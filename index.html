          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense showed signs of life by scoring seven runs, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Milwaukee Brewers in an 8-7 loss. Despite a three-RBI day from Shohei Ohtani and back-to-back home runs late in the game, the Dodgers' pitching and defense faltered. This defeat marks their ninth loss in the last eleven games, highlighting a persistent struggle to find a winning formula and capitalize on crucial offensive opportunities. The team continues to search for answers amid a disappointing stretch of the season.</p>

          <p>Intense sectarian clashes between Druze and Bedouin groups in southern Syria have resulted in over 900 deaths, despite a ceasefire announced by the interim president. Reports indicate Druze fighters pushed Bedouin gunmen from Suweida city, but fighting continues elsewhere in the province, with government forces accused of participating in attacks on the Druze. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for an end to "the rape and slaughter of innocent people" and demanded accountability for atrocities. The violence erupted following a merchant's abduction, escalating long-running tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced a significant decrease in the number of individuals reported missing following severe flooding earlier this month. Through extensive follow-up work, the count dropped from a peak of over 160 to just three. This positive development comes as a relief to the community, which has been grappling with the aftermath of the disaster. However, the overall death toll from the floods across Texas stands at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County alone, underscoring the tragedy's severe impact.</p>

          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are disproportionately affecting small, rural radio stations that are vital sources of local news and information. Allegheny Mountain Radio, serving communities in West Virginia and Virginia, relies on Corporation for Public Broadcasting funds for up to 65% of its budget and now faces an existential threat. These stations provide essential services, from local news and emergency alerts to community announcements, in areas with limited internet and phone access. The funding cuts are ironically harming rural communities that heavily supported the president who advocated for them. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the desperate quest for peace in conflicts from Gaza to Ukraine is failing due to a collapse of a shared global moral order. The author observes a rise in atrocities against civilians, which are often justified through moral relativism, making impartial mediation nearly impossible. This ethical fracturing is mirrored by the decline of the international rules-based system, allowing conflicts to persist indefinitely amid growing polarization. The piece suggests that this modern failure to uphold universal ethical standards, defined by international law and shared responsibility, is a primary reason why peace remains so elusive.</p>

Investigators then used DNA from the crime scene to identify a new suspect, George Burch. Google Dashboard data from Burch's phone tracked his movements from a bar to the crime scene and where the victim's body was found, ultimately leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, visited the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank to condemn an arson attack on the ancient Church of Saint George. Residents blame extremist Israeli settlers for the fire, which occurred amid a surge of violence in the territory since the start of the Gaza war. Huckabee, typically a staunch supporter of Israel, called the desecration of a place of worship an "act of terror" and insisted that the perpetrators must be prosecuted. The visit highlights growing international concern over settler violence in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has filed a $20 billion libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit stems from a report alleging Trump signed a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which Trump has denied as "FAKE." The lawsuit claims the report was false and defamatory, while the publisher expressed full confidence in its reporting and vowed to defend against the suit. This legal action comes as Trump faces pressure to disclose more about his past association with Epstein.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Warn of Rising Nicotine Pouch Use Among Teens</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:06:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as white snus, is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, with some using products containing dangerously high levels of nicotine. These pouches are sold without age restrictions, allowing teens to easily purchase them, leading to addiction and significant gum damage. Health professionals and Trading Standards officers are expressing alarm over the trend, noting that current laws are insufficient to regulate sales to minors or the strength of the products. A new bill aims to address this by making it illegal to sell them to under 18s.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initiative touted by the UK government to install "Great British Energy solar panels" on schools has sourced its initial products from Chinese firms. The first eleven schools in the program received panels from Aiko and Longi, two Chinese companies. This has drawn criticism from some MPs due to concerns over alleged forced labor in China's solar panel supply chains, particularly in the Xinjiang region. While the companies deny using forced labor, the situation raises questions about the government's commitment to ethical sourcing and supporting British industry through its green energy projects.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of drivers are parking in lay-bys and side streets near UK airports like Edinburgh to avoid escalating "kiss-and-fly" charges. Research shows that over half of the country's busiest airports have increased these fees, with some charging as much as £6 for a brief 10-minute stop. This has led to a cat-and-mouse game where drivers wait nearby for passengers to call before quickly picking them up to evade the charges. The practice highlights public frustration with what many see as extortionate fees for a simple and necessary service.</p>

          <p>Russia is conducting a systematic campaign in occupied Ukrainian territories to erase Ukrainian identity and instill pro-Russian ideology in children from a very young age. This involves a Russian curriculum, military-patriotic youth groups like Yunarmia, and "bravery lessons" from soldiers who depict Ukraine as a neo-Nazi state. Thousands of children have also been taken on tours of Russia or forcibly deported to "re-education camps," actions that are banned under international humanitarian law. These efforts represent a deliberate strategy to brainwash a generation of young Ukrainians against their own country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The surging global demand for lithium, essential for electric car batteries and other green technologies, is creating an environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama Desert. The extraction process, which involves pumping vast quantities of brine, is depleting water resources in the arid region, harming local ecosystems and the livelihoods of indigenous communities. Residents report shrinking lagoons, dying native trees, and a decline in flamingo populations. This situation highlights a critical paradox where the race to solve the climate crisis is inadvertently causing significant, localized environmental damage and social disruption.</p>

          <p>The UK chancellor has expressed a desire to encourage savers to move money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares, arguing the benefits of investing are often overshadowed by risk warnings. The government is considering new ad campaigns and targeted messages to promote investment, and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize the shift. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and warn that a poorly managed push could backfire, potentially deterring a new generation of investors. (not investment advice)</p>
