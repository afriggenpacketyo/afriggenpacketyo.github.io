          <p>An Adobe Analytics report projects that U.S. online holiday spending will increase by 5.3% to $253.4 billion, a noticeable slowdown from the 8.7% growth seen in the previous year and below the 10-year average. This moderated growth reflects broader economic concerns, with consumers, particularly Gen Z, planning to spend less and actively seeking discounts. Despite the slowdown, mobile shopping is expected to account for over half of all online sales, and the use of AI-powered chatbots for gift research is anticipated to rise significantly.

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett estimated it will cost the nation's GDP approximately $15 billion per week. Amid the stalemate, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has challenged Speaker Mike Johnson to a live televised debate to discuss the impasse, which centers on disagreements over appropriations and healthcare provisions. With Congress deadlocked, both Republican and Democratic leaders continue to blame each other for the shutdown, while crucial votes on stopgap funding measures are anticipated.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, upholding her conviction for sex trafficking in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of underage girls. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in the crimes. The court's decision, made without comment, effectively exhausts one of her final legal avenues for an early release. This development occurs as the Trump administration faces scrutiny for not releasing investigative files related to the Epstein case, despite previous commitments to do so.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department is considering the issuance of a $1 commemorative coin with President Trump's image to mark the 250th anniversary of American independence. A preliminary design shared by a Treasury official features Trump's profile on the heads side and a depiction of him with a raised fist on the tails side. While federal law typically prohibits featuring a living president on currency, there may be more flexibility for commemorative coins produced by the U.S. Mint. A Treasury spokesperson confirmed the design is a draft and not yet final.</p>

          <p>Gold and Bitcoin have both reached record highs, with gold surpassing $3,900 per troy ounce and Bitcoin breaking the $125,000 barrier. The surge in these assets is attributed to several factors, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which has weakened the dollar, and broader geopolitical instability from conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Investors are increasingly treating both as safe-haven assets, with rising demand for gold-backed ETFs and growing institutional investment in Bitcoin, which is also benefiting from the Trump administration's supportive stance on cryptocurrencies.

As part of the agreement, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares, contingent on deployment milestones.

          <p>As of early October, average mortgage rates remain relatively high, with a 30-year fixed mortgage averaging 6.34% and a 15-year loan at 5.64%, according to Bankrate's national data. Refinance rates are slightly higher, creating a challenging environment for both homebuyers and those looking to refinance. However, there is potential for relief, as experts anticipate that mortgage rates may stabilize or decline if the Federal Reserve pauses its interest rate hikes. To secure the best possible rates, prospective borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit scores and compare offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that President Trump may resort to "sharp measures" if the ongoing government shutdown is not resolved by the Senate's next votes on funding bills. The administration has indicated that this shutdown could lead to permanent layoffs for thousands of federal workers, a departure from the furloughs seen in past funding gaps. Hassett placed blame on Democrats for any potential job losses. The warning escalates the political pressure as both parties remain deadlocked over competing proposals to reopen the government.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actor Cheryl Hines revealed she had profound fears for her husband Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s safety during his 2024 presidential campaign, worrying daily about potential assassination attempts. She cited the family's tragic history, with both his father and uncle having been assassinated, as a source of constant anxiety, which was heightened by his lack of Secret Service protection. Hines, whose husband now serves as Secretary of Health and Human Services, believes he may not even share the full extent of the threats he receives with her. Kennedy ultimately suspended his independent campaign and endorsed President Trump.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has announced successful long-range strikes on two key Russian strategic targets: a major explosives factory and an oil terminal in occupied Crimea. The attack on the Y. M.

Another strike caused a fire at an oil depot in Feodosia, which is used to fuel Moscow's war efforts.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is confronting a severe political crisis following the collapse of his third government in just twelve months, intensifying the political deadlock that has gripped the nation. After calling a snap election last summer that resulted in a hung parliament, Macron has been unable to form a stable majority, leaving his minority governments vulnerable to no-confidence votes. With public debt high and key reforms stalled, Macron's options are dwindling as he runs out of time before the 2027 presidential election, where he is constitutionally barred from running again.</p>

          <p>A recent poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov indicates that talk show host Jimmy Kimmel has a higher favorability rating than President Donald Trump. The survey, conducted after Kimmel's temporary suspension from ABC, found he had a net favorability of +3, while Trump registered a net favorability of -13. The controversy began when the FCC, led by a Trump appointee, threatened ABC's broadcast licenses over Kimmel's criticism of the administration, leading to his brief removal from the air. Public backlash and boycott calls contributed to his reinstatement shortly thereafter.</p>

Opponents, including the parliamentary minority, argue the deal is unconstitutional for lacking parliamentary ratification and poses a national security threat. The government defends its decision on humanitarian and pan-African grounds, stating it is not an endorsement of U.S. immigration policies. However, the move has been described as problematic and inconsistent, especially after some of the first deportees were reportedly left in neighboring Togo, raising further legal and diplomatic questions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed to have secured $17 trillion in new investment commitments for the U.S. economy, a figure central to his economic platform. However, analysis suggests this number is likely exaggerated and speculative, with the White House's own website listing a total of only $8.8 trillion, some of which includes commitments made during the previous administration. While economists acknowledge a meaningful increase in investment pledges under Trump, they estimate the actual figure is in the hundreds of billions, not trillions, raising questions about the effectiveness of his tariff-driven economic strategy.

          <p>In her new book, "Into the Weeds," acclaimed author Lydia Davis explores the symbiotic relationship between reading and writing, framing it not as a one-way street but as a continuous conversation. Adapted from a lecture, the work functions less as a traditional writing manual and more as a guide to rediscovering literature through personal and sometimes serendipitous connections. Davis shares her own reading journey, moving between diverse authors and reflecting on how books find us through recommendations and unexpected discoveries. The article suggests this approach is vital in an era of shrinking literary criticism and algorithm-driven suggestions.</p>

The drama follows a modern-day Chicago teen who finds himself transported back to 1864, exploring themes of history, identity, and the search for freedom.
