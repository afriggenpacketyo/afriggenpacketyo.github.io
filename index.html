            <p>A man has been convicted of murdering Cher Maximen at the 2024 Notting Hill Carnival after stabbing her in front of her daughter. Shakeil Thibou, 20, was found guilty of stabbing Maximen, 32, during a fight. The victim died six days later in the hospital due to the severity of her injuries. Thibou's brothers were also convicted of assaulting an emergency worker and violent disorder, and sentencing for all three is scheduled for May. The Crown Prosecution Service hopes the verdict brings a sense of justice to the community.</p>

            <p>House Republicans are proceeding with a vote on a GOP budget blueprint, despite facing opposition from within their own party. Speaker Mike Johnson is working to secure enough votes to pass the legislation, which is backed by President Trump. Hard-liners in the House Freedom Caucus are likely to vote against the bill, citing concerns about deficit reduction. The vote will be a key test for Republicans, and its success would represent a significant win for Trump, who urged passage of the bill on social media.</p>

            <p>Refinancing student loans can be a strategic move for borrowers seeking better financial terms, especially those with high interest rates or multiple loans. Several companies offer refinancing options, catering to different credit profiles and needs, including Earnest for low rates, PenFed for parents, Laurel Road for those with good credit, and SoFi for flexible repayment options. Borrowers with federal student loans should exercise caution before refinancing, as it converts them to private loans, forfeiting valuable government protections. It's crucial to compare lenders carefully and consider individual financial circumstances before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

The DHS states that there is no room in the United States for terrorist sympathizers, and the move is consistent with President Trump's executive orders on combating antisemitism.

            <p>An Atlantic article criticizes President Trump's trade policies, arguing that they are harming the U.S. economy rather than fixing it. The author contends that Trump's tariffs are disrupting supply chains, increasing uncertainty in financial markets, and hurting U.S. manufacturers. The article suggests that the policies are based on flawed logic and are being implemented in a chaotic manner. It concludes that Trump's approach threatens to destroy the very thing he intends to save: American manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Global bond markets are experiencing volatility due to President Trump's tariffs, causing investors to seek safe havens, including German debt. U.S. Treasurys are selling off, while German bunds are rising in value as investors await clarity. Concerns about a move away from the U.S. dollar and the volatile geopolitical climate are contributing to the shift. European bonds with shorter maturity terms are also rising in value as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>While consumers and businesses should anticipate rising prices due to President Trump's tariffs, companies citing these tariffs for immediate price hikes may be taking advantage of the situation. U.S. Customs guidance includes an "on the water clause," meaning cargo arriving in the coming weeks is not subject to the new tariffs. Major corporations are preparing investors and consumers for eventual cost and price impacts. The Federal Reserve Chair has acknowledged that the tariffs will lead to higher inflation and slower growth.</p>

Trump claims money is "pouring in" from the tariffs and that countries are eager to negotiate, but China has vowed to "fight to the end" if the US continues its tariff war.</p>

            <p>A High Court judge has ruled that former footballer Joey Barton's online posts about former England striker Eni Aluko had a defamatory meaning. Aluko said she faced threats of violence and abuse on social media after Barton posted twice on X in January 2024. The judge ruled Barton's claims about Aluko's father being financially corrupt, her private education making her a "hypocrite," and her accusation of "using the race card" were mainly statements of opinion and were defamatory.</p>
