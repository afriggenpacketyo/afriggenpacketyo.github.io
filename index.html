          <p>The Trump administration dropped a lawsuit against National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts, abandoning a potential $2.25 million settlement for borrowers.  The CFPB had accused the Trusts of improper debt collection practices, including suing for unproven debts and collecting after legally permissible deadlines.  This dismissal follows other actions by the Trump administration to weaken the CFPB, raising concerns about consumer protection.
