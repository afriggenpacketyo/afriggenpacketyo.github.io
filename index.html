          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $80,000, as cryptocurrencies mirrored a broader market downturn fueled by recession anxieties linked to new tariffs. The cryptocurrency saw a sharp decline over the weekend, triggering substantial liquidations as investors offloaded holdings amidst global economic uncertainty. While some analysts suggest Bitcoin may find support around the $74,000 level, its performance is expected to remain closely tied to equity markets, influenced by ongoing recession fears overshadowing potential regulatory benefits. Over the long term, some analysts suggest that Bitcoin could benefit from deglobalization and rising geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink revealed that many CEOs believe the U.S. is already in a recession, citing the airline industry as an early indicator of economic distress. Fink also voiced concerns that President Trump's tariff policies could exacerbate inflation, limiting the Federal Reserve's ability to implement interest rate cuts typically used to combat recessions. Fink anticipates a more challenging economic environment, suggesting that expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts this year are unlikely to materialize due to the potential for elevated inflation.

The show features unconventional segments, like a panel of actors who have played Willy Loman, and focuses on topics of interest to Mulaney. By blending traditional talk-show elements with absurd antics, Mulaney aims to create a unique and unpredictable viewing experience. Mulaney's approach harkens back to earlier, more conversational talk shows while injecting a modern sensibility.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to block a lower court order mandating the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The administration argues that the order infringes on the President's authority over foreign diplomacy, especially concerning the extradition of suspected gang members. Garcia, who had been granted protection from deportation in 2019, was sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, despite the Justice Department acknowledging the deportation as an "administrative error". The case raises questions about due process and the limits of executive power in immigration matters.</p>

          <p>Wall Street leaders are voicing concerns about the potential economic consequences of President Trump's tariffs, warning of rising prices, slower growth, and damage to America's global standing. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the tariffs could harm long-term economic alliances. Goldman Sachs raised its prediction for a recession, citing tighter financial conditions and policy uncertainty. Even some of Trump's supporters, like hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, are criticizing the tariffs as an "economic nuclear war."</p>

          <h2>Republicans Accused of Misleading Accounting to Pass Tax Cuts</h2>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are being accused of using misleading accounting tactics to pass a massive tax cut, which would add trillions to the public debt. By switching to a "current policy baseline," Republicans can claim the extended tax cuts are "free," despite the real cost of $4 trillion over 10 years. Critics argue this maneuver is designed to posture as deficit hawks while increasing the national debt. The timing is criticized due to the already spiraling national debt and rising interest payments.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing criticism for praising a doctor known for discussing the dangers of vaccines, hours after attending the funeral of an 8-year-old who died from measles. Kennedy commended the practice of "extraordinary healers" who have treated measles-stricken children using alternative methods. Critics argue that Kennedy's actions undermine the importance of vaccines in preventing the spread of measles. The measles outbreak has affected over 480 people in West Texas.</p>

          <p>Amid massive layoffs at HHS, top officials have been offered reassignments to the Indian Health Service (IHS), which some view as a purge of leadership. The move has been described as disrespectful to public service and an insult to healthcare professionals in the IHS. Some sources suspect the targets were picked as retribution dating back to the pandemic, as several leaders close to Dr. Anthony Fauci received the offer. Critics suggest that the IHS is being used as a pawn to force HHS staff to resign.</p>
