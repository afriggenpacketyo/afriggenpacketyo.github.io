          <p>A Cambridge professor debunks common myths about cooking oils, clarifying that sunflower and vegetable oils are healthy options, low in saturated fats and high in beneficial polyunsaturated fats, contrary to some negative press. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy due to near-zero trans fats. The article explains that extra virgin olive oil is better for dressings due to its low smoke point, while vegetable or sunflower oil is suitable for deep frying.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Housing and Urban Development's website displayed a banner blaming the "Radical Left" for the government shutdown, prompting an ethics group, Public Citizen, to file a complaint alleging a "blatant violation" of the Hatch Act. The act limits political activities of federal employees to ensure nonpartisan administration of programs. White House and HUD spokespersons defended the message, while Public Citizen criticized the Trump administration for neutering ethics enforcement offices.</p>

          <p>Eight months into President Trump's second term, his administration's aggressive legal crackdown on "sanctuary" cities and states has yielded few tangible results. Despite numerous lawsuits and threats of funding cuts, most legal actions remain unresolved, and local Democratic leaders continue to defend policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration officials. Federal courts have blocked attempts to withhold funds, and only Louisville, Kentucky, has abandoned its sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval among Latino voters is slipping, primarily due to economic concerns like high grocery and housing prices, despite his strong performance with this demographic in 2024.
