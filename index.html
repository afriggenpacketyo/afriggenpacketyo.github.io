          <p>Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the Democratic Party for the People, faced backlash after referring to government rice reserves as potential "animal feed," sparking controversy amidst rising rice prices in Japan. Tamaki questioned the value of selling rice intended for animal feed to the public, even at reduced prices, during a parliamentary session. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi criticized Tamaki's statement, emphasizing the government's efforts to make stockpiled rice available at affordable prices. The incident occurred against the backdrop of record-high rice prices and a recent ministerial resignation due to an insensitive comment about rice purchases.</p>

Trump expressed concern that about one-fourth of Harvard's student body is international, a figure he believes should be limited to around 15 percent. He also raised concerns about the backgrounds and potential troublemaking tendencies of foreign students. This stance comes amid broader efforts to crack down on universities and align academia with his views on diversity and inclusion.</p>

However, the judge did not order Khalil's release, citing insufficient response to allegations that Khalil withheld personal details on his residency application.

          <p>Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Gangster Disciples, received a commutation from President Trump, though this will not affect his state prison sentence.

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Criticizes Chip Controls That 'Effectively Closed' China Market</h2>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed his displeasure with U.S. chip controls that have effectively closed the China market to the company. Huang stated that the $50 billion China market is now effectively closed to U.S. industry, resulting in a multibillion-dollar writeoff on unsellable or unrepurposable inventory. Despite the revenue loss, Nvidia reported strong quarterly results, driven by demand outside of China. The Trump administration informed Nvidia that its previously approved H20 processor for China would require an export license.</p>

          <h2>Planning Change Eases Heat Pump Installations for Homes</h2>

          <p>The government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon technology. The change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, means it could be easier for millions of homes in England to install a heat pump. However, consumer groups warn that the biggest barrier remains the high upfront costs, especially for older housing stock requiring upgrades to pipework and insulation. The planning changes also include a relaxation of the rules for the size and number of heat pumps households can install.</p>
