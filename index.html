          <p>Scientists in Singapore have achieved a significant milestone in creating remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, industrializing their production for potential use in disaster search missions. The team enhanced the robotic insect's turning ability to over 80 degrees, verifying this precise control through a series of experiments. This breakthrough, detailed in Nature Communications, is seen as meaningful work on insect-computer hybrid robots, promising to reduce mass production time and cost for practical applications. This development could pave the way for a miniature, deployable army of these bio-hybrid robots, offering unprecedented capabilities for navigating collapsed structures and locating survivors in hazardous environments where human entry is too risky, thereby revolutionizing emergency response.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the immediate removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage documents. This dramatic move follows months of Trump's public criticism against the central bank's interest rate policies and its chair, Jerome Powell, whom he has also threatened to fire. Cook's dismissal is an unprecedented test of the president's power, as Fed board members typically serve 14-year terms and can only be fired "for cause." The allegations, initially leveled by a Trump ally, accuse Cook of fraudulently claiming two homes as primary residences to secure favorable lending terms, raising legal and ethical questions about the Fed's independence.

          <p>Korean Air has announced a substantial $36 billion deal to acquire 103 Boeing jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models, aiming to significantly modernize its fleet ahead of its merger with Asiana Airlines. This major agreement was unveiled shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with President Trump, underscoring Trump's push for increased business with American firms amidst ongoing trade negotiations. Boeing stated the deal would support approximately 135,000 jobs across the U.S., providing a crucial boost to the aviation giant which has faced recent crises and production challenges. This marks a significant economic and strategic partnership between the two nations' industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns unexpectedly traded veteran quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick, altering their roster plans. This move addresses the Raiders' urgent need for a backup quarterback after Aidan O’Connell fractured his wrist, providing them with a player who has 25 NFL starts. Pickett's own training camp was hampered by a hamstring injury, preventing him from competing effectively for a spot with the Browns. The trade leaves the backup position behind starter Joe Flacco wide open for rookies Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders, creating further roster speculation for Cleveland.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued an important safety reminder regarding cordless hair styling tools, mandating that devices powered by lithium-ion batteries or gas fuel are only permitted in carry-on bags. This regulation aims to prevent potential fire hazards in the cargo hold, where overheating or combustion could go unnoticed, posing a significant risk to flight safety. Passengers must also ensure a safety cover is securely fitted over the heating element of these tools. This directive is a response to numerous incidents involving lithium batteries, emphasizing the critical need for adherence to these guidelines for passenger and crew safety.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has characterized illegal immigration as a "scourge" of "historic and unprecedented" proportions, unveiling his party's comprehensive plan to tackle small boat crossings. The proposals include pledging to detain and deport people entering the UK illegally, alongside significant legal reforms such as leaving the European Court of Human Rights and repealing the Human Rights Act. Farage also advocates for disapplying international treaties like the Refugee Convention and banning illegal entrants from claiming asylum. These measures reflect a hardline stance on immigration, aiming to prioritize national interests amidst a surge in Channel crossings.</p>

Lee, in turn, praised Trump as the "only person" capable of ending the decades-old Korean standoff. Despite Trump's claims of reduced missile tests, North Korea has been emboldened by the Ukraine war, accelerating its nuclear program and condemning joint US-South Korea military drills, creating a complex diplomatic landscape.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken challenges conventional wisdom on posture, arguing that rigidly sitting upright can be counterproductive. He outlines three key rules for better back health: prioritizing constant movement by avoiding prolonged static positions, building strength through simple core and back exercises, and adopting a positive mindset that acknowledges stress and emotional factors contribute to pain. The article emphasizes dynamic posture over static stiffness, advocating for regular breaks, targeted strengthening, and a holistic approach to well-being. It highlights that effective back care involves more than just ergonomic setups, encompassing overall lifestyle and mental state.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung successfully navigated his Oval Office meeting with President Trump by employing strategic flattery, praising Trump's negotiation skills and role as a global peacemaker. This approach, which included references to Trump's book and personal interests, aimed to secure a positive interaction and avoid the confrontations often seen with other foreign leaders. Lee's primary goal was to improve relations with North Korea and ensure South Korea's involvement in any future US-North Korea deal-making. Despite security negotiations remaining ongoing and tariffs unchanged, the cordial atmosphere was considered a significant diplomatic success for Lee, helping to "save face" for South Korea.</p>

The 77-year-old drug lord expressed remorse for the harm caused by illegal drugs and admitted to extensively corrupting Mexican police, military, and politicians to facilitate cartel operations. His plea comes after US prosecutors confirmed they would not seek the death penalty. Zambada, arrested last year following an alleged double-cross by 'El Chapo' Guzmán's sons, is expected to receive a more lenient sentence but will likely spend his remaining life in a US federal prison.</p>

These internal rifts are further complicated by national Republicans, including President Trump, who openly advocate for partisan gerrymandering in other states, creating a contradictory stance.

          <p>UK food inflation has surged to 4.2% this month, reaching its highest rate in 18 months, primarily driven by significant increases in the cost of chocolate, butter, and eggs. The British Retail Consortium attributes these price hikes to a combination of high demand, tightening global supply, increased labor costs, and poor cocoa harvests exacerbated by climate change and crop disease. This figure aligns with separate data from the Office for National Statistics, which reported a 4.9% rise in food and non-alcoholic beverage costs in the year to July. Consumers are advised to reassess household budgets as overall inflation also increased to 3.8%. (not investment advice)</p>
