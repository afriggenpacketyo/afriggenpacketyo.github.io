          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has contacted Tesla following social media videos showing its robotaxis operating erratically in Austin, Texas. The videos depict instances of robotaxis driving the wrong way and braking abruptly due to stationary police vehicles. Tesla launched the autonomous trips in Austin on Sunday for invited users, mainly Tesla promoters, using Model Y SUVs equipped with FSD Unsupervised software. While the launch boosted Tesla shares, it fell short of Elon Musk's past promises of full autonomy. The agency is gathering information about the incidents, and it had previously investigated Tesla's FSD-Supervised technology following accidents. Optimism around Tesla's autonomous driving progress may be tempered by safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Florida's Operation Dragon Eye, led by the U.S. Marshals Office and supported by the state Attorney General's Office, rescued dozens of children from child sex trafficking operations. The initiative involved 20 agencies locating 60 critically missing children and arresting suspects linked to trafficking, drugs, and child endangerment. The recovered children, aged 9 to 17, received immediate medical evaluations and psychological support. Officials emphasized the operation's focus on providing follow-up assistance to prevent re-victimization. Florida remains a high-risk state for human trafficking, prompting increased funding and legislative efforts to combat it.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of aerial attacks. This follows a U.S. strike on three nuclear sites in Iran and a subsequent Iranian missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Trump stated that the Iranian attack caused minimal damage and thanked Iran for providing early notice, which allowed for the prevention of casualties. Diplomatic sources indicate that the Iranian counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing for it over the weekend.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries that are not their own, including conflict-ridden regions. This decision pauses a lower court ruling that immigrants deserved a "meaningful opportunity" to challenge their removal to these third-party countries. Justice Sotomayor dissented, accusing the court of "rewarding lawlessness" and disregarding the due process rights of immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the decision as a victory, stating it can now remove illegal aliens to countries willing to accept them.</p>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel stated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. He explained that Iran has too much to lose, exporting 1.7 million barrels a day through the strait. Braziel noted that the market reflects this assessment, as oil prices dropped on Monday. He also cautioned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose issues for exporters, potentially damaging the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier.

Protests could disrupt traffic, and banners criticizing Bezos have appeared around the city. The couple's wedding planners aim to minimize disruption, but the event has already impacted local reservations and sparked debate about wealth and tourism in Venice.</p>

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier stated that the facilities could house up to 5,000 detainees and begin operations next month.

          <p>Rising veterinary costs are causing more pet owners to put down their animals or delay treatment, according to the BBC. Many owners are surrendering pets to rehoming centers or forgoing future pet ownership due to high expenses. Veterinary surgeons and nurses attribute the price increases to corporate acquisitions of practices. Animal welfare charities warn that this trend is a "ticking time bomb" for pet welfare, as more animals are not receiving necessary care. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether a lack of competition in the veterinary sector has contributed to soaring prices.</p>

          <p>Top Democrats in Congress are expressing concern over President Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites without consulting them, while Republicans defend his actions. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Trump of potentially misleading the public and wants briefings on the situation. Speaker Mike Johnson, however, stated that the retaliation was expected and that Trump acted within his authority as commander-in-chief. Some lawmakers are pushing for a war powers resolution to limit Trump's ability to take unilateral action against Iran, highlighting the ongoing debate over war powers between the executive and legislative branches.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to reform prior authorization practices. This agreement aims to streamline the process, reduce delays, and increase transparency. The pledge includes standardizing approvals, delivering faster decisions, and reducing the number of procedures subject to prior authorization. Insurers would also honor existing approvals when patients switch insurers and build a public dashboard to review denials. While officials express optimism, some remain skeptical about insurers' commitment to change, given past failures to uphold similar agreements.</p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on oil and gas supplies and potential price increases. Oil prices initially surged but later declined as experts doubted Iran would close the Strait of Hormuz. The conflict could disrupt the energy market and drive up costs for consumers. Experts believe that a closure of the Strait of Hormuz is unlikely, but they acknowledge that ongoing tensions could still impact energy prices. The situation warrants close monitoring for potential disruptions to global energy supplies (not investment advice).</p>

Pilots learn how food affects alertness and digestion during long flights, with bland meals like turkey sandwiches being preferred. Refueling mid-air, especially at night, presents significant challenges due to fatigue and limited visibility. The B-2's success depends on human performance and the support of planners and maintainers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without consulting Congress has sparked debate over war powers.

Some lawmakers argue that Trump bypassed their constitutional authority, while others defend his actions. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to balance the power between Congress and the president, but it has been largely ignored by presidents of both parties.</p>
