          <p>China has responded to accusations from the Trump administration that it violated the Geneva trade agreement by claiming that the U.S. is undermining the deal through export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, as well as revoking visas for Chinese students. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that these actions seriously undermine the agreement reached in Geneva, and China vowed to take measures to protect its interests. Stephen Olson from the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore noted that Beijing is comfortable taking a firm stance in negotiations, understanding that any deal with the U.S. will only buy short-term peace. The U.S. appears frustrated with China's slow progress on easing rare earths exports, which it views as a conflict with the Geneva agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

The funds will be raised privately and allocated to housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives within the affected community. This initiative aims to acknowledge and rectify the historical injustices suffered by the descendants of the victims and contribute to the revitalization of the Greenwood area.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. The election result is a turnaround from initial exit polls, which had predicted a victory for Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. He supports traditional Catholic and family values, advocates for Polish sovereignty within the EU, and backs continued support for Ukraine, though he opposes its NATO and EU membership during Russia's aggression.</p>

          <p>Mexico held its first judicial elections, becoming the only nation in the world to select judges and magistrates by popular vote. Supporters believe this will overhaul a judicial system plagued by corruption and inefficiency, while critics argue it will politicize the judiciary. Voters were tasked with electing around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates. Turnout appeared to be low, with many voters struggling to choose from largely unknown candidates.</p>
