            <p>Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Easter Sunday, a notable encounter given their differing views on immigration. The meeting occurred after tensions arose between Vance and the Pope over the Trump administration's immigration policies. While Francis has championed the cause of migrants, Vance has defended the administration's approach using theological arguments. The Vatican's statement highlighted "an exchange of opinions" on international conflicts, migrants, and prisoners, underscoring the ongoing dialogue between the administration and the Holy See.

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, drew parallels between the current US-China trade dispute and the protectionist policies of the Great Depression era, specifically the Smoot-Hawley Act.
