            <h2>Australian Government Euthanizes Koalas Due to Habitat Loss and Bushfires</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 15:50:00 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Australian government has controversially shot and likely killed several hundred koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park after a massive bushfire destroyed their habitat and food sources. While the government claims this is to end the koalas' suffering from burns and starvation, animal welfare advocates argue that logging and development have also significantly contributed to habitat loss, forcing koalas into the park. Experts are skeptical of the aerial cull method, suggesting rescue and close health assessments should be prioritized. Climate change and habitat loss are identified as fundamental problems exacerbating the koalas' plight, necessitating a collective effort from governments and the public to conserve native species.</p>

            <p>Internal feuds within the Pentagon have become public as three top aides to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were placed on leave amid an investigation into unauthorized leaks. The aides, Dan Caldwell, Darin Selnick, and Colin Carroll, were reportedly not informed of the specific accusations against them and were not given standard legal advisement. Tensions had risen due to concerns raised about Hegsethâ€™s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, with accusations of a 'deep vendetta' against the suspended aides. The investigation could result in the revocation of security clearances and potential criminal prosecution if the aides are found to have leaked classified information.</p>

            <p>The U.S. government is planning an imminent military deportation flight under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), raising concerns from the ACLU. Attorneys for Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas believe their clients are at imminent risk of deportation to El Salvador under the AEA, a wartime authority used to remove non-citizens with limited due process. The ACLU argues that the notices received by their clients do not provide an opportunity to contest the designation under the AEA. This development follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to resume deportations under the AEA, provided detainees are given due process.</p>

            <p>As Iran and the United States prepare for a second round of nuclear talks in Rome, hopes for de-escalation are tempered by military threats and mixed messages. Despite constructive initial talks, the U.S. insists Iran must eliminate its nuclear enrichment program, while Iran maintains that the principle of enrichment is non-negotiable. Amid diplomatic activity, Saudi Arabia's defense minister visited Tehran, and Iran's foreign minister visited Moscow. Distrust remains high due to past actions by the Trump administration, complicating the path to a deal.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has issued a tentative ruling that it is "unlawful" to continue housing juveniles at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall, months after a state oversight body deemed the facility "unsuitable." The judge instructed the probation department to submit a plan for relocating approximately 270 juveniles to other secure locations. The ruling escalates a legal battle stemming from the state's order to shut down Los Padrinos due to insufficient staffing and reports of misconduct and injuries to youths at the facility.</p>

            <p>OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is reportedly developing its own social network to compete with established platforms like Meta and X. While the project may not materialize, it reflects OpenAI's interest in gathering more data for training its AI models. The move has raised eyebrows, as it seems to contradict OpenAI's original mission-oriented, non-profit goals. Some observers suggest that OpenAI's push into social media stems from a desire to maintain its dominance in the AI space and secure new avenues for growth.</p>

            <p>President Trump has renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asserting that interest rates would be lower if Powell "understood what he was doing." Trump's remarks come amid escalating White House attacks on Powell, with economic adviser Kevin Hassett suggesting the administration is assessing options for removing him. The president's discontent stems from Powell's concerns about Trump's tariff plan potentially driving up inflation. The FOMC's current borrowing rate target remains between 4.25% and 4.5%.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed frustration, stating that the U.S. may "move on" if progress isn't made. The administration's approach contrasts with the hard diplomatic work required for past landmark deals. The potential withdrawal of U.S. mediation could benefit Russia, relieving pressure on the Kremlin and undermining support for Ukraine.</p>

This adjustment follows reports that therapists were being asked to conduct sessions in call center-like environments. Despite the memo, confusion remains regarding whether therapists will be allowed to continue working from home if private office space is unavailable.</p>
