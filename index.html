          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York's mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the Democratic party. Following his win, moderate Democrats and business leaders began strategizing to oppose him in the general election, with some considering backing an independent candidate to challenge his platform. Despite this opposition, Mamdani has received endorsements from prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton and Rep. Jerry Nadler, signaling a complex and divided political landscape. Mamdani's campaign is actively engaging with all factions, including the business community, aiming to build a broad coalition for the November election.</p>

The departure of Rauhin and her three offspring marks a significant moment for the zoo, which has been part of a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994. Hundreds of visitors and staff attended a farewell ceremony for the animals, who are heading to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. While the current breeding project concludes, the zoo director expressed willingness to accept new pandas in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Florida indicates that body fat percentage is a far more accurate predictor of mortality risk than the commonly used Body Mass Index (BMI). Researchers found that individuals with high body fat were 78% more likely to die over a 15-year period compared to those with healthy levels. The study suggests that BMI is an unreliable metric because it cannot distinguish between fat and muscle mass. Experts propose that more accessible methods for measuring body fat, like bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), could become a more effective standard of care.</p>

          <p>In a recent opinion piece, a columnist examines President Trump's public use of an expletive when discussing the long-standing conflict between Israel and Iran. The author argues that while unprecedented for a president in such a forum, the moment came across as authentic and reflected a frustration shared by many people. The article suggests that in an era of scripted political speech, such moments of unguarded language can make politicians seem more human and relatable to the public. However, the author also notes that the profanity does not absolve the president of his own role in the complex geopolitical situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration experienced a momentous week, securing several victories while facing unresolved challenges that could define his presidency. Key wins included a Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions against executive actions and progress on NATO defense spending commitments. However, major trade deals remain unfinished ahead of a July deadline, and the passage of his "one big beautiful bill" combining tax cuts and policy priorities is still uncertain in the Senate. This confluence of high-stakes events at home and abroad has created a pressure-filled environment with significant long-term implications.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Fourth of July celebrations may see more expensive and less available fireworks due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods. The U.S. imports nearly all of its consumer and professional fireworks from China, making the industry highly susceptible to these new import taxes. Importers are facing significant price volatility and potential product shortages, prompting them to advise consumers to shop early. The industry is particularly concerned about the impact on the 2026 celebrations for the nation's 250th birthday, a year they anticipate will be huge for pyrotechnics (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unexpectedly decided to postpone its ruling on a contentious Louisiana congressional redistricting case, scheduling it for re-argument in the next term. The case, Louisiana v. Callais, centers on whether a new map with a second majority-Black district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, a key issue for the Voting Rights Act. This delay leaves the future of Section 2 protections against racial discrimination in elections uncertain, as legal experts watch for a potentially major decision that could either uphold or weaken the landmark 1965 law. The court's decision to re-hear the case is unusual and has puzzled many legal observers.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is increasingly turning to interceptor drones as a crucial and cost-effective strategy to counter the escalating number of Russian drone attacks. With Russia deploying modernized Shahed drones that fly at higher altitudes, traditional mobile air defense has become less effective. In response, Ukraine is ramping up the mass production of specialized, high-speed interceptor drones, which are significantly cheaper than anti-aircraft missiles. This strategic shift aims to protect the country's infrastructure and defense systems more efficiently, with President Zelenskyy highlighting it as a national priority.</p>

The move, part of Labour's new 10-year health strategy, aims to simplify a complex system and focus resources on frontline care by having "more doers and fewer checkers." Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, which represents patients, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers.

This move angered her SPD colleague, Environment Minister Carsten Schneider, who insists Germany is focused on renewables. The tension reflects a broader European debate and uncertainty over how to achieve climate neutrality, with France championing nuclear power while Germany officially pursues a different path.</p>
