The lawsuit, filed in Hong Kong, aims to prevent Joy Timeline from advertising CrushAI on Facebook and Instagram, as the company repeatedly attempted to circumvent Meta's ad review process after initial removals. Meta is also updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove similar ads, while sharing signals with other tech companies to address these apps across platforms. Senator Dick Durbin previously urged Mark Zuckerberg to address Meta's role in allowing ads that violate its standards. </p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has formally declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years. The resolution, supported by 19 of the IAEA's 35-member board, cites Iran's failure to provide full answers regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities, expressing concern over its enriched uranium stockpile. Iran has condemned the resolution as political and announced plans to open a new enrichment facility. The IAEA's recent report criticized Iran's lack of cooperation and noted its capacity to potentially create nine nuclear bombs with its 60% enriched uranium. </p>

Olympic swimmer Danielle Hill, who trained at the center, described the attack as racism in its rawest form, noting the community was left frightened and workers without incomes. The PSNI is facing a crisis due to underfunding and officer shortages, further complicating the response to the unrest. </p>

          <p>A new study suggests that following a low-calorie diet may lead to negative mental health effects, including increased depressive symptoms, even among overweight individuals. The research, which analyzed nearly 29,000 adults, found that those on calorie-restrictive diets experienced a greater severity of depressive symptoms compared to those who did not follow a specific diet. Nutritionists caution against fad diets, emphasizing the importance of nutrient-rich whole foods for both physical and mental well-being. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also help people make long-term changes in their eating and improve their overall health. </p>

The Biden administration has banned Russian uranium imports and unlocked $2.7 billion in federal funding to expand domestic capacity. Experts note that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will still rely on other countries for uranium, as its reserves are limited. </p>

          <p>Two police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021, have filed a civil lawsuit seeking a court order to hang a plaque honoring police heroes, as mandated by a 2022 law. The lawsuit argues that the failure to install the plaque, which has been in storage, violates the Equal Protection clause, especially given former President Trump's downplaying of the attack. The officers contend that while Congress has honored Trump in various ways, it has not recognized the officers who defended the Capitol. The delay has fueled disputes over Trump's pardons of Capitol riot defendants and the lack of Republican commemorations of the event. </p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, attributed to a slide in food prices, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.

The Reserve Bank of India has been relaxing monetary policy, recently cutting its benchmark repo rate to 5.50%.
