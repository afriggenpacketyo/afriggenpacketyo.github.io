          <p>North Korea announced that it successfully conducted the first test-firing of its new 5,000-ton destroyer's weapons system, overseen by leader Kim Jong Un. The tests, which occurred earlier this week, included cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, and electronic jamming guns. Kim Jong Un stated the need to accelerate nuclear armament of the navy to defend the state and maritime sovereignty, instructing officials to realize this goal. The warship, equipped with systems to launch supersonic cruise missiles and strategic ballistic missiles, is expected to be deployed by the navy next year.

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported better-than-expected operating profit and revenue for the first quarter, driven by strong sales of its Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The company's first-quarter operating profit climbed 1.5%, while revenue increased 10% from a year earlier, marginally topping Samsung's forecast. Despite the positive results, Samsung cautioned about macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and a slowdown in global growth.

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber issued an apology following the release of internal reports that revealed antisemitic and anti-Muslim prejudice on campus. The reports, prompted by pro-Palestinian protests, included testimony from students who felt alienated and pressured to conceal their identities. Harvard pledged to review its academic offerings and admissions policies, aiming to ensure applicants can engage constructively with diverse perspectives. The university is facing pressure from the Trump administration to end preferences based on race and implement merit-based policies, leading to a legal battle over federal funding.</p>

          <p>Mexico's Attorney General, Alejandro Gertz, stated that an abandoned ranch in Teuchitlán, Jalisco, was used by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel as a recruitment, training, and operations center. This statement contrasts with claims from groups searching for missing relatives that the ranch was an "extermination camp" due to discarded personal items and burned remains found there. Gertz insisted there is no evidence of human cremations at the site, and that bone fragments found did not show heat levels consistent with cremation. Héctor Flores, a leader of a search group, maintains the belief that the ranch was used as an extermination site.</p>

          <p>Despite US President Donald Trump's emphasis on tariffs as a cornerstone of his economic agenda, official press releases from the White House and Treasury Department barely mentioned them when highlighting key achievements during his first 100 days back in office. Instead, the releases focused on broader economic indicators such as job growth, investment, inflation, and regulatory cuts. While Trump continues to justify his tariffs on China, claiming they curb job theft, he also suggests that China is willing to negotiate a deal. China, however, has repeatedly denied any ongoing trade talks with the US.</p>

Mangione allegedly used a monitored line instead of a designated attorney line, and Agnifilo's phone number was not identified as belonging to counsel.

          <p>President Donald Trump eased the impact of his new 25 percent tariffs on the auto industry, aiming to help manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts used in the United States over the next two years. The relief allows American and foreign automakers producing vehicles in the U.S. to claim some reimbursements. Automakers argued that due to the complexity of their supply chains, it would take time to procure domestically all necessary parts. The U.S. is also reportedly close to a tariff deal with India, and is engaging in trade talks with other major trading partners.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders to "unleash high-impact local police forces" and increase law enforcement pressure on "criminal aliens," promoting close collaboration between local and federal law enforcement. The order on policing calls for federal agencies to improve police training, pay, and crime statistics tracking, while another section calls on the attorney general to pursue legal remedies against state and local officials for "obstruction" of law enforcement. The administration is also targeting "sanctuary" jurisdictions that don't cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, potentially leading to legal action.</p>
