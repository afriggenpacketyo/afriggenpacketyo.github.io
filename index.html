          <p>Ferrari's stock experienced its worst trading day ever after the luxury carmaker updated its 2030 guidance, scaling back its electrification ambitions. The company now targets a 2030 lineup of 40% internal combustion engine cars, 40% hybrid, and 20% fully electric vehicles, a reduction from a previous 40% EV sales goal. Analysts expressed disappointment, citing that the new revenue and EBITDA forecasts fell short of expectations, despite a slight increase in the current year's net revenue forecast. Several global carmakers have recently adjusted EV targets due to market conditions, and Ferrari aims to launch four new cars annually between 2026 and 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, has asserted his party's readiness to form a new government in Wales, promising fresh energy and ideas to replace Welsh Labour, which has governed since 1999. Speaking at their annual conference, he positioned Plaid Cymru as the leading alternative, urging voters to support them to prevent Nigel Farage's Reform UK from gaining ground. The party aims to broaden its appeal beyond its traditional Welsh-speaking strongholds, emphasizing policies like a child poverty payment, while navigating a new voting system and significant competition. Despite being pro-independence, the 2026 election will not center on that issue. The article highlights Plaid's ambition to lead, even if it requires coalition building.</p>

          <p>Prince William launched a National Suicide Prevention Network, backed by a £1 million contribution from his Royal Foundation, aiming to understand root causes and provide support. On World Mental Health Day, the Prince was visibly moved during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, who founded a bereavement charity after her husband died by suicide five days after their infant son's death. Mannings shared the stigma surrounding suicide and her enduring question of 'Why didn't you speak to me?' The network will comprise 20 organizations and be chaired by Professor Ann John, focusing on collaborative efforts to tackle this complex challenge. This initiative underscores the importance of open dialogue and unified support.</p>

Taylor recounted a particularly distressing incident at Budapest Airport following the 2023 Europa League final, where he and his family were targeted by angry Roma fans. He believes football's 'win-at-all-costs' mentality and the spread of 'false narratives' online create a negative environment for officials, impacting their mental health. Despite the challenges, Taylor maintains that officiating in the Premier League is one of the best jobs, but calls for more balanced scrutiny and an acknowledgment that perfection is unattainable. The article highlights the personal toll of public criticism on sports professionals.</p>

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has blacklisted semiconductor research firm TechInsights, prohibiting Chinese entities from sharing data with the Canadian company, citing national security. This action follows TechInsights' report revealing that Huawei's latest AI chips contained components sourced from outside mainland China, consistent with findings from other firms. These findings raise questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls, which restrict advanced technology sales to Chinese customers, including Huawei. Beijing's move is seen as an attempt to control information flow regarding its domestic chip industry, which is striving for self-sufficiency amidst U.S. trade blacklists.

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution. The indictment, presented by a prosecutor appointed by President Donald Trump, alleges James made false statements on a mortgage for a Norfolk, Virginia home, which she purportedly rented out instead of using as a secondary residence. James, a long-time antagonist of Trump, called the charges 'baseless' and a 'weaponization of our justice system' by the president. This development follows Trump's public calls for charges against her and former FBI Director James Comey. The article highlights the political tension surrounding the indictment.</p>

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has threatened to fire air traffic controllers who are calling in sick during the government shutdown, working without pay. Duffy criticized these 'problem children' for contributing to over half of the country's flight delays, while praising the majority who continue to work. He stated that employees who do not come to work will not be paid, reinforcing President Trump's earlier suggestion that some federal workers might not receive retroactive pay. The shutdown, now in its second week, is causing increasing disruptions, with major airports experiencing significant delays and the Smithsonian Institution facing closures. The article highlights the escalating impact of the government impasse on essential services and federal employees. The article is specific to the transportation sector's response to the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Mark Bray, a Rutgers University professor and anti-fascism expert, was initially blocked from boarding a flight to Spain with his family, hours after President Trump hosted a White House roundtable on antifa activists. Bray, who has received death threats and had his home address revealed, was relocating to Europe for safety. His flight reservation 'disappeared' at the gate, though he was later rebooked. The incident follows the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, after which Bray was falsely labeled a 'domestic terrorist professor' by right-wing influencers. Rutgers University stated its commitment to providing a secure environment for its community. The article highlights the escalating political tensions and threats against academics in the US. The article notes Bray's flight was eventually airborne.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills is anticipated to announce her campaign for the U.S. Senate next Tuesday, according to Democratic sources. Mills, a Democrat, aims to challenge long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins in what is expected to be a closely watched race in the upcoming midterm elections. Having served as governor since 2019 and previously as attorney general, Mills gained national attention for confronting President Trump over his administration's policies on transgender athletes. Her entry into the race could provide a rare opportunity for Democrats to flip a GOP-held seat and contest the Senate's Republican majority, despite a challenging national landscape.

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race signals a potential ideological shift for the nation, marking the rise of its first female prime minister-in-waiting. An arch-conservative and nationalist, Takaichi's ascent suggests an end to the centrist pragmatism of previous administrations. Her economic vision combines fiscal expansionism with protectionist elements, aiming for state-led industrial revival and strategic investments in defense and technology to reduce reliance on China. This approach could deepen 'friendshoring' strategies with Southeast Asian economies but may also tie aid and investment more closely to strategic cooperation. The article highlights how her leadership could profoundly impact Japan's domestic and foreign policy, and its regional posture.</p>
