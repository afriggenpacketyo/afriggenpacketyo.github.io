          <p>Russia launched another significant drone attack across Ukraine, targeting Kyiv and other regions, resulting in at least one death and damage to infrastructure. The strikes occurred as U.S. President Donald Trump prepared for a state visit to the U.K., where the ongoing war is a key topic of discussion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues to urge for stronger sanctions and a joint European air defense system to counter the relentless Russian assaults. The incident highlights the tense geopolitical backdrop of the President's diplomatic trip to Europe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 this week, though the size of the reduction remains uncertain. The decision is complicated by conflicting economic data, with a slowing labor market suggesting a need for a cut, while inflation continues to creep higher, partly due to administration tariffs. The central bank faces pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that policy will be guided by data, not politics. This consequential meeting will weigh the dual mandate of controlling inflation against maintaining full employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal vaccine advisory committee, with new members appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is anticipated to vote on delaying the standard hepatitis B vaccine for newborns until age four. For over three decades, the vaccine has been administered at birth, which has virtually eliminated the disease among American children. Pediatricians and public health experts are expressing alarm, warning that this change could reverse significant public health gains and leave infants vulnerable to a serious, incurable liver disease. The move is seen as highly unusual as it bypasses the typical data analysis process for such a significant policy shift.</p>

          <p>Starr County Memorial Hospital in South Texas is facing overwhelming pressure due to a high rate of uninsured patients who often use the emergency room for primary care. A new tax-and-spending law signed by President Trump is expected to exacerbate the issue by reducing the number of insured Americans and cutting funds for providers who care for the uninsured. Local health officials and doctors warn that this could lead to a collapse of the healthcare safety net in vulnerable communities, forcing layoffs and closures. The situation illustrates the direct impact of national policy changes on local health infrastructure.</p>

Markets are largely pricing in a quarter-point interest rate cut, which would impact global borrowing costs and investment sentiment. In the U.K., new data showed the unemployment rate holding steady while wage growth slowed, potentially opening the door for a future Bank of England rate cut.

          <p>The stock price of TransThera Sciences, a Chinese biotech company, has skyrocketed by more than 4,500% since its Hong Kong debut three months ago, raising fears of a speculative bubble in China's healthcare sector. Despite posting zero revenue in its latest interim report, the company's shares continued to rally, becoming the top performer on the Hang Seng Healthcare Index. The dramatic rise highlights strong investor enthusiasm for China's biotech industry but also prompts concerns about inflated valuations in a sector known for high drug development risks. The company acknowledged the unusual movements but stated its business operations remain normal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings data, which would add over £500 a year for new pensioners. The rise is dictated by the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees an annual increase in line with the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. While the increase provides more income for nearly 13 million pensioners, it also raises concerns about more retirees being pushed into paying income tax. The ongoing freeze on the personal tax allowance means the rising state pension is moving closer to the taxable income threshold. (not investment advice)</p>

The team's strategy of relying on quick passes to mitigate poor protection has proven insufficient, leaving Burrow vulnerable to frequent hits. The situation draws worrying parallels to the career of former quarterback Andrew Luck, whose time in the NFL was shortened by similar circumstances.</p>

The piece critiques the tendency across the political spectrum to assign collective guilt for the actions of deranged individuals, citing historical examples involving both liberal and conservative targets.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military has conducted a second strike on a vessel in international waters allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing three people on board. This follows a similar strike two weeks prior and has prompted significant questions from lawmakers and human rights groups about its legality and the overreach of executive authority. The administration justifies the action as necessary to combat drug trafficking, which it frames as a national security threat. Critics, however, warn that these "extrajudicial executions" could set a dangerous precedent and risk escalating into a wider conflict without congressional authorization.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5 in a 10-inning game, a result that allowed the Phillies to clinch their division title on the Dodgers' home field. The loss is a significant setback for the Dodgers' goal of securing the National League's No. 2 seed and a first-round playoff bye. Despite rallying from deficits three times, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled, giving up four runs after a strong start from Emmet Sheehan. The defeat extends the Phillies' lead for the coveted bye spot to 5.5 games with less than two weeks remaining in the regular season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professional women's rugby teams are increasingly using technology and tailored nutrition to manage players' menstrual cycles and optimize performance. Recognizing that periods can affect strength, endurance, and recovery, teams have players track their cycles using apps and daily wellness forms. This data allows medical staff to make informed adjustments to training intensity, nutrition, and recovery protocols based on the four phases of the cycle. This approach treats the menstrual cycle as a "fifth vital sign" of female health, moving away from a one-size-fits-all training model and acknowledging the unique physiological needs of female athletes.</p>

          <p>Lily McGarry, a 24-year-old medical student and triathlete at Cardiff University, is preparing for life as a quadruple amputee after a severe battle with sepsis. What she initially dismissed as "freshers' flu" quickly developed into meningococcal septicaemia, causing her to suffer two cardiac arrests and fall into a coma for three months. Sepsis, a life-threatening condition where the body's response to infection damages its own tissues, led to the loss of all four of her limbs. Despite the devastating outcome, McGarry remains positive and is already contemplating how to return to an active lifestyle, particularly swimming, with the help of modern technology.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a comprehensive justice reform bill that proposes significant changes to the country's legal system. The most prominent reform is the abolition of Scotland's unique "not proven" verdict, reducing the possible outcomes of a criminal trial to guilty or not guilty. To balance this change, the bill also proposes raising the threshold for a guilty verdict to a two-thirds jury majority, up from the current simple majority. Other measures in the bill include the creation of a specialized sexual offences court and establishing a new victims and witnesses commissioner.</p>

          <p>Following the death of British boxer Ricky Hatton at age 46, fans are fondly remembering the deep connection they felt with the "people's champion." Hatton's humble, working-class background and all-action fighting style endeared him to thousands of supporters who traveled from the U.K. to Las Vegas for his major fights between 2007 and 2009. Fans recall the electric atmosphere at his bouts against superstars like Floyd Mayweather, where they turned parts of the Vegas Strip into a "Hatton wonderland." They remember him not just for his boxing prowess but for his down-to-earth personality, which made his journey feel personal to them.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from King's College London reveals that over 13,000 deaths from heroin and other opioids in England and Wales were not included in official government statistics between 2011 and 2022. This undercount, a 50% increase over previously known figures, is blamed on the Office for National Statistics not having access to detailed coroners' reports. Since data on specific drug deaths is crucial for shaping public health policy and funding for addiction services, this error raises concerns that the government's response to the opioid crisis has been based on an incomplete picture of the problem's true scale.</p>

His release is unusual, as Russia rarely includes civilians in such exchanges. Upon his return, he has been contacting the families of other Ukrainians he met in prison, providing the first confirmation for some that their loved ones are still alive.</p>

In a recently published speech, Xi outlined key tasks, including cracking down on excessive and "cutthroat" price competition among domestic firms and improving overall product quality. The directive calls on industry associations to guide companies to compete on quality rather than just price. This push for internal market integration is part of a broader strategy to enhance economic resilience and meet long-term development goals amid a complex international landscape.</p>

The challenge also led to unexpected outcomes, including more time spent on other hobbies like baking and increased interaction with their families in communal living spaces. While the teens still used their devices outside their rooms, the experiment highlighted the impact of bedroom tech on sleep patterns and social dynamics within the home.</p>
