        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a massive stock surge, driven by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and a series of significant U.S. government contracts, particularly with the military. The company recently reported its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, fueling a valuation that far exceeds many larger tech peers, reflecting high growth expectations. This ascent is supported by strong interest from retail investors and is primarily based on its rapidly expanding U.S. government business, which contrasts with slower growth in its international commercial sector.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales expectations at the prestigious Monterey Car Week auctions are notably subdued, with projected totals expected to decline for the third consecutive year. Experts attribute this market cooling to a significant generational shift in collector preferences, as aging Baby Boomers begin to sell their collections of 1950s and 1960s vehicles. Meanwhile, younger millennial and Gen Z collectors are showing a strong preference for more modern supercars from the 1980s and beyond, leading to an oversupply of older classics and downward pressure on prices for top-tier vintage automobiles.</p>

In recognition of her inspiring innovation and social consciousness, her achievement is also being celebrated by Lego, which has created a custom mini-figure in her likeness.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is launching a strategic effort to redraw the state's congressional maps, a direct response to a Republican-backed push in Texas to create more GOP-friendly districts. Newsom's plan may involve a special election asking voters to approve a temporary suspension of California's independent redistricting commission, allowing the Democrat-controlled legislature to draw the new boundaries. This move escalates the national political battle over gerrymandering, positioning California as a key player in the fight for control of the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the next midterm elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's move to assume control of law enforcement in Washington D.C., ostensibly to combat crime, is a hypocritical and illegitimate power grab. The author points out the irony of this action given Trump's role in instigating the January 6th Capitol attack, the most violent day in the city's modern history. The piece contends the intervention is based on a false narrative, as official data shows violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, and frames it as an authoritarian tactic to demonize a politically opposed, diverse urban center.</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Explain Why Federal Intervention in Washington D.C. is Difficult to Replicate Elsewhere</h2>

          <p>This analysis clarifies the unique legal framework that permits a U.S. president to take control of the police force in Washington, D.C., an authority that does not extend to other American cities. Due to the District of Columbia's status as a federal enclave, the president commands its National Guard and can assume control of local police during emergencies under the Home Rule Act. In contrast, state governors control their own National Guard units, and any similar federal intervention in a state would face major constitutional hurdles, including the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic military use.</p>

          <p>This article traces the shifting definition of "genius," from its ancient origins as a term for a person's innate guiding spirit to its modern usage as a label for individuals of extraordinary intellect or talent. It explores how 19th-century thinkers, influenced by figures like Francis Galton, attempted to scientifically explain genius through theories of heredity, which controversially led to the development of eugenics. The piece ultimately reflects on how the concept has always been subjective and culturally biased, concluding that contemporary understanding acknowledges the critical roles of luck, timing, and social environment in fostering exceptional achievement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the critical differences between two primary strategies for handling overwhelming debt: forgiveness and management. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount owed, a path that can offer substantial relief but typically causes severe, long-term damage to one's credit score and may create a tax liability. In contrast, a debt management plan, usually arranged by a credit counseling agency, structures a full repayment of the debt with reduced interest rates, a method that is less detrimental to credit. The optimal choice hinges on an individual's income, debt level, and financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Louis Naidorf, the visionary architect behind the iconic, circular Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, has died at the age of 96. At just 24 years old, Naidorf was tasked with designing the structure, applying concepts from his master's thesis to create the world's first round office building, which opened in 1956. His influential career also included designs for the Beverly Hilton hotel and the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, and he later dedicated himself to education as the dean of Woodbury University’s School of Architecture.</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity AI has publicly offered to acquire Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion, a bold move that amplifies the antitrust pressure on Google's parent company, Alphabet. The offer comes as Google awaits a judicial ruling on potential remedies after being found to have a monopoly in the search market, with the Department of Justice previously suggesting that divesting Chrome could foster competition. Although the bid's seriousness is questioned by analysts, it strategically highlights the potential for a forced breakup and puts a public valuation on one of Google's most critical assets.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly has announced it will increase the list price of its highly popular weight-loss drug, Mounjaro, by as much as 170% for private patients in the United Kingdom. This change could raise the monthly cost for the highest dose from £122 to £330. The company justified the price hike by stating that the initial UK launch price was substantially below the European average and that the adjustment ensures a more consistent global pricing structure. This increase will not affect the discounted price paid by the NHS but will significantly impact the many individuals who purchase the drug privately.</p>

The company projects that increased duties will result in a $160 million hit to its bottom line in the upcoming fiscal year, leading it to issue a more conservative earnings forecast than analysts had expected. This financial pressure comes from broader tariff hikes and the recent suspension of the "de minimis" rule, which had previously allowed many of its products to be imported duty-free.
