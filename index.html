          <p>Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old who was detained by ICE after a traffic stop in Georgia, has been released on bond. The charges against her were dismissed after authorities realized she was mistakenly stopped. Despite her release, she still faces deportation proceedings. The case has drawn support from community members and a Republican lawmaker, highlighting concerns about the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement policies, which target undocumented immigrants regardless of criminal history. The Biden administration had policies which would have prevented this arrest from occurring, but those policies were revoked.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by halting the enrollment of international students and requiring current international students to transfer or lose their legal status. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. This move follows previous grant terminations and a lawsuit filed by Harvard against the administration over federal funding cuts.

          <p>Japan's core inflation has climbed to 3.5% in April, the highest in more than two years, driven by rising rice prices. Headline inflation remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Economists expect core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. As seen during Trump's first administration, an oversupply of food stemming from the U.S. tariffs could lead to lower food prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, drawing criticism for potential pay-for-play. The event, held at Trump's golf club, offered access to the president for those who invested heavily in the $TRUMP coin. Critics, including Republican lawmakers, have raised concerns about the arrangement, with Senator Elizabeth Warren calling it 'corruption in plain sight.' While some investors saw it as an opportunity to influence policy, others have lost money on the volatile coin. Trump's involvement in crypto ventures has also raised questions about potential conflicts of interest in Congress.</p>

The Prince of Wales hopes the series will showcase the beauty of the natural world and the importance of conservation, similar to Attenborough's documentaries. Guardians focuses on the increasingly dangerous work of rangers who protect endangered animals, with around 1,400 rangers having died in the past decade. The series aims to emphasize the value of these individuals and the need to support their efforts.</p>
