            <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper denounced the vandalism of statues in Parliament Square, including one of women's suffrage campaigner Dame Millicent Fawcett, as "disgraceful." The vandalism occurred during a transgender rights protest against a recent Supreme Court ruling on the definition of 'woman' under the Equality Act. Cooper affirmed the government's commitment to strengthening laws to protect memorials and emphasized the importance of freedom of speech while condemning criminal damage. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the incidents and seeking information from the public, with efforts underway to remove the graffiti.</p>

            <p>Severe storms caused deadly flooding in Moore, Oklahoma, resulting in the deaths of an adult woman and a child who were trapped in a vehicle swept away by floodwaters. Multiple water rescues were conducted in the area, with police describing the event as a "historical weather event." The storms are forecast to continue, posing further flash flooding risks in southern Oklahoma, while other regions of East Texas, the Ozarks, and the mid-Mississippi Valley face threats of destructive winds, large hail, and tornadoes.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, ensuring detainees have the opportunity to argue their case in court. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted prematurely. The ACLU's action followed reports that immigration authorities were preparing to deport the men, accusing them of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, highlighting ongoing legal battles over the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

            <p>Former President Donald Trump expressed optimism that Russia and Ukraine could reach a deal following the end of a temporary Easter ceasefire. Trump stated his belief that such a deal would lead to significant business opportunities for the United States.

The penalty, assessed for cutting a chicane after the start and retaining the lead over Oscar Piastri, was deemed "very harsh" by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Stewards reduced the penalty to five seconds, citing it was the first lap, but emphasized Piastri had earned the corner. Piastri ultimately won the race, showcasing McLaren's strong performance and raising questions about Verstappen's reaction to the penalty.</p>

The Yasukuni Shrine honors wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals, alongside millions of war dead, making it a point of contention with neighboring countries.

The bill passed in an 85-63 vote, with students receiving $10,000 annually for private school, disabled students getting up to $30,000, and home-schooled students receiving $2,000. Republicans supported the bill, calling it a victory for parents, while Democrats criticized it as "welfare for the rich" and expressed concerns about its impact on public schools.

            <p>Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar warned on Sunday that the US is “getting closer and closer to a constitutional crisis”, but the courts, growing Republican disquiet at Trump administration policies, and public protest were holding it off. Klobuchar said the US supreme court should hold Trump administration officials in contempt if they continue to ignore a court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Ábrego García from El Salvador, the Maryland resident the government admitted in court it had deported by mistake. Klobuchar said the court could appoint a special prosecutor, independent of Trump’s Department of Justice, to uphold the rule of law and charge any officials who are responsible for Ábrego García’s deportation, or have refused to facilitate his return.</p>
