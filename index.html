          <h2>Automaker Stellantis Projects $2.7 Billion Net Loss for First Half of Year Amid Tariffs and Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:40:52 EDT</div>

          <p>Automotive group Stellantis has announced it anticipates a net loss of €2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) for the first half of 2025, a significant downturn from the previous year. The company, which owns brands like Jeep and Peugeot, cited several factors including actions to improve profitability, substantial pre-tax charges, and the adverse effects of higher industrial costs and U.S. tariffs. This preliminary financial disclosure comes as the new CEO faces challenges of falling sales and declining profits. The company's shipments also fell, particularly in North America, due to the impact of tariffs on imported vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Richard Wagner's opera "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" remains a subject of debate due to its historical association with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime, which used it for propaganda. The opera, which focuses on German artistic virtues, was Hitler's favorite, and he saw it as a powerful tool for inspiring the masses, personally overseeing its production at Nazi party rallies. Scholars continue to discuss the work's antisemitic undertones, particularly in the caricature of the character Beckmesser, which some directors interpret as a clear parody of antisemitism. A new production at the Bayreuth Festival aims to emphasize the opera's comedic elements amidst this dark historical context.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Overhaul of England's Water Industry Aims to Address Failures and Underinvestment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:27:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has proposed the most significant reforms since its privatization, including the dissolution of the regulator Ofwat. The 88 recommendations aim to tackle systemic issues like sewage spills and leaking infrastructure, which stem from a long period of underinvestment. While consumers face sharply rising bills to fund a necessary £100 billion upgrade over the next five years, the reforms seek to prevent future investment shortfalls. The proposals focus on ensuring long-term resilience and continuous infrastructure improvement, addressing the consequences of prioritizing low bills over necessary system maintenance for the past two decades.

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners known as the "Battle of Orgreave." The incident, one of the most contentious episodes of the year-long miners' strike, occurred at a coking plant in Rotherham and resulted in numerous injuries and 95 arrests. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will examine the events of the day and the subsequent failed prosecutions, which involved allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought this inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the decision to finally investigate the long-unanswered questions surrounding the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, as American companies rushed to secure supplies. This increase follows a preliminary trade agreement where Beijing eased export controls on these critical components, which are vital for technologies like electric vehicles and wind turbines. China dominates an estimated 90% of the global market for these magnets, giving it significant leverage in trade negotiations. The shortages caused by earlier restrictions had disrupted various industries, prompting the U.S. to explore supply chain alternatives, including a new recycling facility partnership between Apple and MP Materials.

Investors are attracted to the lower costs, diversification, and better liquidity of bond ETFs compared to direct debt investment. The fastest-growing segment targets corporate notes, which offer potentially higher returns and exposure to the country's technology firms, as government debt is seen as a less rewarding trade.

          <p>Visitors requiring nonimmigrant visas to enter the United States will soon have to pay a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250. This fee, part of the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is in addition to existing visa application costs. The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying their permitted time. However, details regarding the implementation, collection, and reimbursement process remain unclear, causing concern among travel industry groups as the U.S. prepares to host major international events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

          <p>Richard Tillman, the brother of the late NFL player and U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman, has been arrested on suspicion of intentionally crashing a vehicle into a San Jose post office and setting it on fire.

Authorities allege the 44-year-old reversed a vehicle into the lobby before starting the blaze and spray-painting "Viva La Me" on the exterior. The motive for the attack remains under investigation, raising more questions than answers given the family's respected and tragic public history.</p>

          <p>Fierce price wars are sweeping across key Chinese industries, from electric vehicles to food delivery, as companies slash prices to attract increasingly cautious consumers. This cutthroat competition is squeezing corporate profits and exacerbating the country's deflationary pressures. While consumers may benefit from lower prices, there are growing concerns about hidden costs, such as potential compromises on product quality and safety. China's state media and government have begun to criticize this "race to the bottom," warning that it could ultimately harm consumer interests, wages, and the broader economy by forcing companies to cut essential costs.

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign despite his ruling coalition losing its majority in the upper house of parliament. The defeat for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its partner Komeito reflects voter frustration over rising prices and potential U.S. tariffs. This loss, following a previous loss of majority in the more powerful lower house, will undermine the coalition's influence and legislative power. The election saw a notable rise in support for the right-leaning Sanseito party, which capitalized on anti-immigration sentiment and drew conservative votes away from the long-governing LDP.</p>

His gang is blamed for much of the escalating violence in Ecuador and is linked to the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate.

          <p>A new class of weight loss and diabetes drugs, known as GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy, are showing significant potential for treating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common and often underdiagnosed hormonal disorder, have reported improvements in symptoms such as irregular periods, weight management, and hair loss after using these medications. Researchers believe the drugs help by improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn can lower testosterone levels and regulate hormones. While early studies and anecdotal evidence are promising, larger clinical trials are needed, and access remains a challenge due to high costs.</p>
