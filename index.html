          <h2>Deportation of Chinese Scientist Altered Global Power Balance, Expert Argues</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the 1955 deportation of Qian Xuesen, a Chinese rocket scientist who significantly contributed to American aerospace and weaponry during the Cold War. The author argues that this decision, driven by xenophobia during the McCarthy era, inadvertently propelled China's technological advancement. Qian returned to China and established its missile and space programs, ultimately transforming the nation into a superpower. The author draws a parallel to current US policies targeting foreign students and researchers, cautioning against repeating historical mistakes that could undermine American dominance. The deportation serves as a cautionary tale about the long-term consequences of short-sighted policies fueled by fear and prejudice.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, accusing him of being a "bad person" who "probably hates America." This outburst follows a court ruling against Trump's tariffs, which the former president attributes to judges influenced by Leo and the Federalist Society. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society's judicial recommendations, suggesting Leo's separate ambitions have undermined the organization's advice. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of federal courts, highlighting the lasting impact of his judicial appointments.</p>

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly aiming for a Hong Kong IPO after failing to secure approval from Chinese regulators for its planned London listing. The move comes amid increasing scrutiny over Shein's labor practices and allegations of forced labor, which the company denies. An EU investigation also found Shein in breach of consumer protection laws, citing fake discounts and misleading sustainability claims. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods further complicates Shein's business model, adding to the company's challenges.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding a significant crypto enforcement action. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a shift in regulatory approach, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be seen as an ally to the crypto industry.

          <p>An Argentine court on Thursday declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona. The judges ruled there would be a new trial, without specifying when. The pivot comes after one of the three judges overseeing the trial stepped down over criticism surrounding her participation in a forthcoming documentary series about the case, "Divine Justice," which spanned from the aftermath of Maradona's death, as scandals and suspicions of foul play began to emerge, to the start of the trial. Although the case largely hinges on medical technicalities, the biweekly testimonies have also become tabloid fodder â€” like much in Maradona's life, which included long spates of drug and alcohol abuse. The decision threw into doubt the timeline of the trial, which was initially expected to last until July.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, has cautioned that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in the rivalry between China and the United States. While the likelihood of full-scale financial sanctions remains low, Lian suggests Washington might adopt a strategy of targeting specific Chinese entities and gradually expanding the scope. He also noted that sanctioning China within the SWIFT system would inflict serious damage on the system itself, potentially leading countries to shift to China's alternative, CIPS. The analysis highlights growing concerns about the potential for financial conflict amid rising tensions.</p>
