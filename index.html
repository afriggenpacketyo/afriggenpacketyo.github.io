          <p>Cam Schlittler, a rookie pitcher for the New York Yankees, delivered a historic performance in the Wild Card series, pitching eight scoreless innings with 12 strikeouts and no walks, leading the Yankees to a 4-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox. Schlittler's stellar outing marked the first time in MLB Postseason history that a player has achieved such a feat. The Yankees' offense came alive in the fourth inning, capitalizing on a Red Sox error and stringing together hits to score four runs. With this win, the Yankees advance to face the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALDS, with Game 1 scheduled for Saturday. The atmosphere in the Bronx was electric as Schlittler dominated the Red Sox lineup. The game was a high stakes battle of rookie pitchers, with Schlittler emerging as the clear victor. The energy in the stadium was palpable. The score is a testament to the performance. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 23:45:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a generic version of mifepristone, an abortion pill, manufactured by Evita Solutions. This regulatory decision has faced immediate criticism from anti-abortion groups and Republican politicians. The FDA spokesperson clarified the agency's limited discretion in generic drug approvals, emphasizing that it does not endorse any specific product. The approval comes amid ongoing political pressure on health officials to reevaluate mifepristone's safety, despite its established record. The approval of this generic drug is unlikely to drastically alter access to the medication, given existing state restrictions and ongoing legal challenges. Reproductive rights advocates have praised the FDA's decision as a routine process executed by career scientists, while opponents express concerns about its implications. The political landscape surrounding abortion access continues to be highly contested. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentinian lawmakers have overridden two vetoes issued by President Javier Milei, dealing a blow to his political agenda amid growing public discontent. The Senate voted to reinstate funding for public universities and pediatric healthcare, previously blocked by Milei due to austerity measures. Milei's popularity is declining due to corruption allegations and the impact of welfare cuts on public services. These overrides highlight Milei's struggle to build alliances in Congress and maintain support for his economic reforms. The Argentinian leader is also working to stabilize the peso before a meeting with the U.S. President to discuss financial assistance. The political climate in Argentina remains tense as Milei navigates economic challenges and opposition from lawmakers. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 23:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is debating whether to ban apps that track Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, citing safety concerns for law enforcement. The FBI has linked these apps to violent incidents, including an attack on an ICE facility in Dallas. Apple removed ICEBlock, an app with over a million downloads, from its App Store following pressure from the Trump administration. Civil liberties advocates argue that banning such apps could violate First Amendment rights, comparing them to police radio scanners. The debate highlights the tension between public safety and freedom of speech in the context of immigration enforcement. The legal ramifications of potentially banning the apps are being debated. </p>

          <p>Robert Morris, the founder of Gateway Church in Texas, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl in Oklahoma in the 1980s. He received a 10-year sentence, including six months in jail, probation, and sex offender registration. The charges stemmed from the abuse of Cindy Clemishere, who first publicly accused Morris in 2024, leading to his resignation from Gateway Church. In court, Clemishere recounted the abuse and its lasting impact on her life. The case highlights the consequences of past actions and the courage of survivors who come forward.

          <p>A treasure trove of over 1,000 silver and gold coins, estimated to be worth $1 million, has been discovered off the coast of Florida. The coins are believed to have originated from Spanish colonies and were lost in a 1715 hurricane. The discovery is significant due to the visible dates and mint marks on some of the coins, offering valuable historical insights. The company that found the treasure uses underwater metal detectors and hand fans to search the sea floor. Florida law dictates that such finds belong to the state, but excavators are often granted permission for recovery services. This discovery provides a glimpse into the Golden Age of the Spanish Empire. </p>

The memo assesses that extremists have conducted targeted, pre-planned violent attacks against ICE personnel and facilities in at least three states since June. The attacks represent an evolution in tactics and an escalation in violence compared to past attacks. The bulletin advises state and local law enforcement to remain vigilant.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has written a letter to the judge overseeing his criminal trial, asking for leniency during his sentencing on Friday and blaming his past behavior on drug addiction. In the letter, he apologizes "for all of the hurt and pain that I have caused" and says that he has been reformed after spending 13 months in a Brooklyn jail. He also apologizes to an anonymous woman who testified during the trial under the name "Jane" and says he became "lost in the drugs and the excess". Combs' accusers have also written to the judge, describing how he wielded his power and influence to ruin their lives, and their fears that he would seek revenge if freed. He goes on to ask the judge for mercy, "not only for my sake, but for the sake of my children".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study warns that climate change has significantly worsened the damage caused by Super Typhoon Ragasa. The study estimates that the typhoon was 49% more likely to occur due to climate change compared to pre-industrial times. About 36% of the damage in South China from a Ragasa-type typhoon can be attributed to climate change. Climate change boosted Ragasa's winds by 7% and rainfall by 12% at landfall. The findings highlight the increasing threat of extreme weather events due to climate change. The planet will continue to warm and thus tropical cyclones are expected to become increasingly destructive. </p>

          <p>California officials are warning that ballots mailed on November 4 may not be counted due to U.S. Postal Service processing delays. The change affects voters who live 50 miles or more from six regional mail processing facilities. Ballots must be postmarked on or before election day to be counted. The warning marks a shift in California, where mail-in voting has become popular. State officials are urging voters to drop off ballots earlier. The Postal Service says same-day postmarking has never been guaranteed. </p>

          <p>The head of the Food and Drug Administration praised TrumpRx as a "major step" toward making prescription medications affordable. The plan involves direct-to-consumer government purchasing with drug discounts. Pfizer is the first drug maker to agree to offer steep discounts to all Americans through TrumpRx, aligning with European prices. The FDA Commissioner argues the agreement will help address healthcare costs. Critics remain skeptical about the plan's impact on out-of-pocket costs for most Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report by Global Witness alleges that TikTok's algorithm recommends pornography and highly sexualized content to children's accounts. Researchers created fake child accounts with safety settings activated but still received sexually explicit search suggestions. The suggested search terms led to explicit videos of penetrative sex. TikTok says it is committed to safe and age-appropriate experiences and took immediate action once it knew of the problem. The platform says that it has more than 50 features designed to keep teens safe. </p>

          <p>Supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England will cost the government an extra £3bn a year by 2029 if the system is not reformed, a think tank has warned. The government is already spending £12bn this year on supporting those with Send, a figure that has risen by 66% in the last decade. One in five pupils (1.7 million) in England get some kind of support for special educational needs in school at the moment. The rising costs of Send support have forced local authorities into hundreds of millions of pounds of debt. The IFS is predicting that the proportion of pupils with EHCPs will rise even further in the next four years, to 8% of all pupils aged four to 16.</p>
