          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has suspended all online orders and is issuing refunds to customers after a cyberattack disrupted its systems. The retailer confirmed the cyber incident after customers reported issues with contactless payments, Click & Collect, and gift card usage. M&S is working with cyber experts to restore online shopping functionality, though its physical stores remain open. The company has apologized for the inconvenience and is addressing ongoing problems related to gift card usage and order collection, while some customers have criticized the company's communication regarding the outage.</p>

          <p>World leaders and dignitaries, including US President Donald Trump, Prince William, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, have convened in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis. The event provides an opportunity for informal diplomatic discussions, although formal meetings are limited out of respect for the occasion. The seating arrangement places leaders in alphabetical order, potentially positioning Trump and Zelensky near each other, though tensions remain between them. The funeral mass also presents the possibility of leaders encountering adversaries, given that Vatican City is considered neutral territory, and some sanctioned individuals can attend.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced negotiations in Oman concerning Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, focusing on uranium enrichment. The talks involve Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, with expert teams led by Majid Takht-e Ravanchi and Michael Anton, respectively. These discussions aim to curb Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of U.S. economic sanctions. President Trump has suggested potential military action if a deal isn't reached, while Iranian officials have cautioned about pursuing nuclear weapons. The 2015 nuclear deal, from which the U.S. withdrew in 2018, serves as a backdrop to these negotiations.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, known for accusing Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse and alleging sexual assault by Prince Andrew, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Her family stated that she had been a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, and that the toll of abuse became unbearable. Giuffre was a prominent voice among Epstein's victims, and her allegations led to a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew, which was settled out of court. Her lawyers and representatives remember her as a courageous champion for other victims of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he would not reduce tariffs on China unless the country provides something "substantial" in return, during a press briefing on Air Force One. Trump specified that he desires China to be more open to U.S. businesses and products, allowing them to sell their goods within China. He expressed uncertainty about pursuing this goal, as China may not be willing to open up its market. The president's comments underscore the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China and the conditions required for a potential resolution.</p>

          <p>The funeral of Pope Francis is expected to serve as a venue for informal diplomatic interactions among world leaders, reminiscent of the Queen's funeral in 2022. With numerous heads of state and government in attendance, the event offers a chance for leaders to "brush by" one another and engage in brief conversations. Focus is on potential discussions between Presidents Trump and Zelensky regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine, though formal meetings are unlikely. The arrangement of leaders in St Peter's Square may influence the proximity and potential for interaction between key figures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's ongoing attacks on the media, including attempts to defund publicly funded broadcasters and barring reporters from the Oval Office, are raising concerns about press freedom in the United States. Legal battles have ensued, with some outlets, like Voice of America and the Associated Press, scoring victories in court. Free speech advocates emphasize the need for active defense of First Amendment rights, cautioning that Trump's actions create an environment of confusion and disinformation, threatening democratic stability. These actions are viewed by some as an attempt to control the public narrative and undermine independent reporting.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" and "sex" as biological. The guidance states that transgender women should not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals and schools. The EHRC emphasizes that transgender people should not be left without any facilities to use, and suggests providing mixed-sex or individual lockable facilities where possible. A consultation is planned to seek feedback from stakeholders, with an updated code of practice expected by the end of June.</p>

          <p>A looming mini-heatwave in the UK is expected to benefit nature by boosting the activity of migratory birds and butterflies, but it also raises concerns about wildfire risks. Wildlife charities are urging people to be cautious and avoid accidentally starting fires, particularly in dry heathland areas. Climate change is contributing to more frequent and intense wildfires, which can destroy habitats and harm wildlife. The warm weather is a temporary dividend for nature, but long-term climate impacts continue to pose a threat.</p>
