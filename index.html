        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 concluded its worst quarter since 2022, losing 4.6% amidst growing fears of tariffs and inflation.  President Trump's planned announcement of further tariffs on April 2nd caused market volatility. Consumer confidence plummeted to a 12-year low due to these economic anxieties, impacting spending and potentially slowing the economy. Tesla's stock also suffered significant losses, partially attributed to CEO Elon Musk's political shifts and subsequent protests.</p>
