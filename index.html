          <p>China's government has pledged to tackle the issues of oversupply and excessive competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology met with industry leaders, urging them to improve product quality and manage the phase-out of outdated production capacity. This directive follows President Xi Jinping's call to eliminate "disorderly low-price competition" and reduce excess industrial capacity. The goal is to ensure the healthy and sustainable development of China's dominant solar sector amid global market exploration.</p>

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi warns that the Iranian government is intensifying its repression of citizens, particularly activists, following its recent conflict with Israel. Speaking from Tehran, Mohammadi claims the regime is using the war's aftermath to justify a crackdown, marked by a surge in executions and arrests to instill fear. She describes extremely harsh conditions for political prisoners transferred from Evin Prison after it was struck by Israel. Mohammadi is calling for renewed international focus on Iran's human rights situation, asserting the fight for democracy will continue despite the increased danger.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has announced that Russia is the first country to officially recognize its rule since it took power in 2021. The recognition was confirmed after a meeting between Afghanistan's Foreign Minister and the Russian ambassador in Kabul. Russia's foreign ministry stated it would cooperate with the Taliban on tackling terrorism and drug trafficking, as well as boosting economic ties. This move, which follows Moscow removing the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations, has drawn criticism over prioritizing strategic interests above human rights.</p>

          <p>A drive-by shooting outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago's River North resulted in four deaths and fourteen injuries. The attack occurred as a crowd was leaving an album release party, with assailants in a dark vehicle firing into the group. Police believe the shooting was a targeted attack, as some victims were in the rapper's inner circle. Authorities have shut down the venue and are on high alert for potential retaliatory violence, though no arrests have yet been made. This location was also the site of a fatal shooting in 2022 when it operated under a different name.</p>

          <p>California's Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a state with an early spot in the Democratic presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation about a 2028 presidential bid. His tour will cover eight economically challenged and environmentally vulnerable counties, aiming to show that rural voters are not forgotten by Democrats. While Newsom's advisors deny the trip is about a future presidential run, it follows a pattern of outreach to Southern voters. The visit will take him through several counties that strongly supported former President Trump in the last election.</p>

The legal action contends that only Congress can create or abolish federal agencies through legislation.

          <p>The museum at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena includes a special memorial dedicated to the Manchester United team of 1958. This tribute honors the victims of the Munich air disaster, which occurred on February 6, 1958, when the plane carrying the team crashed after a refueling stop in the city. The accident claimed 23 lives, including eight Manchester United players, as they were returning from a European Cup match. The memorial, which includes a team scarf and the story of the event, stands as a poignant gesture of respect and remembrance from the German club for one of football's greatest tragedies.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on paid administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's current policies. The employees' letter argued that the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment under the Trump administration. In response, the EPA accused the signatories of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and stated it has a zero-tolerance policy for such actions. This move follows a period of significant policy shifts at the EPA, including rollbacks of environmental regulations and cuts to climate science funding.</p>

Fuyao University of Science and Technology, established by glass magnate Cao Dewang, and Eastern Institute of Technology, founded by semiconductor leader Yu Renrong, are part of a philanthropic trend supporting China's goal of scientific self-reliance. Observers predict these institutions will become highly selective, potentially rivaling established public universities.

          <p>Following a mixed verdict where he was convicted on two lesser charges but acquitted of more serious ones like racketeering, Sean "Diddy" Combs's future remains uncertain. While he avoided the worst possible outcome, he still faces potential jail time and a severely tarnished reputation from the trial's sordid revelations about his lifestyle. Some observers believe a comeback is unlikely given the damage, noting his musical influence had already waned as he focused on other businesses. However, others point to his continued support from some fans and suggest he could attempt to reclaim a place in the industry.</p>

          <p>While not its author, the major tax and spending bill passed by House Republicans aligns with the vision of OMB Director Russell Vought, a key figure in Project 2025. The legislation's deep cuts to programs like Medicaid reflect Vought's long-term goal of shrinking the federal government and politicizing or eliminating nonpartisan agencies. According to an analysis by The Atlantic, Vought's project is less about fiscal conservatism, as the bill adds trillions to the deficit, and more about fundamentally reordering the government.

          <p>The economic effects of the Trump administration's widespread tariff hikes remain a subject of debate as a key negotiation deadline approaches. While the stock market has largely recovered from an initial drop, tariff-vulnerable sectors like retail and automotive are still struggling. U.S. imports have remained high, but a slowdown is evident in consumer spending, with retail sales declining for two consecutive months. Economists widely expect that consumers will eventually bear the cost of the tariffs, despite recent inflation data showing only a modest increase in overall prices. (not investment advice)</p>
