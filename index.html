          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is intensifying over open waters and is forecast to become a hurricane this weekend. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for land, the storm is expected to pass near Bermuda early next week. The system is generating large swells that are projected to reach the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward, as well as Atlantic Canada, into early next week. This activity occurs during what has so far been a quieter-than-predicted hurricane season, according to NOAA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While deadly flooding in the Southwest has eased, forecasters warn of a renewed risk for flash floods in Southern California and Arizona due to incoming monsoonal moisture. This threat comes after a recent flood event in Barstow, California, resulted in the death of a two-year-old child. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to strengthen and is expected to become the second hurricane of the season. Although Gabrielle is not projected to make landfall in the U.S., it will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <h2>California Enacts Law Barring On-Duty Law Enforcement from Wearing Identity-Hiding Masks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed the "No Secret Police Act," a first-in-the-nation law that prohibits law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that hide their identities while on duty. The legislation was a direct response to recent immigration enforcement raids where masked federal agents detained individuals. The law, which has exceptions for riot gear and undercover work, is expected to face legal challenges over a state's authority to regulate federal law enforcement operations. Proponents argue it increases transparency and accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal by the Trump administration for trilateral nuclear disarmament talks involving the United States, Russia, and China has been firmly rejected by Beijing. Chinese officials called the suggestion unrealistic, reaffirming their long-standing policy of maintaining a nuclear arsenal at the minimum level required for national security and self-defense. This refusal underscores the significant challenges in extending arms control agreements like the New START treaty. Analysts suggest the impasse raises concerns about the potential for a renewed nuclear arms race among the major powers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order adding a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, which are widely used by technology companies to hire high-skilled foreign workers. The White House stated the policy aims to prevent employers from replacing American workers with lower-paid labor, a critique echoed by some labor economists. The move has been criticized by immigration advocates and has put major tech firms, many of which have been attempting to build better relations with the president, in a difficult position.

          <p>A right-wing, anti-immigration demonstration in the Netherlands descended into violence, with rioters clashing with police just weeks before the country's general election. Protesters blocked a major highway, threw objects at officers, set a police car on fire, and vandalized the office of the centrist D66 political party. Police deployed tear gas and a water cannon to disperse the crowd. Political leaders, including caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, condemned the violence as completely unacceptable and an act of intimidation.</p>

          <p>A court in Islamabad has formally charged a 22-year-old man with the murder of Sana Yousaf, a 17-year-old medical student and popular TikTok creator. Yousaf was shot and killed in her home in June after she reportedly rejected the man's advances and attempts to meet her. The suspect, who pleaded not guilty, had allegedly confessed to police that he broke into her home, killed her, and stole her phone to erase their conversations. The case has fueled public outrage and protests in Pakistan, demanding an end to patriarchal violence against women.</p>

In letters to the Attorney General, officers argue that the facility has open beds and effective rehabilitation programs that could help alleviate the severe overcrowding in county jails, an issue that has led to lawsuits. The state corrections department cited the prison's aging infrastructure and the lower-level security of its population as reasons for the closure, a justification that the officers dispute.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has officially responded to the Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled worker visas, stating it will have "humanitarian consequences" by disrupting families. As Indian nationals receive over 70% of these visas, the impact is expected to be significant. In its statement, the Ministry of External Affairs emphasized the mutual benefits of skilled worker exchange and expressed hope that U.S. authorities would address the disruptions. The policy change adds another layer of tension to ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, a lack of respect is a fundamental red flag in a romantic relationship that can severely damage a person's self-esteem over time. In her book "Love by Design," she explains that disrespect can manifest in subtle ways, like one partner walking far ahead of the other, or in more significant ways, such as devaluing a partner's priorities or identity. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that people enter relationships to be seen and valued, and suggests having a direct conversation with a partner if disrespectful patterns emerge.</p>
