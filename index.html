          <p>A Eurostar train traveling from Brussels to London was evacuated in northern France after a power failure left it stranded for over nine hours. Passengers endured four hours without power, air conditioning, or working toilets before rescue teams provided water and assistance. A replacement train eventually transported them to London, arriving more than 11 hours behind schedule. Eurostar has issued a full apology and offered refunds and compensation vouchers to all affected customers, promising a thorough investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>A recently enacted US tax and spending bill is set to introduce significant changes affecting millions of Americans, particularly through new work requirements for programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The legislation, which staggers its implementation dates, is projected to reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion over the next decade, potentially increasing the number of uninsured people by nearly 12 million. It also alters the Affordable Care Act, raises the standard tax deduction, and modifies the SALT deduction cap, while eliminating certain green energy tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp in Texas, became the site of a deadly disaster when the Guadalupe River flooded, killing at least 59 people, including campers and the camp's director. Survivors described terrifying scenes as the floodwaters, which rose with little warning, destroyed low-lying cabins and swept people away. The incident has left the community in mourning and raised questions about the safety of locating camps so close to the river. Rescue efforts have now shifted to a recovery operation for the remaining missing campers and a counselor.</p>

          <h2>Senior Hamas Officer Reports Group Has Lost Control Over Most of Gaza</h2>

          <p>A senior officer in Hamas's security forces has claimed that the group has lost approximately 80% of its control over the Gaza Strip, with armed clans and criminal gangs filling the power vacuum. In anonymous messages shared with the BBC, the officer described a collapse of the group's command structure due to Israeli strikes that have killed most of its leadership. This internal disintegration has led to a breakdown of security, with looting and violence becoming widespread. The security vacuum is reportedly being exploited by rival armed groups, creating a new layer of instability in the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>During the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced a cooperative effort to apply artificial intelligence to agriculture. The partnership will focus on creating an AI laboratory to support family farming in semi-arid regions, a significant area in both nations. This initiative aims to use AI technologies with common farm machinery to improve environmental monitoring and soil quality. The agreement highlights a specific area of collaboration emerging from the summit, separate from the broader geopolitical discussions.</p>

          <p>Following Elon Musk's announcement of a new "America Party," fellow billionaire Mark Cuban and SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci have shown interest. Cuban responded to Musk's post with enthusiastic emojis and offered to connect him with an organization that helps new parties get on ballots. Scaramucci, a former Trump communications director, also requested a meeting to discuss the venture. Their reactions add a layer of intrigue to Musk's political move, which stems from his public feud with President Trump over a recent tax and spending bill.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has deported a group of eight men, including nationals of six different countries, to South Sudan following a contentious legal battle. The deportation was initially blocked by a district judge who ruled the men deserved due process hearings, but the Supreme Court overturned that decision, allowing the removal to proceed. The men, convicted of various crimes, were sent to South Sudan, a country the State Department warns against traveling to due to instability. The move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to expand deportations to third countries.</p>

          <p>Thailand's government is preparing a new proposal aimed at averting a threatened 36% U.S. tariff on its imports, with a goal of reducing its $46 billion trade surplus by 70% within five years. The offer comes as a July 9 deadline approaches, after which a 90-day pause on higher tariffs is set to expire. Thailand's Finance Minister stated that the country is pushing for a best-case rate of 10% but would find a range up to 20% acceptable.

          <p>Military experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have stated that China's military needs to undergo structural changes to effectively counter modern drone threats. They suggest that the PLA will likely establish specialized counter-drone units capable of rapid responses, addressing the inefficiencies of current structures. The analysis, which comes as drones play a crucial role in conflicts like the war in Ukraine, also proposes upgrading existing electronic warfare units into intelligent counter-UAV forces.
