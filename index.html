          <p>SoftBank Group has announced its agreement to purchase the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a move aimed at strengthening its position in artificial intelligence. The acquisition aligns with founder Masayoshi Son's vision for "Physical AI," which integrates advanced robotics with super-intelligent systems. This deal cancels ABB's previous plans to spin off the robotics business, with ABB stating the sale provides immediate value to its shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority has outlined a compensation scheme for millions affected by car finance mis-selling between 2007 and 2024. The plan suggests average payouts of around £700 per agreement, totaling a potential £8.2 billion from lenders over issues like undisclosed commissions and unfair contracts. While consumer advocates welcome the long-overdue redress, industry representatives argue the scale of compensation is excessive, setting the stage for further debate as the scheme aims to launch next year.

          <p>The prosecution of two men accused of spying for China has been dropped, a decision the UK's Director of Public Prosecutions attributed to the government's failure to provide evidence officially labeling China a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. This requirement emerged from a legal precedent set in a separate espionage case involving Russian agents. The collapse has drawn criticism from politicians and raised questions about the coordination between government intelligence assessments and the needs of legal prosecution under the Official Secrets Act.</p>

Authorities are urging the community to come forward with any information about the "appalling and reckless attack," emphasizing a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers around the world have been enjoying the sight of a supermoon, which appears larger and brighter than a typical full moon. This occurs because the moon is at its perigee, the closest point to Earth in its orbit. Known as the Hunter's Moon, it is the first full moon of October, a name that historically relates to the period of hunting and preparation for winter in the northern hemisphere.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is appealing a federal judge's order that restricts the Los Angeles Police Department from using crowd control weapons, such as 40mm projectile launchers, against journalists and nonviolent protesters. The city argues the injunction is overly broad and could put officers at risk by causing them to hesitate in chaotic situations. Civil rights attorneys for the plaintiffs counter that the LAPD has a history of deliberately targeting people, making the restrictions necessary to prevent further constitutional violations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged over 200% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals like copper and cobalt in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move reverses a Biden-era decision to block the controversial Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal focus on securing domestic supply chains for strategic resources.

Young people have reportedly used powerful catapults with metal ball bearings to inflict serious injuries, with some incidents filmed and shared online. While the weapons are not illegal to own, campaigners argue they should be treated as dangerous weapons, and police forces report thousands of crimes where catapults were mentioned over the past five years.</p>

          <p>A controversial proposal to redraw California's congressional districts before the next census, known as Proposition 50, has become a major point of debate among candidates for the 2026 gubernatorial election. Backed by state Democrats, the plan aims to create more favorable districts for their party to counter Republican-led redistricting in states like Texas. The issue has sparked a fierce debate over partisan gerrymandering, with supporters calling it a necessary defensive measure and opponents decrying it as a corrupt power grab that undermines the state's independent commission.</p>
