          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, across industries like steel and car production, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies receive emission allowances and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding their limits, incentivizing emissions reduction. While designed to lower emissions, the system may lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration negotiates a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. This tension stems from differing views on how to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Netanyahu believes Iran's vulnerability is temporary and favors immediate action, while Trump prefers negotiating an end to Iran's enrichment program, backed by the threat of military force if talks fail. Israeli officials fear Trump may allow Iran to maintain its enrichment facilities in his eagerness to secure a deal. The article underscores the strained dynamics between the U.S. and Israel regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a crash expert testified that data from Read's Lexus SUV places her at the scene of John O'Keefe's death, with the vehicle reaching 74% throttle moments before his final movements. The expert matched vehicle data to O'Keefe's cellphone activity, solidifying the prosecution's timeline. While the black box didn't register a collision, the expert explained that the system doesn't record pedestrian impacts. Surveillance footage was also analyzed to determine vehicle contact with O'Keefe, with an experiment conducted to investigate scratch marks found on O'Keefe's arm. The testimony supports the claim that Read's vehicle struck O'Keefe.</p>

          <p>A British think tank suggests that a People's Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is "unlikely in the near future" but "not impossible," particularly given the potential for miscommunication with the U.S. under a Trump administration. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) highlights strained US-China relations marked by "deep mutual distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms." While tactical improvements occurred under the Biden administration, these are unlikely to significantly alter the strategic direction during Trump's second term.

Circle will sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders will sell 14.4 million shares. This decision likely reflects the need for venture capital firms to gain liquidity after a period of meager returns. The company is profitable and has a substantial cash reserve, but the high volume of insider sales signals a strong desire among early investors to exit and distribute returns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting new student visa appointments as it expands social media screenings for applicants. The State Department instructed embassies to suspend scheduling appointments in preparation for the expanded vetting process, potentially affecting all student visa applicants. This move follows previous actions, including screening for "antisemitic activity" and efforts to deport students based on pro-Palestinian activism. Lawyers argue that these visa revocations violate students' First Amendment rights. The action reflects a broader effort to tighten controls on international students.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty finding employment, contributing to a rise in the national unemployment rate. The unemployment rate among recent graduates is nearing 6%, exceeding the national average. This trend is attributed to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates and a slowdown in hiring in sectors like technology. Economic uncertainty and the potential impact of artificial intelligence on lower-level computer science roles are also contributing factors. The article highlights the challenges faced by recent graduates in a changing job market. (not investment advice)</p>
