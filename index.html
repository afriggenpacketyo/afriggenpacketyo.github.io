          <p>For the fourth consecutive night, unrest occurred in Northern Ireland, with Portadown experiencing crowds throwing masonry at police, though at a lower intensity than previous nights. The disturbances began after a peaceful protest in Ballymena concerning an alleged sexual assault. Police responded with warnings of baton rounds and a heavy presence, while Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA Jonathan Buckley appealed for calm. PSNI Chief Constable Jon Boutcher described the violence as "racist," stating that families hid in fear during the events, and called on those involved to cease their actions. The events have been described as dystopian, with ethnic minorities and law enforcement targeted.</p>

          <p>Following the tragic Air India crash in Ahmedabad, questions arise regarding the implications for Boeing, already grappling with financial losses, safety crises, and quality control issues. While initial assessments suggest no direct fault on Boeing's side, the incident exacerbates existing concerns about the company's safety practices, especially after a door flew off an Alaska Airlines flight in 2024. Boeing faces legal battles related to past crashes and is working to improve its safety culture under new leadership. The company's shares dropped 5% following the crash, adding to its financial woes. Optimism surrounding the company's recovery is tempered by the need to address safety concerns and rebuild trust.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing a critical juncture regarding its nuclear proposal to Iran, with Israel potentially considering military action. Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, the U.S. is not planning to partner with Israel in any military strike against Iran's nuclear sites, but the U.N. nuclear watchdog has stated that Iran is not complying with nuclear non-proliferation obligations. Iran has condemned these findings and announced plans for a new enrichment facility. Trump and Putin have discussed the matter, with Putin suggesting his participation in the discussions. The situation remains tense as the U.S. seeks to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles has inadvertently given California Governor Gavin Newsom a national platform. Newsom delivered a televised address criticizing the deployment and defending California's values. This exposure has likely boosted Newsom's standing within the Democratic Party and revived speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid. Newsom's strong communication skills and telegenic presence have allowed him to effectively counter Trump's narrative and gain valuable attention.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its immigration enforcement efforts, targeting anyone deportable and deploying new strategies to meet White House demands. Raids are occurring in previously off-limits locations, and the administration is appealing to the public for assistance in finding and deporting undocumented individuals. Military troops have been mobilized in Los Angeles without state and local consent, a tactic that could be repeated elsewhere. Critics say the enforcement actions are retribution against California for its immigrant-friendly policies and an attempt to distract from legislative efforts.</p>
