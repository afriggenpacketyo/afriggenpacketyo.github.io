          <p>Former President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for maintaining steady interest rates, citing low inflation and tariff revenue as reasons for a rate cut. The Fed decided to keep rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.5% due to economic uncertainties caused by tariffs, which has frustrated Trump who wants to stimulate the economy. Powell stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and not influenced by political pressure, maintaining the Fed's independence.

          <p>The British government has secured a trade agreement with the United States, easing the impact of recent tariff increases, as announced by President Trump. This agreement aims to protect the British economy, which narrowly avoided a recession and faces challenges from global economic instability, while also bolstering consumer and business confidence. While the deal is expected to benefit sectors like the auto industry, its overall impact on the British economy may be limited, and the Bank of England has cut interest rates amid concerns about lingering price pressures.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling three federal agencies: the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The ruling sided with Democratic-led states that argued the closings violated the separation of powers, affirming that Congress makes laws and appropriates funds, while the Executive implements them. Judge McConnell stated that the states presented compelling evidence of harm already unfolding due to the dismantling of these agencies.

          <p>President Trump briefly announced a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America, causing shares for Netflix and other entertainment companies to fall, before the White House retracted the statement. The proposal aimed to address the issue of fewer movies being made in Los Angeles due to cheaper labor and tax credits overseas. While the industry favors tax credits over tariffs, the situation highlights the ongoing challenges Hollywood faces in maintaining its dominance. This article explores the potential impact of protectionist measures on the film industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a 'comprehensive' trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on numerous trading partners. The agreement aims to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries, with discussions focusing on lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer views the deal as a vindication of his cultivation of Trump, while experts suggest it may be a more limited agreement than traditional trade deals.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed uncertainty about the condition of three of 24 hostages previously believed to be alive in Hamas captivity in Gaza, following conflicting reports.

Families of the hostages have urged Netanyahu to prioritize a deal with Hamas to return the remaining hostages, rather than expanding the offensive in Gaza.

          <p>The United States and Britain are expected to announce a trade deal that will reduce the burden of President Trump's tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal aims to lower or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel, while the U.S. seeks greater access to the British market for agriculture products. The agreement would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters, but it may do little to address Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits.
