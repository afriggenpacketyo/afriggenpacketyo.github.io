          <h2>New York Jets Quarterback Justin Fields Resumes Practice After Injury Scare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:26:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Fields, the New York Jets' new quarterback, returned to the practice field, easing concerns after an injury scare. Fields suffered a dislocated toe during a training camp session, prompting fears of a significant setback reminiscent of Aaron Rodgers' season-ending injury last year. While he participated in limited drills, head coach Aaron Glenn indicated a gradual re-integration process is planned. Glenn also downplayed the initial social media reaction, stating the alarm was unwarranted and that the team would be transparent about player diagnoses moving forward.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film 'Bend It Like Beckham' is officially in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. The 2002 movie, which starred Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha stated that the recent success of England's Lionesses and the ongoing relevance of challenging stereotypes about women in sports make it an opportune time to revisit the characters. She is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and hopes to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>Darren Beattie, a former State Department speechwriter fired during Donald Trump's first term for speaking at a conference attended by white nationalists, has been appointed acting president of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP). The appointment is viewed as a move by the Trump administration to assert control over the independent, congressionally-funded organization, which has been in a legal battle to prevent its dismantlement. Beattie, who has a history of inflammatory statements, will continue his role at the State Department. The appointment has been called illegal by the institute's former counsel, who vows to continue the legal fight.</p>

          <p>Mobile provider EE has conducted overnight maintenance to resolve a technical issue that left many customers unable to make or receive calls for several days. This follows a major outage earlier in the week that impacted both mobile and landline services, including calls to emergency numbers. Despite the company, owned by BT, stating the network is now "running as normal," some customers continue to report persistent service problems. EE has apologized for the inconvenience caused by the disruption and confirmed it is continuing to monitor the network to prevent a recurrence of the fault.</p>

          <p>Tech company Astronomer has hired actress Gwyneth Paltrow as a "very temporary" spokesperson to help manage the fallout from a viral scandal. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after they were caught in an intimate embrace on a stadium KissCam during a Coldplay concert, with Paltrow's ex-husband Chris Martin joking about the moment on stage. In a short video, Paltrow deftly avoided the controversy, instead highlighting a newfound public interest in the company's data workflow automation services. The incident had previously led to widespread online mockery and memes.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has issued heat advisories and extreme heat warnings for millions of people across large areas of the U.S. Southeast and Midwest. A persistent heat dome is trapping hot air, leading to forecast temperatures in the upper 90s with heat indexes potentially reaching 115 degrees Fahrenheit in some regions. Major metropolitan areas like Raleigh, Charlotte, and Atlanta are facing an extreme heat risk for several days with little overnight relief. Officials are urging residents to take precautions, stay hydrated, and limit outdoor activities to prevent heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heat stroke.</p>

          <p>An internal analysis by USAID officials found no evidence of widespread diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, according to a presentation reviewed by ABC News. The report, which examined over 150 incidents between October 2023 and May 2024, appears to contradict repeated claims by the Trump administration used to justify limiting aid through traditional channels. The findings indicate that in most cases of lost aid, the perpetrator could not be identified. The State Department and the Israel Defense Forces have forcefully pushed back against the report's conclusions, citing other evidence of looting by Hamas.</p>

England's captain Ben Stokes, who had earlier scored his first century in over two years to help his team to a total of 669, did not bowl during the day.

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is healthy continues, with experts advising that the right amount depends on the individual. While some research links moderate daily coffee intake to health benefits and longevity, other studies suggest high consumption can increase risks for dementia and cardiovascular issues, especially for those with hypertension. The FDA recommends a general limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four cups of coffee. However, dietitians stress that personal tolerance varies, and people should be mindful of symptoms like anxiety or poor sleep, adjusting their intake accordingly.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men who were expelled from the U.S. and imprisoned in El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison endured "state-sanctioned torture," according to their lawyers. The men were part of a group of 252 Venezuelans sent to the facility, known for its harsh conditions, despite some having no criminal convictions. Following a prisoner swap deal between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments, the men have been repatriated and are sharing their experiences, which include beatings, humiliation, and inhumane living conditions.

According to internal documents, the "Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool" is analyzing 200,000 regulations with the goal of cutting half of them within a year. The initiative, part of President Trump's campaign promise for an aggressive regulatory reduction, has allegedly been used by agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Kotsev, a member of the reformist PP party, was arrested on corruption charges, which his supporters claim are politically motivated by the ruling conservative GERB party. The case has become a symbol of broader anxieties about democratic backsliding and the hijacking of key state institutions for political interests. Protesters argue this is not an isolated incident, pointing to a pattern of actions against opposition figures and a lack of judicial independence.</p>

He identified growing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube as a significant headwind. Rogers also noted that artificial intelligence could be a "double-edged sword," helping Netflix with costs but also empowering amateur creators on YouTube to produce more professional-looking content, further increasing competition for viewer engagement.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that a significant portion of what was once considered "junk" DNA actually plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. The study focused on transposable elements, or "jumping genes," which make up nearly half of the human genome. Researchers found that a specific family of these elements, called MER11, can act like genetic switches, influencing which genes are turned on or off without altering the underlying DNA sequence. This finding challenges previous assumptions and suggests that these ancient viral remnants have evolved to become integral components of our genetic machinery.</p>

The lawmakers argue the book is relevant to congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein case.

          <p>Political analysts suggest that President Donald Trump is struggling to deflect the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case because it strikes at the core of his populist appeal. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" argued that the case centers on powerful people acting in secret, a theme Trump often uses against his opponents. However, his administration's handling of the Epstein files and his past association with the financier now position him as a defender of the powerful elite in the eyes of his base. This contradiction is making it difficult for the White House to shake the spiraling controversy.</p>

These chemicals, which do not break down in the environment, are linked to serious health issues, including cancer and fertility problems.
