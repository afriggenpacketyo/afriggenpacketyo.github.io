          <p>Elon Musk has continued his criticism of President Trump's spending bill through posts on X, urging followers to contact members of Congress to oppose the bill. Musk argues the bill is bankrupting America and that a new bill is needed to avoid increasing the deficit. Speaker Mike Johnson countered Musk's criticisms, stating that Musk was incorrect about the bill's impact on the deficit, but Musk remains steadfast in his opposition. Musk's grievances extend to electric vehicle tax credit cuts, AI deals favoring competitors, and the withdrawal of Jared Isaacman's nomination as NASA administrator, and his frustration with the Trump administration's trade policies has also been evident. The billionaire's public opposition signals a growing rift between him and the Trump administration, potentially influencing public discourse on the bill.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Republican allies are actively working to discredit economists and budget experts who have raised concerns about the financial implications of the Republican tax ambitions. This coordinated effort aims to undermine the credibility of expert analysis that highlights the potential costs and risks associated with the proposed tax cuts. By challenging the validity of these warnings, Republicans seek to pave the way for the implementation of their tax agenda despite expert reservations. This strategy reflects a broader trend of questioning established expertise when it conflicts with political objectives. </p>

          <p>House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is expanding an investigation into former President Joe Biden's physical and mental state while in office, seeking testimony from key advisors. Comer has sent letters to five of Biden's closest aides, requesting they answer questions about Biden's "mental and physical faculties" during his presidency. The committee is already in talks with four other former White House aides to provide testimony as well. This inquiry follows revelations about Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis and claims in a new book about a "precipitous decline" in his health. The investigation aims to determine if White House staff concealed Biden's condition, potentially requiring a legislative response. </p>

          <p>Senator Ron Johnson has denounced President Trump's budget bill as "immoral" and "grotesque," vowing to vote against it unless significant changes are made. Johnson is concerned about the bill's potential to increase the national debt, echoing similar sentiments from other fiscal conservatives. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Johnson has suggested splitting the bill into two parts, but Trump insists on a single package, and Johnson's opposition could jeopardize the bill's passage in the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrow majority.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer has renamed President Trump's budget bill the "We Are All Going to Die Act," criticizing its proposed cuts to Medicaid. He argues that Republican senators supporting the bill are jeopardizing their political futures due to the potential negative impact on Americans' healthcare coverage. Schumer cites a remark by Senator Joni Ernst to highlight the perceived callousness of the bill's supporters. He also claims the Congressional Budget Office estimates that millions could lose health insurance if the bill passes, with Medicare also facing cuts, and he alleges Trump is misrepresenting the bill's true impact, and Schumer is ready to fight this bill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released an analysis estimating the economic effects of President Trump's tariffs, finding that they would shrink the U.S. economy and increase inflation. However, the CBO also projects that the tariffs would reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion due to increased revenue. The analysis includes a 30% tariff on China and a 10% reciprocal tariff rate on most of America's trading partners. The CBO estimates that the tariffs would reduce GDP growth by 0.06% each year, resulting in a 0.6% lower real GDP in a decade. The analysis indicates that tariffs will increase inflation by an average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026, reducing the purchasing power of households and businesses.

          <p>Eight Mile Style, Eminem's publishing company, is suing Meta for alleged copyright infringement, accusing the tech giant of storing, reproducing, and distributing Eminem's music without proper licensing. The lawsuit, filed in Michigan, seeks at least $109 million in damages and a court order to halt the alleged infringement. Meta claims to have licenses with thousands of partners globally and has been negotiating with Eight Mile Style in good faith. Eight Mile Style owns 243 compositions recorded by Eminem, and alleges that Meta knowingly stored and reproduced these songs in its music libraries, and users have added Eminem's music in millions of videos that have been viewed billions of times.</p>

          <p>Dave's Hot Chicken, which began as a chicken finger stand in an LA parking lot with just $900, has been acquired in a deal worth close to $1 billion. The company was founded in 2017 by Arman Oganesyan and his friends, who initially pooled their savings to start the business. The trio developed a Nashville hot chicken recipe and set up shop in a parking lot, and after gaining attention from a food critic, business boomed. Now, Dave's Hot Chicken is a franchise business with over 300 locations, and this successful venture exemplifies the potential for small-scale ideas to achieve substantial growth. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to move Greenland from U.S. European Command to U.S. Northern Command, signaling a shift in how the U.S. views the island. This move suggests Greenland is seen as more critical to the defense of the U.S. than of Europe, and top Trump officials have reportedly urged Greenland to break from Denmark and align with the U.S. security umbrella. Trump has also expressed interest in acquiring Greenland due to its strategic location and rare earth minerals, but most Greenlanders do not want to join the U.S.</p>

Experts say the levies will raise manufacturing costs on a wide range of products, making many items more expensive to buy.
