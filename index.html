          <p>A significant fire occurred at a Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, California, one of the largest on the U.S. West Coast. The blaze, which followed reports of an explosion, prompted an active response from Chevron's fire department and emergency services. The company confirmed that all personnel and contractors were accounted for and that no injuries resulted from the incident. As of Friday, no evacuation orders were issued for nearby residents, and facility monitoring systems detected no dangerous exceedances in the surrounding area.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its third day, with the Senate scheduled to reconvene and vote on competing stopgap funding bills from both parties. The shutdown began after Democrats blocked a Republican-backed bill, citing demands related to health care provisions. Amid the political stalemate, President Trump posted AI-generated videos targeting his political opponents. The article also notes a separate development where HHS Secretary Robert F.

          <p>In a move critics decry as politically motivated, the Trump administration's Energy Department has canceled nearly $8 billion in funding for over 300 green energy projects, primarily in states won by the Democratic nominee in 2024. The cancellations, announced on the first day of the government shutdown, are expected to halt efforts to reduce carbon emissions and could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. Officials from affected states like Washington and Colorado have condemned the action as an illegal punishment, while the Energy Department defended the cuts, stating the projects were not economically viable.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stated that while the artificial intelligence sector is currently experiencing an "industrial bubble," the underlying technology is real and will ultimately provide enormous benefits to society. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, he compared the current hype to past bubbles like the dot-com era, noting that both good and bad ideas are receiving funding. However, Bezos argued that such industrial bubbles can be beneficial, as the innovations from the eventual winners lead to significant societal progress, much like the biotech boom of the 1990s produced life-saving drugs.

          <p>England's head coach, Thomas Tuchel, has omitted Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham from the latest national squad, signaling a new era where player reputation does not guarantee selection. Despite Bellingham's desire to be included after recovering from shoulder surgery, Tuchel prioritized players who have been performing consistently, particularly after a strong win against Serbia. This decision underscores Tuchel's philosophy that the team's success should not depend on a single player and that all squad members must earn their place based on current form. The manager aims to build a resilient team dynamic ahead of the next World Cup.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has halted $2.1 billion in federal funding for major transit projects in Chicago, a move presented as a measure against improper diversity initiatives. The Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced the freeze, stating it was to ensure funds are not allocated through "race-based contracting." This action, which affects projects like the Red Line subway extension, follows a similar freeze of $18 billion for New York transit projects and is seen by critics as a political tactic to pressure Democrats during the ongoing federal government shutdown.</p>

          <p>According to new findings from the Office for National Statistics, mothers in England experience a substantial and long-term drop in earnings after having children. The data shows that five years after their first child, a mother's monthly earnings are, on average, £1,051 lower than before childbirth. This "motherhood penalty" is attributed to factors like unaffordable childcare, an unbalanced parental leave system, and maternity discrimination. Advocacy groups have called the findings "abhorrent," highlighting how the financial impact persists and widens the gender pay gap, despite government efforts to introduce support like funded childcare.</p>

This article provides an overview of today's CD rates, noting that while national averages are modest, top online banks offer significantly higher yields. For instance, some 6-month and 1-year CDs feature APYs above 4.25%, exceeding the rates for longer 3-year and 5-year terms due to an inverted yield curve. To secure the best rates, savers are advised to explore online banks and consider laddering short-term CDs to maximize returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed a free-floating rogue planet outside our solar system consuming surrounding gas and dust at an astonishing rate, described as a massive "growth spurt." The planet, named Cha 1107-7626, is accreting material at a rate of six billion tonnes per second, the strongest ever recorded for a planetary-mass object. This discovery, made using the European Southern Observatory, challenges previous understandings of planetary behavior and blurs the line between planets and stars. The findings suggest that magnetic activity, previously thought to be exclusive to stars, may play a role in the formation of some rogue planets.</p>

          <p>According to new data from the Federal Reserve, the collective wealth of the top 1% of Americans reached a new record of $52 trillion in the second quarter. The gains were largely driven by a strong stock market, which disproportionately benefits the wealthiest individuals, as the top 10% own over 87% of corporate equities. While all wealth groups saw gains, growth was fastest at the top, with the top 0.1% seeing their wealth nearly double since the pandemic. This growing concentration of wealth has led to a bifurcated consumer economy, increasingly dependent on the spending of a small, affluent segment of the population. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the deep-rooted cumbia culture in Monterrey, Mexico, where the Colombian music genre has been kept alive by "sonideros," or street DJs. Originating in migrant neighborhoods, this subculture gave birth to unique styles like "cumbia rebajada," a slowed-down version of the music. For decades, cumbia was associated with gang life in low-income areas, but it has since evolved into a cherished cultural identity. After a period of intense cartel violence forced the scene indoors, cumbia has returned to the streets, with dance groups working to reclaim and celebrate their heritage.</p>

          <p>The recent execution of a man in Taiwan, the first in five years, has reignited the debate over the island's retention of the death penalty. While Taiwan is often praised for its democratic progress, its use of capital punishment stands in stark contrast to many of its other policies and has drawn condemnation from the European Union. Supporters of the death penalty cite public opinion and retributive justice, while opponents argue it violates human rights and risks executing the innocent. The execution proceeded despite a recent court ruling that narrowed the scope for capital punishment, leading activists to call it a political statement.</p>

A crucial turn in the case came when investigators traced the minivan, only to discover it had been towed and sold to a scrapyard.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is under intense pressure from both industry groups and public health advocates as he decides whether to sign a bill banning the sale of cookware containing PFAS, or "forever chemicals." The legislation would make California the seventh state to enact such a ban, but cookware manufacturers and some celebrity chefs are lobbying against it, claiming it will harm restaurants and consumers. Supporters of the bill, including actor Mark Ruffalo, argue it is a necessary step to reduce exposure to the toxic compounds, which are linked to serious health problems and do not break down in the environment.</p>

          <p>After nearly 34 years, a major breakthrough has been announced in the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed. New ballistic and DNA technology has linked the crime to Robert Eugene Brashers, a serial killer who died by suicide in 1999. The connection was made after advances in a national ballistics database matched a shell casing from the scene to another unsolved murder. This development brings long-awaited answers to the victims' families and is expected to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted for the crime based on coerced confessions.</p>
