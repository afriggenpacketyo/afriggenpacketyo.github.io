          <p>South Korea's LG Energy Solution has announced a significant $4.3 billion contract to supply batteries to a major, undisclosed corporation, with the deal effective until July 2030. While the company maintained confidentiality, reports suggest the counterparty is Tesla, following a similar pattern of undisclosed deals later confirmed by CEO Elon Musk. The agreement, which could be extended, surpasses LG Energy's entire second-quarter revenue, though the company advises caution to investors as details may change. The filing did not specify if the batteries are for electric vehicles or energy storage systems. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom is set to issue an executive order that will weaken a state housing law, SB 9, in areas designated as high-risk for wildfires. This move follows pressure from Los Angeles officials who raised concerns about increased population density in fire-prone neighborhoods like Pacific Palisades, which could complicate future evacuations. The order will allow local governments to restrict the law that otherwise permits up to four housing units on single-family lots. Officials argued that the original intent of SB 9 was not to capitalize on rebuilding efforts after natural disasters.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel agrees to a resolution for the ongoing crisis in Gaza, a move Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated is intended to "affect the situation on the ground." This policy shift aims to create a pathway to peace and alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people by encouraging a ceasefire and the release of hostages. The decision has drawn mixed reactions, with some UK politicians supporting it as a historic step, while others criticize it as political posturing or a conditional bargaining chip.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action, claiming it would save Americans $54 billion annually and restore consumer choice in the vehicle market. This decision directly challenges the foundation for rules on emissions from cars, power plants, and other sources. Critics, including former EPA staff and environmental groups, have condemned the proposal as "criminal negligence," warning it will face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is advancing an ordinance to prohibit law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from concealing their identities while on duty. The proposal, prompted by recent immigration raids where agents wore masks and were unidentifiable, would mandate visible identification and agency affiliation, with exceptions for medical or undercover reasons. Supporters argue the measure is necessary to maintain public trust and accountability, while administration officials defend the practice of masking agents for their safety against threats and doxing. The county acknowledges that enforcing the ordinance against federal agencies may require a court ruling.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General, Rob Bonta, has proposed a "legal pathway" for Democrats to counter potential Republican gerrymandering in other states by redrawing California's congressional districts. The plan involves a special statewide election where voters could approve new maps created by the legislature, bypassing the state's independent redistricting commission. This move is framed as a response to efforts in states like Texas to redraw maps in favor of the GOP ahead of the midterm elections. Republicans have criticized the proposal as an undemocratic power grab that undermines the will of voters who established the independent commission.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate dropped to 2.1% year-over-year in the second quarter, its lowest point since March 2021 and below economists' expectations.

The RBA has already cut rates twice this year but held them steady in its last meeting to ensure inflation remains under control. However, with weaker global growth and a rising unemployment rate, analysts now anticipate the central bank may have sufficient evidence for another cut. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision follows a recommendation from Australia's eSafety Commissioner, who identified YouTube as a primary source of harmful content for young people.

          <h2>U.S. and China Hold Constructive Talks but No Deal Reached on Extending Tariff Truce</h2>

          <p>Top officials from the United States and China concluded two days of talks described as "constructive," agreeing to continue working on extending a 90-day tariff truce set to expire in August. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that any final decision to extend the truce rests with President Donald Trump. The negotiations aimed to prevent the revival of escalating tit-for-tat tariffs that roiled global trade earlier in the year. While both sides acknowledged the importance of a stable economic relationship, key sticking points like rare earths and technology exports remain unresolved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sexual assault crisis charity in Brighton, UK, will launch a new support group exclusively for biological women, following a dispute over the inclusion of transgender women in its sessions. The decision is part of an agreement to settle a legal case brought by a survivor, known as "Sarah," who felt uncomfortable in a group that included a trans woman. The charity, Survivors' Network, will continue to run its existing inclusive groups for all survivors, including trans and non-binary people. This new pilot program aims to provide a dedicated space for biological women who feel it is essential for their healing.</p>

          <h2>Federal Prosecutors in Los Angeles Move to Drop Charges in Two Controversial Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 20:34:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have moved to dismiss charges in two high-profile cases shortly after the Trump administration extended the term of U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. The dropped cases include a major fraud indictment against Andrew Wiederhorn, a Trump donor and ex-CEO of the company owning Fatburger, and an excessive force conviction against an L.A. County sheriff's deputy. These actions have fueled controversy, with allegations that Essayli's appointment was linked to the outcome of the Wiederhorn case. The decisions have been praised by the defense but have drawn sharp criticism and allegations of politicizing justice.</p>
