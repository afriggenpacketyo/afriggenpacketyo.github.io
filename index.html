The cuts have already impacted germination trials, seed regeneration, and long-term breeding programs.  The author calls for congressional intervention to prevent further damage.</p>

          <p>The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) conducted military drills simulating a precision strike on a mock liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, seemingly targeting Taiwan’s largest such facility in Kaohsiung.  The exercise involved firing live rockets at a target resembling the Yongan LNG receiving station.  The drill demonstrates the PLA’s capability to disrupt Taiwan’s energy supply and enforce a potential blockade.  The action underscores escalating tensions in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>March saw a significant surge in announced layoffs, driven largely by the Trump administration's job cuts in the federal government.  The layoffs, exceeding 275,000, are linked to the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to reduce the federal workforce.  The total is second only to the pandemic-related job losses in 2020.  The cuts have disproportionately impacted the Washington, D.C. area.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs were calculated using a formula based on US goods trade deficits with each country.  The formula involves dividing the trade deficit by total goods imports and then dividing the result by two.  The tariffs are not strictly reciprocal, as they don't account for existing tariffs and non-tariff barriers in all cases.  Trump aims to reduce trade deficits and boost US manufacturing.</p>
