          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 07:20:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the Labour government mishandled the rollout of its welfare reform bill, stating that significant concessions have put them in a "better position" to pass it. The government was forced into a major U-turn after over 120 of its own MPs threatened to rebel against the planned cuts, which were aimed at saving Â£5 billion annually. Critics argued the initial proposals would harm disabled people by making it harder to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Following the backlash, the government agreed to limit the cuts to new claimants only and will conduct a review of the Pip assessment process, securing the support of many rebel MPs for the upcoming vote.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid market uncertainties despite the S&P 500 reaching new highs, some investors are turning to dividend-paying stocks for more stable returns. This article highlights three such stocks favored by top-performing Wall Street analysts: McDonald's (MCD), EPR Properties (EPR), and Halliburton (HAL). McDonald's is noted for its 49-year history of increasing dividends and strong brand power. EPR Properties, a real estate investment trust focused on experiential venues, recently increased its dividend and is seen as poised for growth. Halliburton is considered resilient due to its significant international revenue, which may not be fully reflected in its current stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The reliability of key U.S. economic indicators, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is becoming increasingly uncertain due to funding constraints at the Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS). The BLS, responsible for collecting vast amounts of data on prices for goods and services across the country, is reportedly cutting corners. This situation raises concerns about the accuracy of inflation calculations and other vital economic statistics that policymakers, businesses, and the public rely on. The article suggests that these data collection challenges could lead to a murkier understanding of the American economy's actual performance and trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative MP George Freeman has referred himself to the parliamentary standards commissioner following allegations that he sought assistance from a company he worked for in formulating parliamentary questions. The Sunday Times reported that Freeman, a former science minister, asked an environmental monitoring firm, GHGSat, for input on questions directed at the government. This occurred despite a watchdog advising him not to lobby the government on the company's behalf due to potential conflicts of interest from his previous ministerial role. Freeman denies any wrongdoing but has stated he will accept the commissioner's judgment on the matter.</p>

          <p>A music teacher at a Catholic school in a New Orleans suburb was fired after 21 years of service when a parent discovered his late husband mentioned in an obituary. The teacher, Mark Richards, stated he was terminated because his same-sex marriage violated a morality clause in his employment contract, which prohibits conduct inconsistent with Catholic teachings. Richards noted that his sexual orientation was previously an open secret and that the school community had been supportive after his husband's death. The dismissal has sparked backlash from other parents, with a petition calling the firing "unjust" and urging for a change in the archdiocese's policy.</p>

          <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently operating without a confirmed or acting director, placing it under the direct control of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This leadership void has created confusion and raised concerns among legal and health experts, particularly regarding vaccine policy. Kennedy, who has a history of anti-vaccine activism, has already overseen the replacement of independent vaccine advisers and directed changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. This situation has led to worries that scientific consensus could be undermined, with key public health decisions potentially facing legal challenges due to the unclear chain of command.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "Far From Home," Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska details her political journey as a moderate, her fraught relationship with Donald Trump, and her dismay over the Supreme Court's direction. Murkowski recounts her opposition to Trump on key issues like the Affordable Care Act and the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, whom she accuses of bad faith regarding abortion precedent. The memoir also reveals personal experiences, including a childhood sexual assault, which informed her perspective. She expresses concern over the GOP's shift away from her brand of centrism and laments the hyper-partisanship that has driven colleagues from the Senate.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning of an "explosive increase" in the population of lone star ticks, which can cause a severe red meat allergy known as alpha-gal syndrome in people they bite. Rising temperatures due to the climate crisis are allowing these aggressive ticks to expand their territory from the southeastern U.S. to northern and western regions. The number of alpha-gal cases has surged from a few dozen in 2009 to potentially 450,000, and experts predict this number will continue to grow rapidly. The condition presents a significant challenge for those affected, who must avoid not only red meat but also other mammal-derived products.</p>

          <p>A trend among younger bar patrons, particularly Gen Z, of closing their tab after each drink is causing frustration for bartenders. While some bartenders find the practice "unequivocally annoying" as it consumes valuable time during busy shifts, they also acknowledge a potential upside. This pay-as-you-go method can help customers better monitor their alcohol consumption and spending, promoting fiscal responsibility. The article notes that this habit might also stem from concerns about forgetting open tabs or credit cards, and it touches upon the rising transaction fees that multiple small payments can generate for bar owners.</p>

However, CEO Elon Musk now asserts that the company's future value lies not in car sales but in solving autonomous driving and developing humanoid robots.

          <p>British sportscar manufacturer Lotus is in urgent talks with the UK's business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, following reports that it was considering moving production from its Norfolk factory to the United States. The company's Chinese owner, Geely, was reportedly exploring options that could jeopardize 1,300 UK jobs. However, Lotus has since issued a statement insisting it has "no plans to close the factory" and that the UK remains the heart of its brand. The discussions come as Lotus, like other carmakers, grapples with supply chain issues and the impact of U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted to advance the "One Big Beautiful Bill," a major tax and spending package, after a tense standoff with a small group of conservative Republican senators. Senators Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, Cynthia Lummis, and Mike Lee initially withheld their support, demanding further deficit reduction and changes to Medicaid. After lengthy negotiations with GOP leadership, they secured a promised vote on an amendment and agreed to advance the legislation, avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. President Trump celebrated the vote as a "GREAT VICTORY," praising the holdouts for ultimately supporting the bill's progression.</p>

In the interview, they described difficult prison conditions and discussed the controversy surrounding their pardon, which critics questioned. Their daughter Savannah was instrumental in advocating for their release. The couple expressed a focus on prison reform and plans to return to television with a new show.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has strongly criticized the decision to host the Club World Cup in the United States, calling a two-hour weather delay during his team's match against Benfica "a joke." The game in Charlotte, which Chelsea won in extra time, was one of several tournament matches suspended due to thunderstorms, a common occurrence during the American summer. Maresca argued that frequent suspensions disrupt the game's flow and suggested the U.S. is "probably not the right place to do the competition." The recurring weather issues and extreme heat have raised concerns, especially with the U.S. set to co-host the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart enriching uranium for a potential nuclear weapon in a "matter of months." Following recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, Grossi noted the damage was severe but "not total," contradicting claims that the program was "obliterated." He emphasized that Iran still possesses the necessary industrial and technological capabilities. This assessment aligns with a preliminary Pentagon report suggesting the strikes may have only set back Iran's program by a few months, highlighting ongoing international concerns.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the recently agreed-upon ceasefire between Iran and Israel is unlikely to last, arguing that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu benefits from perpetual conflict. The author, Simon Tisdall, suggests that a state of "forever war" allows Netanyahu to maintain power, distract from domestic failures, and avoid legal troubles. Even if Iran's nuclear facilities were damaged, its scientific knowledge remains, providing a pretext for future Israeli strikes. The analysis contends that the recent bombing of Iran has achieved little, instead deepening regional distrust and potentially pushing Tehran to secretly accelerate its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>One week after the U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from President Trump and his top aides have created an unclear picture of the mission's success. While the president claimed Iran's program was "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested the setback might only be temporary, lasting a few months. As the week progressed, administration officials appeared to shift their focus, emphasizing that the strike successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than focusing solely on the physical destruction of the facilities. This evolution in messaging has sparked ongoing questions about the actual extent of the damage and the primary goals of the military action.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites exemplifies what this analysis calls President Trump's "One-and-Done Doctrine" for military force. The article argues that Trump is willing to authorize high-risk, discrete military operations but is averse to sustained campaigns that could become "endless wars." This approach was seen in his first term with actions like the strike on Qassem Soleimani and is now reflected in the Iran attack, which was framed as a single, decisive blow rather than the start of a larger conflict. This doctrine reflects a president who has grown more confident in his own instincts and is surrounded by advisers less likely to challenge him.</p>

The article argues that when global stability is at risk, China prioritizes its own economic interests and relations with the West over its alliance with Iran.

The quake, estimated at magnitude 6.5 to 6.8, exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many cities to address with mandatory retrofitting laws. The event also highlighted the risk to homes not bolted to their foundations, a common issue that persists today. Historically, the earthquake prompted Santa Barbara to adopt new building codes and famously reshape its downtown with a mandatory Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style, creating the distinctive look it's known for today.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation has revealed that the Trump administration is rolling out a national, searchable citizenship data system for the first time, developed without a public process. The tool, an expansion of the existing SAVE database, integrates Social Security and immigration data to allow state and local election officials to verify voter citizenship. While pitched as a way to ensure only citizens vote, privacy advocates and legal experts are alarmed by the rapid creation of such a powerful data consolidation tool without public scrutiny or debate. Concerns remain about the data's accuracy, security, and potential for misuse, especially given the history of flawed voter data-matching efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. wedding industry is grappling with the financial impact of tariffs on Chinese-made goods, particularly bridal gowns. With an estimated 90% of U.S. wedding dresses manufactured in China, new tariffs have led to price hikes and uncertainty for both retailers and couples. Bridal boutiques are struggling to budget for special orders that may take months to arrive, unsure of what the final tariff cost will be. This has forced many designers and stores to add surcharges or raise prices, causing some brides to hesitate on their purchases and reassess their wedding budgets in an already challenging economic climate.</p>

          <p>Belfast rap group Kneecap performed a highly-charged set at the Glastonbury Festival, drawing a massive crowd after being at the center of political controversy. The performance included expletive-laden chants against UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had called their appearance "not appropriate." One of the rappers, Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh, is currently on bail facing a terrorism-related charge, which his bandmate called "trumped up." The Irish-language trio used their platform to criticize Israel's actions in Gaza and voice support for the protest group Palestine Action, thanking the festival organizers for standing by them despite political pressure.</p>
