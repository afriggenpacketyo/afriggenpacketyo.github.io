          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will be banned from participating in women's football in England, effective June 1. This decision follows the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' based on biological sex.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's executive order targeting school discipline policies based on 'discriminatory equity ideology' could challenge California's laws aimed at reducing disproportionate suspensions of Black and Latino students. California's policies, rooted in disparate impact theory, seek to address racial disparities in discipline through alternative methods like conflict resolution. Trump's order directs the Education Department to root out such frameworks and promote 'commonsense' practices. This action has sparked confusion and concern among educators and attorneys about its potential impact on California's efforts to promote equity in schools.</p>

While acknowledging progress, Musk expressed that DOGE hasn't been 'as effective as I'd like,' but still believes that reaching the $1 trillion cost-cutting goal is 'possible.' Musk emphasized the need for political will in Congress to overcome obstacles and achieve significant cuts. He blamed the bureaucracy's tendency to automatically increase spending for hindering their effectiveness.</p>
