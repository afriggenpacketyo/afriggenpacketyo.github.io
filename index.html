          <p>Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada's Conservative party, is facing a critical by-election in a rural Alberta riding to regain a seat in the House of Commons after losing his previous constituency. Although the riding is a Conservative stronghold, the election is seen as a major test of his leadership, with his margin of victory being closely scrutinized ahead of a mandatory party leadership review. The race is complicated by a record number of candidates, many associated with an electoral reform protest group, forcing the use of a write-in ballot. Poilievre's performance is crucial as he aims to re-establish his presence against the new Liberal Prime Minister, Mark Carney.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has asserted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could end the war with Russia "almost immediately," signaling a significant policy shift ahead of a major White House summit. Trump is pressuring Kyiv to accept territorial concessions, stating that Ukraine will not regain Crimea or be permitted to join NATO, echoing Russian demands. This stance follows his recent meeting with Vladimir Putin and precedes a high-stakes meeting with Zelenskyy and key European leaders, including the heads of the European Commission, Germany, the UK, and France, who are expected to defend European security interests and support Ukraine's position.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic party, exemplified by New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, has abandoned its promises to the working class in favor of policies that benefit elites. The author contends that Mamdani's proposals, such as a citywide rent freeze and a $30 minimum wage, are failed socialist ideas that would ultimately harm young people by shrinking the housing supply and eliminating jobs. The piece draws parallels to economic struggles in cities like Chicago and countries like Venezuela, asserting that free-market principles are the only path to prosperity for the next generation.</p>

          <p>Shares for the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk saw a significant increase of nearly 5% following an announcement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA granted accelerated approval for the company's popular obesity drug, Wegovy, to be used as a treatment for a serious liver condition known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This new approval applies to adults with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis, expanding the therapeutic applications for the blockbuster drug. The treatment is intended to be used in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economists and trade experts express skepticism regarding the Trump administration's claims that its widespread tariffs will lead to a major U.S. manufacturing renaissance. Critics argue that the erratic and unfocused nature of the tariffs, which raise production costs for domestic companies, will likely reduce manufacturing competitiveness and employment. Unlike the Biden administration's targeted industrial policies for sectors like semiconductors and EVs, Trump's blanket approach is seen as creating massive uncertainty that deters the long-term investment needed to build new factories. Experts also question the validity of large investment pledges from allies like the EU and Japan, viewing them as non-binding and aspirational. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Canada's fleet remains grounded after its 10,000 striking flight attendants, represented by CUPE, defied a government-backed order to end their labor action and enter binding arbitration. The union is demanding improved wages and compensation for ground duties like passenger boarding, a stance that has gained public support. This unprecedented defiance escalates the standoff with Canadian authorities, disrupting travel for an estimated 130,000 daily passengers. The airline has delayed its restart plans, describing the union's continuation of the strike as illegal, while the government weighs its options, including potential court enforcement or new legislation.</p>

He compared the dynamic to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where massive enthusiasm preceded a significant market correction, though he also affirmed AI's long-term importance. His comments align with growing concerns from other financial experts about rapid, and potentially unsustainable, investment in the AI sector. Despite these warnings and OpenAI's unprofitability, the company is reportedly preparing a secondary stock sale that would value it at approximately $500 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

This criticism comes as the Trump administration plans to increase tariffs on India to 50% over the issue, escalating trade tensions.

This measure is part of the EU's "Vision Zero" initiative, which aims to eliminate road deaths by 2050. Helsinki's comprehensive strategy also includes data-driven identification of dangerous areas, infrastructure improvements for cyclists and pedestrians, and robust speed enforcement with 60 fixed cameras.</p>

          <p>A British tourist has shared his harrowing experience of going permanently blind after consuming free drinks laced with methanol at a hostel in Vang Vieng, Laos. Calum Macdonald, 23, initially experienced a "kaleidoscopic blinding light" before completely losing his sight, one of several victims in a mass poisoning incident that killed six others. He is now collaborating with families of other British victims to raise awareness and urge the UK Foreign Office to provide clearer warnings about the dangers of contaminated, illicitly produced alcohol in the region. Methanol poisoning symptoms can mimic a severe hangover before causing blindness, coma, or death.</p>

          <p>Swiss watchmaker Swatch has issued a formal apology and removed a global advertisement that featured a model making a "slanted-eye" gesture. The image sparked significant backlash on Chinese social media, where users condemned the pose as a racist caricature historically used to mock people of Asian descent, leading to calls for a boycott. In its statement, the company acknowledged the concerns and apologized for any misunderstanding or distress caused. However, many critics remained unappeased, accusing the brand of acting only to protect its profits in a key market that accounts for over a quarter of its revenue.</p>

          <p>On the eve of a crucial White House meeting, Donald Trump stated that a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine would involve "no going into NATO by Ukraine" and no return of the Crimean peninsula. He asserted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could end the conflict "if he wants to," placing the onus for a resolution squarely on Kyiv. These remarks set a contentious stage for talks that will include Zelenskyy and a host of European leaders, such as the UK Prime Minister and NATO Secretary General, who are concerned Trump may pressure Ukraine into accepting unfavorable terms following his recent summit with Vladimir Putin.</p>
