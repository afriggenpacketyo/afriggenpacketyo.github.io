          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the U.S. would not alter its existing tariff levels on Chinese imports, even without a finalized trade agreement. President Trump initially posted on Truth Social about a 55% tariff rate, but a White House official clarified this figure was simply the sum of existing blanket and product-specific tariffs. These statements came after high-level trade negotiations between the U.S. and China concluded in London, with Trump indicating the deal is 'done' but awaits final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping. The article provides context about the ongoing trade discussions and the current administration's stance on tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK and the EU have agreed on a post-Brexit deal concerning Gibraltar, which aims to eliminate the need for checks on people and goods crossing the Gibraltar-Spain border.

UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the agreement protects British sovereignty, supports Gibraltar's economy, and allows businesses to plan long-term. The agreement seeks to finalize a UK-EU treaty text on Gibraltar quickly, bringing legal certainty to residents and businesses in the region.</p>

Provincial premier Oscar Mabuyane described the situation as dire, with hundreds of residents displaced and 58 schools affected in Eastern Cape.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Trump's actions were intended to prevent a repeat of the 2020 unrest in Minnesota, where the governor was slow to call upon the National Guard.

Central banks' gold stockpiles are nearing levels last seen in the 1960s, making gold second only to the U.S. dollar in value as a reserve holding. Gold's attractiveness stems from its long-term value, resilience during volatility, and appeal to emerging and developing countries concerned about sanctions.

Critics argue this move could leave states ill-prepared for major disasters, especially poorer states lacking the resources and infrastructure. While some experts believe FEMA needs reform and states should bear more financial responsibility, they caution that abruptly ending FEMA could create an uneven landscape of disaster safety.
