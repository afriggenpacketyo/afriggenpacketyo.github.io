          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people, India launched strikes on what it called terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian government stated the operation, dubbed "Operation Sindoor," was measured and non-escalatory, targeting locations where attacks against India were planned. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an unprovoked act of war and vowed to respond, leading to heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, with international leaders calling for restraint. The precise nature of the strikes is still somewhat unclear.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to pass a new law that will make climbing on the Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square a criminal offense, punishable by up to three months in prison and a £1,000 fine. This measure is part of a broader effort to protect war memorials across the UK from desecration, as the Churchill statue has become a frequent target for demonstrators. The statue was sprayed with paint and graffiti during protests, prompting the government to take action to ensure it is treated with respect.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is facing a dispute with his neighbors in West Lake Hills, Texas, over the construction of a 16-foot chain-link fence and a metal gate at his $6 million mansion, which he made without obtaining the proper permits. Musk's team unsuccessfully lobbied city officials to keep the details of the property and security operations private, citing his work with the Trump administration as a reason for exemption from public records laws. The city attorney ruled against a closed meeting, and Musk lost his appeal to keep the fence and gate at a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a popular energy efficiency certification for home appliances, as part of an agency reorganization. According to internal documents and recordings, the EPA's climate change and energy efficiency divisions will be eliminated, and the Energy Star program will be de-prioritized. The program has been credited with saving households and businesses billions of dollars in energy costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The decision has drawn criticism from energy efficiency advocates and industry groups, who argue it is counterintuitive to reducing household costs and addressing the energy crisis.</p>
