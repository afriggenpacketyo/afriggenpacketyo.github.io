          <p>Eric Spofford, former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers, has been arrested for allegedly conspiring to stalk and intimidate journalists from New Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR) in retaliation for an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him.

Spofford had previously denied the allegations and filed a defamation lawsuit against NHPR, which was later dismissed.

          <p>U.S. officials have stated that Hamas's response to the proposed Gaza cease-fire is detrimental to progress, indicating a setback in negotiations. The core sticking point remains Hamas's demand for guarantees of a permanent end to the war, a condition Israel has long resisted. The United States continues to push for a resolution to the conflict, but the differing stances of the involved parties are proving to be a significant obstacle. The report highlights the challenges in reaching a consensus and the ongoing efforts to mediate a solution.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, but with limitations on its use, allowing it as a second option, not a replacement for the current Spikevax vaccine. This new vaccine is approved for adults 65 and older, and for individuals aged 12 to 64 with health conditions that increase their risk from the coronavirus. The decision comes after the Trump administration canceled funding for Moderna to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic flu viruses. The agency has also dropped its recommendation for all children to get the vaccinated but still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children, in addition to most adults for now.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), an ambitious reforestation effort, faces scrutiny due to satellite data and field reports suggesting it may not be effectively restoring forests. An analysis of satellite images indicates that some NGP land experienced deforestation events, with native trees being cleared to grow cash crops. The program also struggles with providing long-term access to land for local communities, leading to unsustainable practices. While the program aimed to restore native rainforests, many designated protection areas have little to no tree cover, raising concerns about greenwashing.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people gathered in Sofia and other Bulgarian cities to protest against the country's plan to adopt the euro, demanding a referendum on the issue. Critics fear that adopting the euro will harm Bulgaria's economy and reduce purchasing power, fueled by a mistrust of institutions and disinformation campaigns. Recent surveys indicate that nearly half of Bulgarians oppose joining the eurozone. Bulgarian President Rumen Radev also opposes the euro adoption, citing concerns about inflation and the vulnerability of certain populations.</p>

          <p>This article provides information about delaying Medicare enrollment and the potential penalties involved. Generally, if you or a spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, you can opt to keep the employer-provided health insurance and delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying enrollment also allows your husband to continue making contributions on your behalf to his health savings account. Medicare itself suggests reaching out to the employer’s benefits department to confirm you are appropriately covered and can delay your application. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has voiced his disapproval of a new rule in Formula 1 that clamps down on front wing flexibility, calling it "a waste of money". The FIA imposed a stiffer load test on front wings to limit the aerodynamic advantage teams could gain. Hamilton argues that the rule change has not made a significant difference and has only resulted in teams spending more money on new wings. He said the rule change was unneeded, and the money could have been given to charity.</p>

China has accused the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace.

          <p>The price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a classic New York City dish, has risen at a bodega in Brooklyn due to increasing costs of ingredients. El Vacilon Grocery, owned by Freddy and Yovanna Melo, raised the price of the sandwich from $4.50 to $5, marking the first increase since 2019. The decision was primarily driven by soaring egg prices, which significantly impacted the bodega's operating costs.

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism faces criticism from scientists who argue that genetic research has made significant strides in understanding the condition. Experts say the increase in US autism rates is mostly explained by the expanding definitions of the condition, as well as more awareness and more screening for it. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes that are associated with autism, building a convincing case that genetics are the most important driver of autism’s development. Researchers fear Kennedy’s fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of exciting new therapies that could help those with profound autism.</p>
