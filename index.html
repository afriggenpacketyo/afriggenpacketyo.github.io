            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary Easter truce in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight, citing humanitarian reasons, however, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, stating that if Russia is serious about a ceasefire, it should be extended beyond Easter, highlighting continued assaults along the front lines. A prisoner exchange also occurred, with both Russia and Ukraine returning hundreds of service members, mediated by the United Arab Emirates. The announcement follows frustrations from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicating a potential shift away from negotiations if progress isn't made soon.</p>

            <p>Free breakfast clubs are set to open in 750 schools across England next week, offering half an hour of free morning childcare for thousands of parents as part of a trial program that will run until July, with the intention of a national rollout. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the move would help with "breaking down barriers to opportunity" for children. However, teaching unions have voiced concerns that the government funding allocated for the scheme may not adequately cover the costs, with some schools suggesting that the funding is insufficient and could strain already stretched budgets.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have reportedly tested a non-nuclear hydrogen bomb, triggering chemical chain reactions without nuclear materials, according to a published study. The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, used a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material and generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds, without using any nuclear materials. The team was led by CSSC research scientist Wang Xuefeng, and the hydrogen gas explosions ignite with minimal ignition energy, have a broad explosion range, and unleash flames that race outward rapidly while spreading widely.</p>

            <p>The felling of a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield has sparked outrage, with the owners of Toby Carvery admitting they felled it after receiving advice it was dead, however, Enfield Council has called the felling "an outrage" and is considering legal options. Locals are questioning why the tree was felled and what the wood will be used for, and some say the tree saga points to bigger picture of what they worry is happening to Whitewebbs Park. A large portion of the tree's trunk remains, and people visiting the site hope it will start to regrow.</p>

            <p>Lucy Edwards, a blind content creator, is undergoing IVF with pre-implantation genetic testing to screen out the gene that caused her blindness, Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP), with the genetic condition potentially causing severe brain damage in male pregnancies. The decision to edit out the gene has been a complex and emotive one for Lucy and her husband, Ollie, as it is removing a part of her identity, but Lucy states that she wants to minimize the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load. While responses to her openness have been largely positive, Lucy says she has faced trolling from those unfamiliar with her story, with concerns raised about her suitability as a mother.</p>

            <p>The death toll in attacks in Benue state in central Nigeria has risen to 56, with Governor Hyacinth Alia blaming the attacks on "suspected herdsmen." Clashes between nomadic cattle herders and settled farmers over land use have become increasingly common in central Nigeria, and the attacks often take on a religious dimension, with farmers often Christian and the herders mostly Muslim Fulani. Amnesty International has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to stem the violence and leaving communities "at the mercy of rampaging gunmen."</p>

The Earl of Devon expresses a more nuanced view, stating that hereditaries offer a long-term, multi-generational view and are less likely to be focused on short term political gains. Lord Howe says he loves the Lords and has found it very fulfilling, however, he does not have strong feelings about the proposed removal.</p>
