          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin. Pirro, a former district attorney and staunch Trump supporter, has been a prominent figure on Fox News for 14 years. Her appointment follows criticism of Martin's advocacy for Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants, leading to his withdrawal from consideration. Trump stated that Martin will transition to the Department of Justice in new roles. Pirro's appointment has sparked debate, with concerns raised about her potential focus on prosecuting the President's enemies.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James, focusing on accusations that she misrepresented her primary residence to obtain favorable loan terms. The investigation stems from a criminal referral from the Trump administration's Federal Housing Finance Agency Director, William Pulte. James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, claims the allegations are baseless and politically motivated, accusing President Trump of seeking retribution. The probe follows James's lead role in the case against Trump and the Trump Organization, which resulted in Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts. Lowell has accused Pulte of disregarding updated documentation regarding the number of livable units in a Brooklyn home.</p>

          <p>Columbia University responded assertively to a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Butler Library, marking a shift from previous approaches to campus protests. Unlike a year prior, campus security intervened aggressively, leading to arrests before the New York police arrived. The university's actions have drawn praise from some, including the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, which had previously criticized Columbia's handling of protests and cut funding. However, others have criticized the forceful response, arguing that unarmed demonstrators should not be met with such measures. Demonstrators vandalized the library with graffiti before being cleared by police, and the university is moving to tighten control of protest discipline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's recent stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to invigorate its stock market due to persistent worries about economic deterioration and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The stimulus package, while aligned with economic priorities outlined in a Politburo meeting, is viewed by analysts as a temporary fix rather than a comprehensive solution. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more targeted at industrial and social needs, lacking direct financing for investments and share buybacks. Investors are awaiting more specific fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector, according to analysts. Without these, a meaningful market rally is unlikely.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have broadened the charges in the sexual assault case against luxury real estate brokers Oren and Tal Alexander, along with their brother Alon Alexander, to include six victims, including an underage girl.

The victims represent a fraction of the women federal prosecutors say the brothers lured, drugged, and sexually assaulted over two decades.

          <p>President Trump has proposed a tax increase on wealthy Americans, specifically those earning over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This proposal, discussed with House Speaker Mike Johnson, aims to create a new top income bracket and offset the cost of tax cuts, particularly those benefiting the rich. The move is intended to protect Medicaid, a healthcare program for the poor, from potential spending cuts. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes, such as raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting compensation deductions for highly paid employees.</p>

Experts suggest that while the deal could benefit sectors like financials and healthcare, India will likely ensure that domestic businesses are not harmed. Some analysts believe that certain sectors, such as steel and pharmaceuticals, may not be significantly impacted due to factors like transportation costs and the nature of pharmaceutical products.</p>

          <p>The Kooks and Hard-Fi, prominent British guitar bands from the 2000s, discuss their revival and the changing music industry. Both bands experienced success during the indie boom of the 2000s but faced challenges as musical tastes shifted. The Kooks have found renewed popularity on TikTok, while Hard-Fi is reuniting after a hiatus. The artists reflect on the difficulties of touring and promoting music in the current landscape, as well as the changing consumption habits of listeners. They note that the singalong choruses that defined their early hits were later supplanted by more introspective styles.</p>

          <p>A directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to remove ideologies deemed "divisive" from military academy curricula has led to significant changes at West Point, including canceled classes and book bans. The changes have sparked concerns about academic freedom and led to resignations from tenured professors. The order prohibits instruction in critical race theory and gender ideology and requires teaching that America is a force for good. Some professors have resisted the order, while others have complied, raising questions about the balance between academic freedom and military obligations.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning significant cuts to balance its budget, according to NHS Providers. Services including diabetes care, rehab centers, and talking therapies are at risk, as are staff positions. Some NHS trusts are halting overtime for doctors, potentially impacting efforts to reduce hospital waiting lists. The cuts are a response to initial accounts suggesting a nearly Â£7 billion overspend, despite increased government funding. One hospital trust is looking to shed 1,500 jobs, while a mental health trust has stopped accepting referrals for adults with ADHD.</p>
