          <p>Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party again after stating in a BBC interview that she did not regret the 2023 comments that led to her initial suspension. She reiterated her view that racism based on skin color is distinct from other forms of prejudice, while also condemning antisemitism. In a statement, Abbott claimed her remarks were factually correct and that it is "obvious" the current Labour leadership wants to force her out of the party. She will now sit as an independent MP pending an investigation.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are progressing with a vote on a $9 billion spending cuts package, but the process has been complicated by internal party disputes over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats have leveraged the controversy, demanding a vote on a measure to force the Justice Department to disclose the documents. The package, which passed the Senate, targets foreign aid and funding for public broadcasting. The debate highlights a significant rift within the Republican party over transparency in the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that European nations have been "free-riders" in the past by not contributing enough to their own defense and relying on the United States. Speaking to the BBC, Merz affirmed that Germany and its allies now understand the need to increase their own security investments, a message emphasized by the Trump administration. This acknowledgment comes as Merz works to strengthen defense ties with the UK and France, forming a "triangular alliance" to address threats like Russian aggression. The shift reflects a new strategic reality for Europe.</p>

          <p>On the fifth anniversary of civil rights icon John Lewis's death, tens of thousands of people participated in "Good Trouble Lives On" protests across all 50 U.S. states. The demonstrations, organized by dozens of advocacy groups, were held to oppose the Trump administration's policies and honor Lewis's legacy of activism. Protesters' demands included an end to crackdowns on civil and voting rights, the targeting of minority groups, and cuts to social programs. The events served as a nationwide display of opposition, channeling Lewis's famous call to engage in "good trouble, necessary trouble."</p>

          <p>Cristosal, El Salvador's most prominent human rights group, has announced it is shutting down its operations within the country due to escalating threats and harassment from President Nayib Bukele's government. The organization, which has documented abuses for 25 years, will continue its work from exile in neighboring countries. Cristosal's leadership cited espionage, defamation campaigns, and the recent arrest of one of its program leaders as making it unsafe to continue their work. This departure is part of a larger exodus of journalists and activists amid a government crackdown on dissent.</p>

          <p>During the first round of The Open Championship, professional golfer Jon Rahm became visibly upset with a spectator after a poor tee shot on the 10th hole. Rahm claimed that someone in the gallery whistled during his backswing, causing a distraction at a critical moment. He turned toward the crowd to scold the fan, saying it was "very smart" to make noise at that time. Rahm later downplayed the incident, attributing his emotional reaction to the pressure of the difficult shot and the bad timing of the noise, while also admitting he simply had a bad swing.</p>

This "tail-sitter" design eliminates the need for a runway, offering greater deployment flexibility in rugged terrain.

Governor Gavin Newsom called the move a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that will jeopardize jobs.

          <p>President Trump's ongoing criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stems primarily from the central bank's monetary policy, particularly its decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. Trump, who appointed Powell but later soured on him, has argued for immediate rate cuts to boost the economy and has publicly questioned Powell's competence. The conflict highlights the tension between a president's desire for economic growth and the Federal Reserve's mandate to maintain price stability, which operates independently of political pressure.

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, filed paperwork with the U.S. Small Business Administration identifying itself as a "small disadvantaged business." This designation is typically for firms majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and can provide preferential access to federal contracts. The filing was made shortly before a financing round valued the company at $9 billion. This occurred while Musk, the world's wealthiest person, was leading a Trump administration initiative to cut government spending, raising questions about the classification's appropriateness.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted three current and former Louisiana police chiefs as part of a five-person group allegedly involved in a visa fraud conspiracy. The indictment claims the defendants created and authenticated falsified police reports, which depicted immigrants as victims of fabricated crimes. These bogus reports were then used to help the immigrants apply for U-visas, a special status for crime victims who assist law enforcement. The scheme allegedly involved payments of thousands of dollars for each fraudulent report, undermining the integrity of both law enforcement and the immigration system.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common vein condition, following speculation over photographs showing swollen legs and a bruised hand. A physician's note described the condition as "benign" and common for his age group, stating that Trump remains in "excellent health." The condition occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing it to pool. This public health disclosure aims to address recent rumors and provide transparency regarding the 79-year-old president's physical condition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis argues that the Labour Party had limited options regarding Diane Abbott's latest suspension, given its commitment to a zero-tolerance stance on antisemitism. After Abbott stated she did not regret the 2023 comments that led to her first suspension, the party's leadership felt compelled to act consistently to uphold its position. This decision is rooted in the party's recent history and its efforts under Keir Starmer to eradicate the "poison" of antisemitism. The move underscores the ongoing sensitivity and political importance of this issue for Labour's leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers are facing record-high prices for beef this summer, with the cost of ground beef and steaks up significantly from a year ago. The price surge is driven by a decades-long decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them. The situation is exacerbated by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico and potential tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Ford emphasized that the fundamentals of the company remain strong, with double-digit growth in its medical devices division.

This exchange is part of a broader pressure campaign by the Trump administration, which has criticized Powell's management of the Fed amid frustrations over interest rate policy. The White House has used the renovation project as a lever to attack Powell's leadership.</p>
