          <p>This article recounts the experiences of children rescued from the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult's compound after the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack. The children, separated from their parents and indoctrinated, faced abuse and were hostile initially, but a child welfare worker, Mitsuo Hosaka, and his colleagues worked to create a safe environment for them. Over time, the children began to play together, smile, and regain their childlike selves, eventually being transferred to national child guidance centers. Hosaka reflects on the challenges of helping the children reintegrate into society and the lasting impact of the cult's denial of parent-child relationships.</p>

          <p>Leaked audio from President Joe Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has surfaced, raising further questions about his mental acuity. The audio reveals Biden struggling to recall the date of his son Beau's death and the year Donald Trump was elected president. These memory lapses contributed to Hur's conclusion that Biden's memory was "significantly limited." The White House had previously kept the audio under wraps, but the release has sparked renewed debate about Biden's cognitive abilities.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a massive search operation, though authorities initially reported eleven, but corrected the number after realizing that one had simply been transferred to another cell. Four of the escapees were charged with second-degree murder, raising concerns about public safety. Authorities believe the inmates received assistance from inside the jail, as they were able to breach a cell door and exit through a wall. The incident has led to an investigation and heightened scrutiny of the jail's security measures and staffing levels.</p>

The dust storm disrupted travel, delaying flights at Midway International Airport and causing traffic congestion on expressways.
