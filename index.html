        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the Health and Human Services secretary, is significantly reducing staff and resources at minority health offices within HHS, including the Office of Minority Health and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD). These cuts affect various agencies like the FDA and CDC, potentially widening existing health disparities for racial and ethnic minorities, rural residents, and low-income communities. Experts warn that this could worsen health outcomes, strain the healthcare system, and increase costs, undermining years of progress in addressing health inequities. The Trump administration aims to narrow the scope of these offices, despite legal mandates for their existence, consolidating them under a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is under investigation by Parliament's standards watchdog for failing to promptly declare free theatre tickets she received. The investigation was launched after Reeves did not add the event donation to the MPs' register of interests within the required 28-day timeframe. While Reeves did declare the trip on her ministerial register, which is separate, the parliamentary code of conduct requires MPs to register their financial interests in a timely manner. A spokesperson for Reeves stated that all of the chancellor's interests are fully declared and up to date.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump attributed the recent GDP contraction to his predecessor, Joe Biden, while defending his tariff policies. The U.S. economy shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter, which Trump claims is due to Biden's "overhang," despite data showing the decline reflects increased imports ahead of the tariffs and reduced government spending. Trump insists his tariffs will boost the economy, although experts link shrinking payroll numbers and consumer confidence to tariff-related uncertainty. A former White House spokesman criticized Trump's attempt to deflect blame, noting the strong economy he inherited from Biden.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student with a green card, was released from ICE detention following a federal judge's order in Vermont. Mahdawi was detained on April 16 during his U.S. citizenship interview. His attorneys argued that the Trump administration targeted him for deportation due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, violating his First Amendment rights. The judge agreed that Mahdawi made substantial claims of retaliation for protected speech, comparing the situation to McCarthyism. The government argued Mahdawi's presence had adverse foreign policy consequences related to antisemitism, a justification used to revoke visas of other pro-Palestinian student protesters.</p>

Despite revenue slightly exceeding projections, the stock's decline reflects broader market concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's sweeping tariffs.

The case pits religious freedom claims against the separation of church and state, focusing on whether charter schools are considered "public" and therefore subject to nonsectarian requirements. The school argues that state funding should be equally available to all qualified organizations regardless of religious affiliation, while Oklahoma contends that charter schools are part of the public school system and must remain nonsectarian.

          <p>A phone call between President Donald Trump and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has set the stage for a potentially tense earnings report from Amazon. Trump, who previously criticized Bezos, now calls him a "good guy" after Bezos addressed concerns about displaying tariff impacts on Amazon's site. Investors are already wary due to Trump's sweeping tariffs and their potential impact on Amazon's diverse businesses.
