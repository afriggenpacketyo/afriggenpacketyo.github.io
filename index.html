          <p>South Korea's opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to exit polls. This election was triggered by the impeachment and removal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, held a lead in opinion polls, though his eligibility was questioned due to pending charges of breaching election laws. As president, Lee is expected to navigate trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies concerning China and North Korea, while also contending with reviving South Korea's economy.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have commenced a new search in Portugal for Madeleine McCann, nearly two decades after her disappearance from Praia da Luz in 2007. The search, prompted by German prosecutors, spans 21 plots of land between the resort where McCann disappeared and where the prime suspect, Christian Brückner, resided at the time. Brückner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate crime, the sexual assault of an American tourist, and is suspected of McCann's murder, though he denies involvement. Officials have not disclosed if they are conducting this latest search based on any new information, making it appear as if they are taking one last look in places where evidence or a body could have been hidden.</p>

          <p>Japan is mourning the death of pro baseball legend Shigeo Nagashima, known as "Mr. Giants," who passed away at 89. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed deep admiration for Nagashima, marking the end of an era. Simultaneously, political maneuvering intensifies as ruling party officials suggest a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ishiba's Cabinet could lead to a Diet dissolution and an election. Ruling party lawmakers are signaling a snap election as a warning to the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the only party capable of submitting a no-confidence motion on its own.</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* examines the increasing trend of privatization and its potential to lead to a system resembling feudalism. As governments outsource more functions to private entities, power and governance become decentralized and concentrated among fewer wealthy individuals. This shift erodes transparency, disregards individual rights, and relegates the majority to service jobs, mirroring a modern form of serfdom. The author explores examples such as private military companies, security firms, and the privatization of essential services, questioning whether this trend is a temporary aberration or a fundamental shift in society.</p>

          <p>Three suspects have been arrested in connection with the kidnapping and murder of Mexican musicians in Tamaulipas state, along the Texas border. The five members of the band Fugitivo were found dead after their families received ransom demands. Investigators believe the musicians were kidnapped while driving to a private event. During the operation, authorities seized weapons, cartridges, cocaine, and methamphetamines. Reynosa, a Mexican border city, has been plagued by escalating violence due to disputes among groups vying for control of drug trafficking and human smuggling.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine and Russia intensify attacks, the Trump administration is signaling a shift in its approach toward mediating the conflict. President Trump has had no immediate public reaction to Ukraine's drone strikes inside Russia, and high-ranking officials played a smaller role in recent negotiations. U.S. officials expressed disappointment but not surprise at Russia's demands for a truce, viewing them as nonstarters. Trump's frustration with the lack of progress toward peace has been building, and he has grown increasingly disengaged.</p>

The group also slashed the outlook for the U.S. economy and warned of rising inflation. The OECD trimmed its expectations for UK growth as well, citing heightened trade tensions and uncertainty.</p>

Manufacturing, as a tradable sector, can bring new wealth into a community and create jobs.

While manufacturing has a local multiplier effect, it's smaller than that of tech or finance, and tariffs may not be the most effective solution.</p>
