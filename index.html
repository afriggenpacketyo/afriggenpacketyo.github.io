          <p>Former President Joe Biden's office announced that he has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, following increasing urinary symptoms. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men, with early stages often showing no symptoms. Screening tests, including PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams, are crucial for early detection and treatment. Treatment options vary depending on the stage and spread of the cancer, ranging from observation to surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate for localized cancer is high, but it decreases when the cancer spreads. </p>

          <p>White House visitor logs indicate that several top Democratic leaders frequently visited the White House during former President Joe Biden's term, suggesting they were aware of his cognitive state. Despite this, these leaders publicly defended Biden's leadership capabilities, even as excerpts from a new book and leaked audio recordings raised concerns about his mental acuity. The article points to statements made by figures such as Hakeem Jeffries and Katherine Clark, who expressed confidence in Biden's abilities even after apparent memory lapses were revealed. This revelation has sparked criticism, with some accusing Democratic leaders of participating in a cover-up.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is experiencing volatility due to the ebb and flow of tariff shifts in US-China trade relations, according to Executive Director Gene Seroka. A recent 90-day tariff truce led to a surge in imports in April as importers rushed to bring in cargo before new tariffs took effect. While imports increased by 5% year-on-year, exports fell by 3%, indicating ongoing uncertainty in the trade environment. The port, which relies on China for nearly 45% of its business, is navigating challenges caused by the unpredictable nature of US trade policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage climbed back above 7% after Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, citing concerns over rising government debt levels. Mortgage rates tend to follow the 10-year Treasury bond, which saw its yield increase following the downgrade. Despite the Federal Reserve's previous interest rate cuts, mortgage rates have remained high, compounded by a shortage of affordable properties and near-record home prices. Only a fraction of listed homes are affordable for households earning $75,000 annually, highlighting the challenges for prospective homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's and Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) actions to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The ruling orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president and declares the administration's takeover and staff terminations as "null and void." Judge Beryl Howell emphasized that USIP is an independent entity supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches, and the President's removal power does not extend outside the Executive branch. The decision allows USIP to resume its work in promoting peace and stability worldwide.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second-term tax bill is facing scrutiny as it is projected to worsen the country's fiscal situation, adding trillions to the deficit. The House Budget Committee initially failed to advance the bill due to Republican fiscal hawks' opposition, and Moody's downgraded the nation's credit rating, citing increased federal spending without corresponding tax increases. Despite Republican leaders' claims that the bill will address fiscal issues, analysts argue that it relies on optimistic projections of economic growth and fails to make significant spending cuts.

The US relies heavily on China for rare earths, and Beijing has increasingly used export restrictions as retaliation against US tariffs. The US relies on China for about 70 per cent of its imports of rare earths, a key subset of critical minerals, analysts said.</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump joined her husband, President Donald Trump, in signing the Take It Down Act into law, which criminalizes posting "intimate images" online without consent, including real and AI-generated content. The law requires technology companies to remove such content within 48 hours. Melania Trump, who rarely makes public appearances, described the new law as a "national victory" to protect children from online exploitation. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some digital rights groups express concerns that it could lead to censorship of legitimate content.</p>
