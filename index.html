          <p>A family of showpeople who have lived on a yard in Govan, Glasgow, for over 40 years is facing eviction to make way for a waterfront regeneration project. The family is now fighting the eviction in Scotland's highest court in a landmark case that could set a new legal precedent. Their legal team will argue that the eviction would breach the rights of a five-year-old child living on the site, marking the first major civil court test of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child since its incorporation into Scots law.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in drinking habits, with sales of traditional beer falling to their lowest level in over 30 years while non-alcoholic beer sales have more than doubled since 2013. This trend is driven by a growing health consciousness, particularly among younger generations who are more mindful of their alcohol consumption. In response, breweries are adapting their marketing strategies, promoting alcohol-free options as natural alternatives to energy drinks at events to appeal to this changing demographic.</p>

          <p>A decade after the acrimonious split between creator Hideo Kojima and publisher Konami, the Metal Gear Solid series has returned with a remake of its third installment. The new game, titled 'Metal Gear Solid Delta,' is a faithful recreation of the 2004 classic, leveraging modern graphics while retaining the original voice acting and story. The release taps into the lucrative market for video game remakes and represents Konami's renewed focus on its classic console franchises after years of prioritizing other markets.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers across the United Kingdom are facing a rising tide of abuse and intimidation from other road users, including tailgating, aggressive horn-honking, and verbal harassment. The hostile behavior is reportedly causing severe anxiety and eroding the confidence of new drivers, with some instructors reporting daily incidents of aggression. In response, many driving instructors are now equipping their vehicles with dashcams to capture evidence of inconsiderate driving, which can lead to police action and significant insurance premium increases for offenders.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new reality dating show, 'Stranded on Honeymoon Island,' which combines elements of 'Married at First Sight' and 'Survivor.'

The show aims to test whether love can blossom under extreme adversity, stripping away the superficial elements common in other dating formats to focus on building a genuine connection.</p>

          <p>A plan to loan the nearly 1,000-year-old Bayeux Tapestry to the British Museum has sparked fierce opposition within the French art world. As the Bayeux Museum prepares to close for renovations, experts and a petition with 60,000 signatures argue that the 70-meter-long masterpiece is far too fragile to withstand the journey across the Channel. Critics contend that the decision, announced by President Macron, overrides specialist advice and risks irreparable damage to the historic embroidery detailing the Norman conquest of England.</p>

          <p>The Irish government has formally conveyed its concern to German authorities after video emerged of Berlin police striking an Irish woman in the face during a protest. The 25-year-old woman was participating in a demonstration against the killing of journalists in Gaza when the incident occurred, leaving her with a broken arm and a bloody nose. The event has sparked protests at the German Embassy in Dublin and has led Berlin police to refer the incident to an oversight body to investigate whether the force used was disproportionate.</p>

This grim discovery follows the recent recovery of another hostage's body and increases the number of known deceased among the dozens still believed to be held in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The town council in Machynlleth, Powys, has rejected a proposal from a local hotel to silence the 150-year-old town clock's chimes between midnight and 7 a.m. The hotel owner argued that the chimes, which ring every fifteen minutes, regularly lead to complaints from guests, making the request reasonable. However, councillors voted against the measure, stating that the sound of the recently restored clock is an integral part of the town's character and heritage.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has uncovered evidence implicating legendary sheriff Buford Pusser in the 1967 murder of his wife, Pauline. For decades, it was believed she was killed in an ambush intended for him, a story that inspired the movie 'Walking Tall.' However, modern forensic analysis of the exhumed body and crime scene suggests Pusser's account was inconsistent with the evidence and that the scene was likely staged, with some wounds possibly being self-inflicted.</p>

          <p>The use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) is again dominating post-match discussions after a series of controversial decisions in the Premier League.
