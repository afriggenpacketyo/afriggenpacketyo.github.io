          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant downturn following President Trump's tariff announcements, signaling widespread investor anxiety. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index fell sharply, triggering a circuit breaker, while South Korea's KOSPI and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also saw substantial losses. Trump addressed market turbulence, asserting the country's economic strength and defending the tariffs as necessary medicine. The market declines reflect concerns about the potential economic impact of the trade policies and the overall stability of the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest investors are turning to safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc in response to President Trump's tariffs. The yen has strengthened against the dollar, with the Swiss franc also appreciating, as investors seek stability amid trade tensions. Some strategists propose considering "exotic" hedges like the Brazilian real due to its relative insulation from global trade. The trend reflects a broader risk-off sentiment dominating markets as participants sell stocks in favor of lower-risk options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman criticizes President Trump's tariff policies, warning they are leading to an "economic nuclear winter" by destroying confidence in the U.S. as a reliable trading partner. Ackman argues that the tariffs, which impose levies on imports from numerous countries, are negatively impacting low-income consumers and stoking fears of a global economic slowdown. He suggests Trump should call a timeout for negotiations to resolve unfair tariff deals, highlighting the potential for severe negative consequences for the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The incidents range from injuries and illnesses to serious accidents and deaths, with reports in 2023-24 being 40% higher than five years prior. Parents of a baby killed at a nursery are calling for stronger safeguarding measures and more frequent inspections, while a former Ofsted inspector claims inspections are easily manipulated.

          <p>China's central bank is signaling a preference for stability over devaluation of the yuan in response to President Trump's tariffs. While the yuan's daily reference rate has been set to a four-month low, it remains above the critical 7.2 benchmark, indicating the central bank's intention to stabilize the currency. Analysts suggest this mild depreciation is insufficient to offset the tariff hike, and they anticipate the central bank will maintain this strategy until the next round of tariffs.

While the junta has declared a state of emergency and requested international aid, experts believe the deeply entrenched battle lines and lack of common ground make meaningful dialogue unlikely. Analysts anticipate the junta will exploit the earthquake's aftermath to weaken resistance capabilities, further complicating the prospects for peace and stability in the region.</p>

          <p>Lloyds Bank faces accusations of failing small firms by reducing lending after the 2008 financial crash, with business owners claiming their firms collapsed after being placed in the bank's Business Support Unit (BSU).

          <p>The UK government is considering its response to President Trump's escalating trade wars, weighing the options of retaliation or restraint. Retaliation could be popular domestically and align the UK with other G7 nations, but it could also harm consumers through higher prices and negatively impact relations with the EU. A measured approach, focusing on support for businesses, could minimize economic damage and position the UK as an attractive destination for US companies. The decision involves complex economic and political considerations for Prime Minister Starmer.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to normalize the ongoing crisis in Gaza, moral outrage persists, fueled by graphic images and testimonies of suffering. The article argues that the scale of the crisis defies desensitization, and that efforts to suppress dissent and silence critics are ultimately counterproductive. It highlights the mobilization of state machinery to quell protests and the emergence of a "shadow government of accountability" driven by those divested from trust in political establishments. The author asserts that the daily ravaging of Gaza cannot be normalized, and that the demand for justice and an end to the war will continue.</p>

SSD was a key part of the straight-edge scene in the early 1980s, known for their short, furious songs railing against government, police, and organized religion. Barile formed SSD in response to what he saw as insincere music, and the band's straight-edge philosophy offered an alternative to the typical party lifestyle.

          <p>President Trump defended his sweeping tariffs on imports, stating that "sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something," despite the shockwaves sent through global stock markets. Trump's top officials downplayed recession fears, emphasizing the tariffs would be implemented as planned. However, Asian stock markets plunged following Trump's comments, and JP Morgan predicted a 60% chance of a US and global recession. Indonesia and Taiwan have said they will not impose retaliatory tariffs, while China announced it will impose a 34% tariff on all US imports.</p>

          <p>China is signaling its readiness for a prolonged trade conflict with the US, emphasizing its policy tools are at the ready to respond to Trump's tariffs. While the Communist Party's official newspaper struck a confident tone, investment banks anticipate announcements of rate cuts from China’s central bank and heightened fiscal spending. The newspaper emphasized that China’s “mega-sized economy” can withstand the pressure, and that policies supporting consumption, the stock market, and sectors hit hardest by the US tariff hikes will be announced in the future.

          <p>Asian markets plummeted as fears of a tariff-induced global recession intensified, but President Trump remained nonchalant, comparing the turmoil to necessary "medicine." Senior Trump administration officials provided conflicting messages on the tariffs, with some suggesting they were negotiable. The article also covers other news, including an exclusive report on how Jeffrey Goldberg was added to a White House Signal group chat, skepticism about Trump serving a third term, and a second child's death from measles in Texas amid a growing outbreak.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many senior venture capitalists are leaving big firms, driven by a perception that decision-making is slow and funds are focused on increasing assets under management rather than working with founders. Some investors are capitalizing on changes in the industry, leaving the drawbacks of big firms for the benefits of smaller ones. This trend is fueled by the concentration of money in a few elite firms and the rise of technology platforms that make it easier for individuals to start their own venture capital funds. However, not all departures are voluntary, as some partners are being pushed out due to the industry downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering closing the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office created during the civil rights movement. The office's mission is to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions and civil disorders. Former leaders of the agency worry that its closure could lead to a surge in disputes between police departments or city leaders and minority communities nationwide. The potential closure raises concerns about the federal government's ability to address racial strife in U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has deemed the U.S. government's decision to deport a Maryland man to a prison in El Salvador as "wholly lawless." The judge found little evidence to support allegations that the man was an MS-13 gang member and noted that an immigration judge had previously barred his deportation to El Salvador. The Justice Department has suspended an attorney who conceded that the man should not have been removed. The case raises concerns about the government's authority to deport individuals without proper legal justification.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stock exchanges implement halts in trading, known as "circuit breakers," during periods of extreme market volatility to allow investors to reassess and prevent market crashes. These measures are triggered when stock prices or futures fall rapidly in a single session. In non-U.S. trading hours, S&P futures are halted if they fall 7%, while NYSE circuit breakers are triggered at 7%, 13%, and 20% declines during regular trading hours. The current market volatility is driven by surging global trade tensions stemming from President Trump's tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
