          <p>Following a US-proposed peace plan, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly instructed the military to cease all offensive operations in Gaza. The move, which permits only defensive actions, is said to be in full coordination with the US administration and prioritizes the release of all hostages. The World Health Organization has expressed support for the peace initiative, while the Israel Defense Forces continue to warn civilians that northern Gaza remains a dangerous combat zone.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called on pro-Palestinian protesters to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews" following a recent synagogue attack in Manchester. He argued that proceeding with planned demonstrations this weekend would cause distress and stoke tensions at a sensitive time. Police officials have expressed concerns that the protests will strain resources needed to protect Jewish communities, though organizers maintain that cancelling the peaceful events would be letting "terror win."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) is currently unable to conduct most of its official business after another commissioner's resignation left it with only two of the required four members for a quorum. This paralysis prevents the agency from issuing penalties, launching investigations, or creating new rules for campaign finance. While the FEC can still collect financial disclosure reports from campaigns, the lack of a functioning commission effectively leaves federal campaign finance laws without an enforcement body for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Italian researchers have published a study proposing that the iconic bronze Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated as a tomb guardian statue in Tang dynasty China over 1,000 years ago. The theory is based on stylistic comparisons to mythical Chinese beasts and lead isotope analysis that traces the statue's copper to ore sources in the Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate that the monumental figure could have been transported to Venice by the family of famed explorer Marco Polo before being altered.</p>
