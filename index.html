        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare admission, North Korea confirmed it has deployed troops to support Russia in its ongoing conflict with Ukraine, escalating international involvement. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the critical nature of the coming week for potentially reaching a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine. Adding to the complexities, former US President Donald Trump stated his belief that Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy is prepared to cede Crimea, a territory annexed by Russia in 2014. Despite Moscow's claims of regaining control over the entire region, Zelenskyy asserted that Ukrainian forces are still actively fighting in Kursk. Optimism surrounding the resolution of the conflict remains low amidst these developments.</p>

Trump's comments followed a meeting with Zelenskyy at the Vatican. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius cautioned Ukraine against accepting a deal that involves extensive territorial concessions. Reports suggest the U.S. is proposing a plan that includes accepting Russia's annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control over occupied areas, in exchange for a ceasefire and security guarantees.</p>

          <p>Japan's population has been shrinking since 2008, leading to significant economic and social challenges. The country's birth rate is at an all-time low, with more than two deaths for every birth last year. This demographic crisis is attributed to factors such as the increasing success of women in the workforce, a demanding work culture, and a decline in marriage rates. The government is exploring measures to address the issue, including dating apps, incentives for rural living, and shortened workweeks, but experts suggest a sweeping mindset change is needed to reverse the trend.</p>

          <p>Scientists are expressing concerns that cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the Trump administration could have long-lasting negative impacts on American health. The administration's plan to cut the NIH budget by more than 40% has led to employee firings and research grant cancellations. Dr. Francis Collins, former NIH director, warns that these cuts could jeopardize critical clinical trials and medical breakthroughs. Researchers also fear a "brain drain" as scientists consider leaving the U.S. due to the uncertainty surrounding research funding.</p>

          <p>A leading health think tank reports that urgent and emergency care in England is performing significantly worse than pre-pandemic levels, with record-high A&E waiting times. The Health Foundation attributes this to persistent issues, such as delays in discharging patients from hospitals. While flu cases were higher than usual, they were not worse than in the winter of 2022-23. The report urges the government to address the underlying issues rather than blaming external factors. The government is expected to release an urgent and emergency care plan soon.</p>
