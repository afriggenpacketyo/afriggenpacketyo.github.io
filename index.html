          <p>A senior figure from South Africa's ruling ANC party defended the country's sovereignty amid growing tensions with the US over race relations and a new land law. ANC National Chair Gwede Mantashe criticized South African citizens who have called on Trump to "punish" the country. Tensions have also played out publicly on Elon Musk's X page, where he has described his country's ownership laws as "racist". The expropriation law does allow the government to seize land without compensation, but only in certain circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>
