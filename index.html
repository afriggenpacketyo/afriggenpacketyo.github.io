          <p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr stated that ABC's suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" was due to the host allegedly misleading the public about the political leanings of Charlie Kirk's killer. Carr suggested the FCC might take further action against ABC and its parent company, Disney, signaling a shift in the media landscape influenced by the Trump administration. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats and former President Obama, who accuse Carr of abusing power and engaging in government coercion against media companies for political reasons.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has permitted men aged 18 to 22 to leave and re-enter the country, a decision President Zelenskyy believes will encourage them to remain in Ukraine long-term without harming defense capabilities. The policy has sparked a debate, with some viewing it as a positive step towards freedom and others seeing it as unfair to active military personnel. While border officials have not noted a significant surge in departures, young men are using the opportunity for short-term travel, work, and family visits, with varied intentions of returning.</p>

          <p>A woman in Pasco County, Florida, successfully rescued her four-month-old puppy after an alligator dragged it into a creek behind her home. Danie Wright jumped into the water and wrestled the small dog from the alligator's jaws, sustaining an injury to her own arm in the process. She managed to free her arm by punching and elbowing the alligator until it loosened its grip. A trapper was later called to capture the animal, and Wright is now warning others to be vigilant and aware of their surroundings near water.</p>

This act of giving back through music became a deeply powerful moment that shaped her future.

          <p>Linda Ruggiero, a nurse at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, channels her experiences from the cardiac catheterization lab and the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic into her art. She uses weaving to create pieces that metaphorically represent medical procedures and the emotional turmoil of health crises, such as the chaos of the pandemic. For Ruggiero, who was a neuroscience researcher before becoming a nurse, art serves as a therapeutic outlet and a way to cope with the stress of her profession. She now also teaches weaving, sharing her creative coping mechanism with others.</p>

          <p>A new commentary in Nature Food argues that the severe pain experienced by factory-farmed chickens can be significantly reduced for a very low cost. Researchers calculate that modern chickens, bred for rapid growth, endure hundreds of hours of pain from health issues like lameness and heart failure in their short lives. The article proposes that switching to slower-growing breeds, a key part of the Better Chicken Commitment, could prevent an hour of intense pain for just half a cent to three cents. This approach presents a trade-off, as slower-growing breeds have a slightly larger environmental footprint.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts are outlining the implications for retirees considering reverse mortgages. Unlike traditional mortgages that quickly reflect Fed changes, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by a wider range of factors, meaning rates may not drop as uniformly. The article advises that lower rates can increase a homeowner's borrowing capacity, but retirees should carefully compare fixed-rate and adjustable-rate options and shop around with multiple lenders. Choosing the right product depends on an individual's preference for rate predictability versus the potential to benefit from further rate declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Islamist Student Group's Victories in University Elections Signal Political Shift in Bangladesh</h2>

          <p>Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS), the student wing of Bangladesh's largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, has achieved significant victories in student council elections at two major universities. These wins are seen as a potential indicator of public sentiment ahead of the 2026 national elections. The party and its student wing were banned under the previous government but have been allowed to organize again by the current interim administration. With young voters playing a decisive role, these results suggest a resurgence of support for Islamist politics after years of being excluded from the electoral process.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are expected to increase the prices of Halloween products like costumes, decorations, and candy this year. Despite the potential for higher costs, the National Retail Federation forecasts that consumer spending for the holiday will reach a record $13.1 billion. Small business owners report that tariffs have added 5% to 19% to their wholesale costs, forcing them to absorb some of the increase to remain competitive. Consumers are reportedly aware of the price hikes but are focusing on smart shopping at discount stores to manage their budgets.</p>

          <p>Hedge fund manager David Tepper commented that while the Federal Reserve has room for a few more interest rate cuts, excessive easing could push the economy into "danger territory." Speaking after the Fed's recent quarter-point rate reduction, Tepper cautioned that lowering rates too much while inflation remains a concern could reignite price pressures and create asset bubbles. Although he finds current market valuations high, he stated he is not betting against stocks as long as the Fed is in an easing cycle, adhering to the principle of not fighting the central bank's policy direction.

The deal includes a partnership to develop personal computer and data center chips, aiming to meet surging demand for AI infrastructure. The investment provides a crucial lifeline for Intel, which has fallen behind in the AI boom and recently received a separate investment from the U.S. government. This collaboration is seen as a way for Nvidia to diversify its production and support domestic chip manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations is preparing to cut $500 million from its 2026 budget and reduce its staff by 20%, which could mean over 3,000 job losses. These drastic measures are a direct result of significant funding reductions from the Trump administration, which has also withdrawn from several UN agencies. The cuts will impact the UN's core budget as well as its peacekeeping, humanitarian, and health initiatives. In response, the UN is undertaking a major review, dubbed UN80, to streamline its bureaucracy, eliminate overlapping mandates, and reassess its overall purpose and effectiveness.</p>

The administration had attempted to expel over 70 minors over Labor Day weekend, claiming it was reuniting them with their families at the request of the Guatemalan government. However, Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that any parents had sought their children's return. The ruling affirms legal protections for unaccompanied minors, who cannot be subject to expedited deportation under U.S. law.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including ancient beetles, flies, and wasps, preserved in 112-million-year-old amber in Ecuador, a first for South America. This rare find provides a unique window into the ecosystems of the supercontinent Gondwana during the era of dinosaurs. The amber fragments also contained pollen and leaves, revealing that the ancient rainforest was different from today's Amazon, containing ferns and conifers that no longer grow there. The discovery is significant for understanding the early evolution of the relationship between insects and the then-newly diversifying flowering plants.</p>
