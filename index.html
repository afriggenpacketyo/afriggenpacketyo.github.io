          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday, focusing on the signing of a Gaza peace plan. Downing Street announced his participation, highlighting his intent to acknowledge US President Donald Trump's efforts in brokering the initial ceasefire and hostage return agreement between Israel and Hamas. The summit, gathering leaders from over 20 nations, aims to finalize the deal, marking a crucial step towards ending two years of conflict. Starmer will stress the need for continued international coordination to ensure swift progress on the truce's subsequent phases, promoting humanitarian assistance and regional security.</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the former Lostprophets singer, has died after an attack in HMP Wakefield, leading to the arrest of two men on suspicion of murder. Watkins, 48, was serving a 29-year sentence since December 2013 for child sexual offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. His death highlights recent concerns about violence at the prison, where a report noted a marked increase in incidents and a heightened sense of unsafety among certain inmate populations. This grim development marks a tragic end to the disgraced rock star's life in incarceration.</p>

          <p>China's launch of a commercial underwater data center in Hainan marks a significant step in its bid for AI leadership, but an article suggests US-Gulf partnerships could thwart these ambitions. The US, through deals like advancing chip supplies to the UAE for its Stargate AI data center, is building a competitive edge. Unlike China, the US and its partners face fewer capital constraints and benefit from strong alignment between major chip producers like Nvidia and the Trump administration. This strategic convergence challenges China's near-term goal of leading the global data center industry, emphasizing the need for a broader approach beyond domestic infrastructure.</p>

US special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the crowds, confirming the hostages' return and commending Trump's efforts. While Trump received praise, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced boos, reflecting public anger over the October 7 attack and the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, Palestinian officials reported 500,000 people returning to northern Gaza, finding widespread destruction, as aid agencies highlight critical food shortages despite the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, is currently undergoing radiation and hormone therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer. His spokesman confirmed the ongoing regimen, which is expected to span five weeks. Biden was diagnosed in May with an aggressive form of the disease, characterized by a high Gleason score and metastasis to the bone, though it appears to be hormone-sensitive for effective management. This health update follows his departure from office as the oldest serving US president and his decision to end his re-election campaign due to health concerns.</p>

          <h2>National Guard Patrols Begin in Memphis Amid Blocked Access for Senators to Chicago ICE Facility</h2>

          <p>National Guard troops have begun patrols in Memphis, while Democratic US senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth were denied access to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility near Chicago. The senators sought to tour the Broadview facility and deliver supplies to protesters, but were refused entry, raising concerns about transparency and oversight. This comes as a federal judge ordered ICE to remove fencing at the Broadview site, ruling it illegally blocked a public street. These events highlight ongoing federal-state tensions regarding the deployment and control of National Guard troops in domestic policing roles.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of five British army horses that broke free and galloped through London streets last year, has been retired to a sanctuary in Buckinghamshire. The 15-year-old black horse sustained a broken bone and serious bleeding after being spooked by construction noise, leading to a five-mile chase and injuries to soldiers and civilians. Maj. Thomas Stewart confirmed Quaker was unable to return to duties, and retirement was deemed best for his welfare. This concludes the story of a dramatic incident, with Quaker now enjoying a well-deserved rest.</p>

          <p>Smithsonian museums, the National Zoo, and other facilities are set to close starting Sunday as the government shutdown continues and their prior-year funds run dry. The Smithsonian, which receives significant federal funding, confirmed that all 21 museums and research centers will be affected. While animals at the National Zoo will continue to receive care, public access and beloved animal cams will be suspended. This closure represents a significant cultural impact of the ongoing dispute over government funding, following similar closures of national parks across the country.</p>

Her leadership was pivotal in transforming a struggling mid-season team into champions, notably after a challenging loss prompted her to issue a powerful call for accountability.

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London for a march and rally, a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect in Gaza. Organized by the Palestine Coalition, demonstrators carried Palestinian flags and chanted slogans like "stop arming Israel." The Metropolitan Police made 14 arrests, including for public order offenses and supporting a proscribed group, following minor scuffles with counter-protesters. Speakers at the rally described the US-brokered ceasefire as positive but "precarious," vowing to continue protesting until Palestinians achieve full freedom.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a significant decline after President Donald Trump announced new 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export controls on "critical software," set to begin November 1. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw their worst single-session drops since April, contributing to weekly losses. This market instability coincided with a mixed week for Nvidia, which faced concerns about thin margins on cloud services and competition, though CEO Jensen Huang defended the company's long-term profitability and emphasized US leadership in AI. Key portfolio adjustments by investors also occurred amidst the economic uncertainty and government shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Private charter airline Verijet has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, leading to the cancellation of all its flights and a move towards liquidation. The Vero Beach, Florida-based carrier accumulated over $38.7 million in liabilities, including significant debts to jet card customers, and faced numerous lawsuits. The bankruptcy follows the sudden death of its 60-year-old founder, Richard Kane, in September. Verijet, which experienced rapid growth since its 2020 founding, had expanded to international destinations but ultimately could not overcome its financial problems and customer complaints.

          <p>John Swinney's strategy for achieving a second Scottish independence referendum has been backed by members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at their conference. The First Minister's plan asserts that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election, it will constitute a mandate for a new independence vote. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path, echoing a precedent set for the 2014 referendum. While the UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, has previously stated he cannot imagine a second referendum during his premiership, Swinney remains confident in delivering Scotland's choice.</p>

          <p>Gen Z consumers are increasingly rejecting "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced decor designed for disposability—in favor of sustainable, secondhand items. This trend is driven by environmental awareness, budget constraints, and a desire for emotional connection with unique pieces. Researchers estimate over 95% of the 51 million tons of furniture consumed annually is discarded, largely due to items not being made for recycling. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest show skyrocketing interest in secondhand decor, indicating a significant cultural shift towards reuse and durability, challenging the influence of fast-fashion brands on home design.</p>
