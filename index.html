          <p>CrowdStrike's shares experienced a drop of approximately 5% in extended trading on Tuesday following the company's release of a revenue forecast that fell short of expectations. Despite reporting adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents, surpassing the anticipated 65 cents, and revenue aligning with expectations at $1.10 billion, the company's guidance for the current quarter projected adjusted earnings per share between 82 and 84 cents on revenue of $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates of 81 cents per share and $1.16 billion in revenue. CrowdStrike did increase its full-year earnings guidance but maintained its revenue expectation, and the company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program, reflecting confidence in its future prospects. The company's CEO, George Kurtz, highlighted the share repurchase as a sign of the company's commitment to preventing security breaches. Optimism surrounds the company's long-term financial health.</p>

          <p>Ava Moore, an 18-year-old Air Force cadet candidate, was honored with a full military funeral after she was tragically killed in a jet ski accident while kayaking on Lake Grapevine in Texas over Memorial Day weekend. Moore, who had graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy Preparatory School on May 19, 2025, was set to begin cadet training at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) and become part of the USAFA Class of 2029. The suspected driver of the jet ski, Daikerlyn Alejandraa Gonzalez-Gonzalez, an illegal immigrant from Venezuela, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter, while Maikel Coello Perozo, who allegedly helped her flee the scene, faces charges of collision involving damage to a vehicle and hindering apprehension; both are being held in Tarrant County Jail with ICE detainers placed on them for deportation after their criminal proceedings. The community mourns the loss of a promising young leader, and her death highlights the debate surrounding immigration and accountability.</p>

          <p>Authorities are continuing their search for Grant Hardin, the former police chief of Gateway, Arkansas, who escaped from the North Central Unit prison last week, and the Arkansas Department of Corrections released an updated image of Hardin to aid in the search. Hardin, who was serving a decades-long sentence for murder and sexual assault, escaped on May 25 by impersonating a corrections officer, and the search efforts are focused in north central Arkansas, with investigators using tips from the public to guide their efforts. The reward for information leading to Hardin's capture has increased to $25,000, and officials are investigating how he obtained or manufactured the uniform used in his escape, as well as any potential assistance he may have received. The community remains on high alert as the manhunt continues.</p>

          <p>Aid distribution centers in Gaza are closed for a day as the Israeli military warns that roads leading to the sites will be considered "combat zones." The IDF stated its troops fired shots after identifying suspects moving towards them, deviating from designated access routes, following deadly incidents on routes to a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site. The GHF, a US and Israel-backed aid network, is temporarily closing its sites for organizational improvements and aims to replace the UN-led aid distribution network in Gaza, and the UN and other humanitarian organizations have accused the GHF of failing to uphold humanitarian principles. Humanitarian organizations continue to warn that Palestinians in Gaza do not have sufficient access to food, water, and other supplies.</p>

The order also stipulates that the UK levy could increase to 50% if the UK does not comply with the terms of the EPD from July 9.

Boren, an investment consultant and Idaho ranch owner, has faced disputes with the Forest Service, including disagreements over building a cabin, diverting a stream, and managing land within the Sawtooth National Forest, and he has accused the Forest Service of being "aggressive" at times. If confirmed, Boren would be responsible for day-to-day operations at the U.S. Forest Service, managing about 200 million acres of public land, and he has emphasized the importance of timber production on federal lands. The Senate Agriculture Committee will assess Boren's qualifications and vote on his nomination.</p>

          <p>Middle and major powers are increasingly employing triangular diplomacy, using trade, investment, and technology as tools of influence, reminiscent of Cold War realpolitik. This approach involves balancing and maneuvering between two other powers to build leverage, reduce dependency, and become indispensable to multiple sides without fully committing to any. While triangular diplomacy offers agility, ambiguity, and tactical scope, it also carries the risk of entanglements that could escalate instability, particularly in a world where post-war institutions are declining and multilateral commitments are being reassessed. The strategy requires careful navigation to avoid unintended consequences and maintain regional stability.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has lifted the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a penalty resulting from the bank's past misconduct, including the cross-selling scandal. The removal of the growth restriction signifies the progress Wells Fargo has made in addressing its deficiencies and meeting the conditions for its termination. With the asset cap lifted, Wells Fargo can now expand its deposit base, loan activity, and dealmaking division, and CEO Charlie Scharf has worked to resolve the bank's past issues, clearing 14 consent orders since 2019. While other elements of the 2018 order remain in place, the removal of the asset cap is expected to provide significant growth opportunities for Wells Fargo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering long-standing U.S. immigration policy. Under the proposed changes, the issuance of new work permits to asylum-seekers would be suspended until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, and even if that timeframe is met, asylum-seekers would be required to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit, instead of six months. Advocates argue that such a halt to work permits could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, and drive them to work illegally in the underground economy. The proposed rule would apply to asylum seekers with pending applications sent to USCIS and those in deportation proceedings before the immigration courts.</p>

          <p>Thomas L. Friedman argues that President Trump is governing by unchecked gut impulses, with little or no homework or coordination among agencies. This approach lacks the structured decision-making process typically associated with effective governance. The absence of careful planning and collaboration could lead to disastrous outcomes. The article suggests that Trump's leadership style poses significant risks to the stability and effectiveness of the government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the possibility of civil war in Europe, contrasting it with similar concerns in the United States. While American civil war scenarios are often debated by liberals, European concerns are more commonly raised by conservatives, particularly in France and Britain, citing tensions between natives and new arrivals. The author notes that ethnic and religious differences arguably loom larger in Europe than in the United States, with more intense cultural separatism in immigrant communities, and the elites have been more successful at keeping populist forces out of power, but their tools have markedly diminished their own legitimacy among discontented natives. This creates a situation where neither under-assimilated immigrants nor working-class whites feel especially invested in the system, making multiple forms of political violence more plausible.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening California with fines and legal action over its policies regarding transgender athletes, days after a transgender athlete won two statewide high school track-and-field events. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division called the California Interscholastic Foundation (CIF) policies allowing transgender athletes to compete "unconstitutional," alleging that they deprive female students of athletic opportunities and benefits on the basis of their sex. President Trump singled out the transgender athlete in a post on Truth Social, stating that "large scale fines" will be imposed on the state, and the acting top federal prosecutor in the Central District of California has also launched an investigation into the foundation. The debate surrounding transgender athletes continues to intensify.</p>

The renaming of naval ships is intended to realign the U.S. military with Trump administration priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture," and the decision has sparked controversy and debate over honoring legacies of civil rights leaders.
