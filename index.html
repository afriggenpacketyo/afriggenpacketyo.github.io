          <p>President Trump announced US forces struck another drug-carrying vessel off Venezuela, signaling an expanded focus to land-based drug trafficking. This operation, part of efforts against designated "narco-terrorist" groups, faces UN condemnation as extrajudicial, which the US refutes. The announcement occurred during US Navy 250th-anniversary celebrations, where Trump also addressed concerns about the Navy's size and recent Pentagon leadership changes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's controversial directives, including new "gender-neutral" physical fitness standards and an end to "woke" culture, were highlighted as part of a military realignment towards warfighting.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Martin Powers, a historian, explains how visual evidence from imperial China, particularly public art, offers unique insights into historical political ideas and societal norms, often revealing widespread understandings not always explicit in texts. He argues that art actively participates in political discourse by depicting intergroup relations, such as rich and poor, and illustrating concepts of authority. Powers highlights the concept of "honour" as described by Montesquieu, where arbitrary privilege is a key feature of aristocracies, a notion observable in both Eastern and Western historical contexts through artistic representations.</p>

          <p>Comedian Amy Schumer showcased her significant weight loss, sharing her personal experiences with different medications. She revealed a severe, bedridden reaction to Ozempic due to a specific gene, GDF15, which causes extreme nausea. Conversely, Schumer reported a positive experience with Mounjaro, an injectable medication, alongside hormone therapy for perimenopause symptoms, noting improvements in energy, skin, and hair. The article highlights her previous criticism of celebrities who misrepresent their weight loss methods, advocating for honesty regarding the use of such drugs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard members to Chicago, despite objections from Governor JB Pritzker, as part of a broader plan to send federal forces to Democratic-run cities. Concurrently, California National Guard personnel have arrived in Oregon, circumventing a federal judge's temporary block on deploying the Oregon National Guard to Portland. These actions aim to protect federal property and personnel amidst "violent demonstrations," a justification contested by state leaders who argue the deployments are unnecessary and escalate tensions. A recent incident in Chicago involved Border Patrol agents shooting a woman during an alleged vehicle ramming.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the current stock market, noting its resilience despite events like government shutdowns, which historically haven't significantly impacted it. It highlights a speculative bull market fueled by a "Trump put" perception and a new generation of buyers chasing high-growth, future-oriented stocks like Nvidia and Palantir. The author observes widespread complacency and a lack of profit-taking, even as some stocks experience "life-changing moves." Despite acknowledging the market's current magical run, the advice is to take some profits off the table to protect gains, emphasizing prudence amidst perceived invincibility.

          <p>During celebrations for the U.S. Navy's 250th anniversary, President Donald Trump publicly asserted his superior physical fitness among recent presidents. He referenced his former White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, who allegedly declared Trump the "best physical specimen" of the three presidents he served. The article notes Jackson's history of giving Trump exceptionally positive health reports, including a perfect score on a cognitive assessment, which had previously attracted scrutiny. This self-praise was a notable moment in his address to sailors.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative party is set to unveil proposals for £47 billion in public spending cuts over five years, focusing on welfare, foreign aid, and reducing civil servant numbers. Key measures include ending welfare claims for individuals with "low-level mental health problems," a 25% reduction in civil servants, and lowering aid spending to 0.1% of national income. These plans aim to address rising health and disability benefit costs, following a previous Labour government attempt to cut benefits that faced internal rebellion. The Conservatives argue these cuts are necessary for fiscal responsibility and fairness, while critics condemn aid reductions as "morally indefensible."</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced significant reforms to the housing market, aiming to reduce costs, minimize delays, and halve the number of failed property sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated these changes would "fix the broken system," potentially saving first-time buyers an average of £710 and cutting up to four weeks from transaction timelines. Key proposals include legally mandating upfront provision of property information by sellers and estate agents, and considering the introduction of binding contracts to prevent late withdrawals. The initiative also seeks to elevate professional standards across the sector through a new mandatory Code of Practice.</p>

This decision was hailed by Oregon's Attorney General and Portland's Mayor as a "healthy check on the president" and a victory for peaceful expression.

          <p>President Donald Trump voiced optimism that hostages held in Gaza would be released "very soon," as indirect peace talks between Hamas and Israel are set to commence in Egypt. Hamas has agreed to some aspects of the US-proposed 20-point peace plan, which includes hostage release and a transition to Palestinian technocratic governance. However, critical issues like Hamas's disarmament remain unaddressed. Despite Trump's call for Israel to cease bombing, Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have continued. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also reiterated the necessity of halting bombardments to facilitate any hostage release.</p>

Johnson dismissed the allegations as "absurd" and a "red herring," attributing the delay to the ongoing government shutdown and broader legislative processes.
