          <p>Following a historic election loss for the Liberal-National coalition in Australia, Sussan Ley has been elected as the first female leader of the Liberal Party, succeeding Peter Dutton. Ley, a seasoned politician with experience in various senior ministerial roles, aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, especially women and young people who felt neglected. She plans to review all party policies, including those on nuclear energy and net-zero emissions, and has promised a fresh approach characterized by collaboration rather than unilateral decisions. Ley's election is seen as a significant milestone for the party as it seeks to modernize and reconnect with a broader base of voters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to lift an injunction blocking the deportation of nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, citing security concerns. The solicitor general argued that these migrants, alleged members of Tren de Aragua, pose a significant risk in prolonged detention, with reports of threats against facility staff and ICE officers. The administration insists that the migrants have received adequate notice and opportunity to pursue habeas petitions, while emphasizing the need for expeditious removal procedures under the Alien Enemies Act due to the dangers posed by these detainees.</p>

          <p>The defense in the Karen Read trial has introduced a theory suggesting that Brian Higgins, an ATF agent, may have had a motive to confront John O'Keefe due to jealousy, citing flirty text messages between Read and Higgins in the weeks leading up to O'Keefe's death. The defense argues that Higgins might have been jealous after seeing Read arrive with O'Keefe at a bar on the night of his death, however Sgt. Yuri Bukhenik of the Massachusetts State Police testified that he did not see evidence of this and relied on the totality of the investigation which led to charges against Read. Read is accused of hitting O'Keefe with her car and leaving him to die in a blizzard, a charge she denies.</p>

          <p>A China-led international research team analyzing data from NASA's InSight lander has found seismic evidence suggesting a layer of water-saturated rock exists just a few kilometers beneath the Martian surface. This underground layer, located between 5.4km and 8km deep, could potentially hold a significant amount of water, matching scientists' estimates of Mars' missing water. If confirmed, this discovery would reshape our understanding of the Martian water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet.</p>

          <p>German companies, long-standing investors in the United States, are reevaluating their strategies due to President Trump's tariffs. Surveys indicate a pullback in investments, with companies expressing gloom about their futures in the U.S. Despite automakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz considering shifting some production to the U.S., many German firms are opting to keep investments at home, encouraged by a new government focused on reducing bureaucracy and energy prices. The situation is fluid, contingent on trade negotiations and the potential for agreements between the EU and Washington.</p>

          <p>The American perception of China is split between a technological superpower and an economy on the brink of collapse, each reflecting a real aspect of the country. While companies like DeepSeek and Huawei showcase innovation, China also faces sluggish consumer spending and a housing crisis. Experts suggest that China's technological advances may not be enough to overcome its economic imbalances, especially with a heavy reliance on exports and a real estate sector that dwarfs advanced manufacturing. This complex reality requires the US to understand both the strengths and weaknesses of its geopolitical rival as it navigates trade relations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has put India in a tight spot, as Delhi has historically opposed third-party mediation, treating Kashmir as an integral part of its territory. While Islamabad welcomed Trump's comments, India's hardened stance, especially after revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, makes it unlikely to restart direct bilateral talks soon. The situation is further complicated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement that the two countries have agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.</p>

          <p>President Trump is defending his administration's plan to accept a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, stating that it would be a "very nice gesture" given the US's support for the country's security. The potential value of the plane has raised legal and ethical questions, with critics citing the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. Despite criticism from both Democrats and some of Trump's supporters, the White House maintains that any gift will be accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws.</p>
