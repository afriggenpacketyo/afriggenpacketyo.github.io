          <p>Hurricane Iona has formed in the central Pacific, becoming the first hurricane of the season in that region. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is located hundreds of miles southeast of Honolulu and is not expected to pose a direct threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters predict Iona will strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week as it moves westward. The storm's development follows an active season in the eastern Pacific, which has already seen several named storms.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by an investment fund, Azoria Capital, which sought to compel the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The court ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" that mandates open meetings for government agencies. The judge questioned if the lawsuit, brought by a fund whose CEO is a known Trump ally critical of the Fed, was a publicity stunt. This decision upholds the long-standing practice of the FOMC meeting in private to deliberate on monetary policy.</p>

          <p>A new tariff simulator predicts that U.S. imports from China could plummet by as much as $485 billion by 2027 due to ongoing trade tensions and high tariffs. The forecast, which is based on current tariff rates of 51% on Chinese goods, suggests a significant reconfiguration of global trade relationships. The model also indicates that other Asian economies linked to Chinese manufacturing, like Vietnam and South Korea, will see their exports to the U.S. decline. Conversely, the U.S. is projected to increase imports from partners like Canada and Mexico. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations Human Rights Office has confirmed that Iran executed at least 612 people in the first half of 2025, a figure more than double the number from the same period in the previous year. Minority groups are disproportionately represented among those executed, with many convictions stemming from drug-related offenses or vague charges like "enmity against God." The UN expressed alarm over the sharp increase since President Massoud Pezeshkian took office and criticized the judicial process for lacking due process. The report also highlights a proposed espionage bill that could further expand the use of the death penalty.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares for its July meeting, investors are closely watching the gold market, where prices have recently surged towards the $4,000 per ounce mark. While lower interest rates historically boost gold prices, the metal's value has remained high due to persistent inflation concerns. With the Fed widely expected to hold rates steady this week, analysts suggest the price of gold may remain stable in the short term. However, future price movements could be influenced by the Fed's post-meeting commentary, inflation data, and evolving geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A legal challenge has been mounted against President Trump's effort to keep his former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. An attorney for a defendant in a criminal case argues that Habba's appointment is unlawful, violating the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The motion follows a complex series of events where federal judges initially appointed a career prosecutor to the role, who was then fired by the Attorney General, clearing a path for Habba's reappointment. The case questions the executive branch's authority and could impact prosecutions under Habba's leadership.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade disputes, some of Wall Street's worst fears about a tariff-induced recession are subsiding. Economists note that while tariffs are higher, the effective rate appears to be settling in a 15%-20% range, lower than the more aggressive levels initially threatened by President Trump. This, combined with strong global growth and easing financial conditions, has led some analysts to lower their recession risk forecast. However, strategists caution that the situation remains fluid and further trade escalations could still tip the economy toward a slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The only felony case stemming from the violent mob attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA has concluded with the defendant entering a diversionary program. The man, charged with assault with a deadly weapon and a hate crime, will avoid jail time if he completes 90 hours of therapy and anti-bias training. The resolution has drawn criticism from a victim in the case, who viewed the punishment as a "slap on the wrist." This outcome highlights the limited number of criminal charges filed in connection with the campus protests, despite hundreds of arrests.</p>

          <h2>Major Study Finds Lifestyle Changes Can Improve Cognitive Function in Older Adults</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study has provided strong evidence that a combination of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and cognitive training can significantly improve thinking and memory in older adults. The two-year study involved over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s. Participants who followed the intensive regimen showed cognitive function scores similar to people one to two years younger. These findings suggest that lifestyle interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline and may help delay the onset of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly shortened his timeline for a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, now demanding a deal within "10 or 12 days." Speaking during a visit to Great Britain, Trump expressed frustration over the lack of progress in negotiations, stating there is "no reason in waiting." This new, urgent deadline marks a shift from his previous 50-day timeline and follows his recent expression of disappointment in Vladimir Putin's actions. The move intensifies pressure on both sides to reach a resolution, coming just weeks after the U.S. facilitated a major arms deal for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs are expected to increase the cost of various consumer goods, even after some rates were negotiated down with key trading partners like the EU. An analysis highlights six key areas where Americans may see price hikes, including clothing, footwear, and food items like coffee and olive oil, as the U.S. heavily relies on imports for these products. Other affected categories include alcoholic beverages, cars, housing materials like lumber and steel, and potentially energy. Economists warn that these levies act as a tax on consumers, with the full impact on shoppers' wallets yet to be felt. (not investment advice)</p>

The request follows reports of horrific abuse, including torture and sexual assault, against nearly 300 Venezuelan immigrants sent to the facility by the Trump administration. Ramirez expressed concern that taxpayer money may have funded these human rights violations. The detentions were part of a controversial policy where the U.S. sent the men to the notorious prison based on what critics call flimsy evidence of gang affiliation.</p>

          <p>A new report from five United Nations agencies indicates that while global hunger has slowly declined, food affordability has worsened, with over 2.3 billion people facing moderate to severe food insecurity. The analysis highlights that many are unable to afford a healthy diet as food prices rise worldwide. The report shows stark regional inequalities, with Africa being the most affected continent, where nearly 60% of the population is food insecure. Gender disparity is also a key issue, as women are disproportionately affected by food insecurity globally.</p>
