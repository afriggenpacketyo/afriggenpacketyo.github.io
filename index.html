          <p>Microsoft is laying off 3% of its workforce across all levels, teams, and geographies as part of organizational changes to position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace. Despite reporting better-than-expected financial results, the company is implementing these cuts, which are expected to affect thousands of employees. This move is likely Microsoft's largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023, but is not related to performance, according to a company spokesperson. The cuts come as the company seeks to optimize its operations and adapt to evolving market conditions.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a bill that includes significant Medicaid cuts to fund President Trump's agenda, despite facing resistance from within their own party. The bill proposes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states offering Medicaid to unauthorized immigrants. While the Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would save $880 billion over the next decade, it also projects that at least 8.6 million more Americans will become uninsured. The legislation also addresses culture war issues, such as stripping Medicaid funding from organizations that offer abortion services.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, now 68, has been freed after spending over 38 years in prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, marking the longest miscarriage of justice for a living inmate in the UK. The Court of Appeal overturned his conviction based on new DNA evidence that pointed to an alternative suspect. Sullivan's initial request for DNA testing in 2008 was rejected due to limitations in the available technology at the time. The Crown Prosecution Service did not contest the appeal, and Merseyside Police now face the task of solving a four-decade-old unsolved murder.</p>

          <p>A federal judge, Laura Taylor Swain, has ordered that an outside official be appointed to oversee New York Cityâ€™s jails, including Rikers Island, due to persistent violence and dysfunction. The remediation manager will report directly to the judge and have the authority to take necessary actions to improve the jail complex. This decision comes after nearly a decade of federal oversight following a class-action lawsuit focused on curbing the use of force against inmates and correction officers. Despite spending over $500,000 per inmate annually, conditions at Rikers Island have continued to deteriorate.</p>

Sheriff John Allen credited the department's drone program for preventing a potentially tragic outcome, noting that the department had been called to the home over 50 times due to domestic violence issues.</p>

          <p>A $1 million annuity can provide monthly payments ranging from approximately $5,800 to over $10,600, depending on factors such as age, gender, and the specific annuity structure. Immediate annuities start paying income almost right away, while deferred annuities allow the investment to grow before payouts begin. Lifetime-only annuities pay the most but end payments upon death, whereas adding a period certain or joint-life option reduces monthly income. The interest rate environment at the time of purchase also significantly impacts payouts, with higher rates translating to higher monthly income. (not investment advice)</p>

Stadiums, designed primarily for sports, present acoustic challenges and can be physically demanding for concertgoers.

          <p>The brutal massacre of 26 civilians in India-administered Kashmir has heightened religious tensions, with experts suggesting the Islamist attack aimed to provoke communal discord. Anti-Muslim hate speech has surged, fueled by ultranationalist social media accounts, and online hatred has spilled into real life with incidents like the vandalization of a bakery with a Pakistani name. The conflict has led to increased fear and resentment among minority communities, with some considering leaving India due to growing insecurity.</p>

          <p>Ramaco Resources, a Kentucky-based coal miner, may play a key role in reducing U.S. dependence on China for rare earth elements. The company discovered a significant trove of rare earth elements at a Wyoming coal mine purchased for $2 million.
