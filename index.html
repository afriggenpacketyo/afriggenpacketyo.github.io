          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious gang leader known as "Fito," to the United States to face drug trafficking and weapons charges. This marks the first direct extradition of an Ecuadorean national from Ecuador to the U.S. Macías, leader of the violent Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape last year. His organization is accused of smuggling vast quantities of cocaine into the U.S. and trafficking firearms, contributing significantly to the wave of violence that has destabilized Ecuador in recent years.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump Administration Favors Tariffs Over Sanctions as a Geopolitical Tool</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:36:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has increasingly relied on tariffs as its primary tool for international leverage, viewing them as more flexible and direct than traditional sanctions. This approach, part of the "America First" agenda, aims to address trade deficits and pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking. Unlike sanctions, tariffs can be implemented unilaterally via executive order and generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury. However, critics warn this strategy creates global market instability and blurs the lines between economic policy and punitive action, potentially leading to escalating trade wars.

          <h2>WNBA Star Kelsey Plum Criticizes Caitlin Clark's Team Over Absence from Protest Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:35:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Sparks player Kelsey Plum called out Caitlin Clark and her All-Star teammates for their absence from a player meeting that organized a unified protest. During the All-Star Game, players wore t-shirts with the slogan "Pay Us What You Owe Us" to draw attention to ongoing, tense negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement. Plum's comments, made during a postgame press conference, revealed a surprising lack of universal participation in the planning of the protest. The incident highlights potential divisions among players even as they publicly campaign for higher pay and better contract terms.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the fierce clashes between striking miners and police outside a coking plant in Rotherham on June 18, 1984, as well as the subsequent, failed prosecutions of 95 miners. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for 40 years. Campaigners and former miners expressed cautious optimism, hoping the investigation will finally bring truth and justice to the affected communities.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has appointed former Scotland defence coach Steve Tandy as the new head coach of the men's national team. The 45-year-old Welshman will join the team on September 1, signing a contract that runs until at least the 2027 World Cup. Tandy's appointment comes after Warren Gatland's resignation and a period of instability for the team, which had suffered a record run of 18 straight Test defeats. His hiring is seen as a key part of the WRU's long-term strategy to rebuild the national side and restore its competitive standing in world rugby.</p>

          <p>A significant signaling failure at London Waterloo station caused widespread travel chaos, with South Western Railway (SWR) advising customers not to travel.

Although engineers have since fixed the problem, SWR warned that disruptions were expected to continue for much of the day. Passengers were permitted to use their tickets on other transport services, but the incident highlights the vulnerability of London's critical rail infrastructure to technical breakdowns.</p>

The move follows a recent anti-graft purge that has implicated over a dozen senior military officials and defense industry executives.

          <p>Current and former U.S. Forest Service employees are raising alarms that workforce reductions under the Trump administration have left the agency critically understaffed during a severe wildfire season. Critics claim that after around 5,000 employees quit, firefighters are being pulled from frontline duties to perform administrative tasks like cleaning toilets and mowing lawns. Some crews have reported shortages of food and supplies. While the USFS officially maintains it has sufficient resources, insiders argue the loss of experienced support staff is undermining the agency's ability to effectively combat the decade-high number of wildfires.</p>

          <p>Following the 2024 election, a debate is intensifying within the Democratic party over the political alignment of non-voters and whether mobilizing them is a viable path to victory. One theory suggests a populist platform could activate a large bloc of disaffected, economically progressive non-voters who are culturally more moderate. Post-election data presents a complex picture, but indicates that turnout dropped sharply in Democratic strongholds, suggesting the party had more to gain from energizing its base. The analysis concludes that Democrats must speak more directly to the material concerns of the working class to bring these voters back.</p>

The Trump administration scrapped regulations for CO2 pipelines, drafted after a near-fatal 2020 incident in Mississippi, and has overseen an exodus of senior officials and inspectors. With just 174 inspectors responsible for 3.3 million miles of pipe, critics and former staffers warn that the weakened agency is ill-equipped to prevent tragedies.

          <p>Housing advocates argue that removing a 50-year-old federal rule could significantly ease the U.S. housing crisis by making manufactured homes cheaper and more attractive. The regulation requires these homes to be built on a "permanent chassis," a steel frame that adds cost, limits design, and provides a pretext for exclusionary zoning. Despite decades of support for its removal, the change has been stalled by resistance from the traditional homebuilding industry and bureaucratic inertia. With the housing crisis intensifying, Congress is now reconsidering the proposal, which could scale up production and provide affordable options for millions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A passenger ferry, the KM Barcelona 5, caught fire while traveling in Indonesia's North Sulawesi province, resulting in at least three deaths, including a pregnant woman. Despite the tragedy, a large-scale rescue operation involving the coast guard, rescue vessels, and local fishermen successfully saved more than 560 people. The fire reportedly started in the vessel's stern but was extinguished within an hour. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about maritime safety enforcement in the Indonesian archipelago, where ferries are a common mode of transport and manifest discrepancies often complicate rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>The United States has reiterated that its August 1 deadline for imposing higher tariffs on the European Union is fixed, increasing pressure on Brussels to secure a trade deal. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressed confidence that an agreement could be reached but warned that a baseline 30% tariff would take effect automatically if no deal is in place. The EU is preparing retaliatory measures and exploring its most powerful trade tools in response. The standoff reflects the tense trade relationship between the two economic giants, with a potential 15-20% tariff rate being described as a "total car crash" for European exports.

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has confirmed the club is actively seeking to make more signings before the transfer window closes, stating that his squad is currently "short on numbers."

The club is reportedly still in negotiations for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres and Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera. Arteta's comments indicate that Arsenal's summer transfer business is far from over as they prepare for the upcoming season with a pre-season tour in Asia.</p>

Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure far lower than their male counterparts in the NBA.
