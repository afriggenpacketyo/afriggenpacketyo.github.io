          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. Buffett, 94, had surprised shareholders by announcing his intention to step down as CEO, designating Abel, the current vice chairman of noninsurance operations, as his successor. Buffett clarified that Abel, 62, will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment, but he will remain available to assist with significant acquisition opportunities. Berkshire shares experienced a slight dip despite the announcement, closing at a record high on Friday with a market value exceeding $1.1 trillion.</p>

          <p>Temu, the China-based retailer, has stopped shipping goods from China to the U.S. after the de minimis tariff exemption expired on May 2. This exemption previously allowed low-value parcels to enter the U.S. without tariffs. Now, Temu's products from China face tariffs as high as 145%, impacting its appeal to U.S. consumers. Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with sales handled by U.S.-based sellers and orders fulfilled from domestic warehouses. The company is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform, which President Trump said was a 'big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.'</p>

          <p>Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff is balancing his criticism of President Donald Trump with bipartisan efforts to serve his state's interests. Ossoff, the only Democratic senator up for reelection in a state carried by Trump in 2024, is seeking to retain his seat in Georgia. While launching his reelection bid with a critique of Trump, he also emphasizes his willingness to work with the administration on issues important to Georgia. Ossoff's approach involves carefully selecting his battles, challenging Trump on some fronts while seeking opportunities for collaboration.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Western sanctions, Russia's economy has shown resilience, but the potential imposition of secondary sanctions by the U.S. under President Trump could change that. These sanctions would target third countries and entities continuing to do business with Russia, potentially affecting key partners like China and India. While the Biden administration strictly enforced secondary sanctions, the Trump administration eased enforcement, making the impact of new sanctions uncertain. Russia is attempting to circumvent sanctions through systems like "The China Track" for transactions with China. The effect of secondary sanctions on Russia's economic partners remains difficult to predict.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has announced that Greg Abel, his top lieutenant and energy executive, will succeed him as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. Buffett has expressed confidence in Abel, who currently oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance companies. Abel joined Berkshire in 2000 and transformed MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a major wind energy producer. Abel's management style is considered more hands-on than Buffett's, and he is well-regarded by Berkshire's managers. Abel lived near Buffett in Omaha for six years but they never met during that time.</p>

The study also found that more people are adhering to therapy after starting it, with more visits recorded for new patients. The expansion of telehealth and the inclusion of licensed counselors and social workers as providers have contributed to increased access, though the benefits are primarily seen among affluent, educated individuals with private insurance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, in an interview with NBC News, claimed responsibility for the "good parts" of the economy, while attributing the "bad parts" to former President Joe Biden's policies. Trump defended his tariffs, asserting they would make the U.S. a very rich country. He stated that the tariffs have just started kicking in, despite the economic uncertainty they have caused. This follows Trump's previous attempts to blame Biden for the U.S. economy's contraction in the first quarter of the year. Trump said he takes responsibility for everything, but emphasized his short tenure in office.</p>

          <p>Samantha Montano, an emergency management professor, warns that the Trump administration's cuts to disaster management will result in higher death tolls due to extreme weather events, earthquakes, and pandemics. Montano argues that these cuts will diminish the capacity of agencies like FEMA and NOAA to accurately predict, prepare for, and respond to disasters. The lack of funding for these agencies will lead to emergency managers operating blindly without essential data, hindering the issuance of warnings and evacuation orders. Montano believes that the cuts, combined with the increasing frequency of hazards due to climate change, will have a significant impact on communities.</p>

UK inflation fell more than expected in March, and company hiring intentions are cooling.

          <p>An economist warns that a tariff-induced recession, or 'Trumpcession,' is looming due to President Trump's trade policies. The economy contracted in the first quarter, and while some cheer this as a statistical anomaly, the tariffs are damaging the economy. A supply shock is beginning to ripple across the nation, with fewer container ships leaving Shanghai and docking in US ports. Consumers and businesses may panic and hoard goods, and companies may hike prices.

          <p>President Donald Trump's tariffs, intended to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, are having the opposite effect in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. Mack Trucks announced layoffs at its Lehigh Valley plant, citing tariffs and economic uncertainty. While some workers support Trump's long-term vision, others are concerned about the immediate impact. Economists agree that manufacturing will likely never play as big a role in the American economy as it once did, with service industry jobs becoming more prevalent. Some hope tariffs will reverse this decline, but the layoffs highlight the challenges of reviving manufacturing communities.</p>

The authors argue that democracy and free speech failed in the face of a global emergency. The book points to pre-pandemic plans that cautioned against strict interventions, yet governments disregarded this advice and elevated scientists to policymakers. This led to a moral panic and a suppression of dissent, hurting policy responses and the ability to course-correct.

          <p>Israel's cabinet approved a plan to limit food and supplies distribution in Gaza, a move criticized by aid groups, including the United Nations. An Israeli official stated this is part of a plan to take over more territory and expand the war. Jury selection for Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial begins today in New York City, where he faces charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transporting to engage in prostitution. President Trump said he doesn't know if a president needs to uphold the Constitution, celebrated his changing tariffs, and stated the U.S. is in a time of transformation.</p>

          <p>After a five-year pause, the government is restarting collections on defaulted student loans, potentially impacting millions of borrowers.

There are concerns over potential data loss if the Education Department is closed and loans are moved to another agency.

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for a second month. The group will increase output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June, which is nearly triple the forecast. Oil prices in April posted the biggest monthly loss since 2021 due to fears of a recession and increasing supply. Oilfield service firms are expecting investment in exploration and production to decline due to the weak price environment.

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the benefit clawback rate from 100% to 50% for certain beneficiaries receiving Title II benefits, but experts warn the change may still cause financial hardship. This change applies to new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25. Beneficiaries may owe the Social Security Administration money due to overpayments, which can occur for various reasons. Experts say that losing 50% of benefits could put people into immediate economic hardship, especially since it's often not the beneficiary's fault that they were overpaid.</p>

          <p>Trump's policies, particularly his erratic trade agenda, are undermining the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. This could lead to Americans becoming permanently poorer. The dollar's reserve status keeps demand for America's currency and debt high, leading to low borrowing and consumer costs. Trump's tariffs and trade wars have shaken global investors' confidence and increased talk of "de-dollarization." A weaker dollar would reduce Americans' living standards and force the government to pay higher interest rates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on movies made in foreign countries, claiming America's movie industry is dying. He blamed other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers, calling it a "National Security threat."

UK media union Bectu warned the tariffs could harm the industry as it recovers from the pandemic.

According to the article in Shipborne Weapons, when Chinaâ€™s sixth-generation fighter is in service, the PLA could not only intercept United Statesâ€™ warplanes from penetrating the first island chain, but also conduct airspace blockades lasting one to two hours and suppress the air defence of bases in Guam from a distance.</p>
