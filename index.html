          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave announced plans for a $1.5 billion bond sale, causing its stock to rise over 1%. The capital is intended for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment, following a series of successful funding initiatives that have seen the company's share price more than triple since its Nasdaq debut. Despite rapid growth and major clients like Nvidia and Microsoft, some investors express concern over the company's debt levels and the long-term sustainability of demand for its services.</p>

          <p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led by Tulsi Gabbard, has released declassified documents allegedly showing the Obama administration "manufactured and politicized intelligence" regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. The release claims Obama officials exaggerated the threat to create a narrative against then-President Trump. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have dismissed the release as a politically motivated attempt to amplify conspiracy theories and undermine the intelligence community's consensus.</p>

          <p>A 2020 interview with New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has resurfaced, in which he discusses how his upbringing as a Muslim immigrant made him open to being labeled a "radical." In the clip, Mamdani, a self-described socialist, also talks about the need to rebrand the term socialism to focus on state provisions for a dignified life, such as housing and healthcare. The article notes he has faced criticism for his past anti-Israel stances and his father's controversial writings.</p>
