          <p>Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, two Israeli Embassy workers, were tragically killed in a shooting in Washington, D.C.; the couple met while working at the embassy and were planning to travel to Jerusalem, where Lischinsky intended to propose. Milgrim's father expressed his grief and concern about rising antisemitism, linking it to events since October 7, 2023, and the election of President Trump. Both Milgrim and Lischinsky were dedicated to their work at the embassy, with Milgrim focusing on environmental issues and promoting cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians.

          <p>Amanda Johnson, a Marine spouse and homeschooling mother of five, is publicly contesting the U.S. military's medical establishment's decision to halt her family's move abroad because her children haven't received all recommended vaccinations, despite official Navy policy stating they aren’t required. Johnson asserts that the Navy Medical Jacksonville denied their package and falsely claimed it was sent for final review, causing significant stress. Despite official policy and the destination country, Peru, not requiring vaccinations, the family's move is stalled. Johnson is seeking accountability and policy reform to prevent similar situations, advocating for vaccination status to not be a determining factor for military dependents' travel suitability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's certification to access the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a database crucial for managing international students' enrollment. This action means Harvard can no longer log international students into the system, potentially jeopardizing their visa status and making them subject to deportation. The move is seen as an escalation of the administration's efforts to pressure Harvard on various issues. Harvard is likely to challenge the decision in court, arguing that it infringes on the university's ability to recruit students from around the globe and violates First Amendment rights.</p>

Operations were halted to allow for thorough checks of equipment related to power supply to the carriages. The Keihin-Tohoku Line, which runs near the loop line, also experienced delays but resumed service in the morning.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., linked to a surge in China. The variant has been detected in international travelers arriving at airports in several states, including California, Washington, and New York. Preliminary data suggests NB.1.8.1 may be more transmissible due to its ability to bind to human cells, though it doesn't appear to evade the immune system more effectively than other strains. Health authorities in Hong Kong and Taiwan have also reported increases in COVID-19 cases, prompting increased vigilance and preparations.</p>

          <p>A small plane crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries to people on the ground; the crash occurred in the Murphy Canyon area near Tierrasanta, setting several homes on fire and causing the evacuation of about 100 residents.

The plane, a Cessna Citation, had originated from Teterboro, New Jersey, with a stop in Wichita, Kansas, before heading to San Diego's Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, with the FAA and NTSB investigating the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, a policy that mandates basic rights and protections for child immigrants in government custody. These protections include limits on detention time and requirements for adequate food, water, and clean clothes.

Prosecutors allege that Phillip Clark was the shooter and Santana Kelly orchestrated the killing, based on surveillance footage and phone records. The defense argued for dismissal due to lack of evidence connecting their clients to Morris, but the judge found sufficient evidence to proceed with the trial.</p>

Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has expressed intentions to raise rates based on price trends, while also emphasizing the need to monitor the effects of U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, with 13 to 19 named storms expected. Six to 10 of these storms are predicted to become hurricanes, and three to five could intensify into major hurricanes. The forecast is influenced by factors such as the neutral phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, warmer ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear. NOAA officials emphasized advancements in forecasting technology for more accurate predictions and urged communities to prepare for the season.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have reached record highs, with the average cost of ground beef increasing nearly 50% in the past five years. Ranchers are struggling with higher costs for feed, land, and financing, leading to reduced cattle herds. Drought conditions have also made it difficult to maintain sufficient grazing land, contributing to tighter supplies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts that beef prices will continue to rise throughout 2025, impacting consumers and producers alike. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld President Trump's decision to fire two agency officials with fixed terms, setting aside lower court rulings that would have reinstated them. The 6-3 decision favors the president's power to remove executive officers who exercise power on his behalf, though the Federal Reserve Board is excluded from this ruling. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, arguing the decision favors the President over precedent and disregards Congress's will. The case involves a dispute over the president's authority to control agencies and fire officials appointed to fixed terms.</p>

          <p>The skincare industry is under fire for marketing products with harsh anti-aging ingredients to tweens, often through social media promotions. Dermatologists warn that these products can harm young skin, leading to rashes and increased sunburn risk. Nielsen data reveals that households with children 12 and under spend more on skincare and makeup than those with teens. Lawmakers in California are considering a bill to ban the sale of certain anti-aging cosmetics to children, but brands could still use social media and kid-friendly packaging to target them.</p>
