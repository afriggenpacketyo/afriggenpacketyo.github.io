          <p>Texas election officials have identified over 2,700 potential non-citizens on the state's voter rolls following a crosscheck with federal citizenship data. The review, utilizing the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ SAVE database, is part of a broader effort to ensure election integrity ahead of the 2026 cycle. Flagged individuals will receive a 30-day notice to provide proof of citizenship, or their registration will be canceled. Confirmed non-citizens who voted previously will be referred for potential prosecution, a move supported by Governor Greg Abbott as essential for safeguarding elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing reached £20.2 billion in September, the highest for that month in five years, driven by rising debt interest payments. This brings the total borrowing for the first half of the financial year to £99.8 billion, putting pressure on the chancellor ahead of the upcoming Budget. Economists suggest tax increases may be necessary to meet fiscal rules, as spending on public services and benefits has increased with inflation. Public sector debt now stands at 95.3% of GDP, a level not seen since the early 1960s. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil's government has approved a license for the state-run oil company Petrobras to begin drilling for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from environmental activists. The decision comes just ahead of the COP30 climate talks, which Brazil will host next month. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has supported the project, arguing the revenue will fund the country's climate transition. However, environmental groups have labeled the approval a "sabotage" of climate goals, warning of risks to the Amazon's unique ecosystem.</p>

          <p>New court filings from former FBI Director James Comey's lawyers identify Columbia law professor Daniel Richman as the individual the Justice Department alleges Comey authorized to leak information. Comey was indicted for lying to Congress about not permitting FBI staff to act as anonymous sources regarding the Hillary Clinton investigation. His attorneys are seeking to dismiss the charges, arguing they are a result of "vindictive prosecution" by President Trump. The motion claims prosecutors have mischaracterized the context of the Senate questioning at the heart of the case.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a U.S. fugitive who faked his own death to evade prosecution and fled to Scotland, has been sentenced to five years to life in prison for a 2008 sexual assault in Utah. Before sentencing, the judge described Rossi as a "serial abuser of women" and a significant flight risk. Rossi was arrested in a Glasgow hospital in 2021 after being recognized from an Interpol notice. He maintained a false identity as "Arthur Knight" throughout his extradition process but was ultimately returned to the U.S. to face justice.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines regional flight made an emergency landing in Omaha, Nebraska, shortly after takeoff when the pilots lost contact with the flight attendants via the inter-phone system. The pilots then heard knocking on the cockpit door, prompting them to turn the plane around. After landing safely, it was determined that the knocking was from the flight crew attempting to communicate due to the malfunctioning phone system. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed there was no security incident, and the issue was a technical problem with the aircraft's communication equipment.</p>

In a letter, the university's president emphasized that principles like academic freedom and merit-based research funding must be preserved.

          <p>Despite Prince Andrew relinquishing his royal titles, questions persist about what Buckingham Palace knew regarding his association with Jeffrey Epstein and when they knew it. The decision to act appeared driven by public pressure, raising concerns about the institution's previous handling of the scandal while Andrew was a working royal. With new evidence emerging, such as emails contradicting his claims, scrutiny is turning to what information might be held by the Royal Household. This has led to calls for greater transparency and accountability from the monarchy.</p>
