          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that Iran has increased its production of enriched uranium in recent months, with stocks of 60% enriched uranium exceeding 400 kilograms, raising concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA expressed "serious concern" over the increased amount, which, if further enriched, could be used to produce nuclear weapons, a claim Iran denies. The IAEA also criticized Iran for its "less than satisfactory" cooperation, stating that Iran has not provided credible answers to the agency's questions and has sanitised locations, impeding verification activities. The report comes amid ongoing talks between Iran and the US aimed at curtailing Tehran's nuclear program. </p>

          <p>Many Americans, particularly Gen Xers, are concerned about their retirement savings, with over half having saved less than three times their annual income. Financial experts suggest that there is no magic number for retirement savings, and the required amount depends on individual spending habits and retirement plans. Nathan Sebesta, a certified financial planner, recommends working backward from the desired annual retirement income, adjusting for inflation, to determine the necessary savings and investment growth. If feeling behind, Sebesta advises against panic and encourages starting to save as soon as possible. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>US immigration authorities are collecting DNA information from migrants, including children, and uploading it to a national criminal database, raising privacy concerns. The practice, carried out by Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), involves storing DNA in the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (Codis), used to identify suspects in crimes. Experts warn this constitutes a massive expansion of genetic surveillance and an unjustified invasion of privacy, with over 133,000 migrant teens and children's DNA already in the database. CBP defends the practice as necessary for securing borders and identifying criminals. </p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, is scheduled for trial in August, though the case faces several challenges. Prosecutors have yet to establish a motive, and defense attorneys requested a trial delay due to intense publicity, claiming leaks in an NBC Dateline special prejudiced their client. Despite these issues, the judge has ruled against the defense on multiple evidentiary matters, including the admissibility of Kohberger's Amazon shopping history and a master's essay on handling a crime scene. The defense is also permitted to keep a court filing ‘in support of … alternate perpetrators” sealed from public view. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The early films in the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise, in contrast to today's cinematic universes, were defined by their lack of continuity and strong authorial styles. Directors like Brian De Palma and John Woo brought their unique visions to the series, resulting in standalone stories that prioritized individual creative strengths over brand-building. The films lacked consistent lore, with new cast members and shifting character traits, which proved the value of ignoring the brand-building pressures that have become the norm for big-budget features today. This approach allowed for greater creative freedom and experimentation. </p>
