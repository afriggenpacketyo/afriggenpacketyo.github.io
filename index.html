          <p>Dozens were killed in Gaza during violent clashes between Hamas militants and the Doghmush clan in Gaza City, occurring just hours before an expected hostage release. Hamas accused the clan of attacking its forces, while clan members alleged Hamas exploited the ceasefire to target them for suspected cooperation with Israel. Reports indicate 52 clan members and 12 Hamas militants died, with gunfire causing widespread panic. This internal violence unfolded as Prime Minister Netanyahu called the imminent hostage release "the beginning of a new path," cautioning that the campaign is far from over. The bloodshed casts a shadow over fragile peace efforts in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>Arianne Zucker, a long-time star of "Days of Our Lives," has reached a settlement in her 2024 lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and discrimination on the set. Zucker claimed former executive producer Albert Alarr subjected her and other female employees to "severe and pervasive harassment," including unwanted physical contact and sexually charged comments. She also alleged retaliation, including pay decreases and her character being written off, after voicing concerns. While Alarr denied the allegations, he agreed to settle to end the dispute. Corday Productions, the show's owner, previously stated Zucker's claims were without merit and that Alarr was terminated after an investigation.</p>

          <p>Martinsburg, West Virginia, a town heavily reliant on federal employment, is experiencing significant hardship due to the ongoing government shutdown. Veterans like Jonathan Giba face extended waits for essential services, while federal workers are on unpaid leave or working without pay. The shutdown has led to the closure of a USDA service center and threatens the IRS facility, impacting local small businesses and the regional economy. Residents express frustration over the political stalemate in Washington, highlighting how the impasse hurts average Americans and creates an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear about future job losses in a state already affected by federal workforce reductions.</p>

          <p>Former national security official David Feith warns that Chinese ownership of land near sensitive U.S. military bases poses significant national security risks, including potential espionage or military attacks. He explains that large tracts of land, buildings, or even shipping containers could be exploited by hostile actors using modern technology. Feith also highlights concerns over Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining operations in the U.S., which he believes could be used for intelligence collection or to sabotage the electric grid due to their high power consumption and proximity to military facilities. He emphasizes that Chinese companies are legally obligated to cooperate with their government, making their private status irrelevant in intelligence matters.</p>

          <h2>Financial Journalist Warns of Market Bubble and Eroding Protections, Citing 1929 Parallels</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns of worrying parallels between today's Wall Street and the market before the 1929 crash, suggesting the current AI boom might be an unsustainable "sugar rush" propping up the economy. He expresses anxiety over current stock prices, which he believes may not be sustainable, and notes a rise in speculation and debt. Sorkin is particularly concerned about the erosion of investor protection guardrails, including less stringent SEC rules and a weakened Consumer Protection Bureau. He also criticizes proposals to open riskier private investments and speculative crypto products to ordinary investors, fearing a repeat of the conditions that led to the Great Depression.

          <p>Retired General Tim Haugh, former head of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, warns that China has extensively hacked into U.S. computer networks, targeting not only military and industry but also every American, as demonstrated by the breach of a small town's electric and water utility in Massachusetts. Haugh states that China's aim is to gain an advantage in a crisis or conflict by prepositioning in critical networks to distract the U.S. domestically. He criticizes China's "unrestricted warfare" approach, which targets basic services, and stresses the urgency for the U.S. to enhance its cyber defenses to prevent economic impact, intelligence collection, and potential network sabotage.</p>

          <p>Maintaining adult friendships often becomes challenging amidst life's demands, leading to a phenomenon dubbed "ghosting" where connections fade. Research indicates individuals lose about half their friends every seven years as life stages shift, making friendships "collateral damage." Relationship experts emphasize honest communication, vulnerability, and creative approaches to spending time together, even through mundane activities. Psychologist Julia Samuels advises embracing "mess" and integrating friends into daily life rather than waiting for perfect moments. Experts stress the importance of in-person connection over virtual messaging and encourage individuals to trust that their friends value them more than they might perceive, advocating for proactive effort to combat "relational loneliness."</p>

          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in nose temperature can objectively measure stress levels and recovery. During an experimental stress test involving impromptu public speaking and mental arithmetic, a BBC reporter's nose temperature dropped by two degrees, a physical reaction where blood flow shifts from the nose to eyes and ears in response to perceived danger. This non-invasive technique, which saw similar results in 29 volunteers, could be a "game changer" for monitoring stress in humans, including babies, and even non-human apes, potentially identifying risk markers for anxiety or depression.</p>

Lawyers allege the software allowed cars to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions during tests by operating below normal power. The carmakers deny the accusations, asserting their systems are technically and legally justifiable. If found liable, a further trial will determine compensation levels, potentially exposing one of the most egregious breaches of corporate trust.</p>

The IFS advocates for aligning overall tax rates across different income forms, proposing reforms to property tax and capital gains tax as beneficial starting points.

          <p>Scotland's national football team has secured at least a play-off spot for the 2026 World Cup finals, with their qualification path becoming clearer. Following a victory against Belarus and Denmark's win over Greece, Scotland will now contend with Denmark for an automatic qualification spot, or face the tension of March's play-offs. Both teams are tied on points, but Denmark holds a goal difference advantage, which is the primary tie-breaker. Scotland faces Greece away and then a potential winner-takes-all encounter against Denmark at Hampden, making the upcoming matches crucial for their hopes of reaching their first men's World Cup in 28 years.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has written to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, demanding answers regarding the collapsed spy case against two men accused of spying for China. Charges were dropped after the Director of Public Prosecutions stated evidence referring to China as a national security threat could not be obtained from the government. Badenoch criticizes the government's shifting narrative and accuses them of being "too weak to stand up to Beijing," suggesting a failure to provide crucial evidence. The Conservatives have submitted an urgent parliamentary question, calling for ministers to explain the situation and address concerns about national security and alleged appeasement of China.</p>
