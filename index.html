          <p>President Trump has officially confirmed authorizing CIA covert operations within Venezuela, citing national security concerns related to drug trafficking and the alleged release of prisoners into the United States. When questioned about targeting Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, the president deflected, stating it was a "ridiculous question." The announcement follows a series of US military strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, which have killed at least 27 people and drawn criticism from some lawmakers over the lack of congressional authorization. The Venezuelan government has condemned the move as a "warmongering" effort aimed at regime change.</p>

          <p>A group of parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, successfully raised over $125,000 to continue their lawsuit against the local school district. The funds were required as a bond, ordered by a federal judge, to cover the district's potential legal fees if the parents lose their case. The lawsuit stems from the suspension of their sons, who were found responsible for sexual harassment after they objected to a transgender classmate using the boys' locker room. The case highlights the ongoing and contentious national debate surrounding transgender student rights and school policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will halt its purchases of Russian oil, although a specific timeline for this cessation remains unclear. Trump stated that this move would help curtail Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine and mentioned there would be "a little bit of a process" involved. India, one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, has previously defended its purchases as a measure to stabilize global energy prices. The potential shift in India's policy could significantly impact global oil markets and geopolitical alignments.</p>

          <p>All major Chinese airlines with routes to the United States have formally objected to a US government proposal that would prohibit them from flying over Russian airspace. Carriers like Air China argue the ban would cause significant disruption and inconvenience for thousands of passengers, particularly during the upcoming holiday season. They have requested at least a 60-day grace period if the rule is implemented to manage re-bookings and operational changes. This move comes amid escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, adding another layer of complexity to their bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a dinner for dozens of corporate executives and business leaders to raise funds for a new $200 million ballroom at the White House. The guest list included representatives from major tech companies like Apple and Google, as well as figures from the tobacco, telecom, and cryptocurrency industries. The administration states the 90,000-square-foot expansion will be financed entirely by private donations, not taxpayers, and will allow for larger functions like state dinners. The fundraising effort has drawn criticism from some, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who question the motivations behind such corporate donations.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took part in a rare on-field batting practice session as he works to break a significant postseason slump. The two-way player has struggled at the plate, with only two hits in 25 at-bats and 12 strikeouts since the playoffs began. Manager Dave Roberts had previously stated the team could not win the World Series with Ohtani performing at that level. Ohtani downplayed the idea that his pitching duties were negatively impacting his hitting, stating he doesn't feel a direct physical connection between the two roles and is focused on improving his at-bats.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent reduction-in-force notices to over 4,000 employees, with the White House budget director suggesting the total could exceed 10,000. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own social media posts indicating the cuts were intended to punish political opponents. The order provides temporary relief for workers represented by the unions that filed the lawsuit.</p>

          <h2>State Department Revokes Six Visas Over Social Media Comments Celebrating Activist's Assassination</h2>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of six foreign nationals from different countries for making social media posts that celebrated the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The department stated that the U.S. has "no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans." This action is part of a broader crackdown on such comments, with other government agencies also taking action against employees for similar posts. The move raises legal questions about the government's power to revoke visas based on speech, an issue that legal experts say is largely unsettled.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK housing association chief executive, Kate Wareing, has proposed a plan to help the government close asylum hotels by 2029, a pledge made amid rising community tensions. Her idea involves the government paying councils and housing associations to purchase properties, adding to the social housing stock for both local residents and asylum seekers. Wareing claims this could drastically cut the cost of housing an asylum seeker from £54,000 a year in a hotel to just £4,000. The proposal is reportedly being discussed with government departments as a more sustainable and integrated alternative to the current expensive system.</p>

          <p>A massive legal claim has been filed in the UK against Johnson & Johnson, with 3,000 people alleging the company knowingly sold baby powder contaminated with asbestos, leading to cancers like mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. The lawsuit cites internal documents suggesting J&J was aware of the contamination as early as the 1960s but failed to warn consumers, instead running marketing campaigns that portrayed the product as safe. J&J denies the allegations, stating its talc-based powder was safe, did not contain asbestos, and complied with all regulations. The case could become one of the largest product liability lawsuits in UK history.</p>
