The Knicks will face the Indiana Pacers in the next round, while the Celtics struggled, missing Jayson Tatum due to a ruptured Achilles tendon, as Jaylen Brown led their scoring with only 20 points.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, filling gaps in understanding the diverse populations of South America. Researchers found that early settlers split into isolated groups, with genetic traits evolving to adapt to different environments, such as the Andes. The study highlights the importance of ancestral knowledge for Indigenous people's identities and tailored healthcare.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from a New Orleans jail early Friday morning, possibly aided by jail staff, prompting a manhunt and internal investigation. The inmates escaped through a hole in a cell wall, leaving taunting messages for officials. As of Friday night, three escapees have been captured, while the remaining are considered armed and dangerous. The Sheriffâ€™s Office is investigating multiple security failures, including defective locks, inoperable cameras, and a civilian employee who left their post. Officials are also exploring the possibility of an inside job, as the sink and toilet in the cell could not have been removed from the inside.</p>

          <p>Russia is increasingly recruiting Ukrainians to carry out sabotage operations in Europe, often offering meager rewards or resorting to blackmail. These "disposable" agents are used to target military sites, defense industry factories, and undersea cables, creating a hybrid-war campaign. The use of Ukrainians serves a dual purpose: it allows agents to go under the radar and creates shock among the Western public, while enabling Russian propaganda to claim Ukrainians do not truly support the West. Ukrainian authorities have warned parents about Russian agents grooming teenagers over social media for sabotage plots.</p>

          <p>This article provides an update on the status of US tariffs on imported goods under the Trump administration. Several tariffs are currently active, including a 10% universal tariff, 25% on cars and auto parts, 30% on Chinese imports, and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered in the USMCA. However, some of Trump's highest tariffs have been paused, such as "reciprocal" tariffs and higher tariffs on Chinese goods. Exemptions have also been made for goods covered in the USMCA and electronics imported from China. The president continues to threaten more tariffs on specific industries, leaving the future uncertain.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service regarding an Instagram post that some Trump supporters interpreted as a threat to President Trump's life. The post featured seashells arranged to form "86 47," which some saw as a call to "get rid of" the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post. Trump and administration officials criticized Comey, with Trump calling him a "dirty cop" and accusing him of calling for his assassination. The Secret Service is investigating.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about his mental acuity, months after being interviewed about his handling of classified documents. Audio recordings from the October 2023 interviews revealed Biden struggling to remember dates and slurring his words. When questioned about the report, Biden asserted his competence and dismissed the special counsel's assessment. Hur declined to press charges against Biden, citing that a jury would see him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," despite acknowledging the documents were "willfully" obtained.</p>

The event marked only the second time the Chicago office has issued a dust storm warning and the first time the warning included the city itself.

Trump announced over $2 trillion in economic investments from the three nations, praising their upfront payments. The trip included campaign-style rallies, with Trump bashed Democrats and falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. </p>

The children had been subjected to abuse and brainwashing, denying parent-child relationships and enduring harsh punishments.
