          <p>Federal officials discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area frequently used by Air Force One when President Trump travels to Florida. FBI Director Kash Patel announced the find, with the U.S. Secret Service confirming "items of interest" during a pre-arrival sweep on Friday. While the agency stated there was no impact on movements and no individuals were present, sources indicated the hunting stand had existed for months. Its discovery was recent because the Secret Service only resumed sweeping that specific airport section after construction concluded, prompting an immediate investigation. This event underscores the continuous security challenges faced in protecting high-profile figures and locations.</p>

The couple tied the knot on Saturday at a private vineyard in Santa Barbara, California, with 100 close family and friends, including their respective children, in attendance. Romance rumors between Baumgartner and Connor first emerged in July 2023 when they were spotted on vacation, and their relationship was publicly confirmed shortly after her divorce was finalized.

          <p>Former US congressman George Santos described his prison sentence as "disproportionate" but acknowledged receiving "a very large slice of humble pie" in his first interview since President Trump commuted his sentence. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, was released less than three months into his seven-year term. He expressed surprise at Trump's decision, learning of it from news chyrons inside prison. Santos also called for his former campaign staffer, Sam Miele, to receive a similar commutation, while addressing criticisms of favorable treatment by pointing to other presidential pardons.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring three significant market factors this week: escalating U.S.-China tensions, mounting concerns about credit quality, and the ongoing federal government shutdown's potential impact on economic sentiment. Earnings season is in full swing, with five Club names and approximately 80 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report results, offering crucial insights into corporate performance. Key economic data, including the September existing home sales report, will also be watched, as the government shutdown has delayed other official releases, creating an information void. These intertwined issues present a complex landscape for market participants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A North Korean soldier successfully defected to South Korea on Sunday by crossing the rivals' heavily fortified land border, the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

This marks the first reported defection by a North Korean soldier across this dangerous frontier since August 2024. The crossing underscores the persistent tensions between the two Koreas and the perilous nature of escaping the North, despite the DMZ being one of the world's most heavily guarded borders.</p>

          <p>This "Face the Nation" article covers a range of critical issues, beginning with Senator Mark Kelly's concerns about the legality and objectives of US military operations targeting drug boats in the Caribbean, questioning potential regime change in Venezuela and Trump's shifting stance on Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde offered insights on the global economy, the impact of US tariffs, and the dollar's eroding safe-haven status.

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police are investigating a newspaper report alleging that Prince Andrew asked an officer assigned as his bodyguard in 2011 to gather damaging information, or "dirt," on his sexual assault accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The Mail on Sunday reported Andrew provided Giuffre's date of birth and confidential social security number for this purpose. This investigation follows Andrew's recent relinquishment of royal titles after emails emerged showing continued contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre's family views Andrew's title forfeiture as vindication, urging further stripping of his royal status.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter, as host and musical guest on "Saturday Night Live," skillfully used her appearance to subtly and directly address critics of her provocative pop persona. Through a QVC sketch featuring a suggestive neck pillow and her opening monologue, Carpenter playfully dismissed the idea of her being subservient to a misogynist male fantasy. A later sketch, where she played a "girlboss" character with a concussion, further allowed her to challenge those overly concerned with her sexuality, implying some criticism stems from internalized misogyny. Her performance was a self-aware and humorous pushback against her detractors.</p>

          <p>Following his release from prison, former US Representative George Santos has declared a newfound mission: dedicating his life to prison reform. President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft, leading to Santos's release after only 84 days. Santos described his experience in federal prison as "dehumanizing," citing "rotting facilities" with "thick black mold" and broken air conditioning. He informed Trump of his reform ambitions, seeking to help the administration achieve more humane conditions, though specific plans for his involvement remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has achieved a dramatic decline in per capita tobacco consumption over two decades, attributed to strong policies on taxation, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions. However, the World Health Organization's regional definition, which includes India but excludes Indonesia, complicates data comparison. Despite this progress, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth. The region now faces new challenges from the rapid rise of e-cigarettes and persistent tobacco industry influence, particularly in countries like Indonesia, where 72% of men use tobacco.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume student debt cancellation under specific income-driven repayment plans, reopening a path to loan forgiveness for millions of borrowers. This agreement, reached with the American Federation of Teachers, reverses previous actions that had paused forgiveness in some programs. While two plans, ICR and PAYE, are set to phase out by July 2028 under President Trump's "big beautiful bill," the agreement ensures eligible borrowers will receive relief until then. Additionally, 2025 forgiveness will remain tax-free at the federal level, providing substantial financial benefit.</p>

          <p>Bolivians are heading to the polls in a presidential run-off election, signaling a significant shift after two decades of one-party leftist rule. The choice is between two conservative capitalists, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz, both pledging to address the country's severe economic crisis, including a US dollar shortage, currency devaluation, and high inflation. Both candidates aim to stabilize the economy by fixing the exchange rate, restructuring state businesses, and attracting foreign investment, though they differ on the approach to fuel subsidies and International Monetary Fund involvement, promising a new trajectory for the nation.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, as suggested by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While Miliband would not confirm specifics before November's Budget, he emphasized the need to tackle affordability and the role of clean power in long-term solutions. Scrapping VAT could save average households £86 annually, costing an estimated £2.5bn per year. The government is also exploring reducing regulatory levies currently added to energy bills, aiming to ease financial pressure on consumers amidst persistently high energy prices.</p>

Russian state media highlighted the tie, and a Putin economic envoy amplified the controversy on social media. While some defended it as American colors, the sartorial choice fueled fears about President Trump's shifting stance on Ukraine, particularly after delays in providing long-range missiles and suggestions for territorial concessions, creating an unnecessary diplomatic distraction during a critical meeting.</p>

Polanski also advocated aligning capital gains tax with income tax, asserting that "unearned wealth" should be taxed as much as earned income.
