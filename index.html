          <p>The Trump administration has disclosed that over 4,000 federal workers across seven agencies have received "reduction in force" notices due to the ongoing government shutdown. Departments like Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Education are among those most affected by these layoffs. President Trump attributed the layoffs to Democrats, while Republican Senator Susan Collins and the American Federation of Government Employees criticized the move as "disgraceful" and "illegal." This article highlights the immediate human impact and political tensions surrounding the prolonged budget impasse.</p>

          <p>Secretary of War Pete Hegseth announced the formation of a new counter-narcotics Joint Task Force in the Caribbean Sea, aiming to "crush the cartels, stop the poison, and keep America safe." This initiative, directed by President Trump, will operate in the SOUTHCOM area, synchronizing and augmenting efforts against illicit trafficking networks. The announcement follows a series of fatal U.S. strikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the region, which have drawn concern from Democratic lawmakers regarding the evidence supporting these actions. The task force signifies an intensified military approach to drug interdiction.</p>

          <p>New York City's 26 Federal Plaza has become a focal point for aggressive immigration enforcement, with reports of officers using force during detentions. One incident, where a woman was thrown to the ground while her husband was detained, went viral and led to an officer's temporary suspension. Attorneys describe the environment as traumatic, noting that many detainees have no criminal convictions and are arrested without access to legal counsel.

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to offer discounted prescription drug prices to Medicaid patients, mirroring a recent agreement with Pfizer. Under the "most-favored-nation" pricing model, AstraZeneca will charge no more than the lowest rates offered in other high-income countries. The company also committed to listing "all primary care medications" on the upcoming government website, TrumpRx, and investing in U.S. manufacturing. Experts, however, caution that the impact on Medicaid patients may be limited due to existing protections, and TrumpRx's broader benefits remain unclear. (not investment advice)</p>

Bradford's sentencing for second-degree murder also considered his prior strike convictions and firearm possession, bringing a measure of justice to a tragic event.</p>

Despite director Joachim Rønning's ability to deliver stunning visuals and a thrumming score, the article criticizes Jared Leto's "charisma vacuum" performance as the titular AI, leaving the audience with a wheel-spinning story and unanswered questions about its radical science.</p>
