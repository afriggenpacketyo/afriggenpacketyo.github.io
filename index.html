          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 03:03:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese luxury jeweler Laopu Gold is expanding internationally, opening its first overseas store in Singapore to massive crowds and long wait times. The brand, known for using traditional Chinese crafting techniques, has seen its sales and stock price surge, posing a challenge to established European luxury houses like Cartier. This expansion is part of a broader trend of Chinese brands gaining global recognition, leveraging heritage-inspired designs to appeal to a worldwide market. The company's success highlights a shift in consumer preferences and the growing influence of Eastern manufacturing in the luxury sector.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 03:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The distinct taste of American chocolate, often described as slightly sour by non-US consumers, is attributed to the use of butyric acid for a longer shelf life and a higher sugar content. In contrast, European chocolate, particularly from Switzerland and Belgium, emphasizes a fine, creamy texture through traditional methods and stricter regulations on cocoa content. Emerging markets like India are developing unique flavor profiles, while African consumption is growing despite climate challenges. The article also notes the dark colonial history of cocoa production, which persists in the form of economic exploitation for many farmers today.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 02:49:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest installment in the dinosaur franchise, "Jurassic World Rebirth," has dominated the box office, earning an estimated $318.3 million globally in its first five days. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson, garnered $147.3 million domestically, with a significant portion from the July 4th holiday weekend. Despite mixed critical reviews, its strong performance, particularly in China where it had the year's biggest opening for a Hollywood film, demonstrates the franchise's enduring commercial appeal. The movie's success provides a much-needed boost to the summer box office.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in central Texas have resulted in at least 81 confirmed deaths, with dozens of people still missing as of Sunday. The hardest-hit area was Kerr County, where a Christian girls' summer camp on the Guadalupe River was inundated, accounting for 68 fatalities, including 28 children. Rescue operations are ongoing but are shifting towards recovery, hampered by the threat of more storms and dangerous conditions. The disaster, which saw the river rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes, has prompted a major disaster declaration and a massive search-and-rescue effort.</p>

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the policy will give people necessary time to grieve without worrying about work.

Prosecutors argued the act was deliberate, though they did not offer a specific motive, highlighting strained family relations.

On the ground, Palestinians express weariness and skepticism, fearing a return to conflict after the truce.

          <p>Authorities have confirmed the recovery of the bodies of all seven people who were missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California. The blast, which occurred last week, ignited a large wildfire and destroyed the building, which was managed by Devastating Pyrotechnics.

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina early Sunday. While the storm has weakened, it is still bringing heavy rain to the region, with forecasts of up to six inches in some areas. Flood watches have been issued for parts of central North Carolina and south-central Virginia due to the significant risk of flash flooding. The system is expected to continue moving northeast and weaken further, but dangerous surf and rip currents will likely persist along the Atlantic coast for several days.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fertility rates across the U.S. and the world are falling to historic lows, driven by women having greater economic independence and choosing to have fewer or no children. While this reflects positive social change, economists and demographers are concerned about the long-term consequences, such as labor shortages, economic stagnation, and the solvency of social safety nets. The U.S. fertility rate has dropped to 1.6, well below the 2.1 replacement level, a trend seen in many high-income nations. This demographic shift is prompting a debate on pronatalist policies, though many women view government incentives with suspicion. (not investment advice)</p>

The port is currently leased to a Chinese-owned company, and the potential for a government-influenced sale is a sensitive topic in bilateral relations. Albanese's visit, scheduled for mid-July, is seen as a gesture to maintain positive diplomatic momentum between the two nations. The discussions will be a key indicator of the state of China-Australia relations, particularly concerning strategic investments and national security.</p>

          <p>The European housing crisis, marked by soaring rents and unattainable homeownership, is becoming a major source of political instability and inequality. This article argues that the crisis is driven by the financial sector's growing control over housing, with institutional investors treating homes as a lucrative asset class. Since 2008, investment funds have acquired vast portfolios of residential properties, leading to rent hikes and "renovictions" to maximize profits. This corporate capture, enabled by decades of privatization and deregulation, has systematically shifted power from residents to investors, failing to provide affordable homes.</p>

Despite missing several key players, the US team had shown signs of progress, but the loss to their rivals highlights ongoing inconsistencies.

          <p>Local officials in Texas Hill Country stated they were surprised by the speed and severity of the flash floods that have killed at least 80 people. The Guadalupe River in Kerr County reportedly rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes overnight while residents were sleeping. Kerr County's judge noted they had no reason to believe the rainfall would be so catastrophic and acknowledged the county lacks a river-based warning system. This lack of advance warning is a key factor in the high death toll, as many residents had no time to evacuate.</p>

In response, President Donald Trump threatened an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning with what he called "Anti-American policies of BRICS."

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with some participants in a clinical trial regaining significant hearing within weeks. The therapy involves a single injection into the inner ear that delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is mutated in this type of hearing loss. The trial, which included children and adults, saw all 10 participants experience hearing improvement, with younger patients responding best. Researchers are optimistic that this safe treatment is just the beginning for genetic therapies targeting other common causes of deafness.</p>
