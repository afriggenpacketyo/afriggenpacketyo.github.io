          <p>Marathon world record holder Ruth Chepngetich of Kenya has been provisionally suspended following a positive doping test. The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) reported that she tested positive for hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic, in March. Chepngetich, who set the world record in Chicago last October, voluntarily accepted the suspension in April while the investigation was ongoing. This case highlights the continuing doping challenges within Kenyan long-distance running, with several other high-profile athletes also facing sanctions recently.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark has announced she will not participate in the WNBA All-Star Game or its related festivities because of a recurring groin injury. Clark, who was the leading fan vote-getter, made the decision to prioritize her long-term health and rest her body. She re-aggravated the injury during a recent game against the Connecticut Sun, adding to a season already impacted by several injuries. Clark will still attend the events in Indianapolis to support her team from the sidelines.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued after getting lost in a dense Northern California forest, thanks to a series of handwritten notes they left behind. The pair became stranded after their vehicle's GPS failed, and they spent a night in their car. Search and rescue teams, guided by the notes which provided directions and a plea for help, located them in an isolated area. The boy also used a whistle to signal for help, demonstrating resourcefulness that led to their safe recovery.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor involved in cases against Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Sean "Diddy" Combs, has been fired from the Southern District of New York. The Department of Justice provided no official reason for her dismissal, which comes amid a series of firings of officials who worked on cases related to Donald Trump. Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, sent a message to colleagues urging them not to let fear suppress independent thought. Her firing raises concerns about political influence within the Justice Department.</p>

The bill would also mandate increased transparency in pricing for companies with over $100 million in revenue and allocate $1 billion in additional funding to the FTC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs player Rashee Rice has been sentenced to five years of deferred probation and 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to felony charges from a high-speed car crash. Rice was driving a Lamborghini at 119 mph, causing a multi-vehicle collision before fleeing the scene. As part of his plea deal, Rice must also pay over $115,000 in medical expenses for the victims. The NFL is now expected to issue its own disciplinary action, which will likely be a multi-game suspension for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Puerto Rico's governor has signed a law that criminalizes hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries for transgender people under the age of 21. The legislation imposes severe penalties, including 15 years in prison and a $50,000 fine for medical professionals who violate the ban. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups have sharply criticized the law as cruel and inhumane, vowing to challenge its constitutionality in court. The move aligns Puerto Rico with a growing number of U.S. states that have enacted similar restrictions on transgender healthcare.</p>

          <p>This article explores the nature of charisma, defining it as a combination of influence and affability that makes individuals seem magnetic and exceptional. While some aspects of charisma may be innate, research suggests it can be cultivated through specific techniques, such as practicing emphatic nonverbal communication and powerful vocal inflections. Studies show that charisma is linked to professional success, but its effectiveness can diminish at very high levels, potentially due to an association with narcissism. The article also notes that while charisma is a powerful tool, there is no clear evidence that it directly leads to greater personal happiness.</p>

The review notes the characters' lack of traditional romantic chemistry, arguing the show intentionally portrays their relationship as a pragmatic arrangement born of mutual need rather than passionate infatuation. This "love for a cold climate" is presented as a reflection of modern anxieties, where stability can be more appealing than romance.</p>

          <p>With U.S. inflation rising again, this article analyzes the potential impact on homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs).

Given the recent uptick in the Consumer Price Index, the Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady, meaning HELOC rates are unlikely to fall soon. While HELOCs remain a more affordable borrowing option than credit cards, homeowners should be prepared for the possibility of sustained high rates or even future increases.
