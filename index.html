          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. New York City Mayor Eric Adams stated the shooter, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, was apparently targeting the NFL's headquarters located in the building. A note found on Tamura indicated he believed he had CTE, a brain injury associated with contact sports, and blamed the NFL for his condition. The attack mistakenly occurred at another company's offices after the gunman took the wrong elevator.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Sean "Diddy" Combs have formally requested that a federal judge release him from jail as he awaits his October sentencing. Combs was convicted on two counts of transportation for prostitution but acquitted on more severe sex trafficking and racketeering charges. His lawyers argue for his release on "exceptional reasons," stating the law used for his conviction has never been applied to a similar case involving a consensual "swingers lifestyle."

          <p>Boeing reported a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, fueled by a jump in sales after delivering the most aircraft since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year" for the manufacturer, which has faced numerous crises. The company's adjusted loss per share was better than analysts expected, and it reduced its cash burn substantially compared to the previous year. While challenges remain, including delays in certifying the 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models, the improved performance suggests progress in stabilizing production and operations.</p>

While this activity provided a short-term boost, the IMF warns that higher tariffs and continued economic uncertainty could still lead to weaker growth in the long run.

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported better-than-expected quarterly results but warned that new U.S. trade tariffs will create a significant financial headwind. The consumer goods giant projects a pre-tax hit of approximately $1 billion in its 2026 fiscal year due to higher costs from tariffs on imported materials and finished goods. In response, P&G plans to implement mid-single-digit price increases on about a quarter of its products. The announcement underscores the broad impact of trade policy on multinational corporations and, ultimately, on consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The full-scale removal of melted nuclear fuel from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan is being delayed by several more years. The plant's operator, TEPCO, announced that preparations for the complex task at the No. 3 reactor will now take until at least 2037. This work involves reducing extremely high radiation levels and constructing specialized facilities. This setback casts further doubt on the Japanese government's ambitious goal of completing the plant's full decommissioning by 2051, a timeline that some experts already considered highly optimistic.</p>
