          <p>The Ukrainian president expressed readiness to meet with Russia’s leader in Turkey, emphasizing the need for an immediate truce before negotiations can commence. This comes as President Trump urged Ukraine to consider a Russian proposal for direct talks, diverging from the European leaders' plan for a cease-fire. Amidst these diplomatic maneuvers, Russia effectively rejected the cease-fire deadline, proposing direct talks in Istanbul, while European leaders insisted on an unconditional truce to avoid further sanctions. The flurry of diplomatic exchanges highlights the complex and tense efforts to de-escalate the conflict, with the United States and European nations taking differing stances on the path forward, as this article discusses. Optimism remains uncertain as hostilities continue despite diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>This article argues against framing the artificial intelligence race as a competition solely between the United States and China. It warns that unbridled AI development poses immense risks, including the potential loss of human control over autonomous weapons and manipulation by non-aligned AI. The author contends that such a binary narrative neglects the agency and interests of third parties, such as other countries, multinational organizations, and corporations, whose contributions and perspectives are crucial in shaping the future of AI. The article advocates for a more inclusive and collaborative approach to AI development to mitigate potential global risks.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has announced plans to overhaul the immigration system by tightening English tests for visa applicants and extending the wait time for settlement from five to ten years. The proposed changes also include a fast-track settlement for skilled workers in sectors like nursing and AI. Critics warn that stricter language requirements could split families, while supporters argue that integration is essential. The move aims to reduce net migration and ensure that settlement is earned, not a right, as the article reports.</p>

But the Trump administration hoped Mr. Alexander would be released as soon as Monday, said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury plane described to be a “palace in the sky” being offered to the US president as a gift from Qatar’s royal family, almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism. The article details that a statement from Qatar on Sunday acknowledged it had held discussions with the US about “the possible transfer” of a plane to be used temporarily by Trump as his presidential aircraft, usurping Air Force One. But the emirate’s statement denied a final decision over the transfer had been made – or that it was a gift.</p>
