          <p>President Trump's extensive domestic policy package, which includes permanent tax cuts and significant spending changes, cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate late Saturday. The motion to proceed passed narrowly, 51-49, after considerable drama and last-minute negotiations to secure votes from Republican holdouts. Democrats are now forcing a full reading of the 940-page bill, signaling a contentious path ahead for the legislation, which faces another vote in the House and concerns over its $3.9 trillion impact on the national debt.

The author contends that despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to build a secure, independent supply chain, leaving it exposed to China's ability to weaponize these resources. The article critiques past and present administrations' efforts as insufficient and calls for a long-term, unified national strategy to treat critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power, not just commodities.

Following a series of executive orders, the Department of Energy and the EPA are preparing to eliminate or modify dozens of rules governing appliances and plumbing fixtures.

The company has since corrected the prize amounts and confirmed no incorrect payments were made.

However, President Trump has announced his intention to undo this protection, arguing it locks up land from economic use, setting up a potential legal and environmental battle. The tribe and environmental groups, who fought for decades to safeguard the region, now face the threat of a rollback.

Despite the threat, Tillis stated he is not concerned, having forewarned the president of his opposition.

The piece paints a vivid picture of the bustling, devout Catholic household with ten children where Buckley grew up. This environment, shaped by his father's strong will and the family's wealth, is presented as the foundation of his later identity as a leader of the conservative movement.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound impact of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The book traces a direct line from Buckley's intellectual leadership to key figures like Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and ultimately, Donald Trump. Tanenhaus argues that Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," effectively invented cultural politics and reshaped the Republican Party. The analysis suggests that the modern GOP, including Trump's anti-elite rhetoric, is built on the foundation Buckley created.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its flagship welfare reform bill after facing a rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that the changes, including limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants, have put the government in a "better position." The concessions were made to address concerns that the original plans would harm vulnerable and disabled people. Rebel MPs have indicated they will now likely support the bill, averting a major defeat for the prime minister.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Global Health reveals that a significant number of cancer drugs in four African nations are substandard or falsified. Researchers found that approximately 17% of tested anticancer products in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon had incorrect levels of active ingredients. This issue, which can lead to treatment failure and disease progression, stems from a combination of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products. Experts say the findings highlight a critical need for improved regulatory oversight and better screening technologies across the continent.</p>

The other two questions explore if a partner shows genuine curiosity about one's inner world and if they take accountability for their mistakes. According to the article, these elements are crucial for maintaining emotional intimacy, resolving conflict constructively, and fostering a secure, healthy partnership.</p>

An industry insider reveals that agents are incentivized to keep call times short and limit escalations, sometimes by deliberately dropping calls.

          <p>A California couple, Malana Moberg and Roland Salvato, purchased a historic chateau in Druelle Balsac, France, for approximately $835,000 and are turning it into a bed and breakfast. After selling their San Francisco apartment, they invested in the property, which dates back to the 12th century, and have so far spent over $300,000 on extensive renovations. While the business is not yet profitable, they generate some income by renting out guest rooms and hosting all-inclusive workshops. The couple sees themselves as caretakers of a piece of history, prioritizing the experience over material wealth.</p>
