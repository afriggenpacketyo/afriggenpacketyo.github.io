            <p>The FDA has issued a warning about counterfeit Ozempic circulating in the U.S. drug supply. Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy, alerted the agency to several hundred units of counterfeit Ozempic (semaglutide) injection 1 mg that were distributed outside the authorized supply chain. The FDA seized the counterfeit products and advises patients, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, and healthcare professionals to check any Ozempic products in their possession for lot number PAR0362 and serial numbers starting with 51746517. Experts warn against using cheaper, unregulated versions of the medication. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as Health and Human Services Secretary, declared autism an "epidemic" and vowed to identify environmental toxins as the cause, citing the increase in cases from 1 in 36 children in 2020 to 1 in 31 in 2022. Kennedy contrasted his approach with past research focused on genetic causes and announced new studies to investigate environmental factors. However, researchers and advocates cautioned against attributing autism to a single cause, emphasizing a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Some criticized Kennedy's remarks as stigmatizing and inaccurate, highlighting that many autistic individuals lead fulfilling lives.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's deportation of a Maryland father, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to El Salvador, despite a federal judge's order, has sparked a constitutional crisis. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, but the administration has defied the order, claiming he is a terrorist without providing evidence. This defiance has led to accusations of undermining the rule of law and raised concerns about the administration's disregard for judicial decisions. The situation is further complicated by Trump's joking remarks about deporting U.S. citizens to foreign jails.</p>

            <p>California has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration's tariffs, arguing that the president has overstepped his authority and violated the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit claims that the power to impose tariffs rests with Congress, not the president, and that the tariffs are causing significant economic harm to California. Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit, highlighting California's disproportionate impact from the tariffs and the administration's disregard for the separation of powers.</p>

            <p>Sen. Van Hollen said he hoped to meet with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. Instead, he met with Vice President Félix Ulloa on Wednesday. During that meeting, Van Hollen said that Ulloa indicated he would need a little more time to arrange an in-person prison meeting between Abrego Garcia and the senator. However, when the senator offered to return next week, he said Ulloa told him he could not promise a meeting would happen at all. Van Hollen was also denied a phone call with Abrego Garcia. Ulloa suggested that the requests be handled by the U.S. Embassy instead.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen was denied a meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, during his trip to the country. Despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., Van Hollen was unable to meet with him or speak to him by phone. The senator met with the vice president, who suggested the Trump administration is paying El Salvador to keep Abrego Garcia detained.

This isn't the first public warning about counterfeit Ozempic. In 2023, the FDA alerted the public to thousands of counterfeit doses that had gotten into circulation.</p>
