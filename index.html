The husband, William Shaheen, was initially subjected to additional scrutiny under TSA's "Quiet Skies" program, which monitors individuals not suspected of crimes. After Sen. Jeanne Shaheen spoke with the TSA administrator, her husband was placed on a "secure flight exclusion list," exempting him from future advanced screening. This incident raises concerns about political interference in security protocols. The circumstances surrounding the initial flagging and subsequent removal remain unclear.

          <p>The family of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Colorado fire attack, has been taken into custody by federal immigration agents. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the family could be deported soon. Authorities are investigating whether Soliman's family knew about or supported Sunday's attack.

          <p>More than 100 of Britain's renowned athletes have written an open letter to Prime Minister Keir Starmer urging the government to back London's bid to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships. The bid proposal would see the World Championships held at London Stadium. It requires a "one-off injection of public funding in 2028" with the promise of "Â£400m in national economic impact". The 2029 bid process is due to begin this summer. There is a high potential for stability.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer stated that President Donald Trump's actions draw short sellers and prompt investors to make misguided moves. Cramer noted that the averages have been opening down as of late. He claimed that many hedge funds have started to heavily short stocks like Nvidia or CoreWeave, believing they can make money by "betting against stocks." Cramer suggested Trump has "almost singlehandedly revived the short selling business." The overall sentiment of the article is stable. (not investment advice)</p>
