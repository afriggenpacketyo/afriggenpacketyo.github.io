          <p>The UK government is preparing to announce its spending plans for the next four years, and the BBC interviewed several residents with varying income levels about their priorities. A young delivery driver earning Â£850 a month wants better job opportunities for young people, while a couple earning Â£52,500 seeks more childcare support. Another couple with a Â£71,000 income advocates for more apprenticeships and lower rail fares, and a woman living on Â£700 a month through Universal Credit emphasizes the need for stronger welfare support. A well-off GP earning Â£96,000 suggests subsidizing fresh produce, while a pensioner living on Â£20,000 a year believes the government should focus on saving money. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eurostar is planning to introduce direct train services from London to Frankfurt and Geneva by the early 2030s, investing around â‚¬2 billion in a new fleet of up to 50 trains. The firm anticipates travel times of approximately five hours to Frankfurt and five hours and 20 minutes to Geneva. However, the expansion hinges on securing sufficient depot space in east London, which is also being sought by rival companies. The Office of Rail and Road is currently reviewing proposals to determine how the depot space will be allocated, a decision that could significantly impact Eurostar's expansion plans. The company hopes to provide additional options for passengers traveling across Europe.</p>

          <p>Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has been deported from Israel after being detained when Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound aid boat. Thunberg agreed to be deported and was flown to France, while five other French citizens on the boat refused deportation and face judicial proceedings. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition condemned the detentions and demanded the release of all activists and the return of the aid. Israeli authorities stated the aid, including baby formula and medicine, would be transferred to Gaza through established humanitarian channels. The incident has raised tensions regarding the Israeli blockade of Gaza and international efforts to deliver aid. </p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has proposed selling U.S.-made cars in Japan through its domestic dealership network to support trade negotiations between Japan and the United States. Chairman Akio Toyoda informed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Toyota's willingness to sell vehicles manufactured by U.S. automakers through its extensive network of over 4,000 stores in Japan. This proposal aims to help narrow the U.S. trade deficit, a key concern for President Donald Trump, and potentially ease tariff pressures. Japan has been affected by Trump's tariffs on automobiles and is seeking concessions through ongoing ministerial-level talks. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Republicans consider legislation that would cut billions from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a new poll indicates that nearly half of adults enrolled in ACA health plans identify as Republicans. The legislation, if enacted without extending tax credits, could cause approximately 15 million people to lose health insurance. Experts suggest that the higher enrollment of Republicans in ACA plans may be due to their greater likelihood of being self-employed and residing in states that did not expand Medicaid. The potential cuts could disproportionately affect Republican constituents who rely on these programs for healthcare coverage. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration cannot enforce executive orders that would block grant funding to LGBTQ+ groups based on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies or acknowledgement of transgender individuals. Judge Jon Tigar stated that the executive orders reflected an effort to censor constitutionally protected speech and services. The ruling favored pro-LGBTQ+ nonprofits who argued that the orders violated the Constitution. Lawyers for the government argued that the president is permitted to align government funding with his policies, but the judge's order will remain in effect while the legal case continues, though an appeal is likely. </p>

          <p>The United States is risking its soft power by potentially alienating Chinese students through restrictive visa policies, even as it resumes processing student and exchange visitor visas. While President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. loves to have Chinese students, the White House has imposed visa restrictions that send mixed messages. These restrictions have particularly impacted Chinese students, who make up a significant portion of international enrollment at universities like Harvard. The situation raises concerns about the future of academic and cultural exchange between the two countries. </p>

          <p>Paramount Global is set to reduce its U.S.-based workforce by 3.5%, impacting several hundred employees, as part of ongoing cost-cutting efforts. The layoffs are a response to the decline of traditional pay-TV and macroeconomic challenges. This move follows a previous reduction of 15% in the U.S. workforce last August, and the company is also seeking regulatory approval for its merger with Skydance Media. The cuts are deemed necessary to address the current environment and better position Paramount for future success, with potential impacts to the workforce outside the U.S. over time. </p>

          <p>Republicans often discuss the deficit and federal spending, but the United States collects less money as a share of GDP than comparable countries. Tax cuts under George W. Bush and Donald Trump have contributed significantly to the current deficit, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimating that 37 percent of the deficit can be attributed to these tax cuts. The Republican Party's anti-tax stance is facing challenges due to the party's shifting composition and the distributional impact of tax-cutting measures. Raising revenue, alongside spending cuts, is essential for addressing the government's financial challenges (not investment advice).</p>
