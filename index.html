          <p>A passenger train derailed in the Bryansk region of Russia, near the Ukrainian border, after a bridge collapsed due to an explosion, resulting in at least seven fatalities and dozens of injuries. The incident occurred on a route connecting Klimov to Moscow, carrying 388 passengers. Hours later, a second bridge collapsed in the Kursk region, with Russian investigators classifying both incidents as acts of terrorism. Since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia's border regions have experienced shelling, drone strikes, and covert raids. The event is under investigation.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs are preparing for the summer transfer window, but many face limitations on spending due to Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).

          <p>A recent study across 30 European countries indicates that parents, compared to childfree individuals, report a greater sense of meaning in their lives but experience lower life satisfaction. This disparity is particularly pronounced for mothers, with life satisfaction levels influenced by factors such as living situation and family policy. Scandinavian countries show less difference in satisfaction between parents and non-parents, attributed to supportive family policies and societal attitudes that view children as a shared community responsibility.

          <p>Public debate is intensifying in China over the reinstatement and promotion of officials disciplined for misconduct, exemplified by the case of a Communist Party cadre punished for a drinking spree now considered for promotion. While state media portrays such cases as rehabilitation successes, the public expresses frustration over officials being rewarded for past misdeeds. This trend reflects Beijing's effort to incentivize officials amid an anti-corruption campaign and economic challenges, but it faces significant public disapproval.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals, with experts linking this trend to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. High food price inflation reduces citizens' purchasing power, leading to increased consumption of cheap, processed foods. The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but critics argue it stigmatizes individuals and overlooks broader economic issues. Experts advocate for a nationwide free school meal program and stricter regulations on unhealthy food marketing.</p>
