Following the announcement, Palo Alto's stock declined, while CyberArk's experienced volatility. This acquisition marks Palo Alto's strategic entry into the identity security market, aiming to enhance its offerings and leverage its scale to accelerate CyberArk's platform, especially in the context of advancing AI threats (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declared it will impose a 25% tariff on India starting August 1, citing unfair trade policies and India's military and energy trade with Russia. An additional, unspecified "penalty" was also announced for these actions. President Trump has consistently aimed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, a motive questioned by many economists who highlight the benefits of lower-cost imports. This move is part of a broader, aggressive trade strategy that includes threatening secondary tariffs on countries purchasing Russian energy, escalating global economic tensions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old man, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, has been found guilty of assaulting two female police officers during a violent disturbance at Manchester Airport in July of last year. The court heard that one officer suffered a broken nose in the attack, which was captured on CCTV. Amaaz was also convicted of assaulting a member of the public earlier the same day.

          <p>Senate Democrats are utilizing a rarely used 1928 law, known as the "Rule of Five," to compel the Justice Department to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein. This law allows five members of the Senate's government affairs committee to request information from a federal agency without the chairman's approval. The move comes amid ongoing controversy and calls for transparency after a DOJ internal review found no "client list." Democrats argue President Trump has broken his promise to release the files, while they aim to ensure victim privacy is protected in the document release.</p>

          <p>This article examines President Trump's persistent campaign to pressure Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell into cutting interest rates, a move that flouts historical norms of central-bank independence. It argues that such political interference is precisely why the Fed was designed to be independent, as prioritizing short-term political gains over long-term inflation control can lead to economic instability, referencing the Nixon era as a cautionary tale. The analysis suggests that if Trump were to succeed in ousting Powell, the resulting market chaos would likely lead to higher interest rates, the opposite of his desired outcome.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy grew at an annual pace of 3% in the second quarter, rebounding more strongly than expected after shrinking in the first three months of the year.

In an interview, Lula urged Trump to avoid a "lose-lose" trade war and emphasized that Brazil will negotiate as a sovereign nation.

          <p>As the Ethereum network celebrates its tenth anniversary, it is experiencing a resurgence in institutional interest despite recent struggles. The article attributes this renewed optimism to new U.S. crypto legislation, the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, and a boom in corporate adoption. While Ethereum's native token, ETH, has underperformed compared to its 2021 peak, analysts suggest it is now entering an institutional adoption phase similar to Bitcoin's trajectory from 2019 to 2024. The focus is shifting from speculative trends to the tokenization of real-world assets on its decentralized platform (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The BBC has announced it will once again partner with the Met Office, the UK's national weather service, for its weather forecasts. This move restores a long-standing relationship that ended in 2017 when the BBC switched to a commercial provider, DTN. The new partnership aims to deliver the most trusted and accurate weather information, combining the BBC's journalism with the Met Office's scientific intelligence. The collaboration is seen as particularly important for communicating information about the UK's changing climate and helping audiences make informed decisions about weather events.</p>

          <p>The state of Minnesota has activated the National Guard's cyber protection unit to assist the city of St. Paul after it was hit by a major "digital attack." The city's mayor described the incident as deliberate and coordinated, forcing a full shutdown of municipal information systems as a defensive measure. This has led to widespread disruptions, including wifi outages and impacts on city libraries, though emergency services remain operational. The city is working with the FBI and private cybersecurity firms to investigate the breach and determine the extent of any data theft.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting another quarter of declining same-store sales and missing earnings expectations, Wall Street analysts are finding positive signs in Starbucks' recovery efforts. Executives noted that customer traffic improved each month during the quarter, with notable growth among non-loyalty program members, a key demographic. CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" strategy, which includes service improvements and new menu innovations, is seen as gaining traction. However, investor sentiment remains mixed, as the company's stock fell slightly following the report, indicating the turnaround is taking longer than some had hoped.</p>

          <p>This article re-examines the story of Hansie Cronje, the celebrated South African cricket captain whose career ended in a 2000 match-fixing scandal. Cronje, once a national hero and symbol of post-apartheid unity, confessed to taking money from bookmakers, leading to a lifetime ban from the sport. The piece explores the duality of his character: a charismatic leader with a darker, obsessive relationship with money. His sudden death in a 2002 plane crash cut short any chance for redemption and left a complex legacy, with opinions divided on whether he was a tragic, flawed figure or a manipulative villain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This podcast transcript features historian Doug Irwin explaining the detrimental effects of President Trump's tariff policies. The analysis argues that tariffs, presented as a tool to boost domestic manufacturing, actually harm it by increasing the cost of inputs and provoking foreign retaliation, thus shrinking exports. Irwin refutes historical arguments favoring protectionism, stating tariffs are a regressive tax that hurts lower-income households most and fosters political corruption. The piece concludes that these policies are weakening the U.S. economy, alienating crucial allies, and redistributing the tax burden unfairly (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An NPR journalist shares a personal reflection from a recent visit to Khartoum, the war-torn capital of Sudan. The city, recaptured by the army after two years of brutal civil war, is described as a shell of its former self. Despite the widespread destruction and personal loss suffered by the remaining residents, the author was consistently met with irrepressible hospitality. In homes on the verge of collapse, survivors who had lost everything still insisted on the ritual of offering their guests Sudanese coffee and tea, a stubborn and moving act of kindness in the face of utter devastation.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad, a controversial FDA official and vocal critic of the agency's COVID-19 booster authorizations, has left his position. Appointed under the Trump administration, Prasad served as director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. During his brief tenure, the FDA limited COVID vaccine recommendations for younger, healthy individuals, requiring more clinical data. His departure follows a social media campaign against him by a right-wing influencer highlighting his past support for Democrats, though HHS stated he left to avoid being a "distraction" and to spend more time with his family.</p>

          <p>In a personal and powerful op-ed, Yuli Novak, the leader of the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem, asserts that the Israeli state is committing genocide in Gaza. Novak describes the internal struggle of confronting this reality, citing official Israeli rhetoric, mass killings, engineered starvation, and the destruction of Gaza as evidence. The article references a new B'Tselem report detailing the state's actions and tracing them to decades of occupation and dehumanization, arguing that the horrific Hamas attack on October 7 was a catalyst. Novak concludes that recognizing this truth is a moral obligation to stop the violence.</p>
