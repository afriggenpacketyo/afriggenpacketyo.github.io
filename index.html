        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jewish funeral rituals, focused on eternal memory among the living rather than the afterlife, prioritize a quick and simple burial in a plain casket or shroud. Practices like ritual bathing (Taharah), the K'riah garment-tearing, and mourners helping with burial are central. Post-burial, a seven-day Shiva period involves abstaining from grooming and entertainment, with community visits offering support. The Mourner's Kaddish, an ancient Aramaic prayer, is recited with a minyan, reinforcing faith and communal memory.</p>

          <p>Former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga has died in India at age 80 from cardiac arrest, prompting a seven-day national mourning period and a state funeral. President William Ruto hailed him as a "beacon of courage" and "father of our democracy." A towering figure in Kenyan politics, Odinga ran for president five times, often disputing results, and played a key role in resolving the 2007 post-election violence by becoming prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. His death leaves a significant void, remembered for his unwavering fight for democratic freedoms and human rights.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is re-examining Louisiana's congressional map for a second time, with significant implications for the Voting Rights Act's Section 2. The case questions whether drawing a second majority-minority district to remedy a likely Section 2 violation unconstitutionally relies on race. Louisiana Republicans now argue against race consideration in redistricting, while Black voters and rights groups contend Section 2 is crucial to combat ongoing discrimination. A decision could redefine the constitutionality and future application of the landmark voting rights law.</p>

          <p>A proposed $3.6 billion AI data center, Project Blue, outside Tucson, Arizona, faces strong community opposition due to its massive water and electricity demands in a desert region.

Despite developers' claims of being "water positive," ecologists argue it would deplete groundwater, leading to the city council unanimously halting discussions.

          <p>U.S. officials claim to have conducted multiple strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea, alleging they originated from Venezuela and were operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel. However, legal experts question the legality of these actions under international and maritime law, citing concerns about the use of lethal force without clear evidence of immediate threat or an armed conflict. The Trump administration reportedly determined it was in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, but critics argue this stretches the meaning of self-defense. Congress recently defeated a resolution to require approval for further attacks.</p>

Despite previous promises not to hike major taxes like income tax or VAT, the economic reality necessitates difficult choices.

          <p>The U.S. government entered a shutdown after President Trump and congressional Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on federal funding. This marks the latest in a series of government shutdowns, which have become more frequent since 1980 when legal opinions mandated agencies cease operations without funding. Historically, shutdowns have ranged from one day to 34 days, often stemming from disagreements over spending or policy issues like the Affordable Care Act or border wall funding. The current impasse, centered on health care tax credits, is expected to impact hundreds of thousands of federal workers.</p>
