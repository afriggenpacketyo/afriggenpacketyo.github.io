          <p>Nike announced that it anticipates a potential $1 billion increase in costs for the current fiscal year due to U.S. tariffs, a challenge complicating its ongoing business turnaround. The company plans to mitigate this impact by adjusting its supply chain, reducing its manufacturing presence in China, and implementing price increases. Despite a significant 86% drop in quarterly profits driven by inventory clear-outs and a shift back to wholesale, Nike's earnings beat Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to rise. The company is also realigning its focus back to sports performance and expanding its wholesale partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JosÃ© Adolfo MacÃ­as, the infamous Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been recaptured in the city of Manta after more than a year on the run. MacÃ­as, who leads the "Los Choneros" gang and is wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges, escaped from a high-security prison in early 2024. His escape triggered a wave of violence across Ecuador, leading the government to declare a state of emergency. President Daniel Noboa announced the capture and stated that the government is awaiting a U.S. response regarding his potential extradition.</p>

          <p>A classified briefing for U.S. senators on the recent American strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities has resulted in starkly partisan divisions over the mission's success. Following the briefing by top intelligence and national security officials, some Republican senators supported President Trump's claim of "total obliteration," stating the program was set back by years. However, several key Democrats expressed skepticism, arguing that Trump was misleading the public and that Iran retains significant nuclear capabilities. They criticized the administration for a lack of a coherent long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>

His claims stand in stark contrast to U.S. and Israeli assessments that Iran's nuclear program was severely damaged.

          <p>A newly licensed drug, leniolisib, is offering hope for a potential cure for Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS), an ultra-rare inherited immune disorder. A 19-year-old from Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive the treatment, which was developed after researchers identified the faulty gene in her family. The condition, which can be fatal, disrupts the immune system's ability to fight infections. The approval of the drug, which works by targeting a specific overactive enzyme, marks a major breakthrough, moving from disease discovery to an NHS-approved treatment in just 12 years.</p>
