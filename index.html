          <p>A multi-agency manhunt is underway for Michael Paul Brown, an Army veteran suspected of killing four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana. The suspect allegedly opened fire before fleeing, and while his vehicle has been located, he remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous. Authorities are concentrating their search in the mountainous region west of the small town, where public records show the suspect lived next to the bar. The community is on high alert following the incident, which adds to the nation's growing number of mass shootings in 2025.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a July jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected hiring and significant downward revisions for previous months. Trump alleged the numbers were manipulated for political purposes, a claim made without evidence. The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and some lawmakers, who argue it undermines the integrity of a nonpartisan federal agency and could destabilize markets that rely on unbiased economic data. A deputy commissioner will serve as the acting head of the agency. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's finding that the Trump administration's sweeps appeared to be based on race or language. The ruling requires federal agents to have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals and prohibits basing arrests solely on factors like ethnicity or speaking Spanish. While the administration criticized the decision as judicial overreach, immigrant advocacy groups praised it as a crucial protection of constitutional rights against indiscriminate enforcement actions that have instilled fear in local communities.</p>

The probe follows allegations from Republican Senator Tom Cotton that Smith engaged in illegal political activity by attempting to rush the trials against Trump before the election. Smith, who was appointed by the previous administration to oversee investigations into Trump's handling of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 election, resigned from his post in January.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile have found the remains of one of the five miners who were trapped following a partial collapse on Thursday. The collapse was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude seismic event, which also resulted in another fatality outside the mine. Over 100 rescuers are involved in the intensive search operation, which extends deep underground, while normal mining operations have been suspended.

The duo is asking their reported 600,000 registered supporters to help choose a name, which must be approved by the Electoral Commission before they can field candidates. Experts note that a party's name is a crucial part of its brand identity in the modern digital age, where traditional party structures have eroded.

Scientists warn that thawing permafrost, the "glue" holding mountains together, is leading to more frequent and unpredictable landslides, threatening numerous communities. The immense cost of protecting and rebuilding these villages has sparked a national debate in Switzerland about whether some alpine communities should be abandoned.

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30 million, just two years into his five-year contract. This development comes as the club continues to pursue RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko, whose arrival would marginalize Hojlund's role on the team. Although Hojlund recently expressed his desire to stay at Old Trafford, the club may need to sell players to comply with Premier League financial regulations. A sale at this price would represent a book loss for United on their initial investment in the player. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was sent from Australia in 1943 as a diplomatic gift but died just before arriving in the UK. For decades, it was rumored that the creature died from shell-shock caused by a nearby German U-boat attack. However, recent archival research by students has revealed that the platypus likely died from overheating, as logbooks showed water temperatures on the ship rose well above the safe threshold for the species.</p>

          <p>Rahaman Ali, the younger brother of boxing legend Muhammad Ali and a former heavyweight boxer himself, has passed away at the age of 82. Born Rudolph Arnett Clay, he followed his older brother into boxing and was known as one of Muhammad's most steadfast supporters throughout his career, often traveling and training with him. After retiring from the ring, Rahaman authored two books about his life and his famous brother. The Muhammad Ali Center in their hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, remembered him as an integral part of Muhammad's story and a true example of brotherly support.</p>

Shayna, who was a child when her father died, began corresponding with Berkowitz to understand this part of her family's history.

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly criticized his players' mentality, effort, and ego following a 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening league match. An audibly disappointed Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and that the issue was not tactical but a "mentality problem." He lambasted the performance, suggesting some players needed to "drop their ego" and reverted to type under pressure. The unusually harsh public comments after the first game of the season drew attention from pundits, who noted it was an extreme move for a new manager.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes competition is underway at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters are battling for a single NFL contract worth nearly $3 million. Incumbent punter Matt Hayball, a former Geelong VFL player, is facing a challenge from rookie James Burnip, who recently finished his career at the University of Alabama. Both athletes are graduates of the ProKick Australia academy. The situation highlights the cutthroat nature of the NFL, where only one will secure the lucrative roster spot by the final cuts, leaving the other unemployed.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his efforts were not enough as the Dodgers lost 4-0 to the Tampa Bay Rays. Snell's only blemishes were two home runs hit by Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite the loss, Snell's sharp return, characterized by strong command and 19 swing-and-misses, offered a promising sign for the Dodgers' late-season starting rotation.</p>

          <p>South African police have arrested nearly 1,000 undocumented migrants who were working illegally at the Sheba Gold Mine in the country's northeast. The arrests were part of a week-long operation targeting illegal mining, a widespread issue in South Africa, which has thousands of abandoned mines. The individuals, many from neighboring countries and some potentially underage, will face charges for breaking immigration laws and possibly for illegal mining. The mine's owner welcomed the police action, stating that such illicit activities would not be tolerated on their property.</p>

Aid agencies report that restrictions and the breakdown of order have made safe distribution nearly impossible, with most aid being looted. The crisis prompted a visit from U.S. officials, but the violence underscores the catastrophic humanitarian situation unfolding in Gaza.</p>

          <p>With former Vice President Kamala Harris announcing she will not run for governor of California, the race has been thrown wide open with no obvious front-runner. Candidates like former Rep. Katie Porter and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra are now vying to establish momentum, but political observers note that none currently possess statewide name recognition. The absence of Harris, who had frozen fundraising and planning for other hopefuls, means the campaign is effectively resetting. Experts suggest that factors like fundraising, key endorsements, and the ability to build a profile will now be crucial in the wide-open field.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has surged to over €3,200, creating a severe financial burden for many retirees whose average pensions are much lower. The dramatic increase is attributed to rising wages for care staff and an increase in staffing levels, with residents now paying for care, room, board, and even training costs. With a growing elderly population and the current long-term care insurance system on the verge of collapse, Germany's Health Minister and economists are calling for urgent reforms to address the widening gap between care costs and what seniors can afford.
