          <p>Federal and state officials are responding to catastrophic flooding in Central Texas, where the death toll has tragically climbed to 128. President Trump, visiting the area, praised the efforts of first responders and dismissed criticism regarding the timeliness of warning alerts. First Lady Melania Trump expressed her sympathies for the families who lost loved ones, particularly highlighting the young victims from a flooded summer camp. The focus remains on search and rescue operations as many people are still unaccounted for in the disaster zone.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the Air India crash that killed 260 people indicates the fuel supply to both engines was cut off moments after takeoff. The report notes that cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why they had activated the cutoff switches, with the other pilot denying they had done so. Although fuel flow was restored seconds later, it was too late to prevent the aircraft from crashing into a building. The crash killed everyone on board except for one survivor, as well as several people on the ground.</p>

          <p>One year after an assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is implementing significant security upgrades. The agency has introduced military-grade drones for improved aerial surveillance and mobile command posts to ensure seamless communication with local law enforcement, addressing key failures from the 2024 incident. These changes follow an internal investigation that led to the suspension of six personnel. Officials state the new technology is designed to prevent a repeat of the attack, which left one person dead and others injured.</p>

The diversion resulted in all 267 passengers spending the night in Maine, as the flight crew timed out and a relief crew had to be brought in. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the two individuals involved in the altercation did not face criminal charges but were processed for expedited removal to their home countries.

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by testing the integration of crewed fighter jets with uncrewed "loyal wingman" drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15E each controlled two XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time coordination in a combat training scenario. This program, led by the Air Force Research Laboratory, is a key part of the race with China to achieve air dominance through advanced human-machine teaming. The concept involves uncrewed aircraft being directed by pilots in crewed fighters to extend their tactical reach.</p>

          <p>An off-duty U.S. Border Patrol agent, Isaiah Hodgson, has been charged with multiple offenses, including resisting arrest and battery on a police officer, following an incident in Long Beach, California.

          <p>Philanthropist Bill Gates has strongly criticized the Trump administration's decision to cut funding and effectively dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Gates warned that the cuts are having "devastating effects" and have already led to preventable deaths and interruptions in the supply of critical medicines, such as HIV medication for children in Africa. He emphasized that it is not too late for the administration to reverse its course on international aid. The move to absorb USAID's functions into the State Department has been a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, briefly surpassing $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also supported by a wave of short liquidations and broader market expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. This recent price action continues a strong trend for the cryptocurrency, which has seen ETF inflows of nearly $16 billion since mid-April. (not investment advice)</p>
