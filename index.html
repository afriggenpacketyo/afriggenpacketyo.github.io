          <p>President Trump has arrived in Saudi Arabia, marking the first stop on his tour of the Gulf. He aims to sign deals worth over $1 trillion, focusing on investments in AI, energy, and arms purchases. The Saudi royals are expected to offer Trump lavish hospitality, mirroring his first presidential visit. Trump's trip is under scrutiny due to his family's financial interests, including pending real estate, cryptocurrency, and golf deals with Saudi-owned firms and Gulf governments. The Qatari royal family is also donating a luxury Boeing 747-8 for Trump's use as a presidential plane, potentially raising ethical concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has banned the far-right group "Kingdom of Germany," accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state." Police conducted raids in seven German states, arresting key members, including the group's self-declared monarch, Peter Fitzek. Dobrindt stated the group undermines the rule of law and uses antisemitic conspiracy narratives. The 'Kingdom of Germany' reportedly has around 6,000 members who deny the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic. The movement has come under increased scrutiny due to fears of its violent potential, including a 2022 plot to overthrow the government.</p>

          <p>Japanese auto giant Honda reported a 76% plunge in operating profit for the fourth quarter, missing earnings estimates due to trade tensions with the U.S. and unfavorable currency movements.

Honda expects currency moves to further push down profits by 452 billion yen.

          <p>Addiction experts warn that proposed cuts to addiction funding by Congress will lead to more overdose deaths. A letter signed by over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers warns of "dire consequences" if funding for key agencies is reduced. The letter notes that fatal overdoses dropped in 2024 due to sustained financial investment. Experts are concerned that addiction recovery programs in rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods will be hit especially hard, and research efforts tracking new synthetic street drugs could be defunded.</p>

The senators also typically come from big political families, or are celebrities in their own right – many candidates come from a media or showbiz background.
