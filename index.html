          <p>A nine-year-old Canadian girl, initially reported as kidnapped in upstate New York, was tragically found dead, prompting police to investigate her father for inconsistencies in his story. The father's report had triggered an Amber Alert and a massive search involving multiple law enforcement agencies. However, as the investigation progressed, authorities determined that an abduction likely did not occur and that there was no ongoing threat to the public. The focus of the investigation has now shifted to the father's conflicting account of the events leading to his daughter's death.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based company SpinQ predicts that quantum computing will achieve a threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the company produces both small-scale educational quantum computers and more powerful industrial-grade superconducting systems, which it sells to over 50 countries. The founder and CEO, Xiang Jingen, compares the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, acknowledging that significant development is still required before the technology becomes broadly applicable. The company is positioning itself at the forefront of this emerging field.</p>

          <p>Ellen DeGeneres stated that her move to the United Kingdom with her wife, Portia de Rossi, was made permanent following Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election. The couple sold their Montecito estate and now resides on a farmhouse in the English countryside, a move DeGeneres says was prompted by the election results. She has expressed her love for the simpler, polite, and clean way of life in the U.K. The article also notes her public support for fellow comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who also left the U.S. after the election.</p>

          <h2>Public Support for Trump's Deportation Program Declines Amid Economic Concerns, Poll Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the policy. This shift is linked to perceptions that the program is deporting more people than expected and not just focusing on dangerous criminals. The survey also highlights that most Americans want the administration to prioritize lowering prices over other issues like tariffs or spending cuts. Overall approval for the president has also incrementally declined, reflecting growing public doubt outside of his core political base.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to stay in his role despite his ruling coalition losing its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election result is a significant blow, reflecting voter frustration over rising prices, a cost-of-living crisis, and recent political scandals. This loss of majority control undermines the coalition's influence and could lead to political instability, especially during critical trade negotiations with the United States. Analysts note that previous leaders who lost the upper house majority have typically resigned shortly after.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has stated that online abuse directed at players is getting worse as the popularity of women's football grows. Her comments came after her teammate, Jess Carter, revealed she had received a significant amount of racist abuse during the Euro 2025 tournament, prompting a police investigation. Bronze highlighted that while the game's growth brings more fans, it also attracts more critics and abusers. She called for greater accountability from social media platforms and affirmed the team's commitment to using its voice to push for change.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to create a new water ombudsman to serve as a single point of contact for consumer complaints against water companies. This new consumer champion will have legal powers to tackle issues such as leaky pipes, incorrect bills, and sewage discharges. The move is part of a wider effort to reform the water industry, which has faced intense public criticism over rising bills and environmental pollution. The plan aims to increase accountability and provide a more robust system for resolving disputes, similar to what exists for other utilities.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass characterized the Trump administration's immigration enforcement as a "reign of terror" that has spread fear throughout the city. She described raids by masked federal agents in unmarked cars, which have led many residents, including legal citizens, to be afraid to leave their homes. Bass criticized the tactics as punitive and argued that the resulting fear has harmed the city's workforce and culture. While denouncing the immigration policies, she expressed a continued willingness to work with the White House on other critical issues.</p>
