          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of high-stakes trade negotiations aimed at alleviating tensions arising from the existing trade war. The talks carry significant implications for the global economy, which has been destabilized by tariffs imposed by both nations, disrupting supply chains and pressuring businesses to increase prices. While President Trump has expressed openness to lowering tariffs, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick resolution, even with potential tariff reductions, as the overall effective tariff rate would still be significantly higher than before Trump's election. This article highlights the ongoing complexities and potential impacts of the U.S.-China trade dispute.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has ignited widespread anger and unified Iranians across political and ideological divides. The name Persian Gulf has historical roots dating back to ancient Persia, and Iranians view it as integral to their national and cultural identity. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names currently mandates the use of the Persian Gulf for official U.S. business, but Trump has the power to order changes to geographical names as they are used in the United States. This article examines the history and cultural significance of the Persian Gulf and the reactions to Trump's suggestion.</p>

The European Union prioritizes hormone-free, grass-fed products, reflecting a preference for smaller family operations and traditional farming methods. While trade officials are willing to make concessions to avert a trade war, they are steadfast in maintaining strict health and safety standards, particularly regarding hormone-treated beef and acid-washed chicken.

          <p>A Chinese research team has developed a novel algorithm that allows first-person-view (FPV) drones to execute autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing human capabilities in demanding flight missions. This breakthrough, published in Science Robotics, leverages nature's aerial acrobatics, seen in species like sparrowhawks and ravens, to redefine traditional drone flight paradigms. The algorithm enables drones to rapidly adjust speed and direction, performing vertical or inverted flights to navigate obstacles and enhance performance. Gao Fei from Zhejiang University emphasized that this biological wisdom transforms high-risk maneuvers into high-survival rewards, unlocking the full potential of drone flight.</p>
