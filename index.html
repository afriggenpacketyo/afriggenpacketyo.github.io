          <p>The price of Bitcoin has surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, as the cryptocurrency continues its strong rally. This significant price movement is being driven by substantial capital inflows into recently approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, these financial products attracted over $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional and retail investor interest in the digital asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing economists' expectations, largely due to strong demand from non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. A temporary tariff truce with the United States also helped slow the decline in shipments to America. Concurrently, imports saw their first increase of the year, signaling a potential stabilization in domestic demand amid ongoing global trade tensions and negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A notable trend is emerging in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly opting for technology-centric fields like information and communications technology and vehicle engineering. This shift away from previously popular majors such as international trade reflects a broader, state-driven national priority to bolster technological capabilities. The trend is largely influenced by China's goal of achieving greater self-reliance amid intensified technological competition with the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to discuss security issues, including a new strategy for arming Ukraine. The emerging plan involves the U.S. selling weapons to its European allies, who would then transfer the military equipment to Ukraine. This approach is being considered as a faster way to supply Kyiv while also benefiting U.S. defense manufacturers, and it comes as Congress weighs further sanctions against Russia.</p>

A new opposition figure, Peter Magyar, is gaining significant traction by capitalizing on widespread public discontent with corruption, a stagnating economy, and deteriorating public services. This internal pressure is creating cracks in Orban's long-held grip on power.</p>
