          <p>A sweeping tax and spending bill, aiming to extend tax cuts from President Donald Trump's first term, advanced through a key House committee despite internal Republican conflict. The bill includes provisions to end taxes on tips and increase military and border spending, funded partly by cuts to Medicaid and green subsidies. While some conservatives seek deeper cuts and stricter Medicaid work requirements, moderates are unhappy with the bill's local tax deduction cap. Analysts estimate the bill could add $3-5 trillion to the national debt, already exceeding $35 trillion, raising concerns among ratings firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in the trade war between China and the United States, tensions have resurfaced following a US ban on Huawei Technologies' Ascend AI chips. China accused the US of "long-arm jurisdiction" and suppressing its AI industry, while the US cited national security concerns. Analysts suggest this ban signals an expansion of the conflict beyond tariffs, with the US tightening tech restrictions on China. Beijing is actively countering US restrictions with its own export controls and a push for self-reliance in technology.</p>

          <p>American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog, has sued the Trump administration for allegedly withholding records regarding President Trump's actions against Harvard University, including efforts to revoke its tax-exempt status. The lawsuit seeks to compel the IRS, Treasury Department, and Education Department to release communication records related to these actions, claiming potential political interference by the president in agency operations. American Oversight argues that the documents could reveal Trump using the federal government to punish critics, potentially setting a precedent affecting other universities and nonprofits.

          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated he prefers only one interest rate cut this year, balancing potential inflation pressures with recession worries. Bostic noted that tariffs have been larger than anticipated, potentially impacting inflation expectations. He expressed concern about inflation, highlighting the movement of expectations in a "troublesome way," which could complicate the Fed's mandate to support stable prices and maximum employment. The tariff landscape has shifted since President Donald Trump took office, with a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries and a separate truce with China, though tariffs remain higher than pre-Trump levels.

According to a Defense Department memo, service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria have until June 6 to begin the voluntary separation process.

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a landmark agreement aimed at enhancing security cooperation and reducing trade barriers introduced by Brexit. The deal includes provisions for British citizens to use electronic gates in Europe, easier pet travel, and the resumption of British meat product sales in the EU. A key aspect involves allowing European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038, in exchange for reduced trade barriers for British food products. The agreement also includes plans for a "youth experience" program to facilitate travel and work opportunities for young Europeans in Britain and vice versa.</p>

          <p>A recent Microsoft report indicates that employees are interrupted every two minutes during the 9-to-5 workday by meetings, emails, and other notifications, impacting their productivity. Experts recommend methods for creating dedicated quiet time to focus on work, such as scheduling blocks of time on the calendar, treating them like important meetings, and minimizing distractions. It's also important to identify the most productive times of day and create a suitable workspace, whether it's a quiet room at work or a designated area at home, to maximize concentration.</p>

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted EU leaders in London, securing deals aimed at strengthening defense and trade ties. An agreement on fisheries grants EU fishermen access to British waters for 12 years, while the EU eases customs checks on food imports and exports. Additionally, a new defense and security pact aims to involve the UK defense industry in a €150 billion defense fund established by the EU.</p>

          <p>Stock futures fell after Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about widening federal deficits and increasing debt costs. The downgrade, following similar actions by Standard & Poor's and Fitch, prompted a decline in S&P 500 futures, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, and Nasdaq Composite futures. Analysts noted that while the downgrade was anticipated, it served as a reminder of the serious fiscal challenges facing the U.S., in addition to existing tariff concerns. Moody's forecast that federal deficits will widen to almost 9% of the U.S. economy by 2035, driven by higher interest payments on debt, growing entitlement spending and low revenue generation from taxes.

          <p>President Trump’s tariffs on auto parts are causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, a key region for manufacturing components for vehicles destined for the United States. Union officials express concern that the tariffs could turn Windsor into a "ghost town" due to the impact on smaller auto-parts plants. Estimates suggest that thousands of parts workers have been laid off and, in some cases, recalled since the start of U.S. tariffs. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs and their complex regulations is creating challenges for small-parts makers, threatening the industry's stability.</p>

The decision follows a recent U.S. credit rating downgrade by Moody's and an overbought signal from the S&P Short Range Oscillator. The Investing Club believes GE Vernova will benefit from increased investment in reliable power and grid infrastructure, driven by data center expansion, manufacturing activity, and the rise of electric vehicles. Additionally, the company is expected to benefit from trade deals and Saudi Arabia's commitment to purchase $14 billion worth of gas turbines and energy solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health officials are urging vigilance against bird flu, but experts are puzzled by the absence of new human cases in recent months. Possible explanations include weakened testing efforts due to government cuts, fear among immigrant farm workers to come forward for testing, or a natural ebb in infections. The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading among birds and animals globally, and infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S., mostly with mild symptoms.
