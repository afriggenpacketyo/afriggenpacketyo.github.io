          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region opened higher on Monday after China's central bank decided to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This stability comes ahead of the release of key economic data, with analysts expecting a slight slowdown in China's third-quarter GDP growth compared to the previous quarter. Major indices in Japan, Hong Kong, and mainland China saw gains, following a positive close on Wall Street last Friday driven by a softening U.S. tone in trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel launched air and artillery strikes in Gaza after accusing Hamas of violating a recent ceasefire by targeting its soldiers, resulting in the deaths of two IDF personnel. In response, Israel has halted aid transfers into the territory and struck dozens of what it termed Hamas targets. Hamas denies involvement in the reported clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the truce, while the U.S. has expressed that the ceasefire remains in effect, attributing the breach to internal rebel factions rather than Hamas leadership.</p>

          <p>Families of individuals who died by suicide are calling for a public inquiry, alleging the UK government repeatedly failed to act on warnings about a website that promotes suicide. A report from the Molly Rose Foundation states that government departments were alerted 65 times about the online forum, which is linked to at least 133 deaths in the UK involving a toxic chemical. Campaigners argue that despite numerous warnings from coroners, the government's response has been slow and fragmented, allowing the platform to continue endangering vulnerable people.</p>

          <p>Whistleblower Erez Reuveni, a former Department of Justice lawyer, claims he was fired after refusing to sign a legal brief containing false information in the case of a mistakenly deported man. Reuveni alleges that senior officials, including the DOJ's number three, instructed attorneys to disregard potential court orders to ensure the deportation of over 100 Venezuelans under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act. His disclosure highlights broader concerns about the DOJ allegedly misleading courts and undermining the rule of law, a pattern some legal experts say has been noted by multiple federal judges.</p>

          <p>Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews gathered outside the Israeli consulate in New York City to protest potential changes to Israel's military draft laws. The demonstration addresses the possible elimination of a long-standing exemption that allows religious students to avoid compulsory military service. Leaders from the Satmar community organized the protest, reflecting deep concerns within the community that mandatory enlistment could negatively impact their religious way of life, an issue that has created significant social and political division within Israel.</p>

          <p>Preliminary results show that centrist candidate Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, marking an end to two decades of rule by the leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. The election was dominated by Bolivia's severe economic crisis, including a US dollar shortage and soaring inflation, which has crippled the economy. Both Paz and his right-wing opponent, Jorge Quiroga, campaigned on platforms of economic change, promising to attract foreign investment and pivot away from populist policies, signaling a major geopolitical shift for the nation.</p>

This move mirrors U.S. policies that extend its legal reach to foreign-made goods and is seen as part of a broader Chinese strategy to develop a toolkit for retaliating against foreign sanctions and economic pressure.</p>

          <p>To combat workplace burnout and reclaim personal time, career experts advise employees to learn how to set firm boundaries with their bosses. A simple yet effective technique is to replace the phrase "I can't" with "I don't" when declining requests, as the latter is more definitive and less open to negotiation. This approach helps create clear, non-negotiable rules, such as "I don't attend meetings after 5 p.m.," allowing individuals to protect their time without appearing uncooperative. The advice comes as research shows a rising number of workers are experiencing extreme levels of stress.</p>

Sources indicated the stand appeared to have been there for months and did not have a direct line of sight to the president. No individuals were present at the location, and there was no impact on the president's movements.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the U.S. military conducted a strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel in international waters, killing three people. This marks the seventh such attack since last month, with this vessel reportedly linked to the Colombian guerrilla group ELN. The Trump administration has justified these actions by classifying the conflict with drug cartels as a "non-international armed conflict," arguing that the narcotics they smuggle constitute an armed attack on the U.S. However, the policy has faced criticism from some lawmakers questioning its legal basis.</p>

Witkoff also described bonding with a top Hamas negotiator over the shared experience of losing a son, a moment that humanized the high-stakes discussions and helped pave the way for an agreement.</p>

          <p>As China's leaders convene to draft their next Five-Year Plan, this article examines how these strategic blueprints have historically driven massive global economic shifts. Key plans include the "Reform and Opening Up" policy of the 1980s, which transformed China into a manufacturing powerhouse and led to the "China shock" in Western economies. Later plans successfully targeted "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, giving China a near-monopoly on critical resources for electric vehicles and solar panels, fundamentally altering global supply chains and geopolitical power dynamics.</p>

Hayes was injured while completing a dunk off a lob pass from teammate Luka Doncic, with whom he is developing on-court chemistry. The adjustment period for players to get used to Doncic's creative passing style is ongoing, as the team works to capitalize on his playmaking abilities ahead of the regular-season opener against the Golden State Warriors.</p>

The proposal is part of a broader white paper on education that also includes creating an alternative qualification for students who need to resit their maths and English GCSEs, addressing concerns about the current system's low pass rates.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, discusses the nature of Chinese innovation and the U.S.-China rivalry. She argues that concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on China's economy are exaggerated, as exports to the U.S. now constitute a small percentage of China's total GDP. Liu also emphasizes that the rivalry has expanded beyond trade into technology and ideology, and highlights the critical importance of including women's voices in policymaking to foster balanced and sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world has already transitioned into a multipolar order, and great powers like the U.S. and China must choose between rigid, confrontational alliances or patient, managed statecraft. Unlike past hegemonic shifts, the current era is defined by the deterrent of nuclear weapons and deep technological and economic interdependence, which make total war irrational and systemically catastrophic. The author suggests that leaders should heed the example of Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai, who pursued institutional adaptation to manage their differences rather than risking a devastating conflict.</p>
