          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 06:24:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official data indicates that UK inflation has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest rate in over a year, primarily driven by increases in household bills such as water, gas, and electricity. The Office for National Statistics highlights housing, household services, transport, recreation, and culture as significant contributors to this rise. The Bank of England anticipates inflation to peak at 3.7% between July and September 2025 before declining to its 2% target, but analysts are now questioning the likelihood of additional interest rate cuts this year due to the latest inflation data. Rising costs of airfares and services also contributed to the surprise inflation figure.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting quarterly sales slightly below Wall Street expectations, Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, projecting total sales between $83.5 billion and $84.5 billion. CEO Marvin Ellison credits investments in stores, technology, and customer service for helping the home improvement retailer navigate housing market challenges. While comparable sales decreased by 1.7% year-over-year due to weather impacts, the company noted growth in online sales and among home professionals. Lowe's expects comparable sales to be flat to up 1% year over year and earnings per share to range from approximately $12.15 to $12.40.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously affirmed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners seeking to restrict public access. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access the commons for open-air recreation, a right the judges said includes camping. This decision is expected to fuel further debate regarding public access to land in England. The Dartmoor National Park Association expressed delight at the ruling, emphasizing the importance of responsible access and respect for landowners and farmers.</p>

This was part of a program that stationed UnitedHealth's medical teams in nursing homes, pushing them to cut care expenses. In some instances, residents needing hospital care were denied transfers, leading to negative health outcomes. UnitedHealth said its bonus payments to nursing homes help prevent unnecessary hospitalizations, which are costly and dangerous to patients.

The suspect in the bombing, Guy Edward Bartkus, left behind writings reflecting antinatalist and nihilistic ideologies. Online spaces now allow those with lone wolf mentalities to use "what they find in the online space as kind of a hand in glove for their own idiosyncratic perspectives".

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating due to rising debt levels, exacerbated by the potential enactment of new Trump tax cuts. While some Republicans advocate for spending cuts to address the debt, there is a simpler solution: ending the Trump tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy and corporations. By raising taxes on the super-rich, the government could reduce its reliance on borrowing and alleviate the pressure on the national debt. The growing political power of the wealthy and big corporations to lower their taxes at the expense of most Americans is the underlying cause.</p>

This article examines a long history of presidents concealing or downplaying health issues, from Grover Cleveland's secret surgery to Woodrow Wilson's stroke. The ability to conceal illness is facilitated by the unique environment of the White House, where access to information is tightly controlled.

          <p>A report on the collapse of Skid Row Housing Trust, one of Los Angeles' largest homeless housing providers, warns of systemic issues endangering supportive housing viability. Low and inconsistent rental subsidies are identified as key factors in the trust's failure. The report suggests that other providers face similar risks, potentially impacting housing for vulnerable residents and taxpayers. Recommendations include setting rent subsidies to cover supportive housing costs and standardizing subsidies to reduce variability. The report suggests reevaluating housing those with severe health issues in single-room occupancy hotels.</p>

          <p>In April, Southern California home prices saw minimal growth, with the average price increasing by only 0.4% from March to $884,981, according to Zillow data. High mortgage rates, increasing inventory levels, and economic uncertainty are factors contributing to this stagnation. Zillow forecasts a slight dip in home prices, projecting a 1.5% decrease in the Los Angeles-Orange County metro region by April 2026, due to a rising number of homes for sale. Rental prices are increasing in areas affected by recent fires, while rents remain stable across the city of Los Angeles.</p>

A third target is to reduce the number of people living on the streets in 2030 by nearly a third.

Supervisor Kathryn Barger believes there was a breakdown in communication between county fire, sheriff, and emergency management officials.
