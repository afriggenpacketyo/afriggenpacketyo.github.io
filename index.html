          <p>President Trump expressed his anger at Vladimir Putin for undermining Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's credibility during ceasefire negotiations.  Trump threatened secondary tariffs on countries purchasing Russian oil if a ceasefire isn't achieved, showcasing a shift in his previously conciliatory stance towards Putin. This action may be interpreted as a strategic move to exert pressure on Russia, but it also reveals a potential bias towards prioritizing his own image over long-term diplomatic solutions.</p>
