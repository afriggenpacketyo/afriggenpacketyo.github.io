          <h2>Experts Warn of Escalating Conflict Risks Due to New Military Technologies in India-Pakistan Clashes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan followed days of intense hostilities, highlighting the dangerous role of emerging military technologies. The conflict, which began after a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, involved missiles, drones, and loitering munitions from various countries, marking the first conflict showcasing Chinese, American, Russian, and French weapons systems. This use of advanced weaponry created a restraint-escalation paradox, incentivizing limited action while simultaneously suggesting constraints in military responses. Experts warn that the dynamics of this escalation signal a step closer to nuclear war, shaped by the reliance on and use of technologically advanced weapons.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful, declaring the actions "null and void." The ruling reinstates George Moose as USIP's acting president and criticizes the administration's use of force and threats to seize the agency's headquarters. Judge Howell emphasized that USIP is an independent think tank supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches, not part of the Executive branch, and that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional. The USIP looks forward to restarting its programs following the decision.</p>

Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, citing the bill's potential to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade. The bill, aimed at renewing President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, includes provisions that would cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful, deeming the actions by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as "null and void." Judge Beryl Howell stated that President Trump's unilateral effort to disband the agency exceeded his constitutional authorities. The ruling cited the statute that established USIP, noting its unique status as a mix between an executive branch agency and a private nonprofit corporation. The USIP board, management, and staff look forward to restarting USIP's programs to promote and facilitate peaceful conflict resolution around the world.</p>

          <p>President Trump is calling for a "major investigation" into celebrity endorsements for his political rivals, alleging that stars like BeyoncÃ© and Bruce Springsteen were illegally paid to support former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump accused the Harris campaign of paying for endorsements "under the guise of paying for entertainment." He also criticized Taylor Swift, suggesting her popularity has declined since he declared "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT" in September 2024. Trump's attacks followed criticism from Springsteen, who called the administration "incompetent and treasonous" during a concert in England.</p>

          <p>With credit card balances remaining high and interest rates unlikely to decline significantly, borrowers should consider strategies to manage their debt. Credit card interest rates are driven by a variety of factors, from the federal funds rate to the prime rate and more. Since credit card debt compounds daily, borrowers should explore debt relief options, including debt consolidation loans, debt management programs, and credit counseling.

          <p>A House Republican proposal to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, dubbed "No Tax on Tips," has garnered bipartisan support but faces criticism for its potential drawbacks. While the tax cut would benefit tipped workers, particularly those in the middle-income bracket, it may not provide significant relief to lower-income workers who already owe little or no federal income tax. Concerns have also been raised about the potential impact on the service industry, as the policy could create wage pressure and distort labor markets. Some experts suggest alternative tax breaks that apply across the board to lower-income households.</p>
