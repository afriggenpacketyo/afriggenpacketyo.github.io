          <p>Sean Carroll, president of American Near East Refugee Aid, reports a catastrophic humanitarian emergency in Gaza, exacerbated by Israel's ongoing blockade and restrictions on aid. With food, fuel, and medicine nearly exhausted, starvation indicators are alarmingly frequent, especially among children. Carroll accuses Israel of exploiting aid as a tool of war, violating international law and potentially aiming to expel Palestinians. He urges the creation of secure humanitarian corridors and a political agreement ensuring Palestinian security and self-determination, emphasizing that sustainable peace requires dignity, freedom, and mutual security. The article frames the situation as a moral reckoning for the world, questioning complicity in Gaza's collapse versus participation in its recovery.</p>

          <p>Despite facing significant tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, e-commerce experts believe Temu and Shein will remain competitive in the U.S. market. These companies are shifting to localization strategies, onboarding American sellers, and utilizing local warehouses to mitigate tariff impacts. While prices have increased, experts argue that Temu and Shein's previously low prices allow them to absorb tariffs and still undercut competitors like Amazon. The article notes that Chinese companies are adept at operating on thin margins and finding ways to survive in adverse environments, suggesting they will continue to adapt and compete effectively.

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from receiving new federal grants, citing concerns over antisemitism and diversity policies. Education Secretary Linda McMahon alleges Harvard failed its legal obligations and will not receive grants until it demonstrates responsible management. This move intensifies the clash between the administration and elite universities, which have been criticized for their handling of campus protests related to the war in Gaza. Harvard has vowed to fight what it calls illegal government overreach, arguing that the demands would impose unprecedented control over the university and stifle research and innovation.</p>

          <p>Lamine Yamal, a La Masia graduate, is drawing comparisons to Lionel Messi due to his sensational performances for Barcelona at a young age. At 17, Yamal has already achieved significant milestones, including winning a European Championship with Spain and playing 100 games for Barcelona, surpassing Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's early career stats. While Yamal downplays comparisons to Messi, his rapid trajectory has ignited speculation about his potential to emulate Messi's greatness. However, it is acknowledged that reaching Messi's level of achievement will be a monumental challenge, even for a player as talented as Yamal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from GOP-led states seeking to limit telehealth access to mifepristone, an abortion drug. While not directly commenting on the drug's access, the Justice Department argues the states lack legal standing to sue. The lawsuit aims to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for mifepristone, require in-office visits, and restrict its usage timeline. The case is before a Trump-appointed judge in Texas, who previously ruled to halt the drug's approval, though that ruling was later overturned by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador ordered the arrest of five bus company heads for not complying with his mandate to offer free transport for a week due to highway construction. Bukele accused them of sabotaging the country, despite his claim that the government was covering their usual daily income, which could not be independently verified. This action is another instance of Bukele's authoritarian methods, as he faces accusations of undermining democratic institutions and suppressing dissent under a state of emergency implemented to combat gangs.

          <p>Phillip C. Saunders and Joel Wuthnow suggest that President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials casts doubt on China's readiness to invade Taiwan by 2027. The removal of key officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force and Gen. He Weidong, raises concerns about the competence and reliability of military commanders. This internal turmoil may weaken Xi's appetite for war, providing Taiwan and the United States with an opportunity to strengthen their defenses. While China's military has modernized significantly, the lack of battlefield experience among its officers and potential political interference remain critical challenges.</p>

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz Island expressed shock and disbelief at Donald Trump's proposal to reopen the former prison. Many questioned the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of such a plan, given the island's dilapidated state and historical significance as a site of Indigenous resistance. While some supported the idea, most viewed it as an absurd and unfeasible political distraction. The National Park Service, which operates Alcatraz, declined to comment, but staff reportedly expressed exasperation at the proposal.

          <p>Taiwan's first domestically built submarine, the Hai Kun, is facing doubts about meeting its November delivery deadline due to testing delays and repeated piping system failures. The submarine has yet to begin sea trials, and former navy captain Kuo Hsi reports that compartment flooding has forced foreign testing teams to suspend work. These challenges raise concerns about the vessel's readiness and the timeline for its integration into Taiwan's naval forces, which are crucial for defense against potential threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to close a tariff loophole is expected to significantly reduce the volume of low-value shipments from China to the U.S., impacting delivery companies like UPS and FedEx. The de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to enter the U.S. without tariffs, is now eliminated for imports from mainland China and Hong Kong. This change is projected to decrease revenue for logistics companies and airlines, particularly those heavily involved in e-commerce trade between China and the U.S. While some companies are adapting by shifting to local warehouses, the overall impact on the industry remains uncertain.</p>
