        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the University of British Columbia indicates that multiple sclerosis (MS) may present warning signs up to 15 years before a formal diagnosis. The study, which analyzed over 2,000 patient records, found elevated rates of psychiatrist visits and complaints of fatigue and pain long before classic symptoms appeared. These findings suggest the disease's "prodromal phase" is longer than previously thought, potentially allowing for earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes by recognizing these subtle, early indicators.</p>

This growth, driven by the increasing wealth managed by these firms, reflects a broader interest in assets like private credit and infrastructure.

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake worth approximately $1.6 billion in the embattled insurer UnitedHealth, according to a recent regulatory filing. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has struggled amid public backlash over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices. The move aligns with Warren Buffett's history of value investing, as other notable investors have also recently bought into the insurer, which is trading at a low price-to-earnings ratio.

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to export certain advanced AI chips to China, contingent on a 15% tax on the proceeds, a move critics argue is unconstitutional. The decision reverses a previous block on Nvidia's H20 chips, designed specifically to comply with US export controls while still being powerful for AI applications. This policy has ignited a debate over national security, with some officials reportedly considering resignation over fears it will help China's AI development and undermine the U.S.'s technological edge.</p>

          <p>Talks in Geneva aimed at creating a landmark, legally binding treaty to address the global plastic pollution crisis have concluded without an agreement. Negotiators from 183 countries remained deadlocked over key issues, particularly whether to impose caps on new plastic production, a measure opposed by oil-producing nations and the plastics industry. Despite significant progress on some fronts, the failure to finalize a treaty means the exponential growth of plastic production and its environmental impact will continue unabated for now.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have continued to fall, with the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to 6.58%, creating favorable conditions for some homeowners to refinance.

Experts suggest that homeowners with mortgage rates above 6% or 7% should consider refinancing, provided they plan to stay in their homes long enough to offset the closing costs.

          <p>Less than a month after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to protect journalists, three reporters were injured by LAPD batons while covering a protest in downtown Los Angeles. The L.A. Press Club and others have now filed a contempt motion, alleging the LAPD violated the order which explicitly forbids the use of force against the press. The motion asks the judge to further restrict police actions, highlighting a pattern of the department disregarding First Amendment rights during protests.</p>

          <p>The rivalry between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres has intensified into one of baseball's most heated matchups, driven by contrasting team cultures and repeated high-stakes encounters. The Dodgers, long the dominant force in the NL West, represent a more subdued, established power, while the Padres have cultivated an aggressive, high-emotion style as they seek to usurp them. This dynamic has been fueled by recent playoff battles, a benches-clearing melee, and a tight division race, turning every game into a significant and contentious event.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is utilizing high-tech surveillance, including MQ-9 Predator B drones, to track migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border from a command center at Fort Huachuca. Originally designed for warfare, these drones are equipped with advanced radar that can identify and track moving objects over vast desert areas, guiding Border Patrol agents on the ground. With migrant crossings down, the technology is now being used to pursue even small groups or individuals, showcasing a significant shift towards advanced military-grade technology in immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents have renewed enforcement activities across Los Angeles, with Home Depot parking lots emerging as a primary battleground. These locations, long-standing gathering points for day laborers, have seen a series of raids, including one where agents used a moving truck to ambush and arrest workers. This follows a temporary court order meant to restrict agents from targeting people based on location or vocation, leading immigrant advocates to accuse the administration of unconstitutional behavior and racial profiling.</p>

          <p>A retired RAF test pilot, Squadron Leader Robert Burke, has claimed that the 1994 Chinook helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre, which killed all 29 people aboard, was a "show flight." He alleges the Mark 2 Chinook was used to demonstrate its safety to the Army despite internal concerns from pilots and engineers about its airworthiness. The flight, carrying senior security service members, was a reckless gesture to prove the upgrade program was on schedule, according to Burke, adding to families' calls for a new public inquiry.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that the prime minister appoint members of his party to the House of Lords, arguing the current composition is undemocratic. In a letter, Farage pointed out that his party received over 4.1 million votes and has four MPs, yet has no representation in the upper chamber, unlike smaller parties. While appointments are at the prime minister's discretion, the move highlights the shifting political landscape and Reform's push for greater influence within the UK's parliamentary system.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry has lodged a formal protest with the United States, demanding it "rein in frontline forces" after a recent incident at the disputed Scarborough Shoal. Beijing accused Philippine vessels of dangerous maneuvers like "high-speed ramming" and infringing on its sovereignty, placing blame on the U.S. for its support of the Philippines. The statement underscores the escalating tensions in the South China Sea, with China asserting that its military remains on high alert to safeguard its territorial claims.</p>

A military blockade has cut the region off from the rest of the country, causing food prices to skyrocket and destroying livelihoods, leading to reported deaths by suicide due to hunger. The civil war has created a dire humanitarian crisis, with the WFP reporting a 60% drop in funding and being able to feed only a fraction of those facing severe food insecurity.</p>

          <p>A research team from Tsinghua University in China has developed a new approach to the "single-source shortest-paths" problem, a fundamental challenge in theoretical computer science. For decades, the dominant method has been Dijkstra's algorithm, which has a known speed limit due to its sorting process. The new method bypasses this sorting step, potentially breaking a 40-year-old computational barrier and significantly reducing calculation time, a development that won the Best Paper Award at a major computer science symposium.</p>

Phelps and other swimming legends are calling for an independent review and improved athlete services to fix the organization's structural issues ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer's fan code of conduct, which bans political displays, is under fire for confusing and seemingly inconsistent enforcement, highlighted by the removal of a fan wearing a MAGA hat.

This creates a challenge for the league as it tries to balance the norms of global soccer culture, where political expression is common, with the business-focused, apolitical stance of major American sports.</p>
