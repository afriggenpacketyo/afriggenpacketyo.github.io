          <p>Following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared ten key takeaways in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity. While stating that "there’s no deal until there’s a deal," Trump indicated significant progress was made and that he believes Putin is genuinely open to achieving peace. He declined to specify the remaining sticking points but suggested the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European nations, also noting he would be open to a future trilateral meeting.</p>

The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will continue to intensify, potentially becoming a major hurricane over the weekend. While not currently projected to make landfall in the United States, the storm is expected to pass just north of the Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bringing heavy rainfall and dangerous surf conditions to the region.</p>

          <p>A Bank of America strategist has highlighted a chart showing the S&P 500's price-to-book ratio has reached a record high, surpassing the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000. This surge is largely driven by investor optimism about the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, which bulls argue is justified by current corporate profits. While some valuation metrics indicate market froth similar to historical peaks, high valuations reflect strong expectations for future earnings and do not definitively signal an imminent crash.

          <p>A detailed analysis from The Atlantic explores the recent summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, which concluded without a peace deal for the war in Ukraine or any other tangible agreements. The article notes that despite the high-profile meeting in Alaska, which included a formal red-carpet welcome for Putin, both leaders offered vague statements and took no questions from the press. The outcome leaves Ukraine and European allies in a state of uncertainty, with the piece suggesting that Putin achieved a symbolic victory by being hosted on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that Grant Hardin, a convicted murderer and former police chief, meticulously planned his prison escape over six months. He exploited lax security in the prison kitchen to create a fake law enforcement uniform and gather supplies, ultimately walking out of a gate after a guard failed to verify his identity. The report details Hardin's survival methods in the wild before his recapture and highlights systemic security failures, including his misclassification and inadequate surveillance, that enabled the breakout.</p>

          <p>Journalists from the BBC offer dual perspectives on the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, which ended without a ceasefire agreement or concrete deliverables. The analysis suggests that for Trump, who prides himself on dealmaking, the vague outcome represents a setback, while Putin benefited from the geopolitical stage. The article highlights the unusual dynamic of the press conference, where Putin spoke first and at length, while Trump's remarks were brief. The key question remaining is whether Trump will now impose threatened sanctions on Russia.</p>

          <p>Following a legal challenge from Washington D.C. officials, the Trump administration has rescinded an order that would have replaced the city's police chief, Pamela Smith, with a federal appointee. After an emergency court hearing, the Justice Department agreed to a compromise where Chief Smith retains full command of the Metropolitan Police Department. The revised directive now positions the federal official as an intermediary for directing police services for federal purposes, such as immigration enforcement, resolving a tense standoff over control of the capital's law enforcement.</p>

This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the lakebed is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that since pollution sources are so diverse—including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads—efforts should pivot from source control to protecting residents with indoor air filtration and public health alerts.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea market, driven largely by Chinese chains, is projected to grow into a multi-billion dollar industry, with three major companies recently listing in Hong Kong. Brands like Mixue Group, which now has more outlets than McDonald's, have expanded rapidly through a franchise-heavy model that relies on low prices and high volume. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including market saturation, intense price wars, and the difficulty of maintaining quality control, leading investors to question whether its explosive growth is a sustainable trend or a passing fad.

          <p>California Democrats have unveiled a bold redistricting proposal aimed at giving their party up to five additional U.S. House seats, a direct response to similar Republican efforts in Texas. The plan, which would require a constitutional amendment approved by voters in a special election, seeks to redraw district lines to create more favorable conditions for Democratic candidates. If passed, the move could significantly reshape California's congressional delegation and play a crucial role in the national battle for control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The opening Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily halted after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by an individual in the Anfield crowd.

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored after the Chinese government complained about works by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists. The show's curator, a Burmese artist named Sai, alleges that Chinese embassy officials, accompanied by Thai city officials, demanded the removal of sensitive artworks, leading to pieces being covered up or taken down. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an act of transnational repression, and the curators have since fled Thailand, planning to seek asylum in the UK.</p>

          <p>Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is pitching a simple, barebones electric pickup truck with a potentially low starting price, aiming to address consumer concerns about the high cost of EVs. The company's strategy involves a basic, two-seat vehicle that owners can customize with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. However, with the rollback of federal EV tax credits, the truck's final price may be closer to $28,000, placing it in a more competitive market segment and testing whether its minimalist appeal can succeed without a sub-$20,000 price tag.
