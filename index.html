          <p>Ukraine has accused Russia of hindering the next round of peace talks scheduled in Istanbul by not providing its negotiating proposals, a key demand from Kyiv. While the Kremlin stated that ceasefire conditions would be discussed, President Zelensky expressed concerns that Moscow is intentionally making the meeting unproductive, emphasizing the need for a clear agenda and proper preparation. Despite a prisoner of war swap resulting from the first round of talks, tensions remain high as both sides reported explosions and casualties in various regions, further complicating the already fragile negotiation process. Ukraine has expressed readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire to move towards de-escalation. Optimism in the region is low due to the persistent conflict.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower the soaring price of rice. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to start selling the rice at a reduced price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. The initiative aims to alleviate the financial burden on households struggling with rising rice costs, and the cheaper rice has been met with enthusiasm by consumers, with some stores selling out within minutes. This measure is a response to the increasing financial strain on Japanese households. (not investment advice)</p>

This recommendation is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a similar recommendation in 2022.

          <p>A new tax bill from the US President includes a 3.5% tax on remittances made by non-US citizens, a measure expected to significantly impact African economies. Remittances are a vital source of income for many African families, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. Experts warn that the tax could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to send money, undermining the formal financial system.

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Smithsonian as leftist and anti-American, and has taken steps to target funding for programs that promote what he considers "divisive, race-centered ideology." This move continues a trend of Trump appointing loyalists to key positions in cultural organizations.</p>

          <p>UC Irvine's baseball team lost to Arizona State 4-2 in the Los Angeles Regional of the NCAA Tournament, failing to capitalize on key offensive opportunities. Despite a strong pitching performance from Trevor Hansen, who settled down after giving up two early home runs, the Anteaters' offense struggled to produce runs. Jacob McCombs' sacrifice bunt in the fifth inning put runners in scoring position, but the team couldn't bring them home, and a bases-loaded double play in the eighth ended another rally. UC Irvine now moves to the losers bracket and must win four consecutive games to advance to the super regionals. The game's score may have been different if UC Irvine had played differently.</p>

          <p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Indo-Pacific defence chiefs that China wanted to “fundamentally alter the region’s status quo”, and that American allies must step up defence investments.
