          <p>A growing number of students in the United Kingdom report that university mental health services are inadequate, citing a "one-size-fits-all" approach and bureaucratic hurdles. The article explores the complex debate over the extent of a university's responsibility, contrasting rising student needs with institutional resource constraints and the role of the National Health Service. Academics and experts discuss the challenges, including a lack of specialized training for tutors and the difficulty students face navigating the support systems, raising questions about whether universities can provide a sufficiently safe and supportive environment.</p>

          <p>In a rare and symbolic challenge to the central bank's independence, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, escalating his public criticism of Chairman Jerome Powell. For years, presidents have avoided direct interference with the Fed, but Trump has repeatedly condemned Powell for not lowering interest rates and has even suggested he might fire him. This unprecedented visit brings the political pressure directly to the institution, raising concerns about the politicization of U.S. monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated into an armed clash, with soldiers from both nations exchanging fire in a contested border area. The conflict follows Cambodia's decision to downgrade diplomatic relations after Thailand closed border crossings in protest of a landmine blast that injured five Thai soldiers. Both countries blame each other for initiating the firefight, which exacerbates a long-standing territorial dispute historically centered around ancient temples and fueled by nationalist sentiments on both sides.</p>

          <h2>Giants' Rafael Devers Expresses Newfound Preference for Playing Defense</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprising reversal, San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers stated he prefers playing defense after making his debut at first base. This contradicts his previous stance with the Boston Red Sox, where he was adamant about serving exclusively as a designated hitter and had publicly rebutted suggestions of a position change. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats, a change in perspective that comes after a tense spring training with his former team over this very issue.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber has defended the league's policy banning political signage in stadiums, stating it is necessary to prevent incitement and keep games safe for all fans. His comments came in response to questions about supporters' groups protesting against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdowns, with some fans feeling targeted and unsafe. Garber asserted that while individual teams can make statements, the league itself will not take a position on the issue, a stance that has drawn criticism from fan groups.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. representatives has introduced a resolution to halt a controversial federal plan to kill approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest. The plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is intended to protect the threatened northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl. Opponents of the plan criticize it as inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money, while some conservationists argue that without it, the spotted owl faces certain extinction.</p>

          <p>A coalition of business leaders in Los Angeles has initiated a ballot measure to repeal the city's gross receipts tax, which is levied on a wide range of companies and generates over $800 million annually. Proponents argue the repeal is necessary to combat an "anti-job climate" and make the city more affordable, but city officials are sounding the alarm. They warn that eliminating this major revenue source would punch a massive hole in the budget and force devastating cuts to core public services like police and fire departments.

          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, narrowly avoiding a technical recession and beating economists' expectations. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. However, with domestic consumption still sluggish and the external trade environment uncertain, analysts suggest the pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained. (not investment advice)</p>
