          <p>A framework deal between the U.S. and China for TikTok's American operations is nearing finalization, with technology giant Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake expected to be major investors. The precise structure, including ByteDance's continued involvement and control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm, remains under active negotiation. This agreement follows years of U.S. national security concerns regarding potential Chinese government access to user data and content manipulation, which led to a congressional bill requiring divestment or a ban. President Trump has delayed enforcement, but a new deadline looms, as he seeks to ensure a favorable deal for the popular platform, citing its importance to younger voters.</p>

          <p>Elliot Forhan, an Ohio Democratic candidate for attorney general, is facing intense criticism from Republicans for social media posts disparaging conservative activist Charlie Kirk days after his assassination. Forhan's comments, including a profanity-laced statement and calling Kirk a 'champion of tyranny,' have prompted widespread condemnation and calls for his withdrawal from the race. Ohio's current Attorney General Dave Yost and other GOP officials labeled the remarks as 'petulant' and 'demented publicity,' arguing such rhetoric is ill-suited for public office and increasingly mainstream within the Democratic Party. The controversy highlights the deep political divisions following Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's Tmall merchants are strategically expanding into Southeast Asia through its subsidiary, Lazada, streamlining cross-border e-commerce for invited sellers. This innovative initiative eliminates the need for merchants to establish new stores, hire local teams, or manage logistics, as Lazada will handle everything from warehousing to localized customer service. Global brands like audio electronics firm Harman International and sports equipment company Spalding have already joined the invite-only program. This strategic move reflects Alibaba's commitment to diversifying product offerings in Southeast Asia's rapidly growing internet economy, which is projected to exceed $330 billion this year, aiming to capture a larger market share.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is undergoing two days of intense congressional questioning regarding his leadership, particularly his handling of the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation and the controversial firings of three senior agents. Critics, including Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dick Durbin, accused Patel of sparking 'mass confusion' with social media posts about a suspect. Patel defended his performance, crediting his decision to release suspect images for the swift arrest, comparing it favorably to past FBI investigations. He also faces scrutiny over a lawsuit from fired agents alleging politicization of the FBI, his 'enemies list,' and the handling of Jeffrey Epstein files, further highlighting agency turmoil.</p>

The Duchess, who passed away at 92, was fondly remembered for her kindness, dedication to charities, and deep love of music, having volunteered at a homeless charity and taught music.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has appointed Mike Liberatore, formerly the finance chief at Elon Musk's xAI, as its new business finance officer, tasked with overseeing significant infrastructure spending. Liberatore's move further intensifies the escalating rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who were once co-founders of OpenAI before a public falling out. This hiring follows Musk's lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI for alleged breach of contract, and OpenAI's recent valuation at $500 billion, with a substantial $300 billion deal with Oracle for compute commitments. Liberatore's departure from xAI, after just three months, was part of a series of high-profile exits from Musk's AI startup.</p>

          <p>The national average FICO credit score has fallen to 715, marking the second consecutive annual decline after more than a decade of steady increases. This concerning drop is attributed to high interest rates, persistent inflation, and rising consumer debt, which have collectively led to an increase in missed payments. The resumption of federal student loan delinquency reporting also significantly contributed to the overall decline in scores. Experts emphasize that credit scores are dynamic, and improving them involves consistently paying bills on time, judiciously applying for new credit, and maintaining a credit utilization rate below 30%, which can lead to substantial long-term financial savings.</p>

For minimizing startup costs, service-based businesses are recommended for their lower overhead and ability to capitalize on existing skills.

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk could significantly influence the Trump administration's foreign policy, potentially leading to a more accommodating stance toward China. The article posits that a U.S. leadership increasingly focused on domestic cultural conflicts and border protection might temper its ambitions to contain China. This perspective arises amid ongoing trade war negotiations and challenges in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict, where President Trump's efforts have been thwarted. The author believes Kirk's death could reinforce a doctrine rejecting multiculturalism and immigration, ultimately impacting global relations and potentially fostering calmer U.S.-China interactions.</p>

          <p>Sixteen-year-old American track sensation Cooper Lutkenhaus, the youngest U.S. competitor at the World Athletics Championship, failed to advance past the 800m opening round in Tokyo. Despite his personal best ranking him among the fastest in history and high expectations from figures like David Rudisha, Lutkenhaus finished seventh in his heat. He acknowledged the tough race and an uncharacteristic lack of sprint finish, but remained remarkably optimistic about his future in the sport. The high school junior, who missed school to compete, expressed excitement about the invaluable experience of racing against the world's best and left the stadium with his head held high, ready to learn and improve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 1997, the U.S. has decertified Colombia as a drug control partner, with President Trump accusing Bogotá of 'failing demonstrably' its obligations due to unprecedented surges in coca cultivation and cocaine production. Despite the rebuke, a 'national interest waiver' prevents immediate sanctions, preserving crucial U.S. aid and security cooperation. Trump criticized Colombian President Gustavo Petro's 'erratic' leadership and his peace negotiations with criminal groups. Petro countered, blaming persistent U.S. and European demand for the drug issue, while the move deals a symbolic blow to a long-standing ally, raising questions about Washington's reliability in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have unearthed what could be the world's oldest known mummies in Southeast Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years, significantly predating Egypt's and Chile's Chinchorro mummies. Researchers discovered smoke-dried human remains in crouched positions with cuts and burn marks across various archaeological sites in China, Vietnam, and other regional countries. This ancient practice, believed to have been common among hunter-gatherer communities, allowed for sustained physical and spiritual connections with ancestors, bridging time and memory. The findings offer significant insights into prehistoric funerary practices and the timeless human desire to preserve loved ones, demonstrating a widespread and ancient tradition of mummification.</p>

          <p>President Trump has filed a substantial $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging a years-long pattern of 'defamation and libel' against him, his family, and the 'America First Movement.' The 85-page suit specifically targets a book written by two Times reporters and three articles published during the 2024 presidential campaign, claiming they were 'carefully crafted with actual malice' to inflict maximum damage. The Times has vehemently dismissed the lawsuit as having 'no merit' and being an attempt to stifle independent reporting, vowing to defend journalists' First Amendment rights. This legal action follows a similar $10 billion suit against The Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that President Trump's unwavering willingness to let TikTok cease operations in the U.S. was the decisive factor in advancing a deal framework with China. Bessent explained that while commercial terms were largely established months ago, China had stalled negotiations following Trump's significant tariff announcement. The President's firm stance on prioritizing national security, even at the cost of the app's shutdown, ultimately compelled China to re-engage in discussions. A critical September 17th deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations is fast approaching, with Oracle reportedly poised to manage the app's data infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A landmark 'Hillsborough Law' bill is set to be introduced in Parliament, mandating public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters and cooperate fully with inquiries. The legislation, which includes a professional and legal 'duty of candour,' will impose criminal sanctions for breaches, and provide legal funding for victims of state-related disasters. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who pledged the law, praised campaigners for their decades-long persistence following the 1989 Hillsborough disaster that tragically killed 97 football fans. The law aims to fundamentally change the 'culture of cover-ups' and apply lessons from other public tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire and infected blood scandals.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases, has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice to regain her job, alleging 'unlawful and unconstitutional' termination by the Trump administration. Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, claims her firing was solely or substantially due to her father's identity or her perceived political affiliation, without any legitimate explanation. She is among dozens of DOJ employees who have challenged their terminations during Trump's second term. Comey warned that such firings instill fear and suppress independent thought within the DOJ, ultimately undermining the pursuit of justice for victims.</p>

          <p>World Athletics is set to 'remind' Great Britain of its strict rules against religious and political slogans after sprinter Jeremiah Azu competed with a '100% Jesus' headband at the World Championships in Tokyo. Azu wore the headband during the men's 100m semi-finals, where he finished fourth, missing a spot in the final. The governing body's regulations explicitly prohibit the marketing or display of such slogans during competition. As Azu may participate in the upcoming 4x100m relay, the team will be informed of these regulations and the potential consequences, highlighting the ongoing tension between personal expression and sporting event guidelines designed to maintain neutrality.</p>
