          <p>The families of Fletcher Merkel, 8, and Harper Moyski, 10, the two children killed in the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, have released public statements expressing their profound grief. They shared cherished memories of their children, with one father calling the attacker a "coward" for taking his son's life. While asking for privacy, the families also thanked the community and first responders for their support. The family of Harper Moyski specifically urged leaders to take meaningful action to address gun violence and the nation's mental health crisis to prevent future tragedies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automotive research firm Edmunds suggests that this Labor Day presents a significant opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. This is primarily due to a $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, both of which are set to expire on September 30. Leasing has become the dominant method for acquiring EVs, accounting for 70% of transactions in July, as it allows consumers to avoid long-term commitment to rapidly evolving technology. The IRS has also clarified that a contract signed before the deadline makes a buyer eligible, even if delivery occurs later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), in collaboration with Metro Transit Police, successfully disrupted a potential school shooting plot in Washington D.C. The intervention led to the arrest of a minor on Wednesday night following an investigation into violent threats made on social media. A subsequent search warrant resulted in the discovery of seven firearms. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the juvenile posed a risk to the community and was removed due to the proactive efforts of law enforcement, which occurred the same day as a tragic school shooting in Minneapolis.</p>

          <p>A Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), Colin Smyth, has had his access to Holyrood deactivated following reports that he placed a secret camera inside a parliament toilet. Smyth was previously suspended from the Labour party after being charged with possessing indecent images of children and is now reportedly facing a further charge related to these new allegations. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body made the decision to deactivate his pass due to the ongoing criminal investigation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked Trump administration official Kari Lake's attempt to fire Voice of America Director Michael Abramowitz, ruling the action illegal. U.S. Senior District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally mandated advisory panel, which is currently vacant as President Trump has not appointed new members. The ruling is part of a larger legal battle over Lake's efforts to significantly scale back the operations of Voice of America, a move the court has scrutinized. The judge rejected the administration's broad claims of executive power in this instance, upholding the legal firewall designed to protect the broadcaster from political interference.</p>

Her lawyers contend the termination is unlawful and that she was targeted for resisting unscientific directives. In the wake of her ouster, HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill has been named acting director of the agency. The move follows a period of public disagreement between Monarez and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over U.S. vaccine policy and is part of a larger leadership shakeup at the CDC, with several other top officials also resigning.</p>

A federal judge diagnosed the issue as a mistaken "hit" in the warrant system, which blocked her court-ordered release.

Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan is surging, with nearly a million visitors in July alone, making China the top source of inbound tourists.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to launch significant immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, potentially starting as early as September 5. According to senior DHS officials, the operations are expected to mirror tactics used in Los Angeles, which involved armored vehicles and tactical gear that sparked public protests. This planned action is distinct from President Trump's recent proposals to deploy the National Guard to address city crime, a move that has been strongly opposed by both Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. Both state and city officials stated they have not been in direct communication with the federal government about the reported ICE operations.</p>

          <p>In a major NFL trade, the Dallas Cowboys have sent star edge rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers following a prolonged and public contract dispute. As part of the deal, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history. The Cowboys will receive two first-round draft picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark in return. The trade came after Parsons grew frustrated with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who refused to negotiate with his agent, leading the two-time All-Pro to formally request a trade earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>Shares of Gap Inc. fell in after-hours trading following the company's warning that trade tariffs will have a greater-than-expected impact on its future profits. The apparel retailer raised its estimate for tariff-related costs, which is now projected to lower its full-year operating margin. The company delivered mixed results for its second quarter, with overall sales slightly missing expectations and its Athleta brand showing a 9% decline in comparable sales. The announcement underscores the ongoing challenges that retailers face from global trade policies and their effect on profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced an expansion of special California Highway Patrol (CHP) crime suppression teams to work with local law enforcement in major cities across the state. While touting that overall crime numbers are down, Newsom acknowledged that public perception is key and that more work is needed. The move comes amid frequent criticism of crime in California from President Trump, who has threatened to use military forces to address local crime. Newsom contrasted his collaborative approach with local leaders against what he called the president's strategy of "militarizing American cities" and doing things "to people, not with people."</p>

          <p>The recent turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the firing of its director and the resignation of four top officials, stems from a fundamental conflict over vaccine policy and public health science. The upheaval follows a series of actions by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, to overhaul federal health agencies. Resigning officials cited an environment that weaponizes public health and disregards scientific reality, pointing to changes in immunization schedules made without their input. Health policy experts worry this leadership exodus could erode public trust and weaken the nation's ability to respond to disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Amid reports that employee mentions of burnout are at their highest level since 2016, a lifestyle expert has offered practical advice for reducing stress at work. Maisha Wynn, a CBS News contributor, recommends that workers strategically manage their energy by tackling demanding tasks in the morning and saving simpler activities for later in the day. She also suggests building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create moments of joy and relief at one's desk. A key strategy for avoiding burnout, Wynn notes, is learning to set boundaries and occasionally say "no" to preserve one's own well-being.</p>

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the Surface Transportation Board (STB), was abruptly fired by the Trump administration on Wednesday. Primus stated he learned of his termination after returning from an Amtrak event and finding his work phone locked. The White House said Primus "did not align with the President's America First agenda." Rail worker unions condemned the move, suggesting it was timed to influence the STB's review of a proposed merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, a deal Primus had indicated he opposed. This firing is the latest in a series of removals of officials at federal agencies by the administration.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has scheduled a hearing for Friday to consider Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request to block President Trump's attempt to fire her. Cook filed a lawsuit against Trump after he announced he was removing her "for cause" based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which her attorney calls "nakedly pretextual." The lawsuit argues the move is an illegal attempt to subvert the Federal Reserve Act and undermine the central bank's independence. This unprecedented case challenges the legal standard for removing a Fed governor and is likely to escalate to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump is acting within his constitutional authority by moving to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The author asserts that Article II of the Constitution vests the entire "executive power," including the removal of officers, in the president. The piece contends that so-called "independent" agencies like the Federal Reserve are an unconstitutional fourth branch of government and that Supreme Court precedent is moving toward restoring the president's plenary removal power. The author concludes that the allegations against Cook constitute legitimate "cause" for removal and that the move sends a necessary message that the president is in charge of the executive branch.</p>

He describes the songs as arriving unexpectedly, blooming from a process of surrender rather than intentional effort. The album explores a wide range of genres, from electronic music and bolero to cumbia, reflecting a playful and spontaneous approach to creation that del Real will preview at an upcoming performance at the Grammy Museum.</p>

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service explained that while they may look strange, these organisms are actually beneficial to their freshwater ecosystems. Each blob consists of thousands of individual creatures called zooids that work together to filter-feed on plankton, thereby cleaning the water. These ancient organisms have existed for hundreds of millions of years and are a natural, though seldom seen, part of many slow-moving rivers and lakes across the country.</p>

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a hose in the rear brake system can rupture, leading to a loss of brake fluid, which may result in longer stopping distances for the driver.
