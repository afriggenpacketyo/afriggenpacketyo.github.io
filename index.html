          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin gave the Russian leader what he desired, which was the legitimacy of a meeting with a U.S. president. Speaking just days after a record Russian aerial assault on Ukraine, Zelenskyy emphasized the need for increased international pressure on Russia to end the war. He reiterated his call for American and European allies to impose stronger sanctions, particularly targeting Russia's energy sector, which he described as Putin's primary weapon.</p>

          <p>According to the U.N.'s Universal Postal Union, postal traffic to the United States has dropped by 81% after the Trump administration suspended the "de minimis" trade exemption in late August.

The administration defended the executive order as a necessary measure to combat counterfeit goods and fentanyl trafficking while reducing the trade deficit. As a result of the change, at least 88 international postal operators have suspended some or all of their services to the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump amplified his threats of a federal crackdown on immigration and crime in Chicago by sharing an AI-generated image parodying the film "Apocalypse Now" with the caption, "I love the smell of deportations in the morning." While later stating he is not "going to war" but rather intends to "clean up our cities," the post has intensified tensions with local leaders. This comes as an internal memo revealed Department of Homeland Security preparations to base federal agents at a nearby naval station for a potential 30-day operation.</p>

Duckworth clarified that while she takes the president's words seriously, there are currently no indications of an imminent military deployment into the city. She confirmed that federal agents are being provided office space at a naval station but emphasized that no requests have been made for barracks or detention facilities to support a troop presence.</p>

The piece draws parallels to the expansion of executive power seen during the "war on terror" and warns that such summary executions are both wrong and counterproductive.</p>

          <p>Police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man who is the suspected driver of a Formula 1-style racing car repeatedly spotted on a public motorway since 2019. After the latest sighting, police followed the distinctive red car to a property and took the driver into custody while he was still wearing his racing suit and helmet. Because the vehicle is not road-legal, the owner now faces a fine and a possible suspension of his driving license.</p>

          <p>A new study by the financial services company River indicates that businesses have been purchasing an average of 1,755 Bitcoin per day over the past 20 months. This sustained institutional investment has reportedly contributed over $1.3 trillion to Bitcoin's market capitalization and has expanded corporate-held reserves to over 6% of the total circulating supply. Market analysts cited in the article suggest that if this trend continues, it could be a significant factor in pushing Bitcoin's price above the $125,000 mark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jarvis McKenzie, a Black man in South Carolina, is publicly calling for the state to enact a hate crime law after being the victim of a racist attack in July. During the incident, a white man allegedly fired a rifle over his head and shouted racial slurs. South Carolina is one of only two states in the U.S. without a hate crime law, though the alleged shooter was charged under a limited local ordinance. Proposed state legislation that would impose stronger penalties has passed the House but remains stalled in the state Senate.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian argues that while the recent elimination of the "de minimis" trade exemption by the Trump administration will raise prices, the resulting panic among small businesses is largely misdirected. The author contends that this change affects only a small fraction of businesses and that the more critical factor to monitor is the overall health of the economy and consumers' ability to absorb these costs. For now, with income and wealth remaining high, the economy will likely adapt. (not investment advice)</p>

While police reported coordinated violence from some protesters, event organizers stated that attendees were peacefully defying the ban and accused the police of making false claims.</p>

          <p>A major new study published in Nature Human Behavior, analyzing data from nearly 15 million people, has found a consistent, cross-cultural trend of individuals forming romantic partnerships with people who have similar psychiatric diagnoses. The research, which spanned generations from the 1930s to the 1990s in Denmark, Taiwan, and the U.S., identified these "spousal correlations" across nine disorders, including depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Researchers suggest this may be due to shared understanding, similar environments, or the impacts of social stigma.</p>
