        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court justices appeared divided during oral arguments regarding the potential establishment of the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school in Oklahoma. The case centers on St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, with justices debating whether excluding the school from charter school funding constitutes religious discrimination. The court's liberal members voiced concerns about using taxpayer funds to advance a specific religious ideology in public institutions. Conservative justices questioned whether a ruling against St. Isidore could impact other government contracts with religiously affiliated organizations, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case.</p>

          <p>A Chinese academic has cautioned that potential interactions between the Philippines and Taiwan could be viewed by Beijing as support for Taiwanese independence, potentially leading to economic repercussions. This warning follows China's summoning of the Philippine envoy to Beijing to express concerns over recent actions by the Philippines related to Taiwan and security matters. The Chinese embassy in Manila also issued a warning against remarks by a Philippine Navy Rear Admiral regarding potential joint patrols with Taiwan in the Luzon Strait. This marks the first time a senior Philippine military official has acknowledged potential military cooperation with Taiwan.</p>

Authorities described the incident as "way beyond hazing" and expressed concern over the students' lack of judgment.

          <p>Fox News has filed a motion for summary judgment in Smartmatic's $2.7 billion defamation suit, arguing that its coverage of false election fraud claims did not harm Smartmatic's business. The network contends that Smartmatic already had a poor reputation and that its reporting on allegations made by President Trump and his lawyers was newsworthy and protected by the First Amendment. Smartmatic counters that Fox News knowingly aired false claims to appease its viewers, causing significant damage to the company's reputation and financial standing. The case follows Fox News's $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over similar claims.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that egg prices are falling, but food economists argue that this claim is misleading, noting that retail egg prices have actually increased during his term. While wholesale egg prices have declined due to an easing of the avian flu outbreak, the economists said that this decline has not yet translated into lower prices for consumers. They also refuted the idea that any president has significant control over egg prices, attributing fluctuations to factors like bird flu outbreaks and consumer demand. Trump stated that egg prices are down 87% since he took office, but this figure is not accurate.</p>

The article highlights the need for Congress to address spending bills and the possibility of a major policy fight over Trump's tax cuts.

          <p>A recent survey conducted by the Carter Center and Emory University indicates that over half of mainland Chinese citizens oppose the use of force to unify with Taiwan under any circumstances. However, the survey also found that a majority of respondents support Russia's actions in Ukraine and maintaining Beijing's border claims with India, even at the risk of conflict. Additionally, a large majority believe that the Philippines and Vietnam should respect China's sovereignty claims over the South China Sea, regardless of international law. The online study surveyed 2,211 Chinese citizens aged 18 to 54.</p>

The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 0.1%. The initial drop was triggered by the Commerce Department's report that the economy contracted 0.3% in Q1. The markets rebounded later in the day after a report said the measure of inflation that the Fed likes to use slowed to 2.3% in March. (not investment advice)</p>

The drug's effectiveness is likely linked to weight loss and improved blood sugar control. Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Wegovy, has sought FDA approval for the drug as a MASH treatment.</p>
