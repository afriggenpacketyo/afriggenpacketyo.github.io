          <p>A federal judge in Georgia has mandated the reinstatement of legal statuses for 133 international students whose F-1 visas were abruptly terminated by ICE and DHS. The students, many in good standing and nearing graduation, claimed the terminations lacked notice, explanation, or opportunity to respond, with the ACLU arguing it was a coercive tactic. Judge Calvert agreed, finding the terminations likely exceeded legal authority and violated due process, ordering the agencies to reinstate the students' statuses retroactively. This decision highlights ongoing legal battles concerning immigration enforcement and students' rights.</p>

          <p>Gold prices experienced a significant rally, surpassing $3,500 an ounce, as investors grew increasingly concerned about President Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence. Trump's pressure on Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates led to equity market sell-offs, prompting investors to seek safe-haven assets like gold. Central banks are also contributing to the precious metal's rally by increasing their gold reserves, reflecting a broader trend of seeking stability amid economic uncertainty.

Rising insurance costs due to climate-related damages and the impact on food supplies are already affecting prices.
