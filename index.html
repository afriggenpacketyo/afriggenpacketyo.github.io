        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Negotiations in Geneva aimed at creating a landmark, legally binding treaty to combat global plastic pollution have concluded without an agreement. Delegates from 184 countries were deadlocked on the core issue of whether to cap new plastic production, a measure supported by about 100 nations but opposed by oil-producing countries and the plastics industry. Despite extending the talks and considering multiple drafts, the committee could not find a consensus, leaving environmentalists and many national representatives deeply disappointed. The failure to reach a deal means the growing crisis of over 400 million tons of new plastic produced annually remains unaddressed by a unified global policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Danish brewer Carlsberg has noted a significant change in consumer behavior, with beer drinkers increasingly choosing either premium or economy brands over traditional core offerings. This "bifurcation" is squeezing mid-range brands as consumers react to cost-of-living pressures, a trend also reflected in declining sales volumes for major brewers like AB InBev and Heineken. The CEO also highlighted a shift towards more at-home consumption as rising prices in bars and restaurants deter patrons. These changes indicate that even the resilient beer industry is facing challenges from broader macroeconomic headwinds and evolving consumer spending habits.</p>

          <p>For individuals struggling with sleep, particularly during disruptive summer heatwaves, several evidence-based strategies can promote faster and better rest. The article recommends incorporating at least 30 minutes of daily exercise to increase melatonin production and reduce stress, which can significantly improve sleep duration and quality. It also advises against consuming caffeine within eight hours of bedtime and reducing screen time before sleeping, as both can negatively impact sleep cycles. While the popular "4-7-8" breathing technique lacks robust scientific backing, its anecdotal success in calming anxiety suggests it may be a harmless method worth trying.</p>

          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, expectations for a breakthrough in the Ukraine war are being carefully managed. Trump himself has estimated a "25% chance of failure" but expressed hope that the meeting could lead to peace, emphasizing that any deal would require follow-up talks involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. From a European perspective, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that the summit presents Putin with an opportunity to end the conflict, but stressed that any peace agreement must have Ukrainian consent. The international community remains watchful over concerns that Trump's desire for a deal could lead to unfavorable concessions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study from Tsinghua University has quantified China's massive role in the global textile industry, revealing that the country produced over one billion tonnes of textile fibers between 1978 and 2022. This staggering volume, equivalent to roughly twice the total human mass on Earth, highlights China's position as the world's leading textile processor, accounting for more than half of global capacity. The research also underscores the significant environmental challenge posed by this production, noting that China's textile waste recovery rate is only 17 percent. Most of this recovered material is downcycled into lower-quality products, indicating a need for more sustainable practices.</p>

          <p>The arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage for a summit on the Ukraine war has elicited strong and divided reactions from local Alaskans. Many residents, including Ukrainian expatriates and military veterans, organized protests to voice their opposition, expressing disgust that Putin would be welcomed on U.S. soil. The state's historical ties to Russia, having been purchased from the Russian Empire in 1867, add a layer of significance to the meeting. Conversely, other locals, such as parishioners at an Orthodox church and fishermen, expressed cautious optimism, hoping the talks could finally lead to an end to the destructive conflict.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the peace summit between President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of deliberately trying to derail the talks. The Georgia Republican claimed that a recent large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia was timed to sabotage Trump's "heroic efforts to end the war." Her comments came as Ukraine launched multiple drone strikes into Russia, which Russian officials said caused civilian injuries and damage. In response to the ongoing violence, Zelenskyy has maintained that Russia is not sincere about peace, urging continued international pressure to compel Moscow to end the war justly.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in educational institutions. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from schools and universities with DEI initiatives. The case challenged memos that broadly interpreted a 2023 Supreme Court ruling on admissions to prohibit any "race-based decision-making" across all of education. While the judge did not rule on the merits of DEI policies, she found the administration's guidance represented a "sea change" in regulation that was imposed without following proper legal procedures.</p>

          <p>New home prices in 70 major Chinese cities fell by 0.3 percent in July, matching the previous month's decline, which was the sharpest in eight months. This continued slide indicates that a series of government support measures, including eased purchasing restrictions and lower mortgage rates, have so far failed to revive consumer confidence and investment in the property sector. On a year-over-year basis, prices fell by 3.4 percent, showing a persistent downturn that began in April 2022. The data underscores the deep-seated challenges in China's real estate market, as cautious consumers prioritize saving over buying homes, prolonging the liquidity crisis for many developers.

Having initially been given the modest goal of a top-four finish, Slot's remarkable success has dramatically shifted expectations at the club. The acquisitions of high-profile talents like Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike mean that anything less than another major trophy would now be seen as a disappointment. While Slot has demonstrated a calm demeanor, the significant investment transforms Liverpool from hunters to the hunted, placing intense scrutiny on his ability to integrate new players and deliver sustained success.</p>

After Newcastle rejected a £110 million offer from Liverpool, Isak reportedly remains keen on the move, creating a challenging situation for his current team. Rooney noted that while losing a top player is a blow, financial regulations might make selling Isak beneficial for Newcastle, as it would free up funds to strengthen the overall squad.

The lifting of economic sanctions on Moscow, accountability for war crimes, and the return of prisoners and abducted children are also major topics for negotiation.

Industrial output also expanded at its slowest pace since last November, hampered by extreme weather and a government push to curb excess production capacity in sectors like steel.

A specialist team determined the items were practice bombs, which were not live but contained a charge, and had been carefully buried in rows. The site was once a military ordnance depot, and historians believe the bombs were likely disposed of by soldiers after the war, remaining undetected for decades as generations of children played just above them.</p>

The security minister stated that the group had support from "foreign states" and was attempting to destabilize the country. Among those arrested were two generals and a French national, who was accused of being an agent for French intelligence. This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent by the junta, which seized power in 2020 and has since resisted calls for a return to civilian rule while aligning itself more closely with Russia.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing forecasts despite facing trade headwinds from U.S. tariffs. The positive performance was largely driven by a rebound in exports, which contributed significantly to GDP growth after contracting in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, the economy expanded by 1%, more than double what economists had predicted. However, analysts caution that this momentum may not last, as the full impact of U.S. tariffs, particularly on the key automobile sector, could lead to a decline in corporate profits and investment, potentially slowing growth in the coming quarters.

While the games demonstrated progress, they also highlighted current limitations, with robots frequently falling, crashing into each other, and requiring human assistance. Organizers stated the event provides valuable data for developing robots for real-world applications, as China invests heavily in the sector to address its aging population and compete technologically with the U.S.</p>

          <p>An Australian man convicted of murdering Emma Lovell, a British expatriate, during a home invasion in 2022 will be eligible for supervised release sooner after a successful appeal. The attacker, who was 17 at the time of the stabbing, had his non-parole period reduced from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence, cutting his minimum time in jail by 17 months. The Queensland Court of Appeal cited the man's early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and potential for rehabilitation as reasons for the change. The murder of Lovell, who was killed in front of her family, sparked widespread outrage and led to stricter youth crime laws in the state.</p>

The man, who has not been identified, was transported to a hospital where he died from his injuries. The event has drawn condemnation from local officials, who argue that such raids terrorize communities and create dangerous situations, highlighting the intense fear within immigrant communities under current administration policies.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old man accused of murdering one Minnesota state politician and wounding another has had the state charges against him upgraded. The suspect now faces two counts of first-degree murder and four counts of attempted first-degree murder, in addition to charges for impersonating a police officer and animal cruelty. The attack occurred in June, when the suspect allegedly posed as an officer to gain access to the homes of Senator John Hoffman and Representative Melissa Hortman. The Hennepin County attorney stated the new charges better "reflect the weight" of the crimes, which are also being prosecuted in a separate federal case that could carry the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing federal law enforcement takeover of Washington D.C., President Trump made false claims that the city's crime rate is "the worst it's ever been." In reality, violent crime in the capital hit a 30-year low in 2024. The president's comments came as federal agents and National Guard troops increased their presence, establishing checkpoints and clearing homeless encampments, which advocates warn is creating a chaotic and frightening situation for the city's unhoused population. The federal intervention, which local leaders have condemned, has escalated tensions between the administration and the city, with Trump suggesting he may seek to extend the 30-day takeover.</p>

The airline stated it will begin a gradual suspension of all operations, starting with long-haul overseas flights, and expects a full grounding by Saturday morning.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan for the state's Democratic-led legislature to redraw its congressional maps, a direct response to a Republican effort in Texas to create maps favorable to their party. Newsom framed the move, called the "election rigging response act," as a necessary defensive measure to "neuter and neutralize" the Texas proposal, which could hand Republicans five additional U.S. House seats. The new California map would only be enacted if a Republican-led state advances a partisan mid-cycle redistricting plan and would require voter approval. The proposal marks a significant escalation in the partisan "arms race" over redistricting.</p>
