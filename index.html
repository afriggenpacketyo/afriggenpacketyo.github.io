          <p>The Labor Department is set to release August employment figures, a report under heightened scrutiny following President Trump's dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month. Economists are closely watching for signs of whether the labor market is stabilizing or continuing to slow, with forecasts projecting around 80,000 new jobs and a steady unemployment rate of 4.2%. The data will be crucial for the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, as it considers a potential cut to bolster job growth. This article provides context on the ongoing debate regarding the accuracy and political independence of U.S. economic data.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, currently a powerful Category 4 storm in the Pacific, is moving west towards Hawaii, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph. While no coastal watches or warnings are currently in effect, a turn towards the west-northwest is expected, bringing the storm closer to the Hawaiian Islands by early next week.

          <p>Bill Pulte, President Trump's housing finance chief, declined to reveal the source of his "tip" regarding alleged mortgage fraud by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Pulte, who has made multiple criminal referrals and aggressive social media posts targeting Cook, cited the need to protect sources and methods. His refusal to disclose the tipster has raised concerns about the "political weaponization" of his office. The incident occurred shortly before Pulte abruptly canceled a scheduled press conference on Cook.</p>

          <p>Neil Hopper, a 49-year-old NHS vascular surgeon, has admitted to two counts of insurance fraud and three counts of possessing extreme pornography. Hopper, who performed hundreds of amputations, had his own legs removed in 2019, falsely claiming sepsis as the cause to insurers. The court heard he self-inflicted injuries by freezing his legs, driven by a "sexual interest in amputation" and "greed," defrauding two firms of over £466,000. This case reveals a disturbing series of deceptions and personal struggles.</p>

          <p>T. Rowe Price's shares rallied 10% after announcing a $1 billion deal with Goldman Sachs to expand private-market product offerings to retail investors. Goldman Sachs will acquire up to $1 billion in T. Rowe Price common stock, aiming for a 3.5% ownership stake. This collaboration seeks to leverage Goldman's expertise in public and private markets with T. Rowe Price's active investing to create new opportunities for wealth and retirement funds. The move comes as T. Rowe Price looks to rebound from years of struggling with market shifts and aims to capitalize on new executive orders allowing greater access to alternative assets in 401(k) plans.</p>

Trump also reiterated his commitment to brokering a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, with his special envoy attending a European leaders' meeting in Paris.

          <p>An estimated $88 billion annually leaves Africa through illicit financial flows, including tax evasion, money laundering, and corruption, a figure that has significantly increased since 2015.

Experts highlight that digital corporations, commodity traders, and corrupt elites exploit tax havens, perpetuating a system that benefits powerful individuals in both Africa and the global North.

This friction highlights challenges in the Trump administration's massive $170 billion immigration enforcement expansion, which diverts federal agents from other crimes and strains partnerships with local agencies.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the fifth-largest in the lottery's history after no winner emerged from Wednesday night's drawing. With a cash value of $634.3 million, the odds of winning are 1 in 292.2 million. CBS News data reveals significant variations in net payouts across states due to differing state income taxes on lottery winnings, in addition to federal taxes. States like California and Florida offer the highest take-home amounts, while New York has the lowest after-tax annuitized payout, highlighting the financial impact of location on jackpot winners.</p>

          <p>The death toll from Sunday's magnitude-6.0 earthquake in Afghanistan has tragically surpassed 2,200, with nearly 4,000 injured, primarily in Kunar province. Rescuers face immense challenges reaching survivors due to aftershocks, rockfalls, and blocked roads, as the window for finding people alive rapidly closes. This disaster exacerbates an already severe humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, a country grappling with decades of conflict, mass returns of refugees, and drastically reduced foreign aid since the Taliban's return to power. International aid agencies are urgently calling for more support to address the vast and growing needs of the affected population.</p>

The acquisition will slightly reduce the Mara and Tisch families' holdings but will not alter John Mara's role as team president.

Current organ transplants significantly extend lives, with ongoing research exploring xenotransplantation using genetically altered pigs and growing new organs from human stem cells.

The prosecution alleges Linehan used social media to "relentlessly" publish offensive posts, calling Brooks a "deeply disturbed sociopath" and a "domestic terrorist." Brooks testified to feeling alarmed and distressed by the posts, which she claims were verbally abusive and vindictive. Linehan, who pleaded not guilty, maintains his posts were in the public interest as a journalist exposing tactics of trans activists, and that an incident where he allegedly knocked her phone was a reflex response to being filmed.</p>

          <p>The peace sign, or V-sign, has become a ubiquitous photo pose for Gen Z and Gen Alpha kids, evolving from its origins as a World War II victory symbol and 1960s anti-war gesture. While its specific meaning has broadened, children today often use it simply as a default pose to appear "cute" or to have "something to do with their hands" in pictures. The widespread adoption is partly attributed to the influence of Japanese pop culture, particularly anime, where the gesture is common in both celebratory and everyday contexts. This cultural shift reflects how younger generations adopt and recontextualize gestures, often without deep historical awareness.</p>
