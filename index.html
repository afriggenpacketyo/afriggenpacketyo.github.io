          <p>Despite President Trump's 25% tariffs on foreign auto imports, major automakers showed surprising resilience.  The muted response is partly due to exemptions for Canada and Mexico, key production hubs. However, analysts warn of significant price hikes and decreased car sales in the coming months due to limited stock and the tariffs' impact on margins.  The long-term effects remain uncertain.</p>

The families of Letby's victims have criticized this evidence as flawed and a rehash of the defense case.  The CCRC will now review this new information.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs, a significant increase on goods imported into the US, were calculated using a formula based on the U.S. goods trade deficit with each country. The formula involves dividing the trade deficit by total goods imports, then dividing the result by two. However, the tariffs are not truly 'reciprocal,' as they don't reflect what other countries charge the U.S.  The approach aims to eliminate trade deficits and boost domestic manufacturing, although the economic consequences are complex and far-reaching.</p>
