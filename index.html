          <p>Former Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby's interview reveals his failure to adequately address child abuse allegations within the Church of England, specifically concerning serial abuser John Smyth.  Welby's admission of insufficient care and his statement that he would forgive Smyth if alive have caused further distress to victims.  The interview showcases a potential bias towards prioritizing institutional unity over immediate victim needs, and a self-serving narrative to explain his actions.</p>
