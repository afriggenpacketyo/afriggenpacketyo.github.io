          <p>The Reichsbürger, or "Reich Citizens," are a diverse group of conspiracy theorists who reject the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic. They claim the pre-war German Reich still exists, the Federal Republic lacks a valid constitution, and Germany remains under Allied occupation. The movement, comprising organized groups and individuals, resists state authority, refusing to pay taxes or recognizing court orders. The Reichsbürger movement gained attention due to its propensity for violence, culminating in a plot to overthrow the German government in 2022.</p>

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) advises caution due to low response rates to the survey.

          <p>A coalition of addiction experts has warned Congress about the "dire consequences" of proposed funding cuts to programs battling the drug overdose epidemic. A letter signed by over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers highlights that these cuts would reverse the progress made in reducing overdose deaths in 2024, which resulted from sustained financial investment. Experts are particularly concerned about the impact on rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods, as well as the potential defunding of research efforts tracking new synthetic street drugs. They also fear cuts to Medicaid funding, which provides crucial insurance coverage for addiction treatment.</p>
