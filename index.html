          <h2>US-China Agreement on Jet Engine Parts Supports Chinese Aircraft Production</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 02:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent agreement between the US and China has lifted a ban on American jet engine parts and technology sales to Chinese manufacturers, significantly benefiting the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac). This enables Comac to sustain its C919 narrowbody aircraft production, fulfilling hundreds of orders, as China currently lacks domestic mass production of these critical components. Analysts caution that while the deal is important for Comac's immediate production and EU market ambitions, previous US export restrictions had a chilling effect that could still harden Beijing's resolve to accelerate indigenous engine development. This strategic move highlights the intricate balance of global trade, technological reliance, and national industrial strategies, influencing both countries' economic and aviation sectors and potentially shaping future supply chains.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods have tragically claimed at least 81 lives in Central Texas, with over 40 individuals, including children from Camp Mystic, still missing. The Guadalupe River experienced an unprecedented rise, reaching the height of a two-story building in some areas, leading to widespread destruction and necessitating extensive search and rescue operations. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and President Donald Trump have mobilized significant resources, with the latter declaring a major disaster for Kerr County, the hardest-hit area. The ongoing crisis has prompted a massive recovery effort, with officials collecting DNA for identification and warning of further potential flooding, underscoring the severe and unpredictable nature of such environmental events and their profound human cost.</p>

          <h2>Trump Threatens Additional Tariffs on Countries Aligned with BRICS Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 01:58:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened an additional 10% tariff on countries aligning with what he terms "Anti-American policies of BRICS," a move announced during the bloc's meeting in Rio de Janeiro. BRICS leaders, including Brazil, Russia, India, and China, criticized "unjustified unilateral protectionist measures" and tariffs that distort global trade, expressing serious concerns about their impact on the global economy. Trump's statement, posted on Truth Social, signals a hardening stance on international trade, potentially escalating global economic tensions and challenging the existing world order. This policy aims to pressure nations to reconsider their economic alignments and trade practices, underscoring a period of significant geopolitical and financial uncertainty.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet President Trump in Washington, with discussions expected to focus on a potential Gaza ceasefire deal. This marks Netanyahu's first White House visit since a joint attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, an event that has reportedly created a more favorable environment for peace talks. The proposed ceasefire involves Hamas releasing eight living hostages initially, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, though significant obstacles remain, including Hamas's insistence on a permanent end to the war, which Israel rejects. The meeting occurs amidst increased Israeli public pressure to end the conflict and a rapidly changing Middle East landscape, highlighting complex diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions and secure hostage releases.</p>

          <p>In Lahore, Pakistan, police have arrested the owners of a pet lion after it escaped and attacked a woman and her two young children, causing injuries to their arms and faces. Dramatic CCTV footage captured the big cat leaping over a concrete wall and pursuing the family. The lion has since been captured and moved to a wildlife park. While it is legal to keep big cats as pets in Pakistan with a license, they must be housed outside city limits. This incident, where the children's father claimed owners did nothing to restrain the animal, has prompted authorities in Punjab to launch a crackdown on illegal wildlife possession, leading to several arrests and lion recoveries.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has sharply criticized Elon Musk, calling him "completely off the rails" and a "train wreck" after the Tesla CEO announced the formation of a new "America Party" to compete against existing political factions. Trump dismissed the idea of a third party as "ridiculous" and a source of "confusion," emphasizing the historical two-party system in the US. The public feud stems from disagreements over Trump's recent tax and spending bill, which ended electric vehicle tax credits, a policy Musk had previously indicated he had "no problems" with.

However, significant differences persist, particularly Hamas's insistence on a permanent end to the war, which Israel has rejected. The visit follows recent US-Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, which some analysts believe have created more favorable conditions for an agreement.

Institutional investors, managing $1.7 trillion in global real estate, view European housing as a lucrative "asset class," often prioritizing profit maximization through rent hikes and reduced expenditure, exemplified by "renoviction" tactics. This corporate capture, enabled by decades of privatization and liberalized mortgage credit, has disproportionately affected renters and fueled political disenfranchisement, including support for far-right movements. The article argues that housing provision invariably fails when profit is the primary force, necessitating fundamental structural changes to reclaim homes from finance and reinstate housing as a core public priority.

          <p>Ministers in England are facing urgent calls to preserve Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), which campaigners describe as "precious legal protections." Concerns are rising that abolishing EHCPs could deny thousands of children vital support and access to education. While the government acknowledges a "complex and sensitive area" and insists no decisions are final, the shadow education minister criticized "broken promises and U-turns." The debate highlights the increasing number of EHCPs in place—totaling over 638,000—and the critical need to ensure adequate provision for vulnerable children amidst ongoing system reform efforts and funding discussions.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa faces a grave national security concern after a top police officer accused the police minister and other senior officials of interfering in investigations into political assassinations. Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi alleged obstruction of justice to shield politically connected individuals and impede efforts against organized crime. The minister denies the claims, but the matter has prompted calls from across the political spectrum for urgent action, including an independent commission of inquiry. This public dispute highlights deep-seated corruption allegations within the South African Police Service, raising serious questions about the integrity of law enforcement and the rule of law in a country with one of the world's highest crime rates.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched airstrikes on three ports and a power plant in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, confirming targets included the commercial ship Galaxy Leader, previously hijacked by the rebel group. Israel's Defence Minister stated the strikes were part of "Operation Black Flag" and warned of heavy consequences for Houthi actions, equating Yemen's fate to Tehran's. Following the Israeli attacks, two missiles were launched from Yemen towards Israel, triggering sirens and prompting military review of interceptions. These strikes are a direct response to repeated Houthi attacks on Israel and its citizens since the Israel-Hamas war began, with Israel claiming the targeted ports were used for Iranian weapon transfers to terror plans.</p>

          <p>Following his feud with President Trump, Elon Musk has announced plans to launch a new "America Party," a daunting endeavor due to complex state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules, and intense litigation. Election lawyers emphasize that forming a national party requires navigating 50 different state legal systems, often biased towards the two major parties, and would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. While Musk's vast wealth could potentially fund such an effort, the process is inherently multi-year and faces significant pushback from established political structures. This article provides a realistic analysis of the formidable hurdles involved in establishing a viable third political party in the United States, highlighting the systemic challenges beyond financial resources.</p>

          <p>Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate, has rapidly become one of Africa's deadliest jihadist groups, responsible for a surge in militant attacks across West African nations like Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Formed in 2017, JNIM has expanded its reach, exploiting local grievances and governance failures to recruit members, often young men lacking economic opportunities. The group imposes a strict interpretation of Islam and funds itself through various illicit means, including cattle-rustling, extortion, and taxing illicit goods. Despite international and regional counterinsurgency efforts, including French military presence and UN peacekeeping, these strategies have largely failed, with military coups exacerbating instability and human rights abuses further fueling JNIM's growth and entrenchment.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is advocating for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence (AI), as stated in their recent summit declaration. They view AI as a "unique opportunity" for driving inclusive growth, innovation, and sustainability, but warn that without fair governance, it could widen the digital gap. BRICS leaders emphasized the need for technical specifications and protocols involving UN agencies to ensure "trust, interoperability, security and reliability" across AI platforms. They also called for equal access to AI technologies for Global South countries, open-source collaboration, and safeguards for intellectual property without hindering technology transfer, underscoring a push for more equitable global AI development.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp in Kerr County, Texas, was tragically swept away by a "horrific" flash flood as the Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Many of the hundreds of girls were sleeping in low-lying cabins near the riverbank, resulting in 78 confirmed fatalities from the wider Texas floods, including the camp's longtime director, Richard "Dick" Eastland, and several young campers. Survivors recounted "hysterical" scenes and military evacuations from the "horrendously ravaged" site. The disaster raises questions about camp location and evacuation procedures, as search efforts continue for the missing amidst widespread devastation and profound community grief.</p>
