          <p>Senate Republicans are facing significant challenges in passing a large-scale tax and spending bill, a key part of President Trump's second-term agenda. With four Republican senators expressing opposition, the party's slim majority is at risk, requiring intense negotiations to avoid failure. The nearly 1,000-page legislation extends tax cuts from Trump's first term and proposes spending cuts to social programs, a point of contention even within the party. If the bill passes the Senate, it must return to the House for another vote, where it also faces a difficult path due to the narrow Republican majority.</p>

          <p>President Trump, alongside Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, toured a new immigration detention facility located in the Florida Everglades, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz'. The site, situated at a remote airport, has been rapidly converted to house, process, and deport thousands of unauthorized immigrants. Proponents praise its isolated and secure location, while critics, including environmental groups and immigrant advocates, have condemned it as a 'callous political stunt' and filed lawsuits to block its operation. The facility's funding is reportedly coming from FEMA, adding another layer of controversy to the project.</p>

          <p>Over 100 million Americans are currently burdened by a collective $220 billion in medical debt, prompting many to seek relief options. Federal law requires nonprofit hospitals to offer charity care, providing free or discounted services to individuals and families below certain income thresholds relative to the federal poverty level. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement companies can negotiate to reduce balances, though this may impact credit scores. As a final resort, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or restructure medical debt, but this carries significant long-term financial consequences.</p>

          <p>Steve Goncalves, the father of victim Kaylee Goncalves, has strongly criticized the plea deal offered to Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students. He stated that the families were unprepared for the deal, which spares Kohberger the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas and four consecutive life sentences. Goncalves accused prosecutors of rushing the process and failing to consult with the victims' families about what they considered justice. He described the outcome as 'disgusting' and the opposite of what his family and others had wanted, expressing profound frustration with the legal system.</p>

          <p>British police have arrested three former senior managers of the Countess of Chester Hospital on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. The arrests are part of an investigation into the hospital's handling of the case of Lucy Letby, a nurse convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill seven others between 2015 and 2016. This development occurs amid ongoing controversy surrounding Letby's conviction, with some medical experts and her lawyer challenging the evidence and seeking an appeal. Police have clarified that these arrests do not impact Letby's existing convictions but focus on potential corporate and leadership failures.</p>

Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell explained that the Fed adopted a 'wait-and-see' approach after the tariffs were announced, as they significantly altered inflation forecasts. This admission provides context for the Fed's decision to hold rates steady despite public pressure from the White House to implement cuts.

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a cornerstone of American foreign policy since 1961, has been formally dismantled and absorbed into the State Department under the Trump administration. Former agency heads from both Democratic and Republican administrations have called the move an 'abomination' and a 'train wreck,' warning that the State Department is ill-equipped to manage complex global aid programs. They express deep concern that the shutdown will lead to increased global instability, famine, and migration, ultimately undermining U.S. national interests.

          <p>The Department of Justice has issued a memo directing its civil division to 'maximally pursue' the denaturalization of U.S. citizens, raising concerns among legal experts. The directive broadens the criteria for revoking citizenship, focusing on the subjective standard of 'good moral character' and targeting categories like individuals with alleged gang ties. While the government must still prove its case in federal court, critics fear the policy could be used to target political adversaries. This marks a significant escalation from previous administrations, which focused denaturalization efforts primarily on cases involving war criminals or clear immigration fraud.</p>

This notable demographic shift occurred alongside a slight overall rise in births in England for the first time since 2021, though birth rates in Wales continued to decline. The data also confirms a continuing trend of people delaying parenthood, with a decrease in births to mothers under the age of 30.

Responses like 'a person who doesn't want to text on weekends' or 'someone who is too social' provide genuine insight into the actual work environment.

This figure sets a new record for the first half of a year since data collection began in 2018. The Labour government, which has introduced new measures to combat people smuggling, faces criticism from Conservatives over the rising numbers. The situation is a key topic for upcoming talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, as the two countries negotiate potential new agreements to manage the deteriorating situation in the Channel.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has officially signed Spanish international goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from rival club Chelsea for a fee of Â£5 million. The 30-year-old, who remains the world's most expensive goalkeeper following his 2018 transfer to Chelsea, joins the Gunners on a three-year contract. Kepa spent last season on loan at Bournemouth and previously had a successful loan spell at Real Madrid. His arrival at the Emirates Stadium is expected to provide experienced competition for Arsenal's current number one, David Raya, strengthening the team's goalkeeping depth ahead of the new season.</p>

A former roommate described Roley as having gone 'downhill' after moving out and becoming homeless, living out of his vehicle. The victims were veteran battalion chiefs Frank Harwood and John Morrison, and their deaths have left the local community and fire departments in shock.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a significant surge in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies 'front-loading' inventory by stocking up on goods before the tariffs took effect. Additionally, some businesses are absorbing initial cost increases or using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments, all while waiting for more clarity on U.S. trade policy. However, experts caution that these are temporary buffers and expect prices to rise in the latter half of the year as these strategies are exhausted (not investment advice).</p>

While maintaining that the 'doors of diplomacy will never slam shut,' he indicated that Iran needs more time before re-engaging.

The missile defense sector showed the highest dependency, with 11.1% of its primary suppliers based in China.

The feud stems from Musk's harsh criticism of the Trump-backed 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' which Musk claims is fiscally irresponsible. In response, Trump has threatened to have the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an agency Musk once led, investigate the extensive government subsidies Musk's companies receive. Musk, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Africa, has continued to attack the bill and the politicians who support it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab concludes that the Republican 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' would significantly shift resources from the poor to the wealthy. The report projects that the lowest-earning 20% of households would see their annual income decrease by about 2.9% ($700), while the top 20% would gain 2.2% ($5,700). This disparity is primarily due to the bill's sharp cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which would outweigh any tax benefits for low-income families. The legislation's tax cuts, including an extension of the 2017 cuts, disproportionately favor higher earners (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The article explores the mainstreaming of kink in literature, moving from a taboo subject to an established genre with its own canon and conventions. It reviews Brittany Newell's novel 'Soft Core,' which centers on a San Francisco sex worker, as a prime example of this evolution. The article argues that while nonfiction about BDSM often aims to normalize and demystify the subculture, fiction like Newell's can explore the complex psychology, emotion, and loneliness within these worlds more freely. It positions 'Soft Core' as a literary work that delves into the feeling-tones of transactional relationships and existential searching.</p>
