            <p>Ukraine's military reported a significant increase in Russian drone attacks across several regions immediately after the expiration of a 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by Moscow. Air raid alerts were issued for Kyiv and other regions, with explosions reported in Mykolaiv, raising concerns about potential casualties. Neither side has officially commented on the reported attacks, but both had previously accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement, underscoring the fragility of the truce. The renewed hostilities highlight the ongoing challenges in achieving sustained peace in the region.</p>

            <p>China has warned that it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that compromise Beijing's interests, amidst escalating trade tensions between the two nations. The warning comes as the Trump administration reportedly plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure U.S. partners to limit their dealings with China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce cautioned about the risk to all countries if international trade returns to the "law of the jungle," and emphasized China's willingness to work with all parties to defend international fairness and justice.</p>

The firm anticipates that this will result in slower economic growth, increased unemployment, and higher inflation, but believes the U.S. will narrowly avoid a full-blown recession. JPMorgan recommends that investors consider structured notes and hedge funds in diversified portfolios to navigate the more volatile environment created by the tariffs (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>This article reviews the second episode of The Last of Us Season 2, focusing on the death of Joel, a central character. The author critiques the show's adaptation of the video game's plot, arguing that the extended and graphic depiction of Joel's death diminishes the shock and emotional impact compared to the game. The review suggests that Season 2 leans too heavily into misery and lacks the elegant insights of the first season, resulting in a more circular and suffocating narrative.</p>
