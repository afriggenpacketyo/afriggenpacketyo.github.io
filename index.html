          <p>A large-scale manhunt is underway for the suspect who assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah Valley University event. Authorities have recovered a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon and are analyzing video footage and physical evidence, including prints found near the scene. The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information, as officials believe the shooting was a targeted attack carried out by a single, college-aged male who fled the campus after firing from a nearby rooftop. The investigation remains active with law enforcement pursuing numerous leads to identify and apprehend the perpetrator.</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison after being convicted by the Supreme Court for plotting a military coup. The court found him guilty of leading a conspiracy to remain in power following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The verdict, which also convicted seven co-conspirators including senior military officials, has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who called the trial a "witch hunt." Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, is expected to appeal the sentence but cannot appeal the guilty verdict itself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the 24th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, U.S. lawmakers from both parties expressed growing concern that domestic terrorism now poses the greatest threat to national security. In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, several representatives highlighted the dangers of political polarization and violence, with some specifically blaming heated rhetoric for creating a volatile climate. While concerns were bipartisan, Republicans also pointed to issues at the southern border as a potential source of terrorist threats. The consensus reflects a significant shift in perceived national security priorities since the foreign-led attacks of 2001.</p>

          <p>NATO is reinforcing its eastern flank after several Russian drones were shot down over Polish airspace, an incident Poland described as an unprecedented provocation. In response, member states including the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and France are deploying additional troops, air defense systems, and fighter jets to enhance security. The incursion has heightened regional tensions, particularly as it coincides with major joint military exercises between Russia and Belarus. While U.S. President Trump suggested the drone presence could have been a "mistake," European leaders widely view it as a deliberate test of the alliance's resolve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An industrial area in downtown Los Angeles is facing a severe public health issue due to the persistent illegal dumping of rotten produce, which has attracted swarms of "extra large" rats. Local business owners and residents report that trucks dump spoiled fruits and vegetables nightly, creating a putrid stench and unsanitary conditions that city officials have been slow to address. The discarded food, likely from nearby produce distributors, is left to fester on the streets, impacting both local businesses and the unhoused population living in the area.

          <p>The iconic mockumentary rock band Spinal Tap is returning for a sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," more than four decades after the original cult classic film. The new movie, directed by Rob Reiner, reunites the band members—played by Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Christopher Guest—for one last contractually obligated gig. The plot follows their search for a new drummer, a notoriously perilous position in the band's fictional history, and features cameo appearances from real-life rock legends Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John. The film revisits the deadpan humor and rock-and-roll satire that made the original a beloved classic.</p>

          <p>Americans who do not meet new, stricter eligibility criteria are reporting significant difficulties in obtaining the latest COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA has limited approval to those 65 or older or with specific health vulnerabilities, a major shift from previous universal availability. Consequently, many younger, healthy individuals seeking vaccination to protect themselves or at-risk family members are being turned away by pharmacies. This change, advocated by the Trump administration, has created confusion and frustration, forcing some to seek doctor's prescriptions or hunt for providers, while a key CDC advisory committee meeting that could clarify guidance has been delayed.</p>

The case was brought by two couples who challenged the Department of Home Affairs after being denied their naming preferences.

After a recent pullback tempered the market's rapid ascent, officials are now focused on avoiding the volatile boom-and-bust cycles of the past. The goal is to guide a more measured and sustainable uptrend, which could reduce risks associated with speculative retail investing while still building household wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

While the extraction for construction purposes was technically legal, the water utility's managing director called the usage "appalling" and immediately banned the practice.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a Hamas office in Doha, Qatar, has severely shaken the confidence of Persian Gulf nations in their long-standing security agreements with the United States. The attack, which killed five Hamas members and a Qatari officer, targeted a location where Hamas officials were living at Washington's request. Gulf leaders are questioning the value of hosting U.S. military bases and buying U.S. weaponry if an American ally can strike them with impunity. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation from Arab nations and is seen as a major setback for U.S. efforts to build a regional anti-Iran coalition.</p>

          <p>Stock prices for both Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance saw a significant surge following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a takeover bid for its rival. The potential deal would consolidate two major players in the U.S. media landscape, combining assets like CNN, HBO, and the Paramount film studio. This move comes as the industry continues to be reshaped by the rise of streaming and faces scrutiny from the Trump administration. The bid has not yet been formally submitted, but the market reacted positively to the prospect of the merger, which is being led by David Ellison.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her role in a high-profile bribery case. She was convicted of accepting bribes, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car, in exchange for her husband's political influence. During her sentencing, Menendez tearfully told the judge she had blindly followed her husband's requests and took full accountability for her actions. The judge acknowledged her ongoing cancer treatment but described her as a "central participant" in the scheme, not an innocent observer. Her husband is currently serving an 11-year sentence for his conviction.</p>

          <p>A Scottish couple has finally solved the mystery of a stranger who appeared in their wedding photos four years ago, thanks to an appeal on social media. Michelle and John Wylie were puzzled by a man in their 2021 wedding pictures whom neither they nor any of their guests could identify. The man, Andrew Hillhouse, has now come forward, explaining he had accidentally attended the wrong wedding after his partner gave him the incorrect venue name. He realized his mistake only when the bride walked down the aisle and, not wanting to cause a disruption, stayed through the ceremony and even the group photos.</p>

          <p>In the immediate aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, President Trump and many conservative figures quickly blamed "radical left political violence" before facts about the shooter emerged. This article analyzes the rhetoric, arguing that it selectively ignores the well-documented history of far-right domestic terrorism, which has significantly outpaced violence from other groups in recent decades. The author contends that by framing political violence as a uniquely left-wing problem, Trump creates a distorted narrative that serves his political agenda. This framing could justify future crackdowns on political opponents while emboldening extremist elements on the right.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's new striker, Yoane Wissa, has demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout his career, most notably after surviving a horrific acid attack in 2021. The assault, which occurred just before his move to the Premier League, could have ended his career, but his determination saw him recover and continue his ascent in professional football. His recent £55m transfer from Brentford was contentious, as Wissa publicly pushed for the move, souring his legacy with some fans. However, those who know him cite his unwavering focus and will to succeed as key traits that have propelled him from France's second division to the Champions League.</p>

The company recently cut 9,000 jobs and now requires workers near its headquarters to be in the office three days a week. While Wall Street has applauded Microsoft's financial performance and AI strategy, the changes have caused friction with some members of its workforce who feel a loss of autonomy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has abruptly pulled a state bill that would have significantly altered Measure ULA, the city's "mansion tax" on high-value property sales. The proposed legislation aimed to reduce the tax burden on the sale of newly constructed commercial and apartment buildings to address what backers called unintended consequences slowing housing production. However, the bill faced strong opposition from the coalition that originally passed Measure ULA, who argued it would gut funding for homelessness programs. Citing the need for further amendments, the mayor plans to reintroduce an improved version of the bill in January.</p>
