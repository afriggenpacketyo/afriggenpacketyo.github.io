          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that Iran's nuclear ambitions were "obliterated" following U.S. strikes on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. Hegseth emphasized that the mission, authorized by President Trump, was a precision operation to neutralize threats to U.S. national interests and the collective self-defense of troops and ally Israel. He echoed Trump's remarks about the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, though the full extent of the damage remains unclear. Hegseth praised the operation as focused, powerful, and clear, reiterating that it was not about regime change in Iran, but about eliminating the threat of nuclear proliferation.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials disclosed new details about the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine describing it as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The mission, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, requiring multiple in-flight refuelings. The U.S. also launched Tomahawk cruise missiles from a submarine against a site in Isfahan, and deployed deception tactics to ensure the safety of the aircraft. Caine warned Iran against retaliation and Defense Secretary Hegseth called the attack an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing it did not target Iranian troops or civilians.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation from the White House, calling the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites a "spectacular military success" and warning of further attacks if Iran does not "make peace." Trump stated the objective was to end the nuclear threat posed by Iran, and thanked U.S. service members and the Israeli military for their contributions. The strikes targeted sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with American B-2 bombers dropping 14 "bunker-buster" bombs on Fordo and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles hitting the other sites. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes, but claimed they would not stop Iran from advancing its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The US has bombed three of the Islamic Republic's key nuclear sites in Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz, following Israeli strikes on Iran which have lasted for over a week, prompting a war between the two countries. The attack on the underground fuel enrichment site at Fordo used so-called bunker-buster bombs that are designed to penetrate into the ground before detonating, US media reported. The US is the only country with military capability of dropping the weapon.  US President Donald Trump has claimed that the Iranian facilities were "completely and fully obliterated" in the attacks, claims that have yet to be verified.  Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said there were no immediate signs of radioactive leakage at the three locations following the strikes.</p>

          <p>This article argues that while striking Iran was the right decision, President Trump did it in the wrong way, without Congress and with questionable leadership. It asserts that Iran initiated the conflict by pursuing nuclear weapons and supporting terror groups. While the strike may have positive consequences, such as defying Putin and sidelining reactionary elements, it also carries dangerous implications, including expanding presidential war-making power and undermining democratic norms. The author expresses concern about Trump's authoritarian tendencies and the potential for the conflict to escalate.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced the recovery of the remains of three more hostages from the Gaza Strip, identified as Yonatan Samerano, Ofra Keidar, and Shay Levinson, who were killed during the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that the campaign to return all abductees will continue, and the Hostages Families Forum emphasized that bringing back the remaining hostages is key to achieving victory. The recovery comes amid ongoing conflict, with Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza reportedly killing over 55,000 Palestinians. The Oct. 7 attack and Israel's subsequent offensive ignited a chain of events leading to the recent U.S. strikes on Iran.</p>

          <p>Most people in Japan are worried about how the outbreak of war in the Middle East could impact their daily lives, given the country's heavy dependence on the region for oil, a Kyodo News survey showed Sunday.  In the nationwide telephone poll, a total of 83.7 percent of respondents said they have concerns about the repercussions of the escalating Israel-Iran war.  Asked about which party they would support in the election for the House of Councillors, or upper house, 26.7 percent said they would vote for the LDP in the proportional representation segment, while 11.1 percent expressed support for the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.  The two-day survey from Saturday was conducted to gauge voters' views on the government's performance and policies as well as key societal issues after the end of the ordinary Diet session.</p>

          <p>A 68-year-old Mexican-born man died while being transported from a local jail to a federal detention center, raising concerns about the safety of ICE detainees. Experts warn that more deaths are likely amid the current administration’s “mass deportation” push across the US, and the death occurred as private companies with little oversight are increasingly tasked with transporting more immigration detainees across the US. The man's family reported that he had no health conditions before being detained but was put in a wheelchair during his time in jail, and was unable to speak during a family visit. The family is seeking answers and has hired an attorney to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death.</p>

          <p>Subway surfing, a dangerous practice of riding on top of subway trains, continues to claim young lives in New York City. Arrests for subway surfing are up 70% from the prior year, with the average age of those apprehended being 14. The 2025 anti-surfing campaign includes announcements in subways and drones in the sky, but city and state administrators know they’re up against a powerful promoter – namely the peer value of subway surfing videos on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and other social media platforms. Efforts to hold New York’s city authorities accountable are underway, with a lawsuit planned against the city, the board of education and the MTA.</p>
