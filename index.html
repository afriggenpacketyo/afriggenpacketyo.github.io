          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has launched an investigation into the student-run Harvard Law Review, raising concerns about the wielding of power for political purposes. The probe stems from accusations that the law review is advancing a specific political agenda, prompting scrutiny from federal authorities. This move highlights the ongoing tensions between academic institutions and the government, as the administration intensifies its focus on perceived ideological biases. The investigation's outcome could have significant implications for academic freedom and the autonomy of student publications. </p>

The reprieve provides older student borrowers with more time to become current on their loans and avoid reduced benefit checks. </p>
