          <p>This article details Donald Trump's extensive and often contentious history with the National Football League, spanning over 40 years. It covers his early attempts to buy an NFL team, his ownership of the USFL's New Jersey Generals, and his failed anti-trust lawsuit against the league in the 1980s. The piece also examines his presidential-era clashes, including his vocal criticism of players kneeling during the national anthem and recent political maneuvering involving championship team visits to the White House and a proposed Washington Commanders stadium deal. This complex relationship has consistently intertwined with his public and political career, reflecting his ongoing engagement with the league.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister summoned a top U.S. diplomat following reports that individuals connected to former President Donald Trump were conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. The public broadcaster DR alleged these operations aimed to weaken Greenland's ties with Denmark and gather information on U.S.-friendly locals and Trump opponents. The U.S. State Department confirmed the meeting, asserting it doesn't control private citizens' actions, while a White House official downplayed Danish concerns. This incident highlights ongoing geopolitical interest in the strategically located Arctic island, which Trump had previously expressed a desire to acquire.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief trade negotiator abruptly postponed a trip to Washington, urging the U.S. to accelerate the implementation of a tariffs deal announced in July. Tokyo is specifically requesting an amendment to a presidential order to correct "reciprocal tariffs," which mistakenly imposed an additional 15% on Japanese goods instead of a 15% total. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi stressed the necessity of sincere and prompt action, affirming the deal's critical role for the economic security of both nations. This development highlights the persistent challenges in trade relations, despite the Trump administration's expressed intent to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>Rwanda has accepted the first group of seven individuals deported from the U.S. under a new agreement, with some expressing a desire to return to their home countries and others opting to build new lives in Rwanda. This arrangement is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to negotiate controversial third-country deportation deals. Rwanda justifies its participation by citing its own history with displacement and promises comprehensive support, including training, healthcare, and accommodation for the arrivals. However, human rights experts have voiced significant concerns, suggesting these deportations could potentially violate international law by exposing individuals to risks of torture or other abuses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British-made car sales to the U.S. increased by 6.8% in July, marking a positive shift after three months of decline, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). This rise follows a May agreement between the UK and U.S. to lower import taxes on British cars from 27.5% to 10%, effective from the end of June. The SMMT credits the new deal for the improvement, despite broader struggles in UK car manufacturing due to factors like higher labor costs and Brexit. The U.S. remains a crucial market for British premium brands, underscoring the deal's significance.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, endured a massive Russian drone and missile attack, resulting in at least 14 deaths, including three children, and dozens wounded. President Zelenskyy condemned the "horrific and deliberate killing of civilians," urging a firm global response and new sanctions against Russia for its refusal to end the war. This significant assault, one of the largest since the 2022 invasion, comes amidst struggling U.S.-led peace efforts and renewed calls for Ukraine to be allowed to strike inside Russia. The attack damaged numerous civilian buildings and an EU Delegation office.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes the NFL's continued use of "woke" end zone messages like "End Racism" and "Stop Hate," which began during the Black Lives Matter movement. The author argues these messages are outdated and that the league should either remove political statements entirely or add "Back the Blue" to support police. The article contends that Colin Kaepernick's previous criticisms of police and Commissioner Roger Goodell's endorsement of those views harmed the NFL's relationship with law enforcement.

Constituents express fears about meeting work hour demands, especially those in irregular employment.

          <p>President Trump's executive order is ending the "de minimis" trade exemption, which previously allowed small-value imports (up to $800) to enter the U.S. without tariffs or extensive customs inspection. This rule, once a minor provision, became a major commercial import route for online retailers, leading to billions of packages annually. Critics argued it hurt U.S. businesses and allowed unsafe or illegal goods to enter the market. The change, effective Friday, means all imports will now face duties and tariffs, causing international shipping services to pause deliveries as they adapt to new paperwork and payment processes.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey announced he will boycott the upcoming state banquet for Donald Trump's visit to the UK, citing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. While acknowledging the honor of a royal invitation, Sir Ed stated his decision aims to send a message to Trump, emphasizing the former president's significant influence over key regional actors to halt the conflict and secure hostage releases. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticized the boycott as "appalling judgment" and "pathetic gesture politics."

Photographer Ray Giubilo captured the "half terrifying and half sublime" image by fluke, attributing it to Paolini being off-balance during a forehand stroke. Giubilo, a veteran sports photographer, immediately recognized the shot's greatness, and Paolini herself praised it as "maybe the picture of the year."

This incident, which could cost £850m, involved an official emailing a spreadsheet with a hidden tab containing sensitive information. Internal emails also show concerns among Information Commissioner's Office staff about the decision not to fine the MoD, despite a smaller breach leading to a fine in 2023. The MoD claims improved data security, but the ICO states more action is needed.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's engagement news sparked widespread emotional reactions from fans, illustrating the concept of "parasocial relationships"—one-sided friendly or romantic feelings for a celebrity. This article explains how constant exposure to celebrities' private lives, often via social media, creates an illusion of intimacy. While these relationships can offer a sense of connection and community, particularly online, experts like psychologist Sonia Jaeger and sociologist Arthur C. Brooks emphasize they cannot replace reciprocal, real-life friendships. They serve as a "fast food" for connection, tasting good but lacking nutritional content.</p>

          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK under an import tax exemption more than doubled last year, reaching £3bn, largely driven by e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. This surge has prompted a UK government review of rules that allow imports worth £135 or less to avoid customs duties. UK businesses and industry groups are demanding swifter action, arguing that the exemption creates unfair competition for High Street retailers and exposes consumers to potentially unsafe products. This article highlights growing concerns over the impact of these low-value imports on the domestic economy and consumer safety.</p>
