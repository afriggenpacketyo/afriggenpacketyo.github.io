          <p>Owen Farrell will captain the British and Irish Lions for their match against a First Nations and Pasifika XV, marking his first start of the tour. The team features a completely different starting lineup from the first Test against Australia, with nine Scots included in the 23-man squad. This match serves as an opportunity for players on the fringe of the Test team, like Blair Kinghorn and Farrell himself, to press their case for selection in the upcoming second Test. The fixture is also a historic first, celebrating First Nations and Pacific Islands culture in rugby.</p>

          <p>The family of legendary England batter Graham Thorpe, who died by suicide last year, will celebrate his life during the fifth Test against India at The Oval. The event, held on what would have been his 56th birthday, aims to raise money for the mental health charity Mind and combat the stigma surrounding suicide. Thorpe's family spoke about his struggles with depression, which worsened following his coaching career, and emphasized the importance of seeking help early. The initiative will also rename Mind's 'Bat and Chat' cricket sessions to 'Thorpey's Bat and Chat' to expand mental health support nationwide.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 01:21:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, particularly within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework and stable monetary policy. The currency has shown defensive characteristics during financial stress and has strengthened against the US dollar. However, its path to becoming a global safe haven like the Japanese yen or Swiss franc is hindered by the relatively small size of its market and its managed exchange rate, which limits liquidity. Despite these hurdles, experts believe the SGD plays a vital role in diversification and could grow in status over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Armed Bedouin clans have withdrawn from the Druze-majority city of Sweida in southern Syria following a week of deadly clashes and a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. The conflict, which killed hundreds and displaced over 128,000 people, was sparked by sectarian tensions and kidnappings. Humanitarian aid convoys are now entering the city, though tensions remain high, with some Bedouin fighters refusing to leave until a rival Druze leader surrenders. U.S. envoy Tom Barrack has called for an immediate end to the hostilities, stating the violence has overshadowed cautious optimism about Syria's post-war transition.</p>

          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are being shut down due to severe fire safety issues, leaving residents homeless and facing significant financial loss. Over the years, leaseholders and taxpayers have spent up to £1 million on failed repairs, safety patrols, and other costs for the Beech Rise and Willow Rise buildings. Residents describe years of neglect by a series of management companies and complex offshore ownership structures that left them responsible for escalating service charges while the buildings deteriorated. The situation is being called a catastrophic failure of the UK's leasehold system, trapping homeowners in an impossible situation.</p>

This incident highlights a growing wave of cyberattacks targeting UK businesses, with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warning that criminals are exploiting simple vulnerabilities.

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being pulled into an MRI machine by a 9kg (20lb) metal weight-training chain he was wearing around his neck. The man, Keith McAllister, had entered the MRI room at a New York clinic to help his wife, who was undergoing a scan. The machine's powerful magnetic field immediately snatched the chain, pulling him violently into the scanner. According to his wife, he suffered a series of heart attacks after being freed and was later pronounced dead. Such accidents are rare but highlight the extreme dangers of bringing magnetic materials near MRI machines.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing tensions, China and the U.S. are pursuing starkly different energy policies, particularly concerning the green transition. As global demand for electricity rises, driven by technologies like AI, China is aggressively investing in and expanding its renewable energy capacity to secure a technological and economic edge. In contrast, the Trump administration is canceling tax credits for wind and solar, labeling them as unreliable and prioritizing fossil fuels. This article contrasts the two superpowers' approaches, framing the energy race as a central component of their broader geopolitical and technological rivalry.</p>

In the past, she publicly supported Bernie Sanders for president in 2015, citing his refusal to take corporate campaign money. More recently, Rousey revealed she made a promise to UFC President Dana White not to speak negatively about Donald Trump, out of loyalty for the support Trump gave the UFC in its early days. Rousey emphasized that everyone's right to vote is their own and encouraged people to participate in the democratic process, particularly in local elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump is threatening to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team changes its name back to the Redskins. In a series of social media posts, Trump claimed there is a 'big clamoring' for the change and that he would not approve a stadium deal otherwise. The team dropped its previous name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It is unclear how Trump could intervene in the project, which Congress already approved legislation for last year.</p>

The incident occurred near Minot Air Force Base, home to a B-52 squadron. It is unclear how close the two aircraft came to each other.

          <p>Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with over 3,800 cases reported in 2025, nearly three times the number in the U.S. The provinces of Ontario and Alberta are the hardest hit, with the spread linked to low vaccination rates, particularly within some conservative Mennonite communities, and fueled by post-pandemic anti-vaccine misinformation. Public health officials are struggling to contain the highly contagious virus, noting that the reported figures likely represent only the 'tip of the iceberg.' Experts stress that increasing immunization rates is the only way to stop the outbreak.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over looming trade tariffs, there are numerous positive catalysts supporting the stock market, according to this market analysis. Strong corporate earnings, coupled with significant economic stimulus from the Trump administration's 'big beautiful bill'—including extended tax cuts and new deductions—are expected to boost the economy. Other bullish factors include business tax relief, corporate re-shoring, massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the grid, and a revitalized energy sector. The article suggests these pro-growth policies create a favorable environment for stocks that outweighs the risks of trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued a stark warning that people retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless action is taken to boost retirement savings. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) found that nearly half of working-age adults, especially the self-employed and low earners, are not saving into a private pension. To address this shortfall, the government is reviving the Pensions Commission, which will report in 2027 on strategies to improve savings rates and build a national consensus on the future of private pensions.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ predicts that the technology will cross a critical threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. The company's CEO, Xiang Jingen, compared the current state of quantum computing to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, on the cusp of a major transition from niche to broad applicability. SpinQ currently produces small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful industrial-grade systems with up to 20 qubits. The firm's optimistic forecast signals growing confidence in the rapid advancement and commercialization of this transformative technology.</p>
