          <h2>Political Opponents Criticize Andrew Cuomo's Re-entry into New York City Mayoral Race</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Candidates from all major parties have united in their criticism of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's decision to re-enter the New York City mayoral race as an independent. Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa both suggested that voters are seeking to move past Cuomo's brand of politics, a sentiment echoed by incumbent Mayor Eric Adams. Cuomo's campaign responded by highlighting that he received more primary votes than Adams did in his last election. The former governor has framed his candidacy as a necessary measure to prevent a socialist from winning, proposing that other candidates should eventually unite behind the strongest contender to oppose Mamdani.</p>

          <p>NBA veteran Brook Lopez has officially signed a two-year, $18-million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, citing the opportunity to compete for a championship alongside stars like Kawhi Leonard and James Harden. A Southern California native, Lopez expressed his astonishment at the franchise's growth and his eagerness to contribute to its success. Although he has been a career starter, he is prepared to accept any role, including coming off the bench. Lopez is particularly enthusiastic about the possibility of playing alongside fellow center Ivica Zubac, envisioning a dominant defensive and complementary offensive pairing that could significantly benefit the team.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 18:48:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a stunning display, the Australian cricket team bowled out the West Indies for just 27 runs, securing a 176-run victory and a 3-0 series sweep in Jamaica. This total represents the second-lowest score in Test cricket history and the worst since 1955. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was instrumental, taking six wickets for nine runs, including a remarkable five wickets in just 15 balls, which also pushed him past the 400-wicket milestone in his career. West Indies captain Roston Chase expressed deep disappointment over the team's recurring poor batting performance, which overshadowed their earlier success in limiting Australia's second innings to only 121 runs.</p>

          <p>Owen Halls, a 22-year-old former police officer from Neenah, Wisconsin, has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of possessing child pornography. Halls was fired from his probationary position in March following the accusations, which originated from a CyberTip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The tip identified child sexual abuse material uploaded to the messaging app Kik, which investigators traced to an address where Halls resided. According to the criminal complaint, Halls acknowledged using messaging apps for explicit content and did not deny knowledge of the illegal material. If convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum of three years in prison for each count.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Major League Baseball is missing a significant opportunity by not having Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, its two most popular home-run hitters, participate in the annual Home Run Derby. Ohtani cited the physical toll of the event, based on his 2021 experience, while Judge stated he would only participate if it were held in New York. The author suggests that MLB should be flexible and even allow the players to help write the rules to secure their involvement. The piece contends that their participation would not only boost viewership but also elevate the profiles of other talented players in the competition, which is crucial for the sport's diminishing cultural relevance.</p>

The California Department of Cannabis Control confirmed it opened an active probe into Glass House, one of the state's largest legal producers, after receiving a complaint about the employment of minors. This follows a Department of Homeland Security raid where 361 people were arrested, and officials reported rescuing at least 14 migrant children from potential exploitation and trafficking. Glass House has denied ever employing minors, while state officials reiterated that employing individuals under 21 in the cannabis industry is strictly illegal.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent shift to a tougher policy on Russia's war in Ukraine is reportedly driven by personal frustration and a sense of humiliation, rather than a strategic change of heart. According to White House sources, Trump feels that Vladimir Putin has ignored his repeated pleas to end the conflict, making him look weak and like a junior partner in their relationship. This culminated in Trump authorizing a significant shipment of defensive weapons to Ukraine via NATO and threatening new tariffs. The analysis suggests that Putin's defiance, especially after Trump had banked on their personal relationship to broker a peace deal, has personally insulted the president, prompting the more aggressive posture.</p>

Proponents, like the Florida Tomato Exchange, argue the tariff is a victory for American farmers who have been hurt by artificially low prices.

          <p>Tesla is defending its Autopilot technology in a Miami federal court in a wrongful death lawsuit stemming from a 2019 crash. The lawsuit was filed by the family of Naibel Benavides Leon, a 22-year-old killed when a 2019 Model S using Autopilot crashed into a parked truck she was standing near. The plaintiffs allege that design defects in the Autopilot system failed to detect the obstacle, leading to the fatal collision. Tesla argues that the system is not fully self-driving and that the driver, who was reportedly distracted by his phone, remains responsible, calling the incident a tragic case of distracted driving.</p>

          <p>Teddy Bridgewater, a former NFL quarterback, has been suspended from his head coaching job at Miami Northwestern High School amid an investigation into allegations of providing impermissible benefits to players. Bridgewater, an alumnus of the school, confirmed the suspension but stated his commitment to the program, even if it means volunteering from the stands. He reportedly posted on social media about paying for services like meals and Uber rides for his players last season. The Florida High School Athletic Association is currently gathering information on the matter. Bridgewater led the team to a state championship in his first year as coach in 2024.</p>

The grueling 135-mile race starts in Death Valley, 282 feet below sea level, and ascends to an elevation of 8,360 feet at the Mt. Whitney trailhead, with temperatures often exceeding 120°F. Becker finished the race with about three hours to spare before the 48-hour cutoff, a redemptive achievement after he narrowly missed the cutoff time in 2022. He credited his experienced coaching crew for his success, demonstrating that age is not a barrier to achieving extraordinary endurance feats.</p>

Over 40 ice cream companies have committed to the change. The announcement also included the FDA's approval of a new plant-based dye, "gardenia blue," as an alternative. This move continues the administration's pattern of working with industries on voluntary health-focused initiatives and aligns with its support for dairy products in national dietary guidelines.</p>

CEO Brian Niccol stated the change is necessary to help the company perform its best work and navigate its current business challenges.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent social media post in which he suggested he was considering stripping comedian Rosie O'Donnell of her U.S. citizenship. The author argues that this threat, seemingly made solely because O'Donnell is a frequent critic, represents a brazen attack on the First Amendment. While the legal possibility of revoking a native-born citizen's status is virtually non-existent, the act of threatening it is seen as a disturbing attempt to normalize the punishment of political speech. The piece contends that this fits a broader pattern of the president viewing both free speech and citizenship as conditional privileges that he can revoke at will, posing a significant threat to democratic norms.</p>

At least 130 people were killed in the initial disaster, including dozens of children at a summer camp, and about 160 people remain missing.

This was Urías's second suspension under the policy, stemming from a September 2023 incident for which he later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges.

In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision "indefensible" and a "grave" threat to the separation of powers.
