          <p>The Quad nationsâ€”US, Japan, India, and Australiaâ€”have launched a new initiative to secure stable supply chains for critical minerals essential for modern technology. This move is widely seen as a strategic effort to reduce dependence on China, which currently dominates the mineral processing market. The joint statement highlighted concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions, emphasizing the need for diversification. The initiative also involves collaboration with around 30 to 40 companies from the Quad countries to strengthen the strategic stability of the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking their legal status and work permits, a plan that was set to take effect in September. The judge stated that the DHS Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its previously established expiration date in February 2026. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, asserting the executive branch's authority over immigration laws.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a halt to some weapons shipments to Ukraine, citing concerns over the depletion of U.S. military stockpiles. The decision, which follows a Department of Defense review, is framed as putting "America's interests first."

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic shift for the company's contract chip manufacturing, or foundry, business. The potential change involves deprioritizing the "18A" manufacturing process, a key initiative under the previous CEO, for external customers due to its waning appeal and production delays. Instead, the company may focus more resources on the next-generation "14A" process, where it hopes to gain a competitive edge over rivals like TSMC. This move aims to attract major clients such as Apple and Nvidia and represents a major pivot to revive the U.S. chipmaker's fortunes.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government experienced a significant political setback, forced into a U-turn on welfare reform after facing a large rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The chaotic events in the House of Commons drew comparisons to the turbulent Brexit debates, as the government lost control of its agenda despite a substantial majority. Downing Street was slow to recognize the depth of anger within the party over proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). The forced climbdown has weakened the Prime Minister's authority and raised questions about his leadership and the stability of his government.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border reached a new all-time monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 apprehensions recorded by Border Patrol. This continues a significant decline in illegal immigration, which the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation policies and enforcement measures. These policies include swift deportations without asylum hearings, an end to migrant releases, and a messaging campaign encouraging self-deportation. The low numbers are a stark contrast to the record highs seen under the previous administration, reflecting a major shift in U.S. immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 7% amid a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, just before the release of its second-quarter delivery numbers. The dispute centers on Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk criticized for increasing the national debt and cutting support for renewable energy and electric vehicles. These cuts could negatively impact Tesla's sales and its energy division. Trump retaliated by suggesting Musk could lose significant government contracts for his companies, like SpaceX, adding investor uncertainty as Wall Street already anticipates a 13% year-over-year decline in Tesla's vehicle deliveries.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. The proposal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, would provide a window to work towards a permanent end to the war. This development comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The conflict, which began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in a devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and it remains unclear if Hamas will agree to the terms.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has enacted the nation's toughest law restricting PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," found in many consumer products and linked to serious health issues. The legislation is named "Amara's Law" after Amara Strande, who testified before lawmakers in 2023 while dying from a rare liver cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. 3M, the company that developed the chemicals, has agreed to stop producing them and pay $850 million for cleanup, marking a major victory for public health and environmental advocates.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing the financial strain of 153 clergy sexual abuse claims. Church officials state the move is necessary to manage the claims equitably while continuing its ministry. However, attorneys for the abuse survivors have criticized the filing as a delay tactic to avoid accountability and justice for victims, many of whom were children. The lawsuits surged after a California law temporarily lifted the statute of limitations for civil sexual assault claims, and critics allege the diocese is using bankruptcy to shield its assets and prolong legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>A new study in The Lancet medical journal estimates that the Trump administration's decision to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could result in 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. The research found that USAID programs have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades, particularly by reducing mortality from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. The administration argues the agency is inefficient, but researchers say their analysis shows that for a small taxpayer cost, the aid has had a substantial life-saving impact. The study highlights a stark contrast between data-driven health outcomes and the administration's policy direction.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay an Â£8.4m fee to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold a month early from Liverpool is already proving to be a sound investment. The right-back provided a crucial assist in the Club World Cup, and the resulting goal advanced the team, securing an extra Â£10 million in prize money, more than covering his early signing fee. While questions remain about his defensive adjustment to a new system under coach Xabi Alonso, his attacking prowess is already making an impact. Teammates and pundits have praised his quality, suggesting he is a great fit for the Spanish club's attacking style.</p>

          <h2>Israel's Mossad Uses Social Media to Taunt Iran Over 'Secret' Military Commander</h2>

          <p>Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, has intensified its online psychological operations against Iran, using its Persian-language X account to taunt Tehran. After an Iranian news agency reported the identity of a new top military commander would be kept secret, Mossad publicly claimed to know exactly who the individual is. This follows another post where Mossad asserted that Iran's Supreme Leader had "surrendered" by agreeing to negotiations, calling it "the beginning of the end" for the regime. The Farsi-language influence campaign is a clear attempt to sow discord and undermine the Iranian government's authority.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Mayor Accuses Trump Administration of an 'All-Out Assault' on the City</h2>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has condemned a Department of Justice lawsuit against the city's sanctuary policies as part of an "all-out assault on Los Angeles" by the Trump administration. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate local laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Mayor Bass criticized federal agents for "randomly grabbing people" to meet what she called a quota set by White House officials. The clash comes amid a series of immigration raids across Southern California that have spurred protests and widespread fear, with the White House defending the actions as necessary law enforcement.</p>
