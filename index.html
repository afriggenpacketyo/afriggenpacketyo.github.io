          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new tariffs on over 60 countries, set to take effect in seven days. The duties, which range from 10% to as high as 41% for nations like Syria, represent a significant escalation in the administration's trade strategy. While some partners like the EU and Japan have secured deals with lower rates, Canada will see its tariff rate jump to 35%. The move aims to reshape international commerce and generate revenue, but economists express concern over the potential for increased economic uncertainty and higher costs for businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's handling of an increasing number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, he argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass Congress, courts must respond to the resulting legal challenges. Kavanaugh stated that the court has implemented more processes to handle these urgent cases and emphasized the collegiality among the justices despite differing views. He acknowledged that criticism is part of the job, comparing it to the scrutiny faced by sports referees.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) under President Biden, had her faculty appointment at West Point rescinded. The decision by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll followed social media posts from a pro-Trump activist who accused Easterly of undermining the current administration. Easterly described the situation as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage," while the Pentagon stated its focus is on turning cadets into "warriors and leaders," not "censorship activists." This marks the second time an activist's public call has led to a high-profile dismissal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling extends their legal status and deportation protections while the case proceeds, with the judge citing the risk of significant harm if they were forced to return. In a strongly worded order, Judge Trina L. Thompson suggested the administration's decision was motivated by racial animus and failed to properly assess the current unsafe conditions in the immigrants' home countries.</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's updated tariff list, which offered lower rates than initially feared for some nations. Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief, with leaders calling it "good news" that reflects a strong partnership with the U.S. Taiwan's president noted the new 20% tariff is an improvement but stated that negotiations are ongoing for further reductions. While some rates were lowered, the executive order also introduced a new 40% tariff on all transshipped goods, creating continued uncertainty for regional trade and supply chains.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers from President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party have approved constitutional reforms that permit indefinite presidential reelection and extend presidential terms from five to six years. The move solidifies Bukele's power, building on a controversial 2021 Supreme Court ruling that allowed him to run for a second term despite a previous ban. Opposition lawmakers condemned the changes, warning that the accumulation of power weakens democracy and fosters corruption. Supporters, however, argued the decision returns power to the Salvadoran people, who have overwhelmingly backed Bukele's hardline security policies.</p>

Harris explained her recent decision not to run for California governor was driven by a desire to step away from the system for now, though she affirmed she will always remain part of the fight for her principles. She stated that while she once believed the nation's systems were strong enough to defend fundamental principles, she no longer feels that is the case.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell suggests that the modern potato evolved from an ancient ancestor of the tomato around 9 million years ago. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's origins, as its closest wild relative does not produce the starchy tubers we eat. The research indicates that a hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a wild potato species combined two key genes. One gene, from the tomato, signaled the plant to form tubers, while another, from the wild potato, controlled their growth, together creating the vegetable known today.</p>

The operation involves ship-to-ship transfers of crude oil in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, with tankers turning off their transponders and obscuring their names to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which reportedly generates billions for Iran, undermines U.S. efforts to curb Tehran's nuclear program.

Currently, UK drivers must self-declare medical conditions and renew their license every three years after age 70, with no mandatory testing. Critics argue this system is inadequate, as many are unaware of their legal duty or reluctant to stop driving, and are pushing for mandatory medical referrals and vision checks.</p>

          <p>Apple reported strong fiscal third-quarter results, with revenue growing 10% to $94.04 billion, significantly outpacing estimates. Both iPhone and Services divisions showed robust growth, with the company setting a new all-time high for its installed base of active devices. Despite the positive financial performance, the stock saw a muted reaction as investors await more clarity on the company's artificial intelligence strategy. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed Apple's commitment to AI but offered few new details, leaving the company in a "show me" position in a market heavily focused on AI developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be erected on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This will be the first monument at the location to honor an individual African American, joining statues of white men, many with ties to the Confederacy. The bipartisan effort to recognize Smalls celebrates his journey from slavery to a Union naval hero and a champion for civil rights. The 12-foot statue is being created by artist Basil Watson to symbolize Smalls' courageous life and his rise as a pioneering statesman.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policy of deporting convicted criminals to third-party African nations is drawing alarm from human rights groups and legal experts. The US has sent non-citizens from countries like Mexico and Yemen to Eswatini and South Sudan, nations with which they have no connection. Critics argue these removals could violate the international law principle of non-refoulement, which forbids sending individuals to unsafe countries. The deals, which are largely secret, raise questions about due process for the deportees and the motivations for host countries, some of which have poor human rights records, to accept them.</p>

          <p>In the first federal trial of its kind, plaintiffs are seeking $345 million in damages from Tesla over a fatal 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system. The lawsuit alleges that a Model S driver, believing the system would brake for obstacles, accelerated through an intersection and killed a 22-year-old woman. Lawyers for the victim's family argue that Tesla knew about dangerous defects in its system and that CEO Elon Musk's public statements encouraged over-reliance on the technology. Tesla's defense counters that the driver was at fault and that a ruling against the company would stifle life-saving technological development.</p>

          <p>Two senior U.S. officials are making a highly unusual visit to a food distribution site in Gaza, reflecting growing American concern over the severe humanitarian crisis there. The visit by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee comes as aid workers on the ground, including the head of a UN agency, warn of a "politically manmade famine" where people are beginning to die of hunger. President Trump has expressed frustration with the situation, blaming Hamas for stealing aid, though U.S. analysis has not found evidence of systemic theft. The visit occurs amid heavy international pressure on Israel to allow more aid into the territory.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and profit, driven by strong performance in its e-commerce and advertising businesses. However, a slight revenue beat from its AWS cloud unit and a mixed forecast for third-quarter operating income disappointed investors, causing the stock to fall in after-hours trading. While the company projects healthy revenue growth, it is also increasing its capital expenditure plans to support AI demand. The results highlight the continued strength of Amazon's core businesses, but also the market's high expectations, particularly for its high-margin cloud division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts are expressing concern about the rising popularity of caffeine pouches among teenagers in the U.S., a trend that may soon spread to the UK. These small, teabag-like pouches are placed in the mouth for a quick caffeine hit, with some containing as much as two cups of coffee. The products are promoted on social media for boosting gym performance or alertness for exams, but health professionals warn of the risks of excessive caffeine intake. High doses can lead to rapid heart rate, anxiety, and other negative side effects, and the discreet nature of the pouches makes them easy to hide from parents and teachers.</p>
