          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals of the French Open, continuing his pursuit of a record 25th Grand Slam singles title. Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, overcoming moments where he felt "a little bit flat," as he put it. Norrie, despite playing in the last 16 at Roland Garros for the first time, couldn't capitalize on his opportunities, particularly in the second set when he led by a break. Djokovic is set to face Alexander Zverev in the next round, a rematch of their Australian Open semi-final where Zverev won after Djokovic suffered a hamstring injury.</p>

          <p>Opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June 2025 could be a prudent financial move, offering protection against potential interest rate cuts and stock market volatility. While the Federal Reserve has paused rate cuts in the first half of 2025, analysts anticipate cuts later in the summer, potentially reducing CD interest rates. A long-term CD provides a fixed interest rate, shielding savings from market instability and ensuring predictable returns. Depending on the term and rate, savers could earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest, making it a simple and safe way to grow money (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, 45, is facing multiple felony charges, including a federal hate crime, after allegedly attacking a pro-Israel rally in Boulder, Colorado, injuring eight people. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism, noting that Soliman used Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower. Witnesses reported hearing Soliman yell "Free Palestine" during the attack, and court documents reveal he admitted to researching how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and stated he wanted to kill all Zionist people. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were participating in a weekly event organized by Run for Their Lives to raise awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza.</p>

The list identified areas that DHS claimed undermined the rule of law and endangered Americans by harboring criminal illegal aliens. A senior Homeland Security official stated the list is under constant review and subject to change, with designations based on factors like self-identification as a sanctuary jurisdiction and non-compliance with federal immigration enforcement. Some jurisdictions on the list, such as Huntington Beach, California, disputed their inclusion, citing their opposition to sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>Campbell's CEO Mick Beekhuizen reports that consumers are cooking at home at the highest levels since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend, observed across all income brackets in the meals and beverages category, suggests people are tightening their wallets amid economic uncertainty. The increase in home cooking mirrors the economic anxieties experienced during the pandemic's initial phase, marked by widespread disruptions in spending and employment. The trend comes as economists and Wall Street analysts consider the potential impacts of President Trump's tariff policies on consumer sentiment and the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>The House Republicans' tax cut package is projected to increase the U.S. debt by trillions of dollars, raising concerns as the Senate begins considering the legislation. Economists warn that a higher national debt could lead to increased interest rates for consumer loans and reduced demand for U.S. Treasury bonds. The bill, called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," cuts taxes for households, primarily benefiting the wealthy, and offsets some of these cuts by reducing spending on safety-net programs. Critics argue that rising debt could spook investors and impact consumer borrowing (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Stephen Curry, despite being a four-time NBA champion and two-time MVP, admits to experiencing impostor syndrome, highlighting that even high-achievers face self-doubt. Curry, son of former NBA player Dell Curry, said he didn't grow up with the expectation of playing in the league due to his stature and underdog mentality. He has embraced his underdog status as motivation and found success both on and off the court, leading Thirty Ink and giving back through his nonprofit Eat. Learn. Play. Curry acknowledges the pressure of balancing his various commitments and strives to be a better husband and father while managing his public image.</p>
