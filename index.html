          <p>An Iraqi family, after enduring 15 years of legal limbo across Europe, has been granted provisional asylum in France, bringing a close to a period of immense hardship. This positive development comes over a year after the family suffered the tragic loss of their seven-year-old daughter, Sara, who suffocated during a perilous small boat crossing of the English Channel. Now residing in Rouvroy, the Alhashemi family has received official permission to remain for four years, enabling them to work legally and plan for a stable future. The family's journey from profound grief to renewed hope is further marked by the recent birth of a new baby girl, symbolizing a new beginning after years of uncertainty and loss.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda struck Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, featuring maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and moving at a rapid 29 mph. The National Hurricane Center issued warnings for the island, anticipating significant rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, which could lead to dangerous flash flooding and coastal storm surges. Michael Weeks, Bermuda's minister of national security, emphasized the seriousness of the threat, urging residents to prepare for the storm's impact. The hurricane is expected to weaken into an extratropical cyclone after passing the island, but swells are also affecting the U.S. East Coast, creating life-threatening surf conditions.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has formally rejected a proposal from Washington to shift half of its U.S.-bound semiconductor production to American soil, stating the topic was not even discussed during recent trade talks. According to Taiwan's top trade negotiator, the negotiations focused instead on lowering tariffs and reducing levies on Taiwanese exports. The '50-50' proposal, championed by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, aimed to reduce American reliance on Taiwan for critical chips. The idea has drawn sharp criticism from Taiwanese politicians, who view it as an attempt to undermine the island's vital tech industry and its 'Silicon Shield' defense strategy against potential aggression from China.</p>

The game began with a critical error by outfielder Teoscar Hernández, which led to a two-run lead for the Reds in the first inning. However, starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance over 6 ⅔ innings, stabilizing the game for Los Angeles. The offense rallied, with a key go-ahead double from Kiké Hernández in the fourth inning and a decisive four-run surge in the sixth, ultimately overcoming the early deficit to clinch the wild-card series.</p>

The collision did not cause significant disruptions to airport operations, and Delta is cooperating with the FAA and NTSB in the subsequent investigation into the event.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown poses an immediate threat to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which supports nearly 7 million people. Unlike larger programs such as Social Security, WIC's funding is not guaranteed and could run out within weeks, as the shutdown coincides with the start of the new fiscal year. If federal funds are exhausted, states would need to cover the costs, and some WIC offices may be forced to prioritize pregnant women while turning away preschool-age children. While the larger SNAP food aid program is secure for October, the shutdown could severely impact the health and nutrition of vulnerable families.</p>

The blast, which occurred as an individual was turning on the heating system for the season, caused a ventilation shaft connected to the boiler to collapse, sending bricks and debris onto the street below. Mayor Eric Adams visited the scene, praising the fact that a major disaster was averted.

Musk's wealth, which is heavily tied to his ownership stake in Tesla, was boosted by a more than 14% year-to-date gain in the company's shares.

However, his ANO party is unlikely to win an outright majority, forcing him to seek alliances with extremist parties that advocate for referendums on leaving the EU and NATO. Babis has publicly ruled out leaving the EU and has tried to distance himself from pro-Russian sentiment, but security analysts warn that a coalition with far-right or pro-Kremlin parties could undermine support for Ukraine and alter the Czech Republic's foreign policy.

          <p>In a new marketing campaign, the 133-year-old Maxwell House coffee brand has humorously rebranded itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to connect with a generation priced out of homeownership. The tongue-in-cheek advertisements acknowledge the unaffordability of the U.S. housing market, where the median age of first-time homebuyers has risen to a record high of 38. The campaign, designed by the Rethink advertising agency, aims to strengthen the brand's appeal among renters by offering the "same affordable coffee you love, now with an even more affordable name." The move reflects a broader cultural and economic shift where homeownership has become an increasingly distant goal for many Americans.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has once again dismissed a lawsuit filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind." Elden had claimed the image constituted child pornography and caused him lifelong harm, but Judge Fernando Olguin ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the photo pornographic, comparing it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." This marks the second time the case has been thrown out, with the judge freeing the surviving band members and Kurt Cobain's estate from what their lawyer described as a "meritless case" and "false allegations."</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has ruled against the full public release of graphic photos from the crime scene where Bryan Kohberger murdered four university students in 2022. Second District Judge Megan Marshall determined that releasing images showing the victims' bodies or surrounding blood would cause "extreme emotional distress" to their families and that this invasion of privacy outweighs the public's interest. The city of Moscow will be required to redact these specific elements from the records. The ruling balances transparency with the need to protect the victims' families from further trauma, while still allowing other non-graphic investigation records, such as videos and documents, to be made public.</p>

          <p>European asset management firm Amundi, which oversees €2.3 trillion, has significantly reduced its positions in Chinese equities, capitalizing on the recent market rally to reallocate funds into safer dividend stocks. The firm's deputy group CIO, Philippe d’Orgeval, expressed doubts about the sustainability of China's economic rebound, noting that the macro environment appears less supportive for equity markets. Amundi has trimmed what it considers "overvalued" Chinese stocks and shifted focus to the CSI 300 Dividend Index. This move reflects a broader market skepticism that the recent AI-driven surge in Chinese stocks may have outpaced underlying economic fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

The pledge cites the two nations' close cooperation and declares that an armed attack on Qatar would be considered a threat to U.S. peace and security. However, the legal weight of the order is unclear, as such defense agreements typically require Senate approval to be considered legally binding treaties.</p>

His remarks led two major carriers to temporarily pull the show, forcing ABC to suspend it before reversing course after public backlash. The hearing was requested by committee chair Ted Cruz, who called Carr's comments "dangerous as hell" and compared them to a mafioso's threat.</p>

Antoni's nomination was controversial due to his past criticisms of the BLS, including suggestions that the agency should suspend its monthly jobs report.

          <p>A central claim in the government shutdown debate is the Republican assertion that Democrats are seeking to provide free healthcare to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, a charge Democrats deny. This article clarifies that the Democratic funding proposal aims to restore Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens who are in the country legally or with government permission, such as refugees, asylees, and parolees. This would reverse a recent law signed by President Trump that significantly restricted their access. Federal law already prohibits taxpayer funds from covering non-emergency medical care for undocumented individuals, and the Democratic plan does not propose changing this long-standing rule, focusing instead on restoring previous eligibility standards.</p>
