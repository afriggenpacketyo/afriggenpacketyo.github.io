          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 04:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactively addressing supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly concerning rare earth minerals. After experiencing an export ban from China in 2010 due to a territorial dispute, Japan began diversifying its sources and investing in non-China rare-earth projects, notably Australia's Lynas. This has reduced Japan's reliance on Chinese rare earths from over 90% to below 60%. The country aims to further decrease this dependence to below 50% this year, showcasing a strategic effort to secure critical mineral supplies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article discusses the current trend of chastising female celebrities for perceived offenses against feminism. It argues that online platforms, driven by sexist algorithms, often promote extreme views rather than meaningful critique. The author suggests that these critiques often lack historical context and economic awareness, reverting to paternalistic tellings-off. The piece encourages a more nuanced discussion about the intersection of capitalism, desire, and domination in women's lives, rather than simply policing feminine sexuality.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen has appealed to the House of Lords not to block the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill was passed by the House of Commons but needs approval from the Lords to become law. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the Lords should scrutinize but not oppose the bill, while critics fear coercion of vulnerable individuals. The proposals include strict safeguards and assessments to ensure eligibility and prevent coercion.</p>

          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a prolonged downturn, further compounded by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates a significant decrease in demand for new homes in urban areas. The country's population is projected to fall, leading to a reduction in home demand. Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, stagnant incomes and job instability continue to discourage young people from having more children. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Due to a surge in rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo in May and plans to open three more by next February. This shift reflects a response to cost-sensitive consumers steering clear of rice amid record-high prices, prompting diversification in the food industry.</p>
