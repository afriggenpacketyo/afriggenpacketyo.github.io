          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 08:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex interplay of biological and psychosocial factors that influence the development of sexual orientation, emphasizing that it is not a choice but rather a stable aspect of identity formed during puberty. Experts highlight that no single factor determines sexual orientation, with research focusing on genes, hormones, and sociocultural influences. The piece underscores the importance of societal acceptance and support for individuals, particularly during adolescence, to foster self-esteem and prevent mental health issues, while also dispelling myths about conversion therapies and the notion of sexual orientation as a disease. It reinforces that human sexuality is diverse and that judging individuals based on their sexual orientation is unjust. </p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in northern Arkansas for Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault, who escaped from a high-security prison. Hardin, 56, was serving a lengthy sentence for the 2017 murder of James Appleton and a previously unsolved sexual assault case from 1997. He escaped dressed in a makeshift law enforcement uniform, pushing a utility cart through a controlled gate. Law enforcement officials consider Hardin extremely dangerous and are warning residents not to approach him, as roadblocks are in place and vehicles are being checked in the surrounding counties.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, marking a significant shift for the company and its customers. Starting Wednesday, passengers will have to pay to check their bags, aligning Southwest with other major airlines that already charge baggage fees. This change comes as Southwest introduces other modifications to its business model, including the elimination of open seating and the debut of basic-economy tickets. The decision to start charging for checked bags reflects the industry trend of generating revenue through ancillary fees, as baggage fees brought in nearly $7.3 billion for U.S. airlines last year.</p>

The khipus, some of which are being kept secret by village elders, could provide insights into the Inca's advanced civilization, which spanned 25,000 miles of roads and included advanced calendars and surgical techniques. Deciphering the khipus requires linguistic flair, statistical savvy, and deep cultural knowledge, but recent breakthroughs and collaborative efforts are revitalizing the field.

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker known for his powerful documentaries that challenged conventional narratives about World War II, has died at the age of 97. His most famous work, "The Sorrow and the Pity," debunked the myth of widespread French resistance to the Nazi occupation by interviewing ordinary citizens who collaborated or turned a blind eye to the persecution of Jews. Although controversial, the film paved the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France. Ophuls also directed "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," which won an Academy Award.</p>

The UN has criticized the plan, refusing to participate, and Wood's resignation adds further uncertainty to the initiative.

Experts warn that tariffs have already increased battery costs, and the proposed budget bill could eliminate key tax credits, jeopardizing the profitability of U.S. battery production. The article highlights the concerns of companies like Tesla and Fluence Energy, which depend on Chinese batteries and face uncertainty due to unpredictable trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli air strikes in Gaza resulted in the deaths of at least 54 Palestinians, many of whom were sheltering in a school in Gaza City, prompting widespread condemnation. The Israeli military claimed it targeted a Hamas command center within the school, while local reports described scenes of severe burns and fatalities among children and women. The strikes are part of an escalated offensive in northern Gaza, with the IDF reporting it struck 200 targets in 48 hours. The article also notes the killing of nine children in a separate strike and the deaths of two Red Cross staff members, further highlighting the conflict's devastating human toll.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, India has launched a diplomatic offensive by sending parliamentary delegations to 33 countries to garner support for its "zero tolerance" policy on terrorism. The delegations are equipped with dossiers detailing Pakistan's alleged support for militant groups and India's right to self-defense. This initiative aims to counter Pakistan's narrative and present India's military strikes as legitimate actions against terrorist infrastructure. Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack and accused India of unprovoked aggression, leading to a heightened state of tension between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Russia is intensifying its attacks on Ukraine, launching massive aerial bombardments and pressing its advantage as the United States reduces its involvement in the conflict. President Trump criticized Putin but did not indicate a willingness to provide additional military assistance to Ukraine. With diplomatic efforts appearing remote and the U.S. pulling back, Russia is exploiting the opportunity, leading to increased civilian casualties and infrastructure damage. Experts warn that Ukraine is running out of interceptor missiles, making it more vulnerable to Russian attacks, while the Kremlin expresses gratitude to Trump for pressing negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is employing a strategy called "legalistic noncompliance" to seemingly comply with court orders while effectively defying them. This involves using specious legal arguments to mask the administration's noncompliance, as seen in cases involving the Alien Enemies Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While appearing preferable to outright defiance, this approach lowers public awareness of noncompliance and could lead to courts legalizing partial noncompliance. By advancing outlandish arguments, the administration aims to wear down the courts and weaken judicial oversight, potentially paving the way for more overt defiance in the future.</p>

Terms like "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture" are replacing DEI in job titles and policies, with some U.S.-headquartered firms scaling back commitments and public celebrations of inclusion work. Experts say this shift is driven by fear of losing jobs or facing negative consequences for speaking out about race-related concerns.

A robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a difficult constitutional amendment process, a diverse and free press, a federal system of government, and strong speech protections all contribute to this resilience. These features empower resistance and check executive power, making it harder for a leader to consolidate authoritarian control. These aspects of American society make the system worth defending.</p>

Drawing on insights from indigenous cultures and the Rights of Nature movement, the author emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the interconnectedness of all things. Robert Macfarlane's book, "Is a River Alive?", is discussed as a means to unlearn damaging distinctions and appreciate the active role of natural elements in shaping our world.

          <p>The author argues for a new kind of Memorial Day to honor the countless civilian victims of war, who often outnumber combatant deaths, citing conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan as examples. While the US has Memorial Day to honor fallen soldiers, there are few monuments to commemorate civilian deaths, highlighting a gap in how society recognizes the human cost of war. The author suggests that honoring civilian deaths would show war for what it is: a waste, and that recognizing this would lead to a better understanding of the value of peace. This new kind of Memorial Day can begin here, and it would recognize the importance of the lives of non-combatants.</p>

          <p>Five years after anti-police protests, initiatives aimed at improving officer mental health are gaining traction, spurred by the exacerbated stress and resignations following the killing of George Floyd. Law enforcement agencies are implementing wellness programs, including peer support teams, mental health debriefings, and dedicated wellness rooms, to help officers cope with job-related trauma. States are also mandating and funding wellness initiatives, while organizations like Valor Station offer specialized treatment for first responders. These efforts aim to reduce the stigma of seeking help and promote a culture of mental wellness within law enforcement.</p>
