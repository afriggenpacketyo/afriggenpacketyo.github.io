          <p>Despite mortgage rates reaching their highest point since January, homebuyer demand increased by 2% compared to the previous week and 18% year-over-year.  This surge is attributed to increased housing inventory in many markets, supporting transaction volume despite economic uncertainty.  According to an MBA economist, purchase applications are outpacing last year's figures.  The increase in purchase applications contrasts with a 7% decrease in refinance applications for the week.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a federal judge's order imposing due process procedures on immigrants facing deportation to third countries.  The administration argues the order creates a diplomatic and logistical problem, causing irreparable harm to its deportation efforts. The judge's order mandates notice of destination, time to raise safety concerns, and time to contest findings, which the administration contends exceeds the judge's authority and jeopardizes the public interest.  The Supreme Court is increasingly involved in disputes over Trump's immigration policies.</p>

The author proposes a postmaterialist explanation focusing on the disruption of traditional social orders by egalitarian democratic progress, leading to a surge in far-right support.
