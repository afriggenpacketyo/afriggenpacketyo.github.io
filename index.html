        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a challenging environment for raising capital, private equity firms are aggressively hiring fundraising and investor relations talent, creating a competitive landscape with Wall Street investment banks. This recruitment surge is driven by the need to secure new capital and prepare for an anticipated rebound in dealmaking as interest rates are expected to fall. While larger, multi-strategy firms are expanding globally, particularly in Asia, smaller firms are struggling to compete. The intense competition has led major banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to implement stricter rules to prevent their junior analysts from being poached.</p>

          <p>Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a bus stop in north Jerusalem, killing six people and wounding several others, including a pregnant woman. According to Israeli police, two attackers arrived in a vehicle and began shooting at civilians before being neutralized by a security officer and another civilian at the scene. The incident is one of the deadliest of its kind since the October 7, 2023 attacks. Hamas praised the shooting, calling it a "natural response" to the ongoing conflict and Israeli actions in the region, while Israeli leaders condemned it as a brutal act of terrorism.</p>

          <p>A sharp disagreement has emerged within the Republican party after Vice President JD Vance stated that killing cartel members is the "highest and best use of our military." Senator Rand Paul strongly condemned this sentiment, calling it "despicable and thoughtless" to glorify killing individuals without a trial and invoking the principles of due process. Vance had doubled down on his position, stating he did not care if such actions were labeled war crimes. The exchange highlights a significant ideological divide on foreign policy and the rule of law among prominent conservative figures.</p>

          <p>Chinese lawmakers have initiated the first review of significant amendments to the country's 18-year-old Enterprise Bankruptcy Law, aiming to modernize the legal framework for market exits. The proposed revisions are intended to address shortcomings in the current system and better facilitate the orderly closure of struggling businesses amid an economic slowdown. Experts believe the changes are critical for eliminating unprofitable "zombie enterprises," clearing economic bottlenecks, and improving the protection of stakeholders' rights as China transitions toward a high-quality, technology-driven economy.</p>

          <p>Jury selection has started in the trial of Ryan Routh, the 59-year-old man charged with attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump in September of last year. Routh, who is representing himself, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that include attempting to kill a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer. Prosecutors allege that Routh meticulously planned the attack for weeks, positioning himself with an AK-47-style rifle near Trump's golf course before being spotted and thwarted by a Secret Service agent without any shots being fired.</p>

          <p>A cross-border investigation has uncovered that the Israeli government used its official advertising agency to fund a multi-million euro international ad campaign aimed at discrediting reports of famine in the Gaza Strip. The campaign, which ran on platforms like YouTube and Google, targeted audiences in Europe and North America with videos showing well-stocked markets and restaurants. However, a fact-check analysis revealed this messaging to be misleading, as it ignored widespread food shortages and unaffordable prices confirmed by journalists and residents on the ground, contradicting findings from internationally recognized humanitarian organizations.</p>

          <p>The United States is on the verge of a mosquito-borne disease crisis, with climate change, urbanization, and international travel creating more favorable conditions for outbreaks. Brownsville, Texas, serves as a critical sentinel city, where a robust surveillance program was established after a Zika virus outbreak in 2016. This program, which involves trapping, testing, and mapping mosquito populations, offers a model for how other regions can proactively combat threats from diseases like dengue and malaria. However, the lack of similar investment in public health infrastructure nationwide leaves the country vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The threat of mosquito-borne diseases in the United States is increasing as climate change expands the habitats of dangerous species. This article serves as a guide to identifying seven key types of mosquitoes, including those from the Aedes and Culex genuses, which are known to transmit serious illnesses such as West Nile virus, dengue, and Zika. Factors like rising temperatures, extreme rainfall, and urbanization create ideal breeding conditions for these insects. Understanding which species are prevalent in a given area can help individuals and public health officials take targeted measures to prevent bites and control outbreaks.</p>

          <p>A new documentary titled "Riefenstahl" delves into the archives of Adolf Hitler's personal filmmaker to explore her role in Nazi propaganda and her lifelong denial of complicity in the regime's atrocities. The film uses previously unseen materials, including correspondence and private recordings, to challenge her carefully crafted image as a purely aesthetic artist who was ignorant of politics. It examines evidence linking her to atrocities, such as her use of Romani extras who were later murdered at Auschwitz, and portrays her as a reflection of Germany's broader struggle with its historical narrative and national shame.</p>

While Trump signaled he is prepared to escalate economic pressure, U.S. officials have indicated that more robust European backing is necessary for sanctions to be truly effective.

While this controversial overhaul led to improved test scores and graduation rates, it came at a great cost to the local community.

On a night train in what was then Yugoslavia, two young men began to forcefully drag her away, seemingly with intent to harm her. Just as she was being overpowered, two older men intervened, rescued her, and then stood guard over her for the entire 12-hour journey. Despite not sharing a language, they shared their food and water, providing a silent but powerful demonstration of human protection and compassion.</p>

          <p>The United States' policy on Russian oil is facing scrutiny as it imposes high tariffs on India for purchasing discounted Russian crude while simultaneously being a top importer of refined oil products from India. An analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air found that the U.S. bought $1.4 billion in oil products from India this year, with over 90% coming from a refinery that sources nearly half its crude from Russia. This situation effectively creates a backdoor for Russian oil to enter the U.S. market, undermining the goal of cutting off the Kremlin's war funding.</p>

          <p>Leaders of major UK trade unions, including Unison, are warning the government against watering down its landmark Employment Rights Bill. Following a recent cabinet reshuffle that saw key proponents of the bill moved from their positions, unions fear that promises to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts and strengthen protections against unfair dismissal could be weakened. They are concerned that the government may be tempted to make concessions to business interests, undermining what they see as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve conditions for working people.</p>

          <p>Following the fall of the Assad regime, lawmakers from Germany's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are calling for new incentives to encourage the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to their homeland.

This political push comes as new data shows a 23% drop in asylum applications across the EU in the first half of 2025, with a 66% reduction in applications from Syrians, largely attributed to the changed political situation.</p>
