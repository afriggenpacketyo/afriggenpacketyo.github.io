          <h2>James Webb Telescope Provides New Exoplanet Insights</h2>

          <p>The James Webb Space Telescope directly observed carbon dioxide in the atmospheres of exoplanets in the HR 8799 system, a significant discovery in understanding planetary formation.  This direct observation, using coronagraph instruments to block starlight, contrasts with previous indirect methods and offers valuable clues about how planets form, potentially including those with habitable moons.  Further research using the Webb telescope and future missions like the Nancy Grace Roman telescope aims to explore smaller, potentially habitable exoplanets.</p>
