          <p>Ahmed Ebid, an Egyptian-born UK resident, has been sentenced to 25 years in jail for his role in smuggling nearly 3,800 migrants from North Africa to Italy between October 2022 and June 2023, some of whom eventually reached Britain. The National Crime Agency (NCA) reported that Ebid was part of a Â£12 million operation that used fishing boats for the crossings. This conviction marks the first instance of someone being prosecuted in the UK for organizing Mediterranean boat crossings, highlighting efforts to combat illegal immigration operations. The operation facilitated dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean Sea, exploiting vulnerable individuals seeking entry into Europe.</p>

          <p>A Mexican naval ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge after accelerating in the wrong direction while leaving a Manhattan pier, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, noting that the ship's speed increased to six knots before its masts struck the bridge. The ship, carrying 277 people, was embarking on a goodwill tour with scheduled stops in various countries, and the NTSB is working with Mexican officials to access the ship and interview crew members to determine the cause of the sudden acceleration. The incident caused no significant structural damage to the bridge, but prompted a thorough investigation.</p>

Hogan, who achieved a personal and school record, was praised on social media for her gesture, with many considering her the "real champion." This event occurred after Hogan and other athletes were allegedly told by CIF officials to remove their "Protect Girls Sports" T-shirts before a previous meet. The Trump administration has since put California and Governor Gavin Newsom on notice regarding the inclusion of biological males in girls' and women's sports, leading to a Title IX investigation of the CIF.</p>

          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a logistics firm supplying major UK supermarkets like Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Aldi, has been targeted by a ransomware attack, disrupting its operations. The attack, which encrypted the company's data, has led to potential food waste as deliveries are delayed. Black Farmer founder Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones estimates that thousands of his meat products are at risk of being thrown away if the issue is not resolved promptly. While recent cyber attacks on larger retailers like Marks & Spencer and Co-op were more extensive, this incident highlights the vulnerability of smaller logistics firms and the potential for significant disruption in the food supply chain.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, has lost her appeal against a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred in a social media post on X. Connolly's post, made on the day of the Southport attacks, called for "mass deportation now" and urged followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers. The post was viewed 310,000 times before it was deleted, leading to her arrest and conviction at Birmingham Crown Court.

          <p>Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, will be released from prison approximately four months early after a High Court hearing reduced his sentence for contempt of court. Yaxley-Lennon was jailed in October for breaching an injunction that barred him from repeating false allegations about a Syrian refugee. The judge reduced the sentence after accepting that Yaxley-Lennon had shown a "change in attitude" and had taken steps to comply with the order, including removing social media posts containing the libellous claims. He is expected to be released within the next week, earlier than his original release date of July 26.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, the cells forming the basis of complex life, existed around 2.72 billion years ago and metabolized hydrogen rather than oxygen. This finding challenges previous understandings of the lineage of this ancestor and supports the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotic cells. The research, published in Nature, indicates that this ancestor lived under oxygen-deficient conditions, before the Great Oxidation Event. Understanding eukaryogenesis could provide insights into the evolution of life and have implications for the exploration of life beyond Earth.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, once considered a rising star in the Republican party, is experiencing a significant decline in his political standing, marked by strained relationships with the Florida legislature and reduced national influence. Analysts attribute this fall to his autocratic governing style and a failed presidential bid that alienated many Trump supporters. DeSantis is now seen as a more standard governor, struggling to push his agenda through a dissenting legislature, while his wife Casey faces scrutiny over a charity scandal. His diminished national profile is further highlighted by his exclusion from Trump's list of potential successors, signaling a challenging path forward for the Florida governor.</p>

Beneficiaries report experiencing delays, fears of denied benefits, and increased stress about receiving timely payments amid rising living costs.

These observations led Quigley to question Biden's ability to handle the demands of reelection. Despite concerns among Democratic officials about Biden's cognitive state, few were willing to publicly voice them, fearing repercussions and the belief that Biden would be the nominee regardless.</p>

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, is working to conserve jaguars by changing perceptions and incentivizing ranchers to protect the wild cats. Through the Viviendo con Felinos program, ranchers are paid for motion camera photos of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats on their land, turning the animals into a source of income rather than a threat to livestock. This approach has led to a cultural shift, with ranchers increasingly valuing jaguars and protecting their habitat. The success of this program is crucial for the potential reestablishment of jaguars in the American Southwest, as it depends on a healthy population in northern Mexico.</p>

This strategy contrasts with Walmart's announcement of potential price increases due to tariffs. Home Depot's first-quarter earnings missed expectations, but sales beat estimates, and the company maintained its full-year sales forecast, assuming the continuation of temporary tariff reductions on imports from China and other countries.</p>

          <p>Experts are raising concerns that the Republican-backed tax and spending bill could add trillions to the U.S. deficit, with projected tax breaks far exceeding any savings from spending cuts. Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt due to the potential for the bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade. Economists and policy experts warn that increasing debt could lead to higher interest payments and squeeze federal spending on programs like Social Security and infrastructure. The Trump administration disagrees with these assessments, claiming the bill includes significant savings.</p>

          <p>Democrats are struggling to capitalize on President Donald Trump's declining poll numbers, as many voters disillusioned with Trump are not necessarily turning to the Democratic Party. Congressional Democrats continue to face unfavorable views, and some of Trump's new 2024 voters, including young people and voters of color, are not returning to the Democratic fold. Reasons for this include a perception that Democrats are out of touch, a wait-and-see approach from some voters, and the disengagement of low-propensity voters who are not strongly aligned with any party.

          <p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) is urging doctors to improve pain management for in-office gynecological procedures, such as IUD insertions and cervical biopsies. ACOG's new recommendations emphasize the need for thorough conversations with patients about potential pain and offering options like paracervical blocks and lidocaine. The guidelines aim to address inequalities in pain treatment and improve patient experiences, following a wave of social media advocacy highlighting negative experiences at OBGYN clinics. This shift reflects a growing recognition of the importance of patient autonomy and transparency in gynecological care.</p>
