          <p>The Cleveland Browns' decision to draft Shedeur Sanders in the NFL Draft has sparked debate, fueled by the lukewarm reactions of head coach Kevin Stefanski and general manager Andrew Berry. Footage of their muted response led to speculation about the team's enthusiasm for the controversial prospect, with some suggesting Sanders was not valued by the team's leadership. Berry clarified that drafting two quarterbacks wasn't the initial plan, but Sanders' availability in the fifth round presented an opportunity to add competition to the position. The Browns had to overcome Deion Sanders' previous comments criticizing the Browns as a destination for young quarterbacks.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a key Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries, causing widespread damage.

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines "woman" and "sex" as biological. The guidance states that trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals, shops, and restaurants, while ensuring trans people are not left without any facilities. The EHRC emphasizes that the law still protects against discrimination for transgender people, and mixed-sex facilities should be provided where possible. The guidance aims to clarify the implications of the ruling for organizations and individuals.</p>
