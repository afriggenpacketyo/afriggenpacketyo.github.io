          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood holds a commanding four-shot lead at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis after completing his second round with a six-under 64. His impressive performance, which brought him to 13 under par, has positioned him strongly for a potential first PGA Tour victory. Play was suspended late in the day due to severe weather, with lightning in the area leaving 21 players, including Justin Rose, still on the course. The tournament is the opening event of the FedExCup playoffs.</p>

While acknowledging ongoing collaboration that has led to reduced drug flow, Sheinbaum emphasized that any direct U.S. military presence would be a violation of Mexico's sovereignty and is not part of any agreement between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Astronaut Jim Lovell, celebrated for his calm and decisive leadership during the perilous Apollo 13 mission in 1970, has passed away at the age of 97. After an onboard explosion crippled the spacecraft, Lovell and his crew worked with Mission Control to navigate a safe return to Earth, turning a potential tragedy into one of NASA's most triumphant moments. Lovell was also part of the historic Apollo 8 mission, making him the first person to fly to the Moon twice, though he never landed on its surface.</p>

          <p>Welsh athlete Louis Rees-Zammit is returning to rugby union, cutting short his attempt to forge a career in the NFL with the Jacksonville Jaguars. While a back injury and coaching changes were factors, his decision was also influenced by increasing opportunities in rugby, including a potential high-paying spot in a new rebel league. Experts note that while talented, his athleticism was not exceptional by NFL standards, but his experience will likely make him a more mature and skilled rugby player.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska next week to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows Trump's suggestion that a peace deal might involve territorial swaps, a proposal Ukraine has firmly rejected. Reports indicate a potential US-backed plan could see Russia retain the Donbas region and Crimea in exchange for withdrawing from other occupied areas, though it is unclear if Ukraine or its European allies would agree to such terms.</p>

          <p>London-based entrepreneur Lucy Rout has launched Haystack Dating, a company that hosts in-person events for singles fatigued by the negative experiences of dating apps. Citing her own "dating burnout," Rout designed a model where attendees are matched into small groups for an activity based on an algorithm that considers their interests and personality traits. The concept taps into a growing trend of people seeking more meaningful, real-life connections, as data shows a decline in users for major dating apps.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a genetically high predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a significant "gear shift" in his life's motivations. The discovery, made during a genetic test for his show "Limitless," revealed he is eight to ten times more likely to develop the disorder. Hemsworth stated the news prompted him to question his purpose and focus more on his health, family, and contributing to the world, rather than simply collecting achievements, a change in mindset reflected in the show's second season.</p>

          <h2>The 'Treatonomics' Trend Sees Consumers Spending on Small Luxuries and Experiences Amid Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 22:11:47 EDT</div>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is gaining momentum as people spend on everything from small 'pick-me-ups' like lipstick to larger experiences like concert tickets to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This behavior, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," involves consumers making everyday sacrifices to afford special treats that provide joy and a sense of well-being. Economists note this trend is fueled by a re-evaluation of life's milestones and a desire to find happiness in the present. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are employing stringent measures to control a chikungunya outbreak, a mosquito-borne illness, that some observers compare to the country's controversial Covid-19 playbook. Reports describe task forces forcibly entering homes to clear stagnant water where mosquitoes breed and community workers insisting on blood samples from feverish children. These intrusive public health tactics have sparked concerns and complaints among residents, highlighting ongoing tensions between individual rights and state-led pandemic prevention efforts in China.</p>
