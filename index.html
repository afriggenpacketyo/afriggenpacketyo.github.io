          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 14:59:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump falsely claimed gasoline prices had fallen below $2 per gallon to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, despite the national average being over $3. According to AAA, the national average was $3.165 per gallon on Monday, substantially higher than Trump's claim. While RBOB gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this contract represents wholesale, unfinished gasoline prices, excluding taxes, transportation, and other costs, making it irrelevant to consumers. Experts emphasize that the RBOB price is not indicative of what drivers pay at the pump. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil futures decreased by approximately 2% after OPEC+ members agreed to increase production for the second consecutive month. The decision to raise output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly triple Goldman Sachs' forecast, was influenced by concerns over recession risks stemming from President Trump's tariffs. This increase in supply, coupled with fears of slowing demand, contributed to the largest monthly loss in oil prices since 2021, leading Goldman Sachs to lower its U.S. crude price forecast. Consequently, oilfield service firms anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production this year.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted additional layoffs, affecting around 200 employees, including 50 from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). These cuts, which surprised NIH officials, impact programs like the Cancer Information Service, which offers information to doctors and patients, as well as updates to databases for healthcare providers. The layoffs follow an earlier round of cuts and are reportedly intended to offset the costs of reinstating other scientists at the agency. The NCI's communications office had previously been spared from earlier layoffs, but is now facing significant reductions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is reducing overpayment clawbacks to 50% from 100% following concerns about financial hardship for beneficiaries. This adjustment comes after the SSA, influenced by Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), initially increased the clawback rate to 100% to safeguard taxpayer funds. The agency's inspector general found that a significant number of overpayments were due to SSA's calculation errors, not beneficiary fault. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still pose a burden for many recipients, particularly those with disabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new assessment by the European Central Bank indicates that European consumers are increasingly avoiding U.S. products and services due to President Trump's trade war. The trend is not merely a temporary response to tariffs but a potential long-term shift in consumer preferences. Companies like Tesla and McDonaldâ€™s are witnessing customer aversion to products labeled "Made in America," and grass-roots boycotts are gaining traction, with consumers actively seeking European alternatives. The study found that even households that could afford higher prices are consciously choosing alternatives, reflecting a broader anguish over America's treatment of its allies.</p>

To qualify, you'll need to have eligible types of debt (credit cards, medical bills, personal loans), sufficient income to make the monthly payment, a meaningful level of debt, and willingness to close your credit cards. If you don't qualify, other options include debt settlement, debt consolidation loans, or bankruptcy.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a new plan for a "forceful entry to Gaza," involving additional soldiers and the relocation of Palestinians to the south. This announcement follows more than two months of continued blockade and bombardment of the Gaza Strip as cease-fire talks have stalled. Opponents criticize the plan, saying it endangers the remaining hostages and will not fundamentally change the dynamic. Israel's operation will include a "wide attack, involving moving most of Gazaâ€™s population for their protection in an area clean of Hamas."</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed his desire to reopen Alcatraz as a "substantially enlarged and rebuilt" prison, prompting the Bureau of Prisons to conduct an assessment. The facility, which has been closed since 1963 and is currently maintained as a national park, has a rich history and held notorious prisoners like Al Capone. Critics argue that reopening Alcatraz would be costly and impractical, given the high cost of living in San Francisco and existing infrastructure challenges at Bureau of Prisons facilities across the country.

This initiative, led by GM President Mark Reuss, aims to restore Cadillac's prominence and compete with luxury brands from Germany, Japan, and electric vehicle competitors like Tesla and Lucid. The strategy involves isolating Cadillac's products from GM's other brands, prioritizing value over volume, and focusing on high-end vehicles like the bespoke Celestiq.
