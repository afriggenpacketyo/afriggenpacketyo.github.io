          <p>Joseph Czuba, a 73-year-old Illinois landlord, received a 53-year prison sentence for the fatal stabbing of Wadee Alfayoumi, a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy, and the severe wounding of his mother. The attack, which occurred in 2023 shortly after the start of the Israel-Gaza war, was classified as a hate crime motivated by anti-Muslim bias. Czuba, who had been renting rooms to the family, grew agitated by the war and targeted them because of their Muslim faith, as stated by prosecutors. The trial included harrowing testimony from the victim's mother and Czuba's ex-wife, ultimately leading to his conviction after a brief jury deliberation.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in the 2025 local elections in England, securing control of seven councils previously held by the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats and the Green Party also saw increases in council seats, with the Greens more than doubling their representation. While Labour retained mayoralties in key areas, the Conservatives experienced losses, ceding control of 12 councils but winning the race for mayor in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. These results signal a shift in the political landscape, challenging the traditional dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine, civilian deaths have significantly increased, according to a United Nations report. In the first 24 days of April, casualties rose by 46% compared to the same period last year, with 848 civilians killed or wounded due to intensified Russian missile and drone strikes, including attacks on civilian areas like playgrounds and apartment buildings. Analysts suggest that this escalation is a tactic by both sides to gain leverage before a potential truce. The violence has put Ukrainians on edge, with many feeling that the attacks are intended to force them into accepting an unfavorable deal.</p>

          <p>Chevron plans to decrease its share buybacks in response to declining crude oil prices, which have been affected by President Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ production plans. The company intends to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its stock in the second quarter, a reduction from the $3.9 billion in the first quarter, while still maintaining its overall repurchase guidance for the year. Analysts suggest this decision reflects a cautious approach due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. Chevron's net income saw a significant decline, dropping over 30% compared to the previous year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Press freedom in Turkey is under increasing pressure as the government employs judicial measures to silence critical voices, according to a report by Deutsche Welle. Journalists are not only facing imprisonment but also judicial restrictions such as house arrest, travel bans, and mandatory reporting to authorities. These measures, intended as alternatives to pre-trial detention, are becoming instruments of de facto punishment, preventing journalists from practicing their profession. Legal experts argue that these control measures are often imposed without valid grounds, violating constitutional court decisions and creating a climate of fear that suppresses freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has stated that there is no legal basis for President Trump's renewed threat to revoke the university's tax-exempt status. Trump's threat came after Harvard refused to comply with demands related to antisemitism and DEI policies on campus. Harvard argues that such action would harm its ability to carry out its educational mission, diminishing financial aid, medical research, and innovation. The university also noted that it is already challenging the Trump administration's freeze on federal grants.</p>
