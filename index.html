          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland has informed Department of Justice superiors that there is insufficient evidence to indict California Senator Adam Schiff on mortgage fraud charges, as reported by MSNBC. This assessment comes despite President Donald Trump's public calls for criminal charges against Schiff, a prominent critic who served as a prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. Maryland U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to update him on her investigation, conveying her belief that the case against Schiff was not strong. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, emphasized that career prosecutors found the politically motivated allegations baseless and unsupported by evidence, asserting that the transparently vindictive effort should now conclude, hoping for justice within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Industry experts at the 11th Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai anticipate significant advancements in the cryptocurrency sector through increased collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. Despite the mainland's years-long ban on various crypto activities, Hong Kong leads in crypto regulation, while mainland developers excel in digital payments and artificial intelligence. Rachel Lee of Cyberport and Lily Liu of the Solana Foundation expressed desires to deepen this cooperation, leveraging Hong Kong's status as a major international financial hub and China's massive developer ecosystem. This synergy is expected to foster development in areas like virtual asset trading, decentralized payments, and the broader Web3 industry.</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old German man tragically died on the French island of Corsica after being swept away by a sudden torrent while swimming with his family during Storm Benjamin. His wife and two children were rescued, but his body was later recovered. The severe storm prompted an orange weather alert across Corsica, with wind gusts reaching 170 km/h, leading to numerous flight delays and cancellations, as well as disrupted ferry services. Across France, the storm caused significant power outages, affecting 60,000 people. Authorities expect continued disruptions, though the storm's intensity reportedly weakened by late Thursday.</p>

          <p>A sweeping federal investigation has led to high-profile arrests, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, for alleged illegal sports betting and involvement in rigged poker games. Authorities detailed two major fraud schemes: "Operation Nothing But Bet," where players allegedly manipulated betting odds by faking injuries or altering performance, and a more complex illegal poker ring tied to New York crime families. This poker operation reportedly defrauded victims of millions using sophisticated technology like X-ray tables and special contact lenses. The NBA has placed the implicated individuals on immediate leave, underscoring its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the game amidst these serious allegations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers exhibit a remarkably composed approach to championship pressure, treating deep postseason runs as routine while aiming for a modern-day dynasty. Players like Miguel Rojas note the absence of frenzied celebrations for a pennant, underscoring the team's singular focus on winning the World Series. Manager Dave Roberts emphasizes a "one day at a time" mentality, deflecting "legacy" and "dynasty" discussions to external observers. This culture, cultivated through consistent star acquisitions and sustained success, allows the team to embrace historical opportunities without succumbing to overwhelming expectations, making their pursuit of a third title in six seasons feel natural.</p>

          <p>An elaborate mafia-run poker scam, dismantled by federal investigators, allegedly defrauded wealthy victims of at least $7 million using sophisticated technology and the allure of professional athletes. Prosecutors described a scheme involving X-ray card tables, rigged shuffling machines, and special contact lenses that allowed conspirators to read marked cards, making winning nearly impossible for unsuspecting players. NBA coach Chauncey Billups and former player Damon Jones were among those arrested, reportedly acting as "face cards" to entice victims. This "Ocean's Eleven"-like operation, which laundered profits via cryptocurrency, highlights a complex criminal enterprise spanning multiple U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>Former special counsel Jack Smith has offered to testify publicly before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees regarding his federal investigations into President Trump's handling of sensitive documents and alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election. His lawyers stated Smith requires Justice Department authorization and guidance on grand jury secrecy, particularly concerning the unreleased second volume of his final report. This volume, which details Trump's document handling, was withheld due to ongoing cases that have since been dismissed. Smith seeks to address numerous "mischaracterizations" of his investigations, which led to two criminal cases against the former president.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized Donald Trump's sanctions against major Russian oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil as an "unfriendly act," though he controversially claimed they would not impact Russia's economy. Trump imposed these sanctions due to Russia's perceived lack of commitment to ending the war in Ukraine, leading to a 5% surge in Brent crude prices. Concurrently, Lithuania reported that two Russian military aircraft briefly entered its airspace, prompting Spanish jets to scramble in response, an incident Russia denied.
