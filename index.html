          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two children, aged eight and ten, and left 21 other people injured during a school Mass. The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, fired through the church windows before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Law enforcement sources indicate the shooter had a connection to the school through their mother, a former employee. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a potential hate crime, as the community grapples with the tragedy and honors the victims.</p>

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has agreed to a transfer deal for striker Nicolas Jackson to join Bayern Munich. The arrangement begins as an initial loan valued at £14.3 million, which includes a mandatory purchase obligation of £56.2 million based on a minimum number of appearances, bringing the total package to over £70 million. Jackson, who joined Chelsea from Villarreal in 2023, is set to sign a five-year permanent contract with the German club. The move follows a period of tension where Jackson reportedly lost the trust of manager Enzo Maresca.</p>

          <p>The body of Grant Gardner, a 38-year-old hiker from Minnesota, was found in Wyoming's Bighorn Mountains nearly a month after he went missing. Gardner had sent a final text to his wife from the summit of Cloud Peak, mentioning the climb was more taxing than expected. A professional climbing team discovered his remains underneath a ledge after noticing a reflection from his backpack. Authorities believe Gardner's death was a tragic accident and hope the discovery provides closure for his family, including his wife and two children.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has criticized comments from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regarding "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Pistorius labeled the public discussion of such plans as "completely wrong" before any negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow have occurred, questioning the EU's jurisdiction in deploying troops. The article also covers other Ukraine-related developments, including Kyiv's criticism of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for omitting the war from its closing statement and Indian Prime Minister Modi urging an end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Afghan nationals, including former employees of German institutions and their relatives, have arrived in Germany after a prolonged wait in Pakistan for their visas. Their arrival comes as Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government has taken a tougher stance on immigration, pausing resettlement plans for hundreds of other Afghans who were previously informed of Germany's readiness to accept them. A recent court ruling affirmed the government's right to stop issuing visas, but the Afghans who arrived on Monday had successfully acquired theirs after filing lawsuits.

          <p>New research indicates that the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement could significantly harm California's $4 trillion economy, which relies heavily on immigrant labor. Industries such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality are particularly vulnerable, with a joint study estimating a potential loss of up to $278 billion from the state's GDP. Immigrant workers, including a large undocumented population, are essential for filling jobs that American-born workers often do not take. The White House maintains that the domestic labor market can absorb any shortages, but business owners and industry advocates express concern over worker shortages and economic disruption.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has secured a deal to sign England center-back Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace, with the 25-year-old set to finalize the move after a medical examination.

This signing is part of a major spending spree for Liverpool, which also includes a £125 million deal for striker Alexander Isak. The acquisition of Guehi aims to strengthen Liverpool's defense, which has appeared vulnerable in early-season matches.</p>

          <p>A powerful magnitude-six earthquake has struck a remote, mountainous region in eastern Afghanistan, resulting in over 800 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries, according to the United Nations. The quake, which occurred just before midnight on Sunday, has caused widespread devastation, with entire villages reportedly flattened in Kunar province. Rescue operations are severely hampered by the rugged terrain and roads blocked by landslides, forcing reliance on helicopter evacuations.

The move comes as Western nations accuse Iran of advancing its uranium enrichment, developing ballistic missiles in violation of UN resolutions, and failing to cooperate with IAEA inspections.

She challenges the conventional wisdom of 30-year loans, pointing out that homeowners build equity very slowly in the initial years due to high interest payments. Joy also warns buyers to account for the numerous hidden costs of homeownership, such as increased utility bills, furnishing larger spaces, and budgeting for unexpected repairs, which can lead to debt if not properly planned for.

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, the CEO of a Polish paving company, has issued a public apology after a video of him snatching a hat from a young boy at the US Open went viral. The incident occurred when tennis player Kamil Majchrzak threw his hat into the crowd for the boy, and Szczerek intercepted it. In his statement, Szczerek claimed it was a "huge mistake" and that he was "convinced" the player was passing it to him, but acknowledged he hurt the child and disappointed fans. The player later met with the young fan to give him a new cap and other merchandise.</p>

          <p>This article details the significant challenges hampering rescue efforts and the flow of information following the deadly earthquake in eastern Afghanistan. The mountainous, remote terrain of the affected provinces makes access extremely difficult, a problem exacerbated by landslides and limited communication infrastructure. Furthermore, the political situation under the unrecognized Taliban government complicates the aid process, as many international agencies suspended operations after the 2021 takeover. While humanitarian exemptions exist, the country's collapsed economy and healthcare system leave it ill-equipped to handle a disaster of this scale, raising particular concerns for women and girls with restricted access to services.</p>

          <h2>Trump Claims India Offered to Eliminate Tariffs on US Goods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated on his social media platform that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. products to zero. While describing the U.S.-India trade relationship as historically "one sided," Trump suggested the offer was coming "late" but was on the table. The comment was made as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, where he met with Chinese and Russian leaders. The potential tariff reduction follows a period of trade friction, where the Trump administration imposed duties of up to 50% on certain Indian goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has permanently abolished peak-time fares, making weekday travel significantly cheaper for commuters. The move, which follows a trial period, is intended to encourage more people to use trains instead of cars, offering both financial relief to passengers and environmental benefits. For example, a journey between Edinburgh and Glasgow will now cost almost 50% less during former peak hours. The Scottish government, which owns ScotRail, will fund the scheme at an estimated annual cost of £40 million to £45 million, hoping the investment boosts passenger numbers.</p>

To restore confidence, the author suggests the government take bold, eye-catching measures in the upcoming autumn budget. Recommendations include credible fiscal projections, significant tax reform like a land tax to reduce taxes on labor, and policies that genuinely boost growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As interest rates show signs of potential decline, savers looking to maximize returns should consider short-term certificates of deposit (CDs), according to financial experts. Six-month CDs are identified as a "sweet spot," often offering the most competitive annual percentage yields (APYs) in the current market. While longer-term CDs historically provided higher rates, the present inverted yield curve means shorter terms are more attractive. Experts also suggest strategies like CD laddering, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with varying maturities to balance high returns with liquidity needs. (not investment advice)</p>
