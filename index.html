          <p>Kelly Stafford, wife of NFL quarterback Matthew Stafford, discussed the inclusion of significant others at the NFL Draft on her podcast. She questioned the practice, suggesting that if a player is drafted and includes his girlfriend in draft photos, the relationship might not last, leading to awkward pictures later. She drew parallels to including a sibling's partner in a wedding before an engagement. Stafford emphasized her vulnerability on the podcast, citing the safety of the community it fosters.

          <p>Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Tommy Pham has been suspended and fined by Major League Baseball for making a crude hand gesture toward fans at Angel Stadium. This incident is part of a pattern of questionable behavior. Pham has a history of run-ins with fans, including a stabbing incident in 2020 and verbal confrontations. Despite his challenges, Pham has had a successful career, overcoming a progressive degenerative eye disease. Optimism score: 50</p>
          <p>50/100</p>
