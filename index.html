          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 23:37:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck early Saturday near the east coast of Russia’s Kamchatka region, with its epicenter located 111.7 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. This significant seismic event is part of a pattern of intense geological activity in the area, following five other powerful quakes, including one of similar magnitude, that impacted the Kamchatka Peninsula in July 2025. The region's position on the Pacific Ring of Fire makes it highly susceptible to frequent and strong seismic events, which consistently pose risks to local infrastructure and populations. Authorities and residents in this remote part of Russia remain on alert for potential aftershocks and any subsequent damage.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the high-profile Karen Read murder trial, detailing events from John O'Keefe's death in January 2022 through Read's second trial and subsequent acquittal on major charges in June 2025. Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him, while the defense argued an elaborate cover-up by law enforcement and others. The complex legal battle included a mistrial, federal investigations into evidence, and intense public scrutiny, highlighting deep divisions and accusations of misconduct. Ultimately, Read was convicted only of driving under the influence of alcohol, receiving one year of probation, a verdict that disappointed prosecution witnesses.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez in Franklin Park, Illinois, after authorities claim he resisted arrest and attempted to drive his vehicle into agents, dragging one. The incident, part of the Trump administration's "Operation Midway Blitz" to ramp up immigration enforcement, resulted in the agent sustaining severe injuries. Villegas-Gonzalez, identified as an undocumented individual with a history of reckless driving, later died at a hospital. The shooting has prompted calls for a full investigation from Rep. Chuy Garcia and Gov. JB Pritzker, with local residents expressing fear and distrust towards ICE actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is implementing new road closures on its South side (red side), affecting Delta flights and passengers, from Friday night at 10:00 p.m. until Monday at 5:00 a.m. These closures, due to ongoing construction, will impact pickup, drop-off, and shuttle services, potentially causing significant congestion.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is facing mounting pressure after Lord Mandelson was dismissed as UK ambassador to the US following revelations of supportive emails with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The BBC understands that officials at No 10 and the Foreign Office were aware of the emails' existence when Starmer initially defended Mandelson, though Starmer himself was reportedly unaware of their contents. The messages, published later, showed Mandelson expressing support for Epstein before his 2008 prison term for soliciting sex from a minor. Mandelson's dismissal was based on "new information" revealing a "materially different" depth of relationship than previously known.</p>

Tsikhanouskaya criticized the move as "not real freedom" and urged Western governments to demand that President Lukashenko allow political prisoners to stay in their home country.

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a new congressional redistricting plan, backed by President Donald Trump, which aims to create an additional Republican-leaning House seat by splitting the Kansas City area. The plan, now awaiting Governor Mike Kehoe's signature, would shift the state's House delegation from six Republicans and two Democrats to potentially seven GOP-leaning districts and one Democratic seat. This move is part of a nationwide Republican effort to reshape congressional maps ahead of next year's midterm elections. Opponents, including the ACLU of Missouri, have already filed a legal challenge, calling the map "unconstitutional" and alleging it dilutes the votes of Black and white residents along racial lines.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reveals that women who have experienced stalking or obtained restraining orders face a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Analyzing data from over 66,000 American nurses, researchers found a 41% increased CVD risk for stalking victims and a 70% higher risk for those with restraining orders, even after accounting for diet and exercise. This groundbreaking research suggests that violence experiences, often overlooked, should be considered alongside traditional risk factors in heart health screenings.

          <p>Two separate boat accidents in the Democratic Republic of Congo this week have resulted in at least 193 deaths and scores missing. One vessel, carrying nearly 500 passengers, capsized after catching fire on the Congo River, with 209 survivors rescued and 146 still unaccounted for. A day prior, another motorized boat capsized, killing at least 86 people, mostly students. These frequent tragedies are attributed to old, poorly maintained, and overloaded vessels, often operating illegally at night, highlighting the severe safety issues in river transport in the country's vast rainforest regions.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, grew up in a quiet Utah community and had no prior criminal record, according to neighbors and public records. Details emerging from the investigation, including a confession to his father and messages on Discord, indicate he had become more political and disliked Kirk for "spreading hate." Engravings on bullet casings found near the scene, such as "Hey fascist! Catch!" and online meme references, suggest a complex motive. Experts caution against immediate ideological attribution, noting a mix of grievance, mental distress, and online influences in similar lone assailant cases.</p>

          <p>Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett has issued a stark warning about a potential stock market bubble, highlighting an "eye-popping" chart showing the S&P 500's price-to-book ratio at a record high of 5.3, surpassing dot-com era levels. This elevated valuation reflects intense investor optimism surrounding AI's transformative power and expected Fed rate cuts. While high valuations don't guarantee a bubble, other metrics like the 12-month forward price-to-earnings and Shiller CAPE ratios also signal market froth. The article notes that while some AI firms have beaten earnings, justifying optimism, valuations are better predictors of long-term returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination revealed a troubling online dynamic where information vacuums are quickly filled with rage bait, conspiracy theories, and vitriol, often before facts are established. This article from The Atlantic argues that the algorithmic internet fosters a "justification machine," where facts are rearranged to fit preset narratives, leading to premature blame and ideological labeling. The complex and often nihilistic online references found on the alleged killer's bullet casings further complicate attempts to assign a clear motive, suggesting a blurring of fringe online life and real-world violence. This environment amplifies extreme voices, contributing to political polarization and a pervasive sense of societal chaos.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency plans to terminate a federal program that tracks greenhouse gas emissions from over 8,000 industrial facilities, including power plants and oil refineries. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin asserts this move will save businesses $2.4 billion in regulatory costs and streamline operations, while still complying with the Clean Air Act. However, environmental and health experts warn that ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program would blind Americans to critical climate pollution data, hindering efforts to cut emissions and protect public health. This decision aligns with broader administration efforts to reduce climate research and regulation.</p>

Serrano, who also photographed Donald Trump in 2004, stated he took Epstein's portrait to acquire a sculpture, despite Epstein's criminal past, finding him "uninteresting" except for his notoriety. He describes Trump as "fascinating" and a "smart guy," having collected over 1,000 Trump-related items for an art installation. Serrano's unique perspective offers insight into both figures, while his work continues to spark discussion on ethics and the nature of his subjects.</p>

          <p>This article provides a stark glimpse into the life of an undocumented person in Trump's America through the story of "Luz," a Mexican immigrant living in fear of detention. With increased ICE raids and enforcement, Luz describes being afraid to leave her home or take her child to school, despite having lived in the US for 17 years, paying taxes, and having healthcare. The Trump administration's policy, driven by "border tsar" Tom Homan, aims to deport all undocumented individuals, prioritizing public safety threats but also detaining non-criminals encountered. This shift forces families like Luz's, including her US-citizen daughter, to consider returning to Mexico, highlighting the profound human impact of strict immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A review of "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" suggests the sequel, while offering agreeable silliness, struggles to recapture the original's iconic satirical magic. Forty years after the cult classic, the film reunites Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls for a final concert. However, the presence of celebrity cameos like Paul McCartney and Elton John, who revere the band, undermines the original's outsider comedy, making the sequel feel more like an extended outtake reel. Despite glimpses of the creators' comedic brilliance, the article notes that the film often undercooks its humor and misses opportunities for fresh satire, ultimately failing to hit the "11" mark of its predecessor.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with ending legal protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This decision by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifts a lower court's stay, marking a victory for the administration's efforts to dismantle Biden-era humanitarian parole policies. The ruling acknowledges the "risks of irreparable harm" to parolees, who face potential separation from families and return to dangerous home countries. However, the court found insufficient likelihood of success on the merits to maintain the stay. This legal development underscores the ongoing political and judicial battles over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill overriding local zoning laws to allow high-density housing near transit hubs. The bill, introduced by Sen. Scott Wiener, permits buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops and six stories within a half-mile of single-family neighborhoods. Proponents argue these drastic measures are necessary to address the state's affordability crisis and leverage existing infrastructure. However, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, claim it's an overreach that strips local authority and disproportionately affects lower-priced neighborhoods. The bill now heads to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk, facing both support from housing advocates and opposition from local communities.</p>
