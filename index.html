          <p>A Russian military court sentenced Yegor Semenov, a dual Ukrainian-Russian national, to 27 years in prison for attempting to poison Russian army pilots at a graduation party on orders from Ukrainian secret services. Semenov was allegedly recruited and promised $5,000 to send poisoned alcohol and cakes to the party in Armavir, southern Russia. The plot failed when the pilots grew suspicious and had the package examined, revealing a lethal dose of a medical drug. Russia has experienced a series of killings targeting servicemen, including high-ranking generals, since its offensive in Ukraine began.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are employing procedural tactics to block a Democratic effort to investigate Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of the encrypted messaging app Signal. GOP leaders included language in a rule for unrelated measures to prevent Democrats from calling up resolutions of inquiry, which are often used by the minority party to request information from the administration. Representative Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, intended to force a vote on a resolution compelling Trump to turn over Hegseth's communications shared on Signal. Speaker Johnson defended the move, citing it as a prevention of political stunts and a waste of time.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's attempt to gain greater control over a highway and public beach access near its Starbase launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, has been thwarted by lawmakers. The Texas House State Affairs Committee voted against a bill that would have granted SpaceX increased authority, even if the community votes to become an incorporated city. The company has historically needed to close roads and beaches for test flights and launches, leading to legal complaints and protests from local residents and activist groups. SpaceX has previously faced fines from the EPA for polluting waters and has been criticized for causing damage to sensitive wildlife habitats.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is employing a "flood the zone" strategy, inspired by Project 2025, to swiftly implement his conservative policies, signing numerous executive orders challenging Congress' power and testing the limits of immigration enforcement. Legal experts note that Trump's approach is an extreme example of presidents expanding executive power. Trump's tactics have faced resistance from the judicial branch, but experts warn that even if blocked, his actions can cause both short-term and long-term damage by implanting a narrative and pushing policies to the right. The administration aims to act quickly, citing midterm elections as a critical timeframe.</p>

          <p>In the latest installment of The Atlantic's "Dear James" column, James Parker addresses a reader's question about why one always seems to want to finish a book, even when thoroughly enjoying it. Parker suggests that this urge stems from our nature as narrative animals, always seeking the next moment and the completion of the story. He also reflects on the linear momentum of reading and the acceleration a reader might feel as they approach the end of a book, mirroring the writer's energy in wrapping up the composition.</p>

          <p>During oral arguments, Supreme Court justices expressed incredulity at the government's defense of an FBI raid on the wrong house in Atlanta. The raid, which involved a battering ram and a flash-bang grenade, resulted in the couple living there being traumatized. The justices questioned the agents' failure to verify the address and the government's claim that the raid did not violate any policy. The case, Martin v. United States, involves legal questions about the Federal Tort Claims Act and whether government officials' actions are protected from lawsuits when they perform a duty that involves discretion.</p>

          <p>According to this opinion article, President Trump's economic policies and views on trade, particularly his use of tariffs, align more closely with left-wing economic thought than traditional American conservative principles. The article argues that Trump's belief in his ability to outsmart the market and direct the economy from above echoes the assumptions of economic planners and politicians on the left. The author contrasts this with the free-market views of economists like Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek, who emphasize the limitations of central planning.</p>

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's push for increased oil and gas production, companies involved in drilling and servicing wells have faced challenges during his second term.

Oilfield service firms are warning of slower investment due to falling prices and economic uncertainty, with shares of major companies declining.
