        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration, through Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, has canceled an additional $175 million in funding for California's high-speed rail initiative, targeting projects like track extensions and a Madera station. This follows an earlier $4 billion grant cancellation, with Duffy labeling the overall project a "boondoggle" due to its $15 billion costs and lack of completed track. California officials, who are suing the Department of Transportation, decried the move as a "politically motivated attack," asserting their system is North America's only true high-speed rail under construction. The state project, initially aiming to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, now faces further financial hurdles and an estimated 2033 completion for a shorter segment.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store has announced it will abandon its recently unveiled, controversial new logo and reinstate its iconic "Old Timer" image. This decision comes after widespread customer outrage and direct criticism from President Donald Trump, who publicly urged the company to revert to its original branding. The company's stock saw a rise in after-hours trading following the announcement, which emphasized a commitment to "delicious food, warm welcomes, and country hospitality." The rebranding had initially removed the "Uncle Herschel" character, leading to a significant drop in stock value and conservative criticism.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing for the 10th test flight of its Starship megarocket, a 403-foot-tall vehicle, after two previous launch attempts were scrubbed due to weather and a liquid oxygen leak. This mission is critical following a series of explosive failures, which have cast doubt on Starship's reliability for Elon Musk's ambitious goals of Mars colonization and lunar missions. The flight aims to send the upper stage across the globe to test heat shield materials and deploy dummy Starlink satellites, while the booster will splash down in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite setbacks, SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" approach continues, with Musk remaining optimistic about future launch frequency.</p>

          <p>Exclusive interviews and verified footage shed new light on Israel's June 23rd attack on Iran's Evin Prison, described as the deadliest Israeli strike on Iranian soil with 80 reported civilian casualties. Political activist Motahareh Goonei recounted the "hellish" experience of being trapped in solitary confinement during the explosions, while Human Rights Watch has labeled the strikes as unlawfully indiscriminate and a potential war crime. Despite the IDF claiming a "targeted strike" on an intelligence facility, witnesses reported "bodies everywhere" and prisoners aiding injured guards.

          <p>An 85-year-old woman with dementia, Barbara Dee Crosby, who went missing from a senior living home in Sonora, California, was safely located thanks to her Chihuahua mix, Poncho. The loyal dog was spotted under brush near Crosby, who was found asleep on the ground after a lengthy search. Due to the steep terrain, rescuers used a litter and rope system to extract Crosby, who was then taken to a hospital. However, Poncho ran off before he could be secured, and authorities are now seeking public assistance to find the "unsung hero" of the rescue.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is ongoing in the Australian Alps for 56-year-old Dezi Freeman, named as the suspect in the fatal shooting of two police officers. The incident occurred when officers attempted to execute a warrant for alleged sexual offenses at his rural property, leading to an immediate exchange of gunfire. A third officer was injured but is expected to recover. Chief Commissioner Mike Bush warned the public to remain vigilant and stay indoors, as Freeman is heavily armed and familiar with the dense bushland where he fled.

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that a Leeds funeral director, Amie Upton, has been banned from NHS maternity wards and mortuaries after keeping babies' bodies at her home. One mother, Zoe Ward, expressed "screaming" anger upon finding her deceased son in a baby bouncer "watching cartoons" in Upton's living room, alongside another deceased infant. Concerns about improper body storage temperatures and lack of consent for transfers have also emerged.

          <p>UK energy regulator Ofgem is expected to announce a slight increase in gas and electricity prices for millions of households this autumn and winter, despite earlier predictions of a fall. Analysts anticipate about a 1% annual rise, meaning another winter of relatively high energy bills for the average family. This increase is partly due to additional government support measures for vulnerable households, which will be funded by all billpayers. Campaigners warn that many households continue to struggle with existing energy debt, urging a shift to clean, homegrown power to stabilize long-term costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Current and former FEMA officials have issued a stark warning to Congress, stating that the Trump administration's budget cuts and leadership changes risk reversing two decades of reforms made since Hurricane Katrina. An open letter, signed by 181 individuals (many anonymously due to "fear and suppression"), alleges unqualified leadership and the termination of grants for state and local disaster preparedness. The administration defends its actions as necessary reforms to combat inefficiency, aiming to "wean" states off federal aid. However, the agency has lost a third of its staff, and critics argue these changes undermine FEMA's mission and readiness for future disasters.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed the first human case of New World screwworm in the U.S., found in a Maryland resident who recently traveled to El Salvador. This parasitic fly lays eggs in open wounds, with maggots burrowing into tissue, causing painful infestations. While rare in humans and eradicated in the U.S. in 1966 (except for a 2017 animal outbreak), the parasite is common in Central and South America. Treatment involves physical removal of maggots, often requiring surgery. Prevention includes covering wounds and using insect repellent when traveling, with efforts underway to prevent its re-establishment in the U.S.</p>

          <h2>USAID's Gutting Leads to "Fire Sale" and Abandonment of Global Aid Supplies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's dramatic reduction of USAID has led to a "massive fire sale" and abandonment of equipment intended for global foreign aid projects. Thousands of items, from mosquito nets to medical clinics, are being auctioned off at a loss or simply left behind due to the cancellation of over 5,000 projects and minimal guidance for closeout. While some NGOs managed to donate supplies to local partners, many items, including textbooks for Afghan girls' schools and water sanitation equipment, remain stranded or destroyed. This "fire sale" is projected to cost $6 billion annually and risks 14 million additional deaths by 2030, raising severe humanitarian and national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Okta, an identity software maker, saw its shares rise after reporting fiscal second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street projections, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. CEO Todd McKinnon noted that economic conditions were "much better than we thought," leading the company to bump up its fiscal 2026 forecast. Despite some contract restructuring and procurement delays with U.S. government customers following President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency initiative, Okta's renewals remained strong. The company anticipates future growth from managing AI agent identities and selling software suites, asserting its value against competitors acquiring rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Dallas arrested Bratton Dean Wilkinson, 36, for allegedly making bomb threats outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. Wilkinson reportedly showed a "detonator" on his wrist and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack, prompting a shelter-in-place order. This incident follows a recent increase in threats and assaults against ICE officials, with the agency reporting a 1,000% rise since the beginning of the Trump administration, which is ramping up arrests. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons stated that the surge in violent protests has necessitated retooling training to ensure agent safety amidst escalating anti-ICE rhetoric.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. financial markets showed a muted reaction after President Trump announced the removal of Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, an unprecedented move analysts fear could compromise the central bank's independence. Trump cited mortgage fraud allegations, which Cook denies, asserting his lack of authority to fire her "for cause." Cook has vowed not to resign, setting up a potential legal challenge that will test presidential power over the Fed. Despite the political turmoil, traders remain confident in a September rate cut, with a high probability assigned to a 0.25% reduction, as the Fed Chair had previously signaled a potential policy adjustment.

          <p>NFL teams made significant roster cuts, reducing squads from 90 to 53 players, leaving many notable athletes, including several quarterbacks and former stars, without jobs. Among the surprising cuts were the league's tallest and heaviest players, a former Rams running back, and a star receiver. Quarterbacks like Dorian Thompson-Robinson, Dresser Winn, and DJ Uiagalelei were waived, often outplayed by new acquisitions or rookies. While many will seek spots on practice squads, the cuts highlight the fierce competition in the league.

          <p>Celtic's hopes for a fourth consecutive Champions League qualification were dashed after a penalty shootout defeat to Kairat Almaty, leaving manager Brendan Rodgers contemplative about the club's direction. The goalless draw over two legs saw captain Callum McGregor admit the team didn't deserve to progress, highlighting the significant financial blow of missing out on approximately £15.5 million from the elite competition. Former winger Aiden McGeady criticized Celtic's performance, citing a lack of quality and forward planning. The club now faces pressure to regroup and bolster its squad before the upcoming Old Firm fixture, with their European future now in the Europa League.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has ordered the state legislature to redraw its congressional maps, a development that could benefit Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. The ruling found that a 2020 bipartisan law unconstitutionally undermined Proposition 4, a voter-passed measure aiming for an independent redistricting commission and prohibiting partisan gerrymandering. Currently, all four of Utah's U.S. House seats are held by Republicans. This decision adds to a national trend of redistricting battles, with Democrats viewing the House as their best chance to regain power, making every winnable seat crucial in the closely divided chamber.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China stands to gain geopolitically from the ongoing stalemate in Ukraine peace negotiations, particularly following perceived failures by U.S. President Donald Trump to broker a deal. Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin and subsequent meeting with Ukrainian and European leaders yielded no ceasefire, as Putin's demands and Zelensky's refusal to cede territory remain firm. The article suggests that Trump's overtures to Putin and thinly veiled contempt for European allies underscore Washington's distancing from the conflict, creating a vacuum that positions China as a potential superpower with significant leverage in the region.</p>

This marks a rare corporate conviction for a worker's death in Travis County.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the potential for former President Trump to gain control of the Federal Reserve through the attempted firing of Governor Lisa Cook, a move currently facing a legal challenge. Under the "for cause" standard, Trump accuses Cook of mortgage fraud, which she denies, setting up a likely Supreme Court battle. If successful, Trump could appoint a majority of the seven-member Board of Governors. Crucially, the article explains how this majority could then block the reappointment of regional Fed presidents, effectively dictating interest rates and undermining the central bank's independence. Historical examples from Nixon's U.S. and Erdoğan's Turkey illustrate the severe economic risks of political interference in monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>
