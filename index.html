          <p>A Taiwanese official attended Japan's Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb commemorations for the first time, a notable diplomatic development. The move is part of Taiwan's broader strategy to enhance its international standing and strengthen unofficial ties with Tokyo. While observers note that Beijing will likely view the participation unfavorably, both China and Japan are expected to proceed with caution to avoid disrupting their own improving relations. The event highlights the delicate diplomatic balance in the region.</p>

Widespread heat advisories are in effect across the Plains and Northwest, with little overnight relief expected in some areas. In addition to the extreme heat, critical fire weather conditions persist in four western states due to low humidity and gusty winds, increasing the risk of rapid wildfire spread.

Her performance, characterized by strong returns and improved serving, sets up a challenging third-round match against either Aryna Sabalenka or Marketa Vondrousova.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor explained his decision to avoid joint practices with other NFL teams during training camp, a strategy employed by only three teams this year. Taylor argues that focusing on intrasquad competition and using preseason games for starters like Joe Burrow is more beneficial for the team's development and installation of new plays. He believes this approach allows the Bengals to focus on their own improvement rather than preparing for a specific practice opponent. The team will instead hold internal scrimmages to prepare for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new proposals to deport foreign nationals immediately after they receive a custodial sentence, rather than after serving part of it. The plan, which could apply retroactively, aims to save taxpayer money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Under the new rules, the decision to serve the sentence abroad would be left to the destination country, potentially allowing some to be freed upon arrival. Those serving life sentences for the most serious crimes would still complete their UK prison term first.</p>

          <p>Liverpool star Mohamed Salah publicly questioned UEFA for its social media tribute to Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid, which omitted the circumstances of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid was killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza while waiting for humanitarian aid. In response to UEFA's post honoring al-Obeid as a talent who gave hope, Salah pointedly asked the organization to clarify how, where, and why he died. The exchange highlights the intersection of sports and the ongoing conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square supporting the recently proscribed group Palestine Action. The arrests were primarily for the offense of showing support for a banned organization, a crime under the UK's Terrorism Act. Protesters held signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to one of the largest single-day mass arrests by the force in a decade. The event has sparked debate, with the government defending the ban and human rights groups like Amnesty International calling the arrests a disproportionate threat to free expression.</p>

          <p>An analysis of India's Hindi-language film industry, Bollywood, reveals a significant shift in its depiction of the Kashmir region over the decades. Once portrayed as a romantic, idyllic paradise in post-independence cinema, its image transformed into a conflict-ridden battleground following the rise of militancy in the late 1980s. More recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," are described as increasingly "statist," aligning with the Indian government's political narratives. This evolution reflects how the region's complex sociopolitical realities have been represented and, at times, simplified for national audiences.</p>

          <p>In excerpts from her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has forcefully denied that there was a conspiracy to destroy her predecessor and mentor, Alex Salmond. She accuses Salmond of being unwilling to accept responsibility for his "inappropriate" behavior towards women and of choosing to attack democratic institutions rather than show contrition. Sturgeon describes her refusal to intervene in a government investigation into complaints against him as the breaking point in their political partnership. The memoir provides her perspective on the high-profile fallout that fractured Scottish politics.</p>

          <p>Three Thai soldiers were injured, one severely, when one of them stepped on a landmine near the border with Cambodia. The incident occurred in a region that has been the subject of a long-running dispute and recent armed clashes between the two nations. Thailand's army stated the event demonstrates that concealed weapons are still being used in the area, accusing Cambodia of violating the Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines. Cambodian officials denied laying new mines, stating the device could be a remnant from past conflicts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a press conference for Monday, claiming it will "essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C." This follows his recent threat to assume federal control of the city's police force after an administration staffer was injured in an attempted hijacking. The White House has already initiated a seven-day surge of federal law enforcement on the city's streets. The announcement comes despite official data showing that violent crime rates in the district have significantly decreased over the past year.</p>

          <p>The German government's decision to temporarily halt exports of certain military equipment to Israel has sparked controversy within the country's ruling coalition and opposition. The move, made in response to Israel's planned military operations in Gaza, was criticized by some conservative politicians as a departure from Germany's long-standing policy of support for Israel. However, the decision also received backing from other conservatives and from the Social Democrats, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's junior coalition partner, who described it as a necessary reaction to the Israeli government's recent actions.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through a homeowner's roof in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than Earth. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which arrived during a meteor event in June that was witnessed across the state. The rock is believed to have originated from a large asteroid that broke up in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter about 470 million years ago. Scientists have proposed naming it the McDonough Meteorite.</p>

Investigators are exploring the theory that the attack was motivated by the gunman's anti-vaccine beliefs, as neighbors reported he was outspoken on the topic.</p>

This claim, which the BBC could not independently verify, has fueled local tensions.
