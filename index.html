            <p>Billionaire Bill Ackman is urging President Trump to pause the implementation of new tariffs, warning of potential bankruptcies for small and medium-sized businesses. Ackman highlights concerns raised by small business owners about their inability to absorb increased costs, citing examples like a cold brew coffee business facing significant price hikes on essential materials. Other billionaire backers of Trump, such as Stanley Druckenmiller, Kenneth Griffin, and Elon Musk, have also voiced opposition to the tariffs. The tariffs, including reciprocal measures from China and the EU, are already impacting businesses and raising fears of a broader economic downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats have reached a coalition agreement with the Social Democrats to form a new government in Germany, ending five months of political uncertainty since the previous government's collapse. The agreement includes measures to control irregular migration and impose border controls, addressing voter concerns from the recent elections. The new government also plans to reform debt rules to allow for increased investment in the military and infrastructure. This coalition aims to stabilize Germany and reassure Europe of the country's reliability amid economic turbulence caused by trade tariffs and rising support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).</p>

            <p>Federal judges in Texas and New York have temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelan men under the Alien Enemies Act, following Supreme Court's decision to allow deportations to proceed with due process. The judges cited concerns about potential irreparable harm to the individuals if deported without proper judicial review, referencing a case where a man was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Attorneys for the Venezuelans argue that the Trump administration's invocation of the Act is unconstitutional, as the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela, and dispute the categorization of the plaintiffs as gang members. The Alien Enemies Act has historically been used only during declared wars.</p>

            <p>Concerns are rising that China could sell its holdings of U.S. mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs, potentially driving up mortgage rates. This action, combined with the Federal Reserve's reduction of its MBS portfolio, could further destabilize the already struggling spring housing market. Analysts suggest that a lack of visibility into the extent of potential sales by foreign entities could spook investors and widen mortgage spreads. The housing market is currently facing challenges due to high home prices and weakening consumer confidence, making it vulnerable to further economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The bond market is experiencing unusual volatility, with Treasury yields spiking amid growing recession concerns driven by President Trump's tariff policies. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 4.5%, reaching levels not seen since February, while the 30-year yield hit 5.02%. Typically, economic uncertainty would drive investors towards bonds, lowering yields, but the opposite is happening. This is due to fears that tariffs are helping to trigger a recession.

            <p>President Trump's escalating tariffs are causing financial strain for businesses, potentially leading to freight abandonment at ports as companies reject incoming goods they cannot afford. Businesses, both large and small, are telling CNBC that the high tariffs could result in freight being abandoned at ports as cash-strapped owners and CEOs reject incoming goods that could financially wipe them out. The tariffs are creating a cash flow burden, forcing businesses to delay shipments and renegotiate prices with retailers. Some importers are considering moving manufacturing out of China, but establishing new supply chains takes years, and for many, there are no factories in the United States.</p>

            <p>Cal-Maine, the largest egg producer in the U.S., has reported soaring profits as consumer egg prices hit record highs, partly attributed to avian flu. The company's profits more than tripled compared to the same quarter last year, reaching $1 billion in windfall income. The price of eggs was a major issue during the 2024 election, with Donald Trump and many voters blaming above inflationary prices on Joe Biden’s economic policies. The Trump administration has opened an investigation into price-fixing by major egg corporations, including Cal-Maine, leading to a drop in the company's shares. (not investment advice)</p>
