          <p>President Donald Trump declared his intent to deploy the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, aiming to address the city's crime challenges, a move he claims is supported by state and local leaders. This announcement shifts focus from Chicago, a city previously considered for federal intervention, and follows Trump's earlier deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., which faced legal challenges regarding presidential authority. The article highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding the legal framework for federalizing law enforcement in U.S. cities, with previous attempts in Los Angeles also being blocked by a federal judge. Trump remains confident in the legality of his actions, despite the constitutional questions raised.</p>

          <p>David Ellison, the new CEO and chairman of the merged Paramount Skydance, has swiftly initiated a transformative strategy, securing a seven-year, $7.7 billion deal for exclusive UFC streaming rights and acquiring rights to develop a live-action Call of Duty film. He also brought in "Stranger Things" creators, the Duffer Brothers, for exclusive content and made a key executive hire, underscoring a commitment to significant investment in content and technology. The article also reports on Paramount Skydance's consideration of a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, which could further consolidate Ellison's media empire. These ambitious actions aim to reposition the company in the competitive entertainment landscape, though analysts anticipate a substantial investment phase before seeing a major financial upside.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's airstrike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, demonstrates the worthlessness of former President Donald Trump's pledges of protection to the emirate. Despite Qatar's substantial investments in US military infrastructure and a luxury jet donation to Trump, the attack proceeded, reportedly aiming to derail ceasefire negotiations. The author asserts that under Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel acts as a rogue state with impunity, enabled by unconditional US support. The article suggests this incident has collapsed current talks and damaged Qatar's role as a mediator, leaving its leaders to question the reliability of US assurances.</p>

          <h2>Teacher Evaluations Linked to Rising Grade Inflation and Declining Academic Rigor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how ubiquitous teacher evaluations contribute significantly to grade inflation and a decline in academic rigor at American colleges. Professors, whose pay, hiring, and tenure often depend on high student ratings, are incentivized to lighten workloads and give better grades, even though research shows students are poor judges of effective teaching. The system rewards ease over genuine learning and is susceptible to various biases. While some institutions are attempting to reduce reliance on these evaluations, their entrenched nature and the desire to satisfy "customer" students make them difficult to eliminate, perpetuating a cycle of inflated grades.</p>
