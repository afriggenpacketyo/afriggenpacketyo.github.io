        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams was awarded €100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC. The case stemmed from a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and online article that alleged Adams sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, an allegation Adams vehemently denies. Adams stated the case was about holding the BBC accountable, arguing the corporation upholds a British state ethos out of sync with the Good Friday Agreement. The BBC expressed disappointment, defending its journalistic diligence while acknowledging the implications of the verdict on freedom of expression, with Adams' solicitor calling the allegations untrue and defamatory. The article highlights the legal battle and Adams' broader critique of the BBC's role in Ireland's peace process. </p>

Musk, who led the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will be returning to the private sector but will remain an advisor to the President. During his time in Washington, Musk aimed to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget but only achieved roughly $160 billion in documented savings, with some analysts suggesting DOGE's actions could cost the government $135 billion. Despite this, Musk participated in Cabinet meetings, traveled on Air Force One, and showcased Tesla vehicles at the White House, demonstrating his close relationship with President Trump. </p>

          <p>President Trump has accused China of violating a recent trade agreement with the United States, casting doubt on the accord's stability. This criticism comes shortly after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that trade talks with China were stalled.

According to the UN, the entire population of Gaza is at risk of famine, a claim disputed by Israeli authorities.

The UN has criticized the mission to deliver aid as being severely obstructed, while the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent reports that half of its medical facilities in the area are non-operational due to shortages of fuel and equipment.</p>

The company's leaders noted that tariffs have led to higher costs and supply chain adjustments, occasionally necessitating price increases. Costco's net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, while comparable sales increased by 8%, and e-commerce sales rose nearly 16%. While other retailers warn of higher prices due to tariffs, Costco is attempting to mitigate these costs through various strategies, including rushing orders and sourcing private-label items locally.

However, many autism scientists argue that genetics, not environmental factors, are the primary driver of autism's development. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, building a strong case for genetic influence. Researchers fear Kennedy’s fixation on toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of new therapies for those with profound autism, with experts pointing out that the increase in autism rates is mostly explained by expanding definitions and more awareness.</p>

          <p>Amelie Mauresmo, the French Open director, has responded to criticism regarding the scheduling of night sessions, which have predominantly featured men's singles matches. Questions have been raised about the tournament's efforts to promote the women's game, as only four women's matches have been scheduled for night sessions since their introduction in 2021. Mauresmo cited the potential for women's matches to be shorter as the reason behind the choices, emphasizing the desire to avoid late finishes. She also noted the success of a recent night match with a full crowd as a measure of the schedule's success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs has been hailed as a victory for the constitutional system of separation of powers. The court found that Trump does not have the "unbounded authority" he claims to impose tariffs without legislative authorization. The decision, prompted by a case filed by the Liberty Justice Center, challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imports, arguing that such action exceeds his constitutional authority. The ruling imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the IEEPA tariffs, but the administration has appealed the decision.</p>

This is attributed to the perceived potential and symbolic value of advanced degrees, although skills-based hiring is becoming increasingly common.

The author claims Musk's efforts to cut government spending through DOGE have been largely unsuccessful and have resulted in significant harm, particularly through the decimation of U.S.A.I.D. grants. It is alleged that these cuts have led to an estimated 300,000 deaths, mostly of children, with the author citing reports of increased malnutrition and disease in regions affected by the aid withdrawal.
