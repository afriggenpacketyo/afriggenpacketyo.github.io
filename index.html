        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Chinese chipmaker SMIC experienced a nearly 7% drop after the company's first-quarter earnings fell short of anticipated figures. While revenue increased by approximately 28% year-over-year to $2.24 billion and profits attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million, these numbers did not meet LSEG's estimates. A company representative attributed the shortfall to production fluctuations that led to lower average selling prices, which is expected to continue into the second quarter. Despite the earnings miss, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, driven by geopolitical shifts and increased demand due to government policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump abruptly dismissed Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, sparking outrage among Democrats who praised her service and dedication to modernizing the Library of Congress. Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, was notified of her termination via email, which cited President Trump's decision. A conservative advocacy group had criticized Hayden for promoting children's books with "radical" content and material by Trump opponents. Democrats condemned the firing as unjust and an assault on American values, highlighting Hayden's efforts to make the Library more accessible and inclusive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. might reduce tariffs on Chinese goods as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks in Switzerland. Trump indicated that the new import taxes of up to 145% imposed on China since his return to the White House were unsustainable. China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying expressed confidence in Beijing's ability to manage trade issues with the U.S., while analysts noted that both sides face growing economic pressure. Despite the anticipation, experts cautioned that any tariff cuts resulting from the meeting would likely be minor, and significant systemic frictions between the U.S. and China would persist.</p>

She stated that Weinstein ordered her to remove her blouse, touched her inappropriately, and warned her to remain silent about the incident. Weinstein denies the allegations and is undergoing a retrial after his previous conviction was overturned. The accuser also described a separate incident four years later where she alleges Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex, stating that her "soul was removed from me" during the alleged 2006 sexual assault.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to recently implemented tariffs. While exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, exports to ASEAN surged by 20.8%. Analysts suggest that the overall export growth may be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs. The Chinese government has been encouraging exporters to shift sales to the domestic market to mitigate the economic impact of the tariffs, potentially leading to deeper deflation.</p>
