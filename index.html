        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources indicate that former President Donald Trump has privately expressed his disappointment with some of his Supreme Court appointees, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett being a primary focus of his frustration, as he feels they are not adequately supporting his agenda. Allies of Trump have also voiced their concerns about Barrett's perceived lack of strength to the president directly. Despite these private complaints, Trump has not publicly criticized Barrett and defended her after she sided with liberal justices on a foreign aid payment ruling. Trump has, however, publicly criticized Leonard Leo, a Federalist Society leader who advised him on judicial nominations. The former president is reportedly looking to nominate judges in the mold of Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and the late Antonin Scalia.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk, a Navy ship named after the gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. The decision aligns with Hegseth's stated goal of "reestablishing a warrior culture" within the US armed forces, following a purge of diversity initiatives at the Pentagon. Other ships, including those named after Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, may also be renamed. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned the reported move as a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of Milk's legacy. This decision is part of a broader effort to dismantle diversity programs within the military.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has been exempted from President Donald Trump's executive order, which doubles steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50% for most countries. While the UK will not face the increased tariffs, the existing 25% levy remains in place until a UK-US tariff pact signed in May comes into effect, which will eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminum. A UK government spokesperson stated the commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors. The Conservatives, however, described the order as a "fresh tariff blow."</p>

          <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill designed to prevent China from purchasing land near strategic assets, such as military bases, leading to backlash. Critics, including state Senate Majority Leader Janae Shamp, called the veto "utterly insane" and accused Hobbs of obstructing efforts to protect citizens from threats. Hobbs defended her decision, arguing that the bill was "ineffective at counter-espionage" and did not "directly protect" American military assets. The bill, S.B. 1109, would have prohibited the People's Republic of China from having a 30% or more stake in Arizona property. Other states have proposed or passed similar legislation to restrict foreign property ownership.</p>

          <p>A US judge ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care to transgender inmates, despite an executive order signed by Donald Trump to halt funding for such care. The ruling allows a class-action lawsuit by over 2,000 transgender inmates to proceed. The judge ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide hormone therapy and accommodations, but not surgical care. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the ruling as a reminder that transgender people have constitutional rights. The Justice Department had argued the judge should defer to the policy decision of the president, but the judge stated that democracy requires respect for duly enacted laws.</p>

Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu were allegedly receiving Chinese government funding for their research, some of which was conducted at the University of Michigan. Authorities allege that Jian's electronics contain information indicating her membership in the Chinese Communist Party. The FBI describes the fungus as causing "head blight," a disease affecting wheat, barley, maize, and rice, resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses.

He stated that China is not neutral and is diplomatically, economically, and militarily aligned with Russia.

Musk's accomplishments during his time in government are debated, with some reporting that he failed to achieve significant cuts, while others highlight the damage caused by his actions, such as the reduction of US foreign aid. Musk claims he will return to focusing on his companies and reduce his political spending, though his recent comments suggest he remains engaged in politics.</p>

The Senate is preparing for a four-week period to address concerns within the GOP and pass the bill, facing challenges due to fiscal conservatives worried about the deficit and moderates concerned about Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add over $3 trillion to the federal debt over the next 10 years.
