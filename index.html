          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders has responded to a teammate's comment that distinguished between "entertainers and competitors," which was widely interpreted as a slight against him. Sanders stated that he is unaffected by others' words and had spoken with fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel, who claimed the media had twisted his statement. Despite the clarification, Sanders expressed some ambiguity about whether he fully believed Gabriel's explanation. The situation adds a layer of interpersonal dynamics to the Browns' crowded quarterback room as the team prepares for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has determined that Alina Habba, the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, was not lawfully appointed to her position. The ruling states that Habba has been exercising her duties without legal authority since July 2025, potentially voiding actions taken during her tenure. Judge Matthew Brann's decision came after her appointment was challenged in two separate criminal cases. The Trump administration has announced its intention to immediately appeal the ruling, which has been temporarily stayed to allow for the appeal process.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June but still higher than the 3% forecast by economists. A key factor in the cooling rate was the easing of rice price inflation, which had previously surged dramatically. The "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy and is closely watched by the Bank of Japan, held steady at 3.4%. This data comes as the central bank has recently upgraded its inflation forecasts for the fiscal year, signaling persistent price pressures in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing mounting debt from years of unprofitable harvests, has found a novel and successful alternative by pivoting to solar grazing. Instead of traditional farming, Chad Raines now rents his flock of 6,000 sheep to green energy companies to manage vegetation at large-scale solar farms. This innovative business model has proven highly lucrative, turning a significant annual loss from cotton farming into a substantial profit. The story highlights a creative solution for struggling small farmers and a symbiotic relationship between agriculture and the renewable energy sector.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with cutting $783 million in research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The 5-4 decision lifts a lower court's order that had blocked the cuts, which are part of a broader push to eliminate federal diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Plaintiffs, including several states and public health groups, argued the cuts would cause severe harm to research on topics like suicide prevention and Alzheimer's disease.

          <p>A global contest to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is intensifying. China and Russia are currently considered leaders in the field, while the United States and the United Kingdom are working to catch up after years of focusing on counter-terrorism. These weapons pose a significant strategic threat because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult to detect and intercept with current defense systems. The proliferation of this technology is raising concerns about a new, destabilizing arms race among major world powers.</p>

          <p>Aberdeen midfielder Dante Polvara made a significant impact as a substitute in the team's 2-2 Europa League draw against FCSB, sparking a comeback from a two-goal deficit. The American player, who has been used sparingly this season, scored a brilliant goal just three minutes after coming on and was a constant threat. His performance has intensified calls from fans and pundits for him to be given a starting role in the team. Polvara's dynamic cameo showcased his versatility and energy, presenting a strong case to manager Jimmy Thelin ahead of the crucial second-leg match.</p>

          <p>An active shooter alert that caused panic and a massive law enforcement response at Villanova University has been declared a "cruel hoax" by the school's president. The false report, which claimed a shooter was at the university's law school, led to a campus-wide lockdown and shelter-in-place order. Officials confirmed that there was no shooter, no injuries, and no evidence of any firearms on campus. The incident is now under investigation by local and federal authorities, who have emphasized that making such false reports, an act known as swatting, is a serious crime.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its campaign to oust Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, urging Fed Chair Jerome Powell to remove her from the board. This follows unconfirmed allegations from Trump officials that Cook, a Joe Biden appointee, committed mortgage fraud. Cook has stated she has "no intention of being bullied" into resigning and is gathering information to answer any legitimate questions. The move represents an unprecedented challenge to the central bank's independence, as the Federal Reserve Act does not grant the chair authority to remove another governor.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine project, which would be built on a sacred Apache site in Arizona known as Oak Flat.

The San Carlos Apache Tribe, which is fighting to protect the site, celebrated the court's decision as a crucial, albeit possibly temporary, victory. The case pits major economic interests and the growing demand for copper against Indigenous religious freedom and environmental preservation.</p>

          <p>This analysis article argues that the Trump administration's recent diplomatic efforts concerning Ukraine have been confusing and have ultimately weakened the U.S. position. While President Trump committed to providing American "security guarantees" to Ukraine, Russia has publicly rejected any peace plan involving foreign troops, making the U.S. president look ineffective. The article suggests that the promise of NATO-like protection is undermined by Russia's predictable opposition and a lack of a credible threat of force from the U.S. The author concludes that the administration's desired image of strength does not match the reality of the diplomatic situation.</p>
