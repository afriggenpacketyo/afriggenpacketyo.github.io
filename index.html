          <p>New research indicates that two well-preserved mummified “puppies” found in Siberia are actually wolf cubs, not early domesticated dogs.  Analysis of their gut contents and genetic data reveals they lived near a mammoth-butchering site but showed no signs of human interaction. The findings provide insights into the diet and environment of ice-age wolves.</p>
