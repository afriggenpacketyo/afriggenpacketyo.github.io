          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed victory over Israel following a ceasefire, asserting that Iran inflicted a "big slap in the face" to the U.S. by attacking the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, though missiles were intercepted. Khamenei downplayed the impact of U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, contradicting assessments from U.S. intelligence agencies and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. The IAEA reported "very significant physical damage" to key Iranian nuclear sites, while Iran has passed legislation to halt cooperation with the agency. Khamenei's remarks, delivered in a pre-recorded video, may be aimed at easing anxiety among the Iranian populace. </p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is being used to decipher carbonized papyrus scrolls from an ancient library buried during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Computer scientist Brent Seales is using a particle accelerator to produce light 10 billion times brighter than the sun, much like an X-ray, to identify ink within the scrolls. A global competition, the Vesuvius Challenge, offered $700,000 in prize money, and three college students made history by extracting words from a 2,000-year-old scroll. Seales believes more scrolls could be discovered as archaeologists continue to excavate the Villa of the Papyri.</p>

He noted that Iran was not cooperating in negotiations before military intervention was taken, but clarified that he was not criticizing the decision to strike.

          <p>A group of 40 former presidents and prime ministers warned of a looming crisis of inequality, potentially leading to the emergence of the first trillionaires while nearly half of humanity remains in poverty. They issued a joint appeal for a "new economic coalition of the willing" to address inequality, poverty, and environmental breakdown. The leaders condemned "narrow unilateralism" and urged comprehensive debt relief, international tax cooperation, and reform of institutions like the IMF. Despite the grim assessment, they expressed optimism that a "powerful shift is possible" and advocated for a coalition founded upon values of solidarity and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Some Americans who rely on Medicaid are concerned that President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would require 40 states and D.C. to add a work requirement to Medicaid, will jeopardize their healthcare. The bill would require enrollees to prove they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or qualify for an exemption. Studies show that most working-age enrollees already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the work requirement would cause about 5 million adults to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034.</p>

          <p>The MAGA movement envisions an ideal American family with many children, a working father, and a stay-at-home mother. Republicans have proposed policies to boost birth rates and encourage parents to stay home, with a clear expectation that the mother would be the stay-at-home parent. Reversing decades-long trends in women's employment would require substantial financial incentives, potentially costing trillions of dollars. Experts suggest that to make stay-at-home motherhood viable, the government would need to provide significant financial support to compensate for lost income and overcome cultural shifts.</p>

The prosecution rested its case after calling 34 witnesses, including Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura Fine, who testified about being pressured into participating in "freak-offs".

          <p>The U.S. economy contracted more than initially projected in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP falling at an annual rate of 0.5%. This decline, the first in three years, was attributed to a surge in imports as companies rushed to buy foreign goods before tariffs took effect. Consumer spending also slowed significantly, reaching its lowest level since the pandemic ended. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified that businesses' efforts to build inventories ahead of tariffs have delayed inflationary impacts, with the effects expected to become more apparent in the summer.

          <p>US-China trade relations are expected to enter an uneasy pause as both countries retreat from extreme positions following months of escalating tensions. This breather comes after a high-stakes tariff battle and retaliatory measures, including China blocking rare earth exports and the U.S. restricting jet engines and semiconductor software. The pause, effective May 12, is set to last three months unless extended. Analysts anticipate that U.S. tariffs will be capped at 55% and China's at 10%, with both sides seeking more organized negotiations to moderate unpredictable approaches.</p>

The vote is one order of business for the panel, which is set to consider thimerosal in influenza vaccines. In the 2024-2025 respiratory disease season, 57% of infants were either born to a vaccinated mother or received monoclonal antibodies at birth, resulting in hospitalizations from RSV being reduced by 30%-40%, according to CDC data.</p>

The precise timing of the cuts could be affected by a looming decision by the Supreme Court which could soon hand down a ruling on whether to leave in place a lower court's order that temporarily paused government-wide layoffs. A senior State Department official told CBS News, "AFSA's statement is false, and the Department has no plans to violate a court order."

Justice Jackson accused the court's majority of weakening civil rights protections and depriving Medicaid recipients of their right to choose their healthcare provider.

          <p>Certain medications, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, heart medications, stimulants, and insulin, can interfere with the body's ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of heat-related illness. These drugs can affect sweating, blood flow, and fluid balance, making it harder to stay cool. It is important to stay hydrated, avoid peak heat hours, and monitor for warning signs of heat-related illness. If experiencing difficulties coping with the heat, individuals should consult their doctor or pharmacist.</p>
