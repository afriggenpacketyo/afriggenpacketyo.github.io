          <p>A woman found deceased in Spain in 2005, known as "the woman in pink," has been identified as Russian national Liudmila Zavada. The breakthrough came through Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, which uses modern biometric data and public appeals to solve cold cases involving murdered or suspiciously deceased women in Europe. Zavada's fingerprints, submitted by Spanish police, were matched by authorities in Turkey, and a DNA sample from a relative confirmed her identity. The successful identification highlights the initiative's effectiveness in bringing closure to long-unresolved cases and providing new leads for investigators.</p>

          <p>CarMax stock experienced a significant drop of over 20% after the used auto retailer reported disappointing second-quarter financial results, falling short of Wall Street's earnings and revenue forecasts. The company's CEO described the quarter as "challenging," citing difficult market conditions and depreciation of its vehicle inventory as key factors for the downturn. Overall vehicle sales and net income also saw considerable declines compared to the previous year. CarMax's performance is often viewed as a bellwether for the broader auto retail sector, causing shares of other car retailers to fall as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter, with the gross domestic product (GDP) expanding at a 3.8% annualized rate, according to the Commerce Department's final revision. This figure is a significant increase from the previous estimate of 3.3% and marks a strong rebound from the first quarter's contraction. The upward revision was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected consumer spending, particularly on services, indicating continued resilience among American shoppers despite economic headwinds. This strong performance could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding future interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the University of California, Berkeley, reveals that the climate crisis is imposing significant "hidden costs" on California households, worsening the state's existing affordability issues. These costs manifest as rising utility bills, increased healthcare expenses from events like wildfires, and lost wages for workers in affected industries. The analysis estimates that the average American born in 2024 could face up to $500,000 in additional lifetime costs due to climate change.

          <p>With children back in school, concerns about head lice infestations are rising, prompting health experts to share prevention and treatment advice. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that up to 12 million infestations occur annually in the U.S., primarily among young children. Lice spread through direct head-to-head contact, not due to poor hygiene, and cannot jump or fly. Prevention methods include avoiding sharing hats and brushes, while treatment options range from over-the-counter medications to professional removal services. The CDC also clarifies that students with lice do not need to be sent home from school immediately.</p>

          <p>Russia is facing significant economic pressure from its ongoing war in Ukraine, leading the Kremlin to plan tax increases and spending cuts to manage a growing budget deficit. The government announced a hike in the value-added tax and is expected to reduce non-defense spending, including in areas like healthcare and education. This economic strain is largely due to falling oil and gas revenues, which have been impacted by sanctions, a stronger ruble, and Ukrainian attacks on energy infrastructure. Analysts suggest these mounting financial woes could increase pressure on President Putin to seek an end to the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Brian Niccol stated the changes are necessary to build a more resilient company, while the Starbucks Workers United union criticized the decision, arguing it ignores the input of baristas.

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed he was the victim of "triple sabotage" during his appearance at the United Nations, citing a series of technical failures. In a social media post, he detailed how an escalator he was on stopped abruptly, his teleprompter failed during his speech, and the sound system in the auditorium was apparently off. Trump dismissed the idea of coincidence and demanded the UN Secretary-General launch an investigation into the incidents. A UN official later told reporters that a person in Trump's entourage had inadvertently hit the escalator's emergency stop lever.</p>

          <p>The French navy has successfully intercepted a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa, seizing 9.6 tons of cocaine with an estimated street value of over $600 million. The major operation was conducted by two naval ships as part of France's long-standing Corymbe mission, which aims to secure the Gulf of Guinea. The seizure followed a tip from international anti-drug and maritime intelligence agencies, including British police. This bust represents a significant blow to international drug trafficking networks that use West African maritime routes to transport narcotics to Europe.</p>

          <p>Shares of offshore drilling company Transocean experienced a steep decline of around 14% after the company announced it would sell 125 million shares at a discounted price. The offering price was significantly below the stock's previous closing price, prompting a negative reaction from the market. The Swiss-based company expects to raise approximately $381 million from the sale, which it plans to use to pay down existing debt. Such share offerings can dilute the value for existing shareholders, often leading to a drop in the stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cultural analysis suggests that Gen Z has largely abandoned traditional dating models in favor of a more fluid and complex landscape with its own extensive vocabulary. Terms like "situationships" and "sneaky links" describe a variety of casual, often non-committal entanglements where emotional vulnerability is frequently avoided. This shift is attributed to a world shaped by the internet, social media, and a desire for autonomy, creating a wide array of relationship options without a clear guide. While this allows for more personalized paths, it can also lead to stress and confusion in navigating intimacy.</p>

          <p>A shift in U.S. drug policy is emerging, with Democratic mayors and the president increasingly aligning on a tougher approach to addiction and public drug use. This trend is exemplified in Philadelphia, where the new mayor has cut city funding for a long-standing clean needle exchange program, a harm-reduction strategy once widely supported by Democrats. The move reflects a broader political convergence away from harm reduction and towards more enforcement-focused policies. This change is occurring as cities grapple with the ongoing fentanyl crisis and public pressure to address its visible consequences.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Rangers FC's poor start to the season explores the tactical struggles under new manager Russell Martin. Despite his reputation for an attacking, possession-based style, the team has failed to secure wins and suffered a humiliating Champions League qualifying defeat. The article suggests Martin's system has left the team vulnerable to counter-attacks by losing the ball in central areas with too few players back to defend. In response to intense pressure, Martin has recently abandoned his long-held philosophy for a more pragmatic, defensive formation, a drastic change that highlights the urgency of the situation.</p>

          <p>A new report alleges that the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was largely unreachable for hours during the deadly floods that struck Texas in July. This communication failure reportedly delayed the deployment of essential search-and-rescue resources in a disaster that killed over 130 people. The agency's response was also allegedly hampered by a new policy requiring the Homeland Security Secretary to personally approve any expenditure over $100,000. The report has led to calls for the acting administrator's resignation and adds to criticism of the federal government's slow response.</p>

          <p>South America's football governing body, Conmebol, has officially proposed expanding the 2030 World Cup to 64 teams, a significant increase from the 48-team format set for 2026. Proponents argue the expansion would be a fitting way to celebrate the tournament's centenary and would make the event more inclusive. However, the idea has faced opposition from leaders of other confederations, including UEFA, who cite concerns about a decline in competitive quality and logistical chaos. A 64-team tournament would involve 128 matches, raising questions about scheduling, player welfare, and environmental impact.</p>

A memo from the Office of Management and Budget instructed agencies to identify employees in programs that could be subject to reduction-in-force notices, a more permanent step than typical furloughs. The move escalates the political stakes in the funding dispute between the White House and Congressional Democrats. Democratic leaders condemned the memo as an intimidation tactic.</p>
