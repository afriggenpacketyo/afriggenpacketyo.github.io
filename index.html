          <p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) reports facing an unprecedented crackdown from state authorities, including the sealing of its offices and freezing of bank accounts. Government officials deny pressuring the group, citing national security concerns and standard procedures for public events. Despite the obstruction and what rights organizations like Amnesty International call a shrinking space for civil liberties in the country, the HRCP has vowed to continue its work advocating for the people of Pakistan. The situation highlights growing authoritarianism and restrictions on freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has advocated for the creation of an international center to coordinate global cooperation on artificial intelligence. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, he highlighted the "fragmented trend" in AI governance and called for a widely accepted framework to be established soon. This proposal is seen as an effort by China to increase its influence in the rapidly evolving AI sector. The call for collaboration comes as the United States simultaneously releases its own blueprint aimed at bolstering American AI dominance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel and housekeeping experts, hotel rooms often harbor significant levels of bacteria in commonly overlooked areas. Decorative items like pillows and bed runners are reportedly washed infrequently, making them primary culprits for germs. Other high-touch surfaces such as remote controls, light switches, and phones are also cited as being particularly unclean. Experts advise travelers to be cautious, suggesting they wipe down these surfaces upon arrival and avoid using in-room glassware without first rinsing it thoroughly with hot water to ensure better hygiene.</p>

          <p>China's official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, has published a series of commentaries urging the force's political cadres to rebuild their public image. The guidelines emphasize demonstrating loyalty to the Communist Party leadership, maintaining honesty, and ensuring integrity in soldier promotions. Observers suggest this campaign is a response to recent corruption scandals and the misdeeds of high-ranking fallen generals. The articles signal Beijing's expectation that political officials within the People's Liberation Army must actively work to repair the damage to their reputation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly condemned the Hong Kong government for offering cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists residing in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries described the move as another clear example of "transnational repression." The bounties target 19 individuals accused of violating Beijing's national security law. In response, the UK has taken steps to sever extradition ties with Hong Kong, reaffirming its commitment to protecting the rights and safety of all individuals within its borders.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank, California, executed a sudden 300-foot dive just moments after takeoff to avoid another aircraft. The dramatic maneuver caused passengers to be thrown from their seats and resulted in injuries to two cabin crew members. The nearby aircraft was identified as a Hawker Hunter, a British fighter jet. The flight was able to continue safely to its destination in Las Vegas. This incident adds to a series of recent events that have raised concerns about aviation safety and air traffic control in the United States.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been questioned by the U.S. Department of Justice. Her lawyer stated that she answered all questions truthfully and that no offer of clemency was made for her cooperation. The questioning comes amid renewed attention on the case, including reports that President Trump was briefed that his name appeared in Epstein's files, a claim he denies. Maxwell is the only one of Epstein's associates to have been criminally charged following his 2019 death.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, to denounce what they call the country's slide into authoritarianism under President Kais Saied. The demonstration marked the fourth anniversary of Saied's 2021 power grab, when he dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree. Protesters chanted for "the fall of the regime" and the release of jailed opposition leaders, journalists, and activists. Critics and human rights groups state that Saied has used his expanded powers to crush all dissent and turn the nation into an "open-air prison."</p>
