          <h2>Texas Lawmakers Advance Bill Clarifying Abortion Exceptions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 18:25:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas lawmakers have moved forward with a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion ban, which took effect in 2022. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death. While not expanding abortion access or including exceptions for sexual assault or incest, the proposal marks a shift for Texas Republicans. Some abortion-rights allies have raised doubts about the bill's potential impact, while supporters aim to avoid confusion among doctors navigating exceptions under the existing ban.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Trump confronted South African President Ramaphosa with a video he claimed showed the persecution of white farmers in South Africa, a claim Ramaphosa disputed. Trump also raised the issue of alleged white "genocide," which has been widely discredited. Ramaphosa emphasized that black people are more likely to be victims of violence in South Africa and highlighted the presence of white members in his delegation as evidence against genocide claims. Trump's actions follow increased tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, including the suspension of U.S. aid and an offer to resettle Afrikaners in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Health insurer Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit Evernorth has reached a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower prices for employers and workers on GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.

The new deal will also include a simplified pre-authorization process and consistent pricing across retail pharmacies and home delivery services. Clients already offering the weight loss drugs are expected to see up to a 20% reduction in costs with the updated arrangement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston found the Trump administration in violation of a court order barring officials from deporting people to countries not their own without sufficient time to object. The ruling came after eight immigrants were deported, allegedly to South Sudan, with little notice. The judge, appointed by former President Biden, is considering criminal contempt penalties for those involved and seeking ways to provide the men with due process. Flight data indicates the deportees were transported via a private jet that made stops in Ireland before landing in Djibouti.</p>

          <p>The U.S. debt-and-deficit situation is worsening, leading to a credit rating downgrade from Moody's and market instability. Concerns are rising over President Trump's proposed spending bill, which could exacerbate fiscal problems. Experts anticipate an increase in the $36.2 trillion debt load and a budget deficit nearing 7% of GDP. This has resulted in higher Treasury yields as investors demand greater compensation for the perceived risk. The 30-year bond yield has topped 5%, reaching levels not consistently seen since the early 2000s, and the 10-year note has neared 4.6%.</p>

          <p>The United States has accepted a Boeing 747 jet as a gift from Qatar, with the Air Force tasked to upgrade it for use as a new Air Force One for President Trump. The plan has raised concerns among members of Congress about rushed security measures and potential undue influence from Qatar. Senator Schumer attempted to block the use of a foreign jet as Air Force One, but the bill was blocked by a Republican senator. The cost to retrofit the Qatari plane could reach $1 billion, adding to the already expensive maintenance of the existing Air Force One planes.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is acquiring Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for $6.4 billion in an all-equity deal, marking OpenAI's entry into the hardware world. Ive will take on creative and design responsibilities across OpenAI and io, with the io team merging with OpenAI's research, engineering, and product teams. The purchase is OpenAI's largest to date, following the recent acquisition of AI-assisted coding tool Windsurf for $3 billion. Ive, the former chief design officer at Apple, left in 2019 to start LoveFrom, a creative collective that will remain independent.</p>

          <p>The FDA's new framework for COVID-19 vaccines, led by Vinay Prasad and Marty Makary, may limit access to initial COVID vaccine series for healthy American children. The agency will require new clinical trial data for approving new COVID shots for healthy individuals under 65, potentially hindering vaccine availability for kids. Experts are concerned that this policy could leave children unprotected against the virus, despite its proven safety and effectiveness in reducing severe disease. This decision is based on the perspective that the risk isn't high enough to warrant vaccination for all children.</p>

Jayqwan Hamilton and Robert DeMaio received 40 years to life, while Jacob Barroso received 20 years to life. The defendants lured the victims, drugged them with fentanyl-laced cocktails, and drained their bank accounts. Judge Mennin noted the defendants spent the stolen money on luxury items, showing a disregard for the victims' lives. The case highlights a "deadly hustle" that targeted patrons at night spots.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his administration is close to brokering peace between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, two African nations with a long history of conflict. Trump credited Massad Boulos, the State Department's senior adviser for Africa, for helping settle the war. Both countries have submitted draft peace agreements that have been merged into one by the U.S. administration. The conflict between Congo and Rwanda has persisted for three decades, with the latest invasion of Congo by the Rwanda-backed M23 militia starting in late 2021.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions. The ruling, favored by conservative lawmakers and religious groups, states that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The decision has eroded bipartisan support for the law and prompted lawsuits. The judge sided with plaintiffs arguing that Congress would have explicitly included abortion if intended.</p>
