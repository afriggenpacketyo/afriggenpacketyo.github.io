          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth convened a meeting of the Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias Task Force, focusing on alleged targeting of Christians during the Biden administration. Bondi highlighted investigations into prosecutions of anti-abortion protesters and claims of FBI spying on traditional Catholics. She also cited the conviction of an Arizona man for plotting to bomb churches as a success in combatting violence. The meeting occurred amidst scrutiny of Hegseth's communication practices regarding potentially sensitive information.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers, potentially slowing the economy, according to experts. Approximately 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections starting May 5, leading to wage garnishments and reduced consumer spending. While the impact may be smaller than other economic factors like tariffs, it could compound existing economic challenges. The resumption of collections ends a pause initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting roughly 42 million borrowers with over $1.6 trillion in student debt.</p>

However, analysts caution that the recent strength is accompanied by light trading volumes, suggesting a significant catalyst like Federal Reserve easing or tariff deals is needed to break above resistance levels. Despite short-term uncertainties, long-term holders remain steadfast, supporting bitcoin's resilience amid economic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in Mahmoud v. Taylor, a case concerning LGBTQ-themed books in Maryland public schools, with the Republican justices appearing skeptical of the school district's policies. The case involves conservative Muslim and Christian parents objecting to the books on religious grounds. A key issue is whether parents should have the right to remove their children from classes where such books are used, and whether the Court's decision could impact public schools' ability to function. The justices explored various approaches, ranging from narrow rulings based on alleged animus to broader rules that could require extensive parental notification for any potentially objectionable content.</p>

A Morgan Stanley survey indicated strong iPhone upgrade intention rates and adoption of Apple Intelligence. However, concerns remain about potential price increases if tariffs are imposed, which could impact consumer demand. Apple is diversifying its supply chain to mitigate tariff risks, but the situation remains uncertain amidst ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey reveals that nearly half of Americans hold a negative view of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. The negative sentiment is attributed to concerns about Musk's controversial political activities and support for President Trump and Republicans. The survey indicates a significant gap between public sentiment towards electric vehicles and Tesla, with many potential EV buyers holding negative views of the company. The findings highlight the challenges Tesla faces in maintaining its brand image amidst political polarization and Musk's involvement in government.</p>
