          <p>Over 20 FEMA employees were suspended for signing an open letter, the "Katrina Declaration," which criticized the Trump administration for reversing post-Hurricane Katrina progress. The letter accused the administration of appointing unqualified leaders, cutting the workforce, and terminating infrastructure grants. FEMA defended its actions, stating its focus is on survivors over bureaucracy, while the employees were placed on paid administrative leave without explicit reason, fueling concerns about retaliation and the agency's operational integrity.</p>

          <p>CDC Director Susan Monarez was removed from her role just weeks after being sworn in, a move her attorney disputes as not a resignation. This significant shakeup saw four other senior officials resign, citing grave concerns over the spread of vaccine misinformation, proposed budget cuts, and the "weaponizing of public health." The agency's leadership turmoil follows a tragic shooting at its Atlanta headquarters and a controversial nomination process under the Trump administration, highlighting a period of profound instability.</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim is under intense pressure following a humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to fourth-tier Grimsby, a result he called his "toughest night." The team's poor performance, including a 15th-place league finish last season and significant transfer spending, has raised questions about his future. Amorim's system, which marginalizes key players, is also drawing criticism, as the club's senior management evaluates its direction ahead of crucial upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair participated in a White House meeting with US President Donald Trump to discuss plans for post-war Gaza, with Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff indicating a "very comprehensive" plan is underway. This diplomatic effort unfolds amidst Israeli military preparations to conquer Gaza City, which has already seen a declared famine and warnings of horrific humanitarian consequences from the UN. The meeting's significance is heightened by Israeli officials dismissing the prospect of a Palestinian state, creating complex international dynamics.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding free childcare to 30 hours a week for working parents of children aged nine months to four years, starting in September. While this aims to reduce costs, concerns persist regarding insufficient staff and places, and providers often charge "top-up fees" not covered by funding. Charities warn that these fees make the "free" hours unaffordable for many, and a review of funding rates is ongoing amidst financial pressures on nurseries, impacting the scheme's accessibility.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage predicts the Scottish Conservatives will cease to be a political force, as three MSPs have quit the Tories in four months, joining Reform or becoming independent. Reform UK consistently polls ahead of the Scottish Tories, posing an "existential threat" to the party. This shift highlights a broader UK-wide wave for Reform and challenges Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay to define his party's platform amidst a splintering voter base and a changing political landscape.</p>

With an estimated 35 million Chinese casualties in WWII, Beijing emphasizes its sacrifice as a key Allied power. This stance counters Western narratives that frame China's growing global influence as a challenge to the existing security architecture, with China aiming to uphold global norms and its historical contributions.</p>

Nvidia's growth is primarily driven by its data center business, with Blackwell chip sales rising, and the company announced an additional $60 billion in share repurchases.
