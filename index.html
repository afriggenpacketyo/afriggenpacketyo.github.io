          <p>SoftBank Group has agreed to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a strategic move to bolster the Japanese conglomerate's artificial intelligence initiatives. This significant acquisition means ABB will no longer pursue a separate listing for its robotics business, with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son emphasizing a vision to fuse Artificial Super Intelligence with robotics to drive groundbreaking evolution. The deal aligns with SoftBank's broader strategy of investing in and acquiring technology companies to position itself at the forefront of the burgeoning AI sector, complementing its existing stakes in firms like chip designer Arm and OpenAI. ABB anticipates the sale will deliver immediate value to its shareholders, with proceeds allocated according to established capital principles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant UK espionage case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, accused of spying for China, collapsed because the government had not officially designated China as a national security threat during the alleged offenses. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, clarified that a recent precedent from a Russian spying case raised the evidential threshold for convictions under the Official Secrets Act. Despite extensive efforts over several months, the necessary government evidence stating China represented a national security threat at the relevant time was not provided. This situation has drawn criticism from ministers and MPs, with the government expressing frustration while denying any deliberate withholding of evidence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of UK motorists affected by a widespread car finance mis-selling scandal could receive an average of £700 per claim under new compensation plans proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The regulator estimates that approximately 44% of 14 million motor finance agreements made since 2007 may be eligible, with lenders potentially paying out £8.2 billion in total. This scheme addresses issues like undisclosed discretionary commission arrangements and unfair contracts. While the FCA aims for quick payouts, some industry figures believe the proposed compensation is excessive, whereas consumer groups and legal firms argue it might not fully reflect the financial harm suffered by victims.</p>

Police arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life, following the earlier arrest and subsequent bail of a 46-year-old man. Authorities confirmed no one was injured in the fire, but the building sustained significant damage, prompting an ongoing investigation. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cullimore appealed to the community for vital information, while Sussex Police reaffirmed their zero-tolerance stance on hate crime and their commitment to supporting local religious communities and addressing their concerns.</p>

          <p>A medical helicopter crashed on a Sacramento freeway Monday evening, critically injuring all three crew members aboard: a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic. The REACH helicopter had just departed from UC Davis Medical Center, bound for Redding, when it experienced an "in-air emergency" and went down on eastbound Highway 50. Remarkably, no vehicles on the busy freeway were involved in the incident, which occurred in the center lanes. Bystanders and fire crews performed a swift rescue, lifting the aircraft off a trapped crew member, and all three injured individuals are currently receiving critical care. Both the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration have launched investigations into the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open flat on Wednesday, reflecting a challenging week marked by political instability and economic concerns across the region. The surprise resignation of French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu, though temporarily delayed by President Macron, highlights ongoing budget impasses and political deadlock in France. Concurrently, the UK steel industry faces significant pressure and potential existential threats following the European Union's announcement to reduce tariff-free quotas and hike tariffs on imported steel. These regional issues, alongside a flat performance in Asia-Pacific stocks and losses on Wall Street due to concerns over AI trade and the US government shutdown, contribute to a cautious global market sentiment.</p>

          <p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, are scheduled to join Gaza peace plan talks in Egypt, following two days of indirect negotiations that ended without significant breakthroughs. President Trump expressed a positive outlook on the potential for broader Middle East peace, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refrained from commenting on the talks' progress. Key sticking points include disagreements over Israeli withdrawal maps from Gaza and Hamas's insistence on robust guarantees to prevent a resumption of hostilities after the initial phase of any deal. The negotiations are centered on achieving a permanent ceasefire, facilitating hostage-prisoner exchanges, ensuring Israeli forces withdraw, arranging humanitarian aid, and establishing post-war governance for the territory.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, driven by investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst escalating economic and political uncertainty worldwide. This rally, the largest since the 1970s, is attributed to factors including US President Trump's tariffs and delays in economic data release due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which typically boosts gold demand. Analysts view gold as a crucial hedge against market turbulence, with a record $64 billion invested in gold exchange-traded funds this year, reflecting increased retail and institutional interest. While some experts predict continued upward trends, they also caution that prices could dip if interest rates rise or geopolitical tensions ease, noting that gold's role as a hedge can be unwound.

          <p>France's persistent political instability, underscored by Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu's recent, albeit temporarily paused, resignation, is intensifying scrutiny on the nation's soaring debt and budget deficit. The country's deficit, at 5.8% of GDP, and public debt, at 113% of GDP, significantly exceed European Union limits, placing France under an "excessive deficit procedure." This ongoing political deadlock, characterized by deep fragmentation and disagreements across the political spectrum, makes achieving the necessary fiscal consolidation by the 2029 deadline highly challenging. Economists predict continued budget slippage and a slowdown in growth, raising concerns among investors and potentially leading to further credit rating downgrades, highlighting a critical period for the euro zone's second-largest economy.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season, with forecasters predicting it will steadily strengthen into a hurricane within a day or so. As it tracks west-northwest across the open ocean, a tropical storm watch has been issued for the northern Leeward Islands, which are expected to experience swells, life-threatening surf, rip currents, and up to four inches of rain by late Thursday or Friday. Although the storm is not currently expected to make landfall, its potential impact on the islands is a concern. This development follows other recent Atlantic systems, including Hurricanes Humberto and Imelda, in what has otherwise been a relatively quiet hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has intensified into a Category 2 storm off Mexico's west coast, with maximum sustained winds of 105 miles per hour. Its outer bands are already affecting Baja California Sur, where a tropical storm watch is in effect, bringing forecasts of heavy rains and gusty winds into Wednesday. While Priscilla is expected to remain offshore and weaken over the coming days, forecasters warn of 1 to 2 inches of rain in southern Baja California Sur and west-central Mexico, with local totals up to 4 inches, posing a flash flood risk. Dangerous swells and rip currents are also impacting coastal areas, with potential moisture reaching the US Desert Southwest later in the week.</p>

          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts explained his decision to initially hold back rookie phenom Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the NLDS, opting for Blake Treinen despite a save situation. Roberts cited Sasaki's workload management and inexperience with back-to-back appearances as primary reasons, aiming to preserve his ace reliever for later in the demanding playoffs. The strategy nearly backfired as Treinen struggled, allowing two runs and forcing Sasaki into the game to record the final out. Moving forward, Sasaki is confirmed as the primary option for future save situations, though Roberts emphasized a continued cautious approach to his usage, balancing his dominant performance with the young pitcher's long-term health and lack of relief experience.</p>

Dolly, 79, cited the need for "a few procedures" to address ongoing health issues and insufficient time for rehearsals, rescheduling the concerts for September next year. This follows a previous announcement where she pulled out of a Dollywood event after being diagnosed with a "lot of problems" from a kidney stone. Freida expressed strong belief in the power of prayer and confidence in Dolly's eventual recovery, affirming her sister's strength and the immense love surrounding her.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the best-selling author and illustrator of "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," revealed his new book, "Always Remember," took six years to complete partly because his iPad, containing many ideas and rough drawings, was stolen from his car. The theft resulted in the loss of significant, unbacked-up portions of the book, forcing him to reconstruct from memory. Mackesy, who also navigated the profound grief of losing his mother and his beloved dog, Barney (inspiration for the Mole character), during this period, described the setback as a test of resilience. Despite these challenges, he found motivation in connecting with readers whose lives were touched by his work, and is now focused on new creative projects and personal rewilding efforts.</p>

          <p>Portland residents living near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building are experiencing nightly clashes between federal agents and protesters, creating a "war zone" atmosphere with tear gas infiltrating homes. President Trump's threat to deploy the National Guard to quell the unrest has been temporarily halted by a federal judge, who questioned his constitutional authority. While some residents blame Antifa and express support for federal intervention, others, including Mayor Keith Willis, accuse federal agents of inciting violence and escalating the situation. The ongoing unrest has significantly impacted the community, forcing a nearby school to relocate and highlighting deep divisions over the protests and the appropriate federal response, with residents like Brennah Hammar even sleeping with a gas mask.</p>

The ads feature veterans discussing economic hardships and alleging that GOP governors would worsen conditions, with Republicans pushing back on claims.

This particular supermoon is known as the Hunter's Moon because it marks the first full moon in October, a name historically associated with preparations for winter in the northern hemisphere, when people would hunt and preserve meats before the cold season.

His victory is seen as a significant test of the former president's influence and the popularity of his "America First" agenda, particularly among Republican-leaning suburban voters in the Nashville area. The 7th Congressional District is a safely Republican seat, and the outcome could slightly expand the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House, with outside groups spending millions on the race.</p>

Trilogy Metals welcomed President Trump's decision to grant permits for the Ambler Road project, reversing a previous administration's rejection, and emphasizing its importance for securing domestic supply chains. This strategic action aims to counter China's undisputed dominance in the critical minerals supply chain, which is vital for energy infrastructure, defense technologies, and manufacturing, highlighting a geopolitical and economic imperative.

Backed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the measure aims to create more Democratic-favorable districts, counteracting Republican redistricting efforts in states like Texas. However, critics, including Republican and Green Party candidates, condemn it as "corrupt," "unconstitutional," and a partisan power grab, arguing it undermines the state's independent redistricting commission. Democratic candidates generally support the plan, viewing it as essential to protect California's influence in Washington, though some acknowledge unease with the partisan implications.

The majority of these tragic deaths are linked to suicide or drug use, with substances like spice and nitazines becoming increasingly deadly. The report underscores a profound systemic failure to adequately support homeless individuals, attributing the rise to increasing levels of poverty and a severely inadequate housing system. While the government acknowledges the "heartbreaking" figures and commits to accelerating efforts, experts and charities are urgently calling for consistent, multi-year funding and stronger leadership to effectively tackle the escalating national homelessness crisis.</p>
