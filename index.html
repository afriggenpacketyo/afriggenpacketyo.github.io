          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial is underway in New York City, with his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura expected to testify. Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004, manipulating women into commercial sex acts, often during drug-fueled parties. Ventura testified about alleged psychological and physical abuse, including an instance of sexual assault after their 2018 breakup. A hotel security video showing Combs attacking Ventura is key evidence; while prosecutors allege it occurred during a "freak off," Combs' lawyers argue it shows a consensual relationship. Ventura had previously filed a lawsuit against Combs, which was settled, and is now married and pregnant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird living in the southern Great Plains. In 2023, the bird was granted protection due to its population crash from hundreds of thousands to roughly 30,000. The administration argues that federal officials made an error when listing the bird, claiming it didn't adequately consider voluntary conservation efforts. This move signals a prioritization of oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, as prairie-chickens overlap with these areas. Critics say delisting the bird would endanger other species living in fossil fuel-rich regions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has cast doubt on the potential for success in Ukraine-Russia peace talks scheduled for Istanbul, stating that progress is unlikely without his direct involvement with Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian and Russian representatives are set to meet for the first time since the early stages of the conflict in 2022. Trump suggested that Putin's absence was due to his own decision not to attend. The return to Istanbul is symbolic, as the city hosted previous diplomatic efforts, including the Istanbul CommuniquÃ© in 2022.

          <p>President Trump has proposed turning the Gaza Strip into a "freedom zone," suggesting displacing Palestinians from the territory. His comments came as the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks surpassed 53,000. Ceasefire talks appear stalled despite the presence of negotiators in Qatar. Hamas agreed to release a U.S.-Israeli hostage after direct talks with the Trump administration, but wants guarantees of an end to the war and troop removal in exchange for releasing remaining hostages. Trump's visit to the Gulf has focused on investment deals in U.S. companies, with Israel planning an offensive and a U.S.-backed plan to distribute food rations to displaced Palestinians.</p>

It also allows Dick's to enter international markets and reach a younger, more diverse customer base.

          <p>An anticipated round of Ukraine peace talks in Turkey became muddled as Ukrainian and Russian delegations arrived in different cities, creating uncertainty about whether they would meet. Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump both skipped the talks, sending mid-level officials instead. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, deeming Russia's delegation "theatrical." The situation was further complicated by Trump's presence in the Middle East, hinting at a possible visit to Turkey. Behind the scenes, Moscow and Kyiv hold differing approaches to ending the war, with Putin demanding concessions before a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Missouri Republican lawmakers have approved a referendum to repeal the abortion-rights amendment approved by voters six months prior. The proposed constitutional amendment, which would ban most abortions with exceptions for rape and incest, will go back to voters in November 2026. Democrats expressed outrage and vowed retaliation. Republicans contend they are giving voters a second chance, confident they will change their minds. The measure also seeks to prohibit gender-transition procedures for minors. Polling indicates most voters oppose most abortions but want limited exceptions.</p>

The proposals would only apply to asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected and who have no further routes of appeal in the UK. </p>

          <p>The article explores the phenomenon of "dry texting" among teenagers, where subtle changes in texting behavior indicate disapproval or anger. This passive-aggressive communication method can create confusion and anxiety. The author examines how phones and social media provide teenagers with tools to avoid direct conflict, but also how this can lead to more subtle and potentially hurtful forms of communication. The article suggests that learning how to navigate these ambiguous signals is an important part of developing social skills, and suggests that adults listen to and understand the role technology plays in teens' lives.</p>

          <p>Investors are growing concerned about the potential for President Trump's tax plan to increase the deficit, even as Republicans debate its specifics. Government bonds have sold off amid worries about the deficit-expanding effects of Trumpâ€™s tax cuts. The Republican bill, which would extend Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax cuts and introduce new ones, could add trillions to deficits over the next decade. Some fiscal hawks are alarmed, with one investor suggesting a need for a repeat of the Liz Truss situation to force fiscal responsibility. Trump indicated a preference for paying off debt before pursuing other initiatives.</p>
