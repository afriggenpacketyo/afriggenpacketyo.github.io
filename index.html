        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Federal Reserve warns that the resumption of student loan collections could lead to a spike in delinquencies and "potential spillovers" to other debts. As collection efforts restart, borrowers may face reduced disposable income, making it difficult to manage credit card bills and auto loans. The end of the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments has already caused a significant increase in delinquency rates, highlighting the financial pressure on borrowers. Experts suggest this could lead to increased credit card debt and overall financial instability.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's declining approval ratings, Democrats are failing to attract disillusioned voters, according to recent polls. Many voters remain distrustful of both parties, leading to a situation where neither Democrats nor Republicans are seen as a credible alternative. Surveys indicate that Americans still trust Trump more than Democrats to handle the country's main problems, and young voters and voters of color who supported Trump in 2024 are not necessarily returning to the Democratic Party. Democrats face challenges in reaching disengaged voters and must address the perception that they are out of touch with average Americans.</p>

          <p>A new study using machine learning casts doubt on the theory that dark streaks on Mars are evidence of flowing water.

The findings suggest a dry origin for these features, potentially altering the search for habitable environments on the Red Planet. The study reviewed these features but found no evidence of water and our model favors dry formation processes.</p>

The allies called the campaign "disproportionate" and the restrictions on humanitarian aid "egregious." Britain further suspended free-trade talks with Israel and announced sanctions on extremist settlers. Prime Minister Netanyahu denounced the criticism, claiming it encourages further attacks. The moves highlight increasing international discontent with Israel's actions and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Viral social media posts claiming that China is delivering aid to Gaza via fighter jets and airdrops are false. A video purportedly showing Chinese fighter jets flying over the pyramids on their way to Gaza is actually footage from a joint military exercise between China and Egypt. Another video of aid being airdropped is from March 2024 and involves other countries, not China. These claims circulate amid limited aid deliveries to Gaza, with Israel having stopped humanitarian aid deliveries earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl, Kyra Hill, was unlawfully killed at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire due to gross breaches in health and safety. The coroner's inquest revealed the absence of an emergency plan or risk assessment, falsely reassuring signs about shallow water despite depths reaching over 15 feet, and poor visibility. The lack of awareness among parents and carers about the risks and water depth likely contributed to Kyra's death. The owner of the park was previously fined Â£80,000.</p>

Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program provide coverage to nearly 80 million Americans.</p>

          <p>As a pediatrician, I spend a lot of time engaging with families about nutrition. My philosophy is simple: If you empower a child to embrace healthy eating habits early on, they are more likely to carry these positive behaviors into adulthood. Early intervention can be transformative and help substantially reduce their long-term risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Many parents already know the importance of feeding kids vegetables and limiting added sugar. We often discuss "eating the rainbow," emphasizing the need for a diverse range of colorful fruits and vegetables. Parents frequently prioritize dark leafy greens, antioxidant-rich blueberries and healthy-fat-packed avocados. However, there's one nutritional powerhouse that often gets overlooked: beans. Here's why I wish more parents fed this underrated superfood to their kids.</p>
