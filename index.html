          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk recently expressed regret over some of his social media posts criticizing President Donald Trump.  The posts, made during a public disagreement, went "too far," according to Musk. This follows Trump's declaration that their relationship was over and his unwillingness to reconcile. The context is a significant falling out between two prominent figures.</p>
