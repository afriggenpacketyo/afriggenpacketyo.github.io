        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Vox article delves into the complexities of animal instincts, challenging the notion that they are simply inborn, unlearned behaviors. Featuring an interview with neuroscientist Mark Blumberg, the article explores how behaviors typical to a species are shaped by a combination of genetic predispositions, environmental experiences, and explicit learning. Blumberg argues against the term 'instinct,' advocating instead for 'species-typical' behavior. The article uses the example of a tailorbird sewing leaves together to illustrate how behaviors are not solely rooted in the mind but are influenced by the system in which the animal operates.</p>

With major cuts to the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion off the table, the remaining option involves limiting how states use a tax loophole to increase federal spending on Medicaid. This would largely reduce Medicaid spending in poorer, Southern states. The final package will likely include smaller Medicaid changes, but a major cut is needed to achieve Republicans’ budget goals.</p>
