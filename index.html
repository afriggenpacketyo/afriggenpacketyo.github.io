        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has raised the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000, a significant change from the $10,000 limit set in 2017. This deduction, which primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states, allows for the deduction of state and local income and property taxes from federal taxable income. While proponents argue it prevents double taxation and supports funding for public services, critics point to its high cost, with estimates suggesting it will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade. The move reverses a key provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is considering an executive order to rename the Department of Defense back to its pre-1947 name, the Department of War, reflecting a desire for a "stronger sound." This change, which would require congressional approval for official status, is supported by officials who favor a more assertive "warrior ethos." The original renaming to the Department of Defense in 1947 under President Truman was a deliberate choice to emphasize deterrence and a broader view of national security in the nuclear age. Critics of the proposed change fear it signals a more bellicose foreign policy, while some supporters argue it simply acknowledges the reality of the Pentagon's role over the past 80 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added a mere 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of the 80,000 forecast and indicating a significant cooling of the labor market amid economic uncertainty. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%, and previous months' figures were revised, showing a net loss of 13,000 jobs in June, the first monthly decline since late 2020. This slowdown is attributed to business hesitancy over tariffs and weaker demand, complicating the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. The weak report increases pressure on the Fed to cut rates to stimulate hiring and prevent a potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California officials have identified Sean Patrick McNulty, a Navy diver who died in 1997, as the perpetrator in at least five home invasion and sexual assault cases from the 1980s and 1990s. The breakthrough came after investigators used DNA from decades-old forensic kits to find matches in California, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana through the national CODIS database. Investigative genealogy pointed to McNulty, and a biological sample from a 1997 case where he was a suspect confirmed his identity across all incidents. Authorities are continuing to investigate if McNulty was involved in other unsolved crimes and have been working to notify his victims, providing long-awaited closure.</p>

          <p>The humanitarian situation in Gaza City is deteriorating rapidly as Israel's military assault intensifies, with residents facing widespread destruction, displacement, and a declared famine. According to the UN, over 80% of the Gaza Strip is now inaccessible to Palestinians, and the Israeli military reports controlling 40% of Gaza City itself. Aid workers on the ground describe an almost impossible situation for providing relief, with thousands of displaced families living in the streets without shelter. Residents are trapped between constant bombardment and the inability to evacuate safely, leading to a profound sense of hopelessness and exhaustion after nearly two years of war.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) must consider new strategies to maximize their earnings. Simply allowing a CD to roll over could lock in a significantly lower rate than previously enjoyed. This article outlines three viable options: moving funds to a high-yield savings account for flexibility, opting for a money market account which combines high rates with checking features, or reinvesting in a new long-term CD to secure a fixed rate against future market changes. Each choice presents a trade-off between rate security and access to funds in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected a Western proposal to deploy a "reassurance force" in Ukraine after any potential ceasefire, stating that any foreign troops would be considered legitimate targets. The plan, discussed at a Paris summit, involves 26 allied nations committing to deploy forces to prevent future aggression, not to engage in combat. Putin's firm stance dampens hopes for a peace deal, as he also expressed skepticism about reaching key agreements with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The warning comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts and a tense geopolitical climate, with the US and its allies working to provide security guarantees for Kyiv.</p>

The dismissal is technical, as Judge Aileen Cannon noted that several counts improperly incorporated all preceding allegations, making the complaint structurally flawed. Newsmax has been granted until the following Thursday to file an amended complaint that corrects these procedural issues. The original lawsuit accused Fox News of monopolistic practices and using intimidation tactics to suppress competition in the conservative media landscape, seeking damages and an injunction against such conduct.</p>

          <p>The ongoing attention to the Jeffrey Epstein case presents several potential political scenarios for Donald Trump, ranging from rising pressure to a fading controversy. The recent public appearance of Epstein's victims has added a powerful human element to the story, making it harder for the administration to dismiss as a "hoax." A key factor will be whether congressional efforts succeed in forcing the release of all government files on the case, which could contain damaging information. Alternatively, without new, significant revelations, the story could become a persistent but manageable distraction, or eventually fade from public attention as other events take precedence.</p>

          <p>A congressional report released by House Republicans alleges that the Pentagon has funded hundreds of research projects in collaboration with Chinese universities and institutes connected to China's defense industry. The investigation found that many of these Chinese partners were on U.S. government blacklists for their ties to the People's Liberation Army. The report argues that these partnerships have allowed China to leverage American research for its own military advancement, eroding U.S. technological dominance and posing a risk to national security. The findings raise serious questions about the oversight of taxpayer-funded research and its potential exploitation by strategic competitors.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for breaching EU competition laws by favoring its own products in the online advertising technology sector. Regulators found that Google engaged in "self-preferencing," intentionally boosting its own ad exchange, AdX, to the detriment of rival services, which resulted in higher costs and reduced revenues for competitors and publishers. This is the third time the EU has found Google to have broken antitrust rules, and the regulator has ordered the company to end its anti-competitive practices. Google has stated that the decision is "wrong" and plans to appeal the substantial penalty.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conducted a significant cabinet reshuffle following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a tax error. David Lammy has been appointed as the new deputy prime minister and justice minister, while Yvette Cooper moves to become foreign minister.

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned from her roles as UK deputy prime minister and housing secretary after an inquiry found she breached the ministerial code by underpaying taxes on a property sale. The prime minister's ethics adviser concluded that while she acted with integrity, she failed to seek sufficient expert tax advice regarding her complex family arrangements, resulting in an underpayment of £40,000 in stamp duty. In her resignation letter, Rayner took full responsibility for the error, stating it was never her intention to pay the incorrect amount. Her departure has triggered a major cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>A political commentary in The Atlantic suggests that Democrats are overusing the argument that President Trump's controversial actions are merely distractions from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The author contends that by framing everything from National Guard deployments to threats against political opponents as a ploy to divert attention from Epstein, Democrats inadvertently downplay the seriousness of these actions themselves. This strategy, while rooted in a legitimate Trump vulnerability, may be an ineffective communication tactic that fails to motivate voters and obscures more pressing threats to democratic norms. The article critiques this approach as a sign of the opposition's own messaging failures.</p>

He pleaded not guilty, arguing his actions were a response to years of being "demonized" for his views on gender identity and that he was trying to expose what he described as the activist's bullying behavior.

          <p>As Nigel Farage's Reform UK party gains political momentum, its economic plans are facing increased scrutiny. The party's platform includes significant tax cuts, such as raising the income tax threshold to £20,000, and increased spending on services like the NHS and defense, totaling an estimated £141 billion annually. To fund this, Reform UK claims it can save £30 billion a year by scrapping net-zero climate policies and another £50 billion by cutting government waste, figures that independent analysts like the Institute for Fiscal Studies have called into question. Critics argue that without credible savings, the party's plans would necessitate a substantial increase in government borrowing.</p>

          <p>The winner of the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot will face a significant tax bill, substantially reducing the final take-home amount. If the winner chooses the $826.4 million lump-sum cash option, there is a mandatory 24% federal withholding, immediately cutting the prize by nearly $200 million. However, the total federal tax rate for such a high income is 37%, meaning millions more will be owed to the IRS at tax time. State taxes can further reduce the winnings, with rates varying from over 10% in some states to zero in others, making the winner's location a key factor. (not investment advice)</p>

The odds of winning the grand prize are 1 in 292.2 million, and the current run of 42 consecutive drawings without a winner is a new record. After federal taxes, a winner's take-home amount varies significantly by state due to differing state income tax laws on lottery prizes. For example, winners in states like California and Florida, which do not tax lottery winnings, would receive a much larger payout than a winner in New York, which has the highest tax rate.</p>
