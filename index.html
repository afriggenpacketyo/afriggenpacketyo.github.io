          <p>Two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez, have been charged with accepting bribes to allow undocumented immigrants to enter the country through the San Ysidro Port of Entry.

Investigators uncovered phone messages between the officers and human smugglers, along with unexplained cash deposits in their bank accounts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to President Trump's implementation of 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts, automakers are adopting various strategies, including production halts, shipment pauses, and adjusted pricing. Stellantis announced temporary layoffs at Midwest factories due to production adjustments in Mexico and Canada, while Jaguar Land Rover paused U.S. shipments. Some companies, like Hyundai and Toyota, are temporarily freezing prices, while others, like Ferrari, are increasing prices on certain models. Market analysts predict potential price increases of 10-15% for affected cars, leading to uncertainty for both automakers and consumers.</p>

          <p>Men are more likely to die prematurely than women due to factors like smoking, alcohol use, and lack of engagement with health services. In the UK, men have a lower life expectancy and are more likely to die before 75 from preventable diseases. Machismo, deprivation, and inaccessible healthcare contribute to these disparities. Experts advocate for targeted interventions, including paid time off for health checks and tailored mental health services, to address the specific needs of men and improve their overall health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind the official portrait of Donald Trump that was publicly criticized by the president, says her business is now "in danger of not recovering." After the president called the portrait "truly the worst," officials removed it from Colorado's State Capitol. Boardman states that Trump's comments have negatively impacted her 41-year-old business, despite overwhelmingly positive feedback in the past. She maintains that the portrait was completed accurately and without political bias.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has admitted that its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23. The IDF now claims at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, though they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. The army initially stated the convoy approached "suspiciously" without lights, but video footage shows the vehicles were clearly marked and had lights on. The IDF has promised a thorough examination of the incident.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has unveiled a new approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The method combines generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning, aiming for better and faster results. The GRM models outperformed existing methods in tests. The announcement comes amidst speculation about DeepSeek's next move following its V3 foundation model and R1 reasoning model.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student activist facing deportation, accused the university of suppressing student dissent over Israel's war in Gaza. Khalil, a green-card holder, claims Columbia laid “the groundwork for my abduction” by creating an environment that conflates anti-Israel sentiment with antisemitism. He urged students to continue protesting and reclaim the university. The Trump administration is seeking to deport him under a provision that permits the state department to deport non-citizens considered a threat to US foreign policy.</p>
