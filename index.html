          <p>The European Union and China are marking the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic ties with a summit in Beijing attended by top EU leaders. The meeting occurs against a backdrop of significant friction, with the EU raising concerns over unfair market access, industrial subsidies, and China's stance on Russia's war in Ukraine. Despite these disagreements, Chinese state media has emphasized that China is a "critical partner" and not a rival. The talks are seen by both sides as a crucial opportunity to engage in frank discussions during a period of heightened global instability.</p>

          <p>A Scripps oceanography student discovered a rare violet sea snail, or Janthina, on a La Jolla beach, marking the first local sighting in a decade. These pelagic snails, known for their vibrant purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, typically inhabit warmer subtropical waters. Researchers note that their appearance often coincides with warmer ocean currents, leading to speculation about a potential connection to climate change and rising sea temperatures. Scientists are urging the public to report any further sightings of these unique creatures.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a major settlement with the federal government, paying $200 million to resolve investigations into on-campus antisemitism and an additional $21 million to the EEOC. This agreement follows a period of intense federal scrutiny and the freezing of $400 million in research grants by the Trump administration. As part of the deal, the vast majority of this federal funding will be restored. The university, which does not admit wrongdoing, has also codified a series of reforms demanded by the administration, including changes to its disciplinary processes and protest policies.</p>

          <p>New regulations under the UK's Online Safety Act now require websites with pornographic content to implement robust age verification for users.

However, officials did not explicitly deny the presence of his name, and the reports have intensified pressure on the administration to release more information. This development comes as a federal judge in Florida denied a DOJ request to unseal grand jury records from an earlier Epstein investigation, citing secrecy rules.</p>

          <p>A subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee has voted with bipartisan support to subpoena the Department of Justice for its complete investigation files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The motion, which passed 8-2 with three Republicans joining Democrats, seeks to compel the release of all related materials to increase transparency. This move escalates pressure on the Trump administration and the DOJ to provide more information about the high-profile case and its handling.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a notable increase in inventory, with 34% more sellers than buyers in May, the highest rate recorded since 2013. Despite this potential advantage for homebuyers, the market remains competitive as the median home sale price reached a new record high in June. Experts suggest this dynamic is partly due to current homeowners being locked into low interest rates, creating a complex environment where more choices are available but affordability remains a major challenge.

          <p>The Trump administration has released its "AI Action Plan," a comprehensive strategy focused on establishing U.S. global dominance in artificial intelligence by stripping away regulations. The plan aims to accelerate the construction of data centers, promote the export of American AI, and remove what the White House calls "ideological bias" from AI models. While praised by many in the tech industry, critics argue the plan recklessly prioritizes corporate interests and speed over public safety and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>California's Catastrophe Response Council has issued a stark warning that insurance claims from the recent Eaton wildfire in Los Angeles could completely exhaust the state's $21 billion wildfire fund. This fund was created to prevent utility companies from bankruptcy if their equipment is found to have caused a fire, and Southern California Edison is currently under investigation for the Eaton blaze. With insured loss estimates for recent fires potentially reaching as high as $45 billion, the fund faces a severe threat to its solvency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched its twin TRACERS satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to study the complex interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This mission aims to improve the understanding and prediction of "space weather," phenomena that can disrupt GPS, communications, power grids, and endanger astronauts. By flying in tandem, the two spacecraft will provide unprecedented, high-resolution data on how energy from the sun is transferred into Earth's atmosphere.</p>
