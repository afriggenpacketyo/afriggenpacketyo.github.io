          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 14:28:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve initiating an interest rate cut, the monthly payments on a $100,000 home equity loan have become marginally more affordable compared to earlier in the year. For example, a 15-year loan now costs around $973 per month, a slight decrease from previous rates. The article notes that while the savings are not drastic, further rate cuts are anticipated, which could make borrowing even cheaper in the future. Homeowners are also advised to consider Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which have variable rates that could drop further with future Fed actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration stop-work order, permitting the Danish company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind farm project off the coast of New England. The project, which is 80% complete and set to power over 350,000 homes, was halted by the Interior Department in August. Orsted stated it will restart work as soon as possible, marking a significant development in the conflict between the administration's anti-offshore wind stance and the renewable energy industry. The judge's decision allows the nearly finished project to proceed toward completion.</p>

          <p>Bruce Pearl, the head coach of Auburn University's men's basketball team, is reportedly planning to retire before the 2025-26 season, with his son Steven Pearl expected to succeed him. This news fuels speculation that Pearl may be considering a political career, potentially running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Tommy Tuberville. Pearl has been an outspoken supporter of Israel and has previously commented on whether he could make a greater impact in politics versus coaching. He led the Tigers to two Final Four appearances during his successful tenure.</p>

          <p>The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, has been removed as a patron or ambassador by six different charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation. The decision follows the publication of a 2011 email in which she referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend," seemingly contradicting her earlier public statements denouncing him. A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent under duress to prevent a defamation lawsuit from Epstein. This development further highlights the ongoing fallout from associations with Epstein for public figures.</p>

          <p>Better Home & Finance Holding Co. saw its stock price more than double after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, known for his influence on Opendoor's stock, recommended it. Jackson's firm, EMJ Capital, has taken a position in the mortgage lender, which he dubbed "the Shopify of mortgages." He argued that the company, which leverages artificial intelligence, is undervalued compared to competitors like Figure Technology Solutions.

The highest probability for isolated storms is on Tuesday and Wednesday, mainly north and east of L.A. County.

Silva stated that players cannot be in perfect condition for such a crucial game with significantly less rest than their opponents.

The controversy began after Kimmel criticized the conservative response to the assassination of activist Charlie Kirk, leading to threats of FCC action.

The article contends that Trump is inverting the American model of free speech by weaponizing state power to silence critics and reward allies, rather than allowing open debate under neutral rules. The piece warns that this strategy, combined with the spread of misinformation, erodes the distinction between truth and lies.

          <p>To maintain a $100,000-a-year lifestyle in retirement, financial experts suggest a savings goal of approximately $1.1 million to $1.75 million, depending on Social Security benefits. This calculation is based on the general rule of needing 70-80% of pre-retirement income. Key factors influencing the required amount include retirement age, life expectancy, and inflation, which can double the cost of living over 25 years. Experts recommend using the "4% rule" as a starting guideline for withdrawals but stress the importance of a diversified portfolio and a flexible plan tailored with a financial advisor.

          <p>Anheuser-Busch has announced that Michelob Ultra is now the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Modelo Especial. Citing retail data, the light lager has claimed the top spot in both retail channels and in bars and restaurants. This marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost its long-held number-one position two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline in popularity coincides with challenges for its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and weaker demand among some consumer segments, which led to a recent cut in its fiscal year forecast.</p>

          <p>A violent clash between rival gangs at a prison in Machala, Ecuador, has resulted in the deaths of 13 inmates and one guard. The riot involved gunfire and explosives, and an unknown number of prisoners managed to escape, though 13 have since been recaptured. The incident is the latest in a series of deadly conflicts within Ecuador's overcrowded and gang-controlled prison system. The violence erupted between members of the Los Choneros and Los Lobos gangs, which the U.S. recently designated as foreign terrorist organizations. Authorities have since regained control of the facility.</p>

The protests occurred as France formally recognized a Palestinian state, a move Italy has not yet made. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the violence in Milan, stating it had nothing to do with solidarity and would not help people in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The health and beauty chain Bodycare will shut down all of its 56 remaining stores by the end of the week, leading to the loss of 444 jobs. The company's administrators announced that after failing to find a buyer, continuing to trade was no longer viable due to stock shortages and high operating costs. This follows the company's collapse into administration earlier in September, which has already resulted in over 1,000 job losses. Analysts attribute Bodycare's downfall to intense competition from rivals like Boots and Superdrug, as well as a failure to adapt to the evolving retail market.</p>

Anti-hunger advocates and policy experts strongly criticized the decision, stating that it will leave policymakers "flying blind" without critical data on how many American families struggle to get enough food. The cancellation comes after the administration expanded work requirements for food aid, which is projected to increase food insecurity for millions.</p>

          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran argued that the central bank should aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate by nearly two percentage points. Miran contended that current monetary policy is overly restrictive and risks harming employment, citing disinflationary pressures from tax, immigration, and deregulation policies. His view places him in dissent with the Federal Open Market Committee's more cautious approach, as he was the sole member to vote for a half-point cut at the last meeting. He believes the federal funds rate should be in the low-2% range, not its current 4%-4.25% target.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging to a record high above $3,700 per ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Gold tends to perform well during periods of low interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, and central bank purchases have further supported demand. For most investors, financial experts recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than buying physical bullion, due to lower costs and higher liquidity. Financial advisors generally suggest limiting gold to a small portion, typically under 3%, of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
