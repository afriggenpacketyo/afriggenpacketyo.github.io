          <p>In its first 100 days, the Trump administration faced a barrage of over 220 lawsuits challenging various policies, from immigration to military guidelines. Judges have blocked key parts of Trump's agenda, including attempts to remove birthright citizenship and ban transgender people from military service. Lawyers have alleged that the administration violated court orders multiple times, leading to rebukes from federal judges for acting in "bad faith." While supporters decry the litigation as a "judicial coup," others see it as a check on executive power, raising concerns about potential damage to the separation of powers. Optimism score: 45</p>

The company saw strong organic revenue growth in its aerospace technologies and building automation segments.

Jim Cramer advises caution, suggesting potential conference call concerns about the second half of the year and advising against chasing the stock after the initial surge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large fire that originated at an electricity substation and spread to a block of flats in Maida Vale, north-west London, was brought under control by the London Fire Brigade. Approximately 80 residents were safely evacuated, and no injuries were reported. The fire, which sent large clouds of grey smoke into the air, was deemed technically complex to extinguish.

          <p>Marks & Spencer stores experienced empty food shelves due to a cyber attack affecting their operations, leading to the pause of online orders since Friday. The disruption, which also impacted a small proportion of products supplied to Ocado, occurred because the firm had to take some of its food-related systems offline. While contactless pay and Click & Collect issues have been resolved, online orders remain unavailable.

The Liberals may fall short of a majority government, potentially forming a minority government where they strike deals with other parties to pass legislation.

          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank will reintroduce cryptocurrency investing this year due to a "fundamental shift" in the regulatory landscape under the Trump administration. SoFi had to discontinue crypto investing in late 2023 as a condition of receiving a bank charter. The company plans to make a comprehensive push into cryptocurrency, including providing crypto or blockchain capabilities in each product area. This announcement signals a broader trend of banks looking to expand into crypto in the Trump era. (not investment advice)</p>
