        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new malware variant named Shamos, derived from the Atomic macOS Stealer, is targeting Mac users globally. The campaign uses a 'ClickFix' tactic, luring individuals seeking technical support to fake websites that provide malicious one-line commands for the Terminal application. Executing the command bypasses macOS security features, installing the malware to steal sensitive data such as passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and Keychain items. Security experts advise users to avoid running unfamiliar commands, be cautious of sponsored search results, and use robust antivirus software to protect against this evolving threat.</p>

          <p>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of the cryptocurrency company Gemini, have forecasted that Bitcoin's value could surge to $1 million per coin within the next ten years. They argue that the current market is still in its early stages, comparing Bitcoin to an upgraded version of gold, or "gold 2.0," with significant potential for growth. This optimistic projection was shared ahead of Gemini's successful initial public offering, which saw its shares priced above the expected range, valuing the company at $3.3 billion. The twins believe there is easily a tenfold increase possible from its current standing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has successfully avoided a substantial European Union antitrust fine by agreeing to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its Office and Microsoft 365 software suites. The European Commission accepted the company's binding commitments, which will last for seven years or more, following an investigation prompted by a complaint from rival Slack. As part of the deal, Microsoft will offer versions of its software without Teams at a reduced price and improve interoperability with competing products. This resolution addresses concerns that Microsoft was unfairly leveraging its market dominance to stifle competition.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he is redirecting the planned deployment of the National Guard from Chicago to Memphis, Tennessee. The decision follows mixed signals from the White House and vocal opposition from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who stated the troops were not wanted or needed in Chicago. Trump cited a conversation with a railroad executive who described Memphis as unsafe, prompting the change in plans. While the deployment to Memphis reportedly has the support of Tennessee's governor, the city's mayor has emphasized the need for financial resources for prevention and intervention rather than troops.</p>

          <p>Following a July incident where an Air Peace Boeing 737 veered off the runway upon landing in Nigeria, the pilot and co-pilot both tested positive for recent alcohol consumption. The Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) also found that a cabin crew member tested positive for cannabis. While all 103 people on board were unharmed, the 64-year-old pilot has been dismissed by the airline for violating safety regulations. Air Peace stated that the co-pilot was later acquitted by the national regulator and has returned to duty, as investigations by the NSIB continue.</p>

          <p>Luxury furniture company RH saw its shares decline after reporting a significant revenue miss and cutting its full-year forecast, citing a larger-than-expected impact from tariffs. The company now anticipates an additional $30 million hit from import duties, causing it to lower its revenue growth outlook from 10-13% to 9-11%. CEO Gary Friedman noted that uncertainty is compounded by President Trump's threat of new tariffs on imported furniture, a move intended to bolster domestic manufacturing. The company has been actively shifting its operations out of China to mitigate these ongoing trade-related financial pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Another increasingly popular method is a home equity sharing agreement, where a company provides an upfront cash payment in exchange for a percentage of the home's future appreciation.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is launching a new pilot program to accelerate the safe integration of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, commonly known as air taxis. Leading eVTOL companies Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are participating in the initiative, which will establish public-private partnerships to facilitate supervised trials. The program follows a June executive order from President Trump aimed at fostering innovation in this emerging aviation sector. Both companies praised the move as a critical step toward establishing commercial air taxi services in the United States.</p>

          <h2>New Fiction and Graphic Novels Explore the Overwhelming Experience of Panic Attacks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 11:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent literary works are delving into the visceral and existential nature of panic attacks, offering readers a raw depiction of what anxiety feels like. Michael Clune’s novel 'Pan' follows a teenager in the 1990s as he grapples with debilitating panic episodes by researching the Greek god from whom the term originates. Similarly, Lee Lai’s graphic novel 'Cannon' uses the metaphor of a menacing flock of magpies to visualize the protagonist's mounting anxiety. Both books move beyond clinical descriptions to explore the subjective, often terrifying, experience of panic and the journey toward learning to live with it.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is increasing its investment in Boeing, purchasing 80 additional shares as the stock price has fallen. This move is part of a strategy to build a new position by buying shares at progressively lower prices to reduce the overall average cost basis. The recent stock drop was triggered by CEO Kelly Ortberg's comments about delays in the 777X aircraft certification. However, the investment club views this as a short-term issue that does not alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory, presenting a buying opportunity for the aerospace giant.

          <p>The family of two teenage brothers, Chu Ming Zheng and Jack Jiang, who drowned in a Bayonne, New Jersey school pool in 2022, has rejected a $14 million settlement offer from the city's Board of Education. The family's lawsuit alleges gross negligence, stating the boys drowned after falling into a sudden 13-foot drop-off in the pool. Their attorney claims surveillance footage shows a lifeguard walking away without urgency after seeing the teens in distress and accuses the district of failing to properly train staff or post adequate warnings. The family asserts the offer is not fair compensation for the preventable tragedy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has reverted to using the term "monkeypox," two years after the World Health Organization (WHO) officially renamed the disease "mpox" to combat racist and stigmatizing language. Public health experts are baffled by the change, noting that the original name was scientifically inaccurate and had been co-opted for racist and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that "monkeypox is the name of the viral disease," without explaining the reversal. Critics suggest the move may be a political provocation and could create confusion after the successful global transition to the term mpox.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is walking a political tightrope in her interactions with President Trump, who has asserted significant federal control over the city. After Trump declared a "public safety emergency" and deployed thousands of federal agents and National Guard troops to D.C., Bowser has adopted a strategy of cautious cooperation mixed with quiet pushback. This approach marks a shift from her more confrontational stance during Trump's first term but reflects her limited legal power, as Congress ultimately governs the district. Her conciliatory tone has drawn praise from the administration but criticism from some local officials who desire greater resistance.</p>

          <p>Apple's once-dominant position in the Chinese market is showing signs of weakening as a growing number of consumers lose enthusiasm for the brand. Many former loyal customers now feel that new iPhone models offer minimal innovation, making them seem "dull" compared to previous releases. This sentiment has contributed to several years of sluggish sales for the tech giant in China. The shift in consumer perception reflects a broader challenge for Apple and other multinational corporations as they navigate the evolving tastes and competitive landscape of the crucial Chinese market, where local brands are increasingly gaining ground.</p>

Some clothing brands catering to big and tall men are seeing a shift in demand from 5-6XL sizes to 3-4XL.
