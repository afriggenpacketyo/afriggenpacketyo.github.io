          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has stated that Columbia University failed to meet accreditation standards due to alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws regarding the harassment of Jewish students on campus. The department's Office for Civil Rights notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Columbia's accrediting institution, about the alleged noncompliance. Education Secretary Linda McMahon asserted that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students following Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The accreditor is now required to notify Columbia and establish a plan for the university to come into compliance, potentially affecting its eligibility for federal student aid.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has criticized the U.S. proposal for a new nuclear agreement, asserting that it will not halt uranium enrichment. Iranian negotiators are preparing to respond to the plan presented at recent talks, which reportedly involves Iran ceasing uranium enrichment in exchange for relying on a regional consortium for supplies. Khamenei stated this proposal goes against the Islamic Republic's principles, while former President Trump warned of potential U.S. and Israeli military action if negotiations fail. Iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful, but it has breached restrictions of the 2015 deal in response to sanctions, stockpiling uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups argued before the California Supreme Court that the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) violated state law by reducing financial incentives for residential rooftop solar panels in 2022. The groups contend that the CPUC failed to consider all benefits of solar panels and ensure expansion in disadvantaged communities. Lawyers from the Attorney General's office sided with utilities, arguing the credits given to panel owners resulted in a "cost shift" to non-solar customers, raising electric bills. The justices focused on whether a state appeals court erred in deferring to the CPUC's expertise; a decision is expected within 90 days.</p>

The call occurred amidst floundering U.S.-brokered peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressing Trump for increased sanctions on Moscow. Trump has threatened both countries with consequences if his peace efforts fail, while also facing pressure at home to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.</p>

The SBU released footage showing drones targeting Russian strategic bombers, transport aircraft, and AWACS, while satellite imagery showed the wreckage of planes at various airbases.

Musk claims the bill will lead to "debt slavery" for America, advocating for a new spending bill that avoids massively increasing the deficit. This opposition comes shortly after Musk's departure from the Trump administration, where he headed the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk's stance is partly motivated by the bill's cuts to an electric vehicle tax credit, which benefits Tesla, his electric vehicle company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The EU has called on China to cease restricting the export of rare earth minerals and magnets, citing an "alarming situation" for European industries. The request was made during a meeting between top commerce officials from both sides, as sectors across Europe express concern about a shortage of rare earths used in high-tech manufacturing. China, which supplies around 90% of the world's rare earth minerals, introduced export controls in April in response to U.S. tariffs. These restrictions have affected firms globally, prompting calls for a resolution as mineral stocks dwindle and production slows.</p>

The initiative, led by the Cook County regional organized crime taskforce, involved over 100 law enforcement agencies and 30 major retailers, including Target, Macyâ€™s, and Walgreens. Retailers played a crucial role by providing information on criminal activity. Authorities say organized retail crime, involving coordinated theft for profit, has become more sophisticated and widespread. The Cook County stateâ€™s attorney has prioritized combating retail theft, pursuing felony charges for stolen goods exceeding $300 or for repeat offenders.</p>

          <p>Civilians in Darfur are enduring the brunt of Sudan's two-year civil war between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). A UN aid convoy en route to El Fasher was attacked, resulting in the deaths of five UN staff and the destruction of supplies intended for desperate families. The conflict has caused tens of thousands of deaths, displaced millions, and created a severe humanitarian crisis. Both the RSF and the Sudanese army have been accused of war crimes, with the RSF allegedly committing genocide against Black African ethnic groups.</p>
