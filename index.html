          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University. The court found the action was likely illegal retaliation for the university's refusal to alter its policies on diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as other First Amendment-protected activities. The ruling vacates the freeze, which had halted numerous critical research projects, including studies on tuberculosis and veterans' mental health, that the judge noted were unrelated to the administration's stated concerns about antisemitism.</p>

While the company's revenue of $249.6 million slightly surpassed expectations and grew 41% year-over-year, its third-quarter revenue forecast, though above consensus, implies a slowdown in growth. Figma is also navigating the integration of AI into its products and has yet to fully monetize these features, adding a layer of uncertainty for investors. The company's net retention rate, a key metric for customer expansion, also saw a slight decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

Eyewitnesses described the carriage as being "out of control" before it overturned and was almost completely destroyed.

They argue that transparency is essential for public understanding and their own healing, expressing frustration over years of delayed justice and legal setbacks.

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Tom Brady offered a critical assessment of the current state of the league, suggesting that today's players are "coddled a little bit more" than in previous eras. In an interview with Kevin Hart, Brady contrasted the modern approach with past expectations, where players were told to "get the work done." He believes that while there are more distractions, players with a strong work ethic have greater opportunities to succeed, highlighting Patrick Mahomes as a quarterback with the will to win and the potential to "duplicate history."</p>

          <p>U.S. and Mexican officials have committed to strengthening their partnership on security issues like drug smuggling and illegal migration. The agreement comes as Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged "narcoterrorists" on a boat from Venezuela, stating such actions may continue. The meeting between Rubio and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum aimed to ease tensions, as Mexico remains concerned that the U.S. designation of cartels as terrorist groups could lead to unilateral American military action on its territory.</p>

          <p>With a government funding deadline less than four weeks away, partisan tensions are escalating in Congress, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are publicly blaming each other's parties for the impasse. A key point of contention is the Democratic demand to reverse Medicaid cuts included in President Trump's "One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act" in exchange for their votes on a short-term funding measure. The White House is unlikely to approve any deal that weakens this signature policy, creating a difficult path to a bipartisan agreement.</p>

          <p>The projected cost for expanding the Los Angeles Convention Center has surged again, now reaching $2.7 billion, which is a $483 million increase in just six months. City officials are growing concerned about the project's financial viability and whether it can be completed before the 2028 Olympics. A significant portion of the project's funding relies on revenue from proposed digital billboards, but there is uncertainty about whether state officials will approve them. Without this revenue, the city's general fund would face an average annual burden of $111 million, straining core public services.</p>

          <p>Legal experts have raised concerns that the recent U.S. military strike on a boat in the Caribbean, which killed 11 alleged drug traffickers, may have violated international law. Speaking to BBC Verify, specialists in maritime and human rights law argued that using lethal force in international waters under these circumstances could be considered an "extrajudicial arbitrary killing." While the Trump administration labeled the individuals "narco-terrorists," experts contend this does not automatically make them lawful military targets, as the U.S. is not in a formal armed conflict with Venezuela or the Tren de Aragua cartel.</p>

          <p>More than 1,000 current and former employees of the Department of Health and Human Services have signed an open letter demanding the resignation or firing of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The letter accuses Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, of "endangering the nation's health" through his leadership. It cites recent turmoil at the CDC, including the firing of its director, changes to vaccine approval processes, and the elevation of "political ideologues" to key scientific posts. An HHS spokesperson defended Kennedy, stating he is working to restore trust in a "broken" CDC.</p>

Stephen Ehikian will take over as the new CEO, replacing founder Thomas Siebel, who revealed an autoimmune disease diagnosis earlier this year. The leadership transition follows a difficult period for the company after what Siebel called "completely unacceptable" performance. (not investment advice)</p>

The Democratic National Committee intervened, arguing the move violated the National Voter Registration Act. The new consent order allows these voters to provide the required information via a provisional ballot at the polling place.</p>

          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window saw clubs spend a record £3 billion, widening the financial gap with other European leagues and raising concerns about competitive balance within the league itself. Experts note that Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) are creating a "glass ceiling," forcing aspirational clubs to sell homegrown talent to comply, often to the league's elite teams. This trend, combined with a record £1 billion spent on transfers between Premier League clubs, is leading to calls for rule changes to prevent a growing polarization between the wealthiest teams and the rest.

The Clippers have forcefully denied the claims, stating the team's relationship with Aspiration ended years ago due to default.
