          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted in 1996 for the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents, have been resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole. The decision, made by Judge Michael Jesic, followed testimony from family members who spoke of the brothers' rehabilitation and remorse. The brothers addressed the court, taking responsibility for their actions and apologizing to their family, expressing sorrow for their heinous crimes and the impact on their family. The Los Angeles County prosecutors argued against the resentencing, saying the brothers have not taken complete responsibility for the crime, but the judge believes they deserve a chance at parole after 35 years.</p>

          <p>Tory Lanez, the rapper serving a 10-year sentence for shooting Megan Thee Stallion, was hospitalized after allegedly being stabbed by another inmate at the California Correctional Institution. Lanez reportedly sustained multiple stab wounds, including injuries to his back, torso, and head, leading to collapsed lungs, but is now breathing on his own and is in good spirits. Details surrounding the attack remain scarce, with investigations underway by CDCR officials and the Kern County District Attorney's Office. Lanez is currently appealing his sentence and has been accused of harassing Megan Thee Stallion from prison, leading to an extension of the restraining order against him.</p>

          <p>General practitioners in England are deeply divided over the proposed Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which seeks to legalize assisted dying for terminally ill patients in England and Wales. A BBC survey revealed that approximately half of the responding GPs oppose the law, citing religious beliefs, concerns about patient coercion, and the belief that resources should be focused on improving end-of-life care, while the other half support it, emphasizing patient choice and the desire for a dignified death. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has expressed neutrality on the principle but concerns about unmet patient needs and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.</p>

          <p>Traditional British television is facing a significant challenge from US streaming giants like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon, leading to discussions about the future survival of British-originated and British-focused TV. With viewing habits shifting and funding becoming increasingly strained, industry insiders are considering options such as mergers or greater cooperation among BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5. A key concern is the potential dominance of US-based media companies with vastly different business models and the shift towards digital-only video on demand by 2035. Some propose a unified streaming service under BBC iPlayer to compete effectively, while others argue for maintaining distinctiveness among British broadcasters.</p>

          <p>Kansas City, Missouri, is implementing a new approach to address its growing homeless crisis, aiming for "functional zero," which means ensuring anyone who becomes homeless is back on their feet within 30 days. The initiative, led by homelessness prevention coordinator Josh Henges, focuses on coordinating resources from churches, aid organizations, and shelters to provide comprehensive support. The plan includes building trust with the homeless population, providing safe shelter, and addressing core issues like addiction and mental health. The goal is to create a coordinated system that effectively delivers people out of homelessness, rather than simply providing temporary solutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States would lift sanctions on Syria, providing an economic boost to the war-torn country and signaling a shift in American foreign policy in the Middle East. The decision was revealed during a business forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where Trump is on a state visit, and comes ahead of a planned meeting with Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Shara. The move is intended to support Syria's new government in stabilizing the country and fostering peace, with Trump noting the region's readiness to help Syria recover. The decision has been praised by Syrian officials and citizens, who hope it will lead to reconstruction and reintegration into the global economy.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, details concerns among Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s aides and top Democrats regarding his mental and physical decline during his presidency. The book recounts instances of Biden forgetting names, appearing frail, and relying on scripted meetings, reflecting a broader reluctance within the Democratic Party to publicly address his waning abilities. The authors describe a “cover-up” where Biden's inner circle spent more time sticking its collective head in the sand about the president’s diminishing abilities than it does scheming to hide evidence of his shortcomings. Despite the concerns, few Biden allies were willing to speak openly about his decline, even after he dropped out of the presidential race.</p>

          <p>GOP lawmakers are targeting online pornography with a proposed interstate ban on obscene content, aiming to clarify the definition of obscenity and make it easier to prosecute offenders. Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Mary Miller introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which seeks to update the legal definition of obscenity for the internet age, replacing subjective standards with practical ones. The bill defines obscenity as material that appeals to prurient interests in nudity, sex, or excretion, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, and removes the intent requirement, which only prohibits transmission of obscene material for the purpose of abusing, threatening or harassing an individual.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan has been indicted on federal charges for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She faces charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstructing a proceeding before a department or agency of the United States. The charges stem from an incident where Dugan allegedly interfered with ICE officers attempting to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was appearing in her court for a domestic abuse case. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has suspended Dugan, and she faces up to six years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>A rock climber survived a 400-foot fall in Washington’s North Cascades mountains that killed his three companions. The surviving climber, despite internal bleeding and head trauma, hiked to his car and drove to a payphone to call for help. The group was descending the Early Winters Spires when the anchor securing their ropes failed. The team used coordinates from a device the climbers had been carrying to locate the site of the fall. Responders found a piton that looked old and weathered, leading them to believe it was the cause of the accident.</p>

          <p>Federal judges across the United States are being targeted by "pizza doxxings," where unknown individuals order pizzas to their home addresses with the recipient listed as Daniel Anderl, the late son of Judge Esther Salas, who was killed in 2020. This tactic is seen as a form of psychological warfare and intimidation against judges. The U.S. Marshals Service is investigating the incidents, which appear designed to send a threatening message to judges.

The politician's cause of death is not known but he had been suffering from oesophageal cancer.

Judge Michael Jesic granted the resentencing, changing their life sentences without parole to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. The decision followed a hearing where relatives and others testified in support of shortening their sentences.

The documentary surfaces footage from performances in which Selena subverts the idea of the well-manicured image that the Quintanilla family has constantly put out of the singer in the 30 years since her death.
