          <p>An investigation uncovered that ticket touts, who resell tickets at inflated prices, received assistance from within ticketing companies like Ticketmaster-owned resale sites. Former staff members revealed close relationships with touts, offering financial incentives and developing software to facilitate bulk ticket sales. Court documents showed that some employees even bought tickets for touts and offered tip-offs about upcoming sales. Ticketmaster stated that the allegations refer to dissolved companies and outdated claims, asserting their commitment to fair ticketing practices. The investigation raises questions about the industry's practices before the closure of Ticketmaster's resale sites in 2018. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea has ceased its loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, signaling a move towards easing tensions. President Lee Jae-myung ordered the halt as part of efforts to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which resumed last year in response to North Korea's trash balloon campaign, included K-pop songs and messages critical of the North Korean leadership. This decision is seen as a proactive step to reduce military tensions and alleviate concerns for South Koreans residing near the border, though North Korea has yet to respond to Seoul's move.</p>

          <p>Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of Lord Leon Brittan, has criticized the decision to drop an investigation into a Met Police officer who led an inquiry into false sexual assault claims against her late husband. The claims were fabricated by Carl Beech, who was later jailed for perverting the course of justice and sexual assault. Lady Brittan expressed feeling betrayed by the lack of professionalism and highlighted the intrusive nature of the investigation, including a raid on her home shortly after her husband's death.

The Mace B cruise missiles deployed there could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union.

          <p>Satellite images released by a U.S. nuclear weapons expert show what is believed to be a new uranium enrichment facility under construction in Yongbyon, North Korea. The location aligns with recent reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The facility includes a large central hall where centrifuges could be installed, surrounded by support spaces. Comparisons with a 2002 image of the Kangson enrichment facility highlight similarities in layout and dimensions, indicating North Korea's continued efforts to expand its nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul has accused the White House of "immaturity" after he and his family were disinvited from the annual White House picnic.

Paul expressed disappointment and a loss of respect for Trump, while asserting that the move would not deter him from advocating for his beliefs.
