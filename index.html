          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a new multi-year media rights agreement to broadcast Friday night WNBA games on Ion, including the "WNBA on Ion" studio show, which is dedicated to WNBA coverage. While the deal's financial details remain undisclosed, reports estimate the original agreement at $13 million annually, expiring at the end of the 2025 season. This new agreement follows substantial viewership growth on Ion, with a 133% year-over-year increase, reaching over 23 million unique viewers, as the league gains popularity due to stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert emphasized the partnership's role in expanding the league's reach, and this deal complements the 11-year media rights agreement with Disney, Amazon, and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal. This expansion of media rights highlights the increasing interest and investment in women's sports. The new partnership solidifies ION's position as the premier Friday night destination for WNBA action for years to come, which is a testament to the flourishing partnership and the league's rising demand.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's effort to overturn a civil jury verdict holding him liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and then defaming her has been rejected by the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The court denied Trump's request for a rehearing of his challenge to the verdict, which ordered him to pay Carroll $5 million in damages, although two Trump-nominated judges dissented from the decision. Trump's legal team indicated they may appeal to the Supreme Court, while Carroll's attorney expressed satisfaction with the decision, affirming Trump's liability for sexual assault and defamation. This case is one of two defamation-related verdicts Carroll obtained against the former president, with another case related to comments Trump made in 2019 still under appeal. The appeals court also denied Trump's request to delay arguments in the other case.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers indicates a significant rebound in consumer sentiment in early June, with the headline index jumping to 60.5, surpassing expectations. This improvement reflects a less pessimistic outlook on the economy and inflation, coinciding with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs. Respondents also sharply reduced their near-term inflation outlook, and the one-year estimate slid to 5.1%, a 1.5 percentage point drop, while the five-year view edged lower to 4.1%. Despite these positive shifts, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels due to ongoing concerns about the impact of tariffs and geopolitical issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel is preparing for potential Iranian retaliation following its recent strikes, indicating that the attack "created a state of chaos in Iran." Netanyahu emphasized the need for Israelis not to be euphoric and to understand that an attack against Israel could occur, potentially in severe waves. He noted that the U.S. was informed in advance of the attack, and he targeted Iran's nuclear facilities due to the existential threat posed by Iran possessing nuclear weapons. Netanyahu also mentioned that he had directed his military to attack Iran after the death of a Hezbollah leader in September 2024, but the attack was postponed for various reasons.</p>

Speaking at a Center for American Progress event, Walz pointed to China's potential ability to negotiate agreements following escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. Walz's ties to China were previously scrutinized during the 2024 campaign, with reports highlighting his support for a medical research institute collaborating with a firm labeled a "Chinese military company."

          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, driven by optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs. This surge in shopper attitudes ended six consecutive months of declining sentiment, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping from 6.6% to 5.1%. The improvement was seen across various demographics, and the recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China, along with pauses on "Liberation Day" tariffs, contributed to this positive shift. However, concerns remain about potential price increases from tariffs, with retailers like Walmart and Best Buy voicing alarm, and the OECD expecting U.S. inflation to reach 4% by the end of 2025.

          <p>Two men have been jailed for the 2019 theft of a Â£4.8 million gold toilet from an art exhibition at Blenheim Palace. James Sheen pleaded guilty to burglary, transferring criminal property, and conspiracy, while Michael Jones was found guilty of burglary, and the judge described the heist as "bold and brazen." Sheen, identified as a key player and career criminal, sold 20kg of the gold for Â£520,000 within two weeks of the theft, and Jones, who worked for Sheen, conducted reconnaissance visits to Blenheim Palace prior to the burglary. The gold toilet, valued at Â£4.8m, was never recovered.</p>

Read's first trial ended in a mistrial, and she has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, leaving the scene of personal injury and death, and manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence. The lead investigator from the first trial was not called to testify in the retrial, and Read herself did not take the stand in her own defense.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's extensive attacks on Iran, President Trump has struggled to articulate a consistent message, facing a major foreign policy crisis and diplomatic dilemma. Trump's initial response on Truth Social was somber, followed by mixed messages to American media outlets, expressing support for Israel while also suggesting Iran had a "second chance." The attacks have highlighted a willingness from Israel to act against American preferences in the region, and analysts suggest that Trump's grab-bag of comments reflects a unique dynamic where traditional diplomatic norms do not apply. The situation has further complicated nuclear talks and raised concerns about regional stability.</p>

Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Experts urge consulting professional medical societies rather than the CDC for vaccine guidance, and the long-term risks include undermining confidence in vaccinations and potentially leading to a resurgence of eradicated diseases. Kennedy's actions have disrupted decades of public health consensus, and the best course of action is for patients and providers to make informed decisions in collaboration with their doctors.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) assert that most Americans are losing spending power and cannot afford a "minimal quality of life." According to LISEP's analysis, the bottom 60% of households by income fall short of the threshold for a minimal quality of life, due to wages failing to keep pace with rising costs. From 2001 to 2023, medical premiums, travel expenses, and rent significantly increased, while real spending power decreased by 4% on average. The "Minimal Quality of Life Index" considers essentials and costs for a fulfilling life with upward mobility.</p>

          <p>The pilot of the Air India flight that crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad reported a loss of thrust and power to air traffic control in his final communication. Sumeet Sabharwal, the pilot, issued a mayday call less than a minute into the flight, which ultimately crashed into a medical building, killing nearly all passengers. The sole survivor, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, described the scene as chaotic and recounted his escape from the wreckage, and the pilot was nearing retirement and had plans to care for his elderly father.</p>
