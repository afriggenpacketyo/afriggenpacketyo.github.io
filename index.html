          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan, near the Pakistan border, causing widespread destruction and claiming hundreds of lives, with more than a thousand injured. The quake, centered east of Jalalabad, destroyed several villages in the Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, prompting rescue efforts from nearby provinces. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan expressed deep sadness over the devastating event, which has led to significant loss of life and property damage. Support teams have been dispatched to the affected area to aid in rescue operations and provide assistance to those in need. This natural disaster underscores the vulnerability of the region to seismic activity and the challenges in providing immediate relief. The initial reports indicated a high casualty count, and officials expect the numbers to rise as search and rescue teams reach remote areas. </p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans, has withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify before the panel. A committee spokesperson stated that Mueller is facing health issues that prevent him from testifying. Chairman James Comer had subpoenaed Mueller as part of the committee's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, citing Mueller's tenure as FBI director during the time Epstein was under investigation. However, Mueller's family informed The New York Times that he has been battling Parkinson's disease, making it difficult for him to appear before Congress. This decision marks the end of a potential public hearing involving the former special counsel. </p>

          <p>Representative Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) has criticized supporters of Donald Trump, suggesting that their "Make America Great Again" hats prevent them from processing facts. Crockett shared a clip of Portugal's president stating that Trump "objectively" behaves like a Russian asset. She also referred to Trump supporters who troll her on social media as "mentally ill" and "grade A losers." This comes amid ongoing political tensions and debates surrounding Trump's influence and policies. Crockett's remarks reflect the deep divisions within American politics and the passionate rhetoric often employed by both sides. Her statements are a continuation of her outspoken criticism of the former president. </p>

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, believe that Dezi Freeman, a fugitive wanted in connection with the alleged murder of two officers, is being aided by members of the community. Freeman, who escaped into bushland after police arrived at his property to execute a search warrant related to a sex crimes investigation, has been on the run for a week. His wife has urged him to surrender, but police have had no sightings of him. Authorities warn that anyone harboring or assisting Freeman is committing a serious crime. The incident has raised questions about how Australian authorities handle the threat of conspiracy theorists. </p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper plans to announce stricter rules for migrants granted asylum who wish to bring their families to the UK, including tougher English language standards and financial requirements. Cooper aims to overhaul what she calls a "broken" asylum system to end the use of hotels for migrants. The National Crime Agency's efforts to combat people smugglers have reportedly increased, with a record number of disruptions to immigration crime networks. The government also plans to implement a returns deal with France, where some migrants arriving in the UK will be detained and returned. These measures aim to strengthen border security and control the asylum system. </p>

          <p>The article discusses India's strategic balancing act between China and the US, particularly in light of recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. India's decision to strengthen ties with China is seen as a pragmatic response to these tariffs, despite historical tensions and border disputes. The Modi-Xi meeting in Tianjin signifies a potential shift in geopolitical dynamics. However, India still faces challenges in addressing its trade deficit with China and navigating its relationships with other multilateral forums perceived as anti-China. The article examines the implications of India's policy of "strategic autonomy" in the context of its relations with both global powers. </p>
