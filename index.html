          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown could conclude within the week. He indicated that if a resolution isn't reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The current impasse stems from a partisan disagreement over federal funding, with Democrats insisting on including enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap bill. Hassett suggested that moderate Democrats might soon break the stalemate, allowing the government to reopen and paving the way for further policy negotiations.</p>

          <p>Executive coach and author Melody Wilding outlines five key strategies for effectively working with a "control freak" boss without becoming exhausted or frustrated. The advice includes presenting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with specific phrasing, and proactively oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques involve preempting criticism by seeking initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." method to incorporate feedback while still asserting one's own ideas. The article emphasizes conserving personal energy by adapting communication styles to the manager's tendencies.</p>

          <p>Former NFL star Doug Martin has died after being taken into police custody in Oakland following a report of a break-in. According to police, officers responded to a medical emergency believed to be related to the same individual, and a "brief struggle ensued" during detainment, after which Martin became unresponsive. He was transported to a hospital where he later died, and the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. Martin, a two-time Pro Bowler, was a standout player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and also played for the Oakland Raiders.</p>

          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs rose significantly after the company announced it is exploring the possibility of entering the rare earths mining business. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated that geological surveys have indicated the presence of these critical minerals at two of the company's sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This move aligns with the national strategy to establish domestic supply chains for essential materials and reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the global market. The potential venture could position Cleveland-Cliffs as a key player in securing American manufacturing independence for these vital resources. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) generally lose value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, a trend attributed to several key factors. Historically, heavy government and manufacturer incentives on new EVs have lowered their resale value, as used car buyers are less willing to pay a premium. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, makes older models less desirable relatively quickly. However, this trend may be shifting as a wider variety of more affordable, mainstream EV models enter the used market, potentially stabilizing depreciation rates in the future.</p>

          <p>This article explains the complexities and requirements for getting approved for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can liquidate most unsecured debts. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares an individual's income to their state's median. Those with income below the median typically qualify easily, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. The process also requires recent credit counseling and is scrutinized for any signs of abuse, such as luxury spending just before filing. For those who don't qualify, alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy or debt settlement are discussed.</p>

          <p>In his first year as Indonesia's president, Prabowo Subianto has taken a highly active role on the global stage, making numerous diplomatic visits and engaging in major international issues. He has offered Indonesian troops for a Gaza peacekeeping mission and supported a U.S.-led peace plan, while also condemning Israel's actions at the UN. Domestically, his administration successfully concluded a long-negotiated economic partnership with the European Union to boost trade and investment. However, some foreign policy analysts criticize his approach as overly personal and reactive, describing it as "FOMO diplomacy" that sometimes lacks coordination with government ministries.</p>

          <p>Jose Rodolfo Villareal-Hernandez, a notorious Mexican cartel leader known as "El Gato," is facing a new federal charge of continuing a criminal enterprise in connection with a 2013 murder-for-hire plot in Southlake, Texas. This charge is in addition to existing ones for interstate stalking and conspiracy to commit murder. Prosecutors allege Villareal-Hernandez orchestrated the murder of a rival cartel's lawyer as revenge for his father's death. After years on the FBI's most wanted list, he was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the U.S.; if convicted on the murder-for-hire charge, he could face the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The Louvre museum remained closed after a daring daytime heist on Sunday, during which thieves stole eight priceless treasures from the French crown jewels collection in the Apollon Gallery. Among the stolen items are the Pearl and Diamond Tiara commissioned by Napoleon III, a sapphire set worn by Queen Marie-Amélie, and an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to his second wife. In their escape, the robbers, who reportedly used a crane to access an upper window, dropped one piece: the gold, emerald, and diamond crown of Empress Eugenie, which was recovered outside the museum.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party is convening to chart its next five-year economic plan, facing the critical challenge of balancing two competing priorities: stimulating domestic consumption and investing in high-tech industrial sovereignty. For decades, China's economy has relied on exports and infrastructure, but with those engines sputtering, boosting household spending has become more urgent. However, amid geopolitical competition and U.S. restrictions on technology, Beijing is expected to continue prioritizing state investment in strategic sectors like semiconductors. Analysts believe this focus on industrial policy will limit the resources available for measures aimed at increasing consumer disposable income.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's decision to stop using his royal titles, including the Duke of York, has not quelled the public and political scrutiny surrounding his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There are ongoing calls for his titles to be formally and permanently removed through an act of Parliament, with the MP for York leading the charge. The Metropolitan Police are also looking into claims regarding his conduct, and a posthumously published memoir by Virginia Giuffre repeats allegations that he denies. Though he has voluntarily given up his honors, he remains a prince by birth and eighth in the line of succession.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that state Medicaid programs should be required to cover GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for treating obesity, which affects an estimated 14 million adult Medicaid recipients. While acknowledging the high cost of these drugs, the author contends that the budgetary concerns are overstated, as prices are falling and the medications can lead to significant long-term healthcare savings by reducing obesity-related diseases. The piece highlights that denying coverage to low-income populations creates further health inequalities. It concludes that making these near-miracle drugs accessible through Medicaid is a necessary step to combat a massive public health crisis and save lives.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) present an affordable borrowing option compared to high-rate personal loans or credit cards. As of mid-October 2025, the average interest rate for a 15-year home equity loan is around 8.20%, while the average HELOC rate is approximately 7.84%. These products differ in structure, with home equity loans providing a lump sum at a fixed rate, and HELOCs offering a variable-rate revolving line of credit. While they use the home as collateral, they offer lower rates and potential tax benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government faces another shutdown, this article provides a historical overview of the 14 previous funding lapses that have occurred since 1980. Before that year, agencies largely continued operating during funding gaps, but legal opinions from the Carter administration changed this practice. The Reagan administration saw eight shutdowns, most lasting only a few days, while the most significant ones in recent memory include the 21-day shutdown under President Clinton in 1995 and the 34-day shutdown under President Trump in 2018. These events, once rare, have become more frequent in the last decade, often stemming from partisan standoffs.</p>

          <p>A prolonged government shutdown could lead to significant disruptions for air travelers in the United States. While essential employees like TSA officers and air traffic controllers are required to work without pay, extended shutdowns in the past have led to increased sick calls and staffing shortages. This can result in longer security lines and potential flight delays, as seen during the 2018-2019 shutdown when 10% of TSA workers called out sick. The U.S. Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the travel economy $1 billion a week and halt the hiring of new air traffic controllers, exacerbating an existing shortage.</p>

Refinance rates are comparable, with a 30-year refinance at 6.45%. The article advises that borrowers can improve their chances of getting a good rate by strengthening their credit profile, aiming for a score in the mid-to-high 700s.

Essential civilian Department of Defense employees also continue to work without immediate pay, while non-essential civilians are furloughed.

          <p>Zions Bancorporation's stock value dropped by $1 billion after it revealed it was unlikely to be repaid on $60 million worth of loans, sparking broader fears about the regional banking sector. The bank's subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing the managers of several funds for what it calls a "sweeping betrayal of trust." The lawsuit alleges the borrowers secretly subordinated the bank's loans, stripping away its first-priority claim on collateral while the underlying properties were transferred or foreclosed. Zions claims the collateral was "irretrievably lost," with the borrowers enriching themselves at the bank's expense.</p>
