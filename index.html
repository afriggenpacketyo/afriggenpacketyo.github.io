The news conference is a significant event for the victims to have a voice and for law makers to take action. It is important to note that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The outcome of the conference is to raise awareness about the crimes he committed. The news conference aims to push for further investigations and justice for the survivors, marking a crucial step in their pursuit of accountability.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Lorena, recently strengthened, is threatening Mexico's Baja California peninsula with heavy rain, flash floods, and mudslides, although it is expected to weaken to a tropical storm by Friday. The hurricane center forecasts Lorena to move parallel to the Baja California west coast before approaching the coast on Thursday night and Friday. Meanwhile, Hurricane Kiko, a stronger Category 2 storm, is located much farther west and poses no threat to land. Mexican authorities have issued a tropical storm warning for parts of Baja California Sur, advising residents to prepare for potential impacts from Lorena, while Kiko is not expected to impact any land.</p>

          <p>Veteran defense lawyer Abbe Lowell is representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook against President Trump's attempt to unilaterally remove her, a move unprecedented in presidential history. Lowell, known for challenging federal agency overreach across administrations, argues that the allegations against Cook are unsubstantiated and irrelevant to her role at the Federal Reserve. He has a history of representing high-profile political clients, including Letitia James and Hunter Biden, often challenging presidential administrations' actions. Lowell's involvement underscores the escalating legal battle over the independence of the Federal Reserve and the limits of presidential power.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 09:57:19 EDT</div>

          <p>Alphabet shares surged 8% after a judge ruled against the DOJ's proposal to break up Google in an antitrust case, which began in September 2023. While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, the court rejected the most severe remedies proposed by the DOJ, allowing Google to retain Chrome and continue its payment arrangements with companies like Apple to remain the default search engine. Analysts view this as a significant win for Google, removing a major overhang on the stock and reinforcing the durability of its search business. The ruling also allows Google to maintain control of the Android operating system, a key asset for expanding its AI initiatives.</p>

          <p>Cholera cases in Africa have more than doubled in the past three years, prompting African leaders to announce an emergency plan to combat the disease, which is easily treatable but deadly if left unmanaged. The plan, a joint effort between Africa CDC and the World Health Organization, focuses on improving access to clean water and sanitation, which are key drivers of the infection. The WHO reports that the situation continues to worsen due to conflict and poverty, with cholera resurging in countries that had not reported substantial cases in years. The emergency plan aims to eliminate cholera as a major public health issue by 2030.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With high mortgage rates and home prices, reverse mortgages are gaining traction among older homeowners, but experts caution about the unique risks involved. Borrowers must maintain their homes, have valid insurance, and keep up with property taxes, all of which are rising costs. Home prices are falling in some areas, reducing equity and potentially making it harder to qualify for a reverse mortgage. While reverse mortgages can provide a financial cushion, they may also deplete the stake in the home and reduce what can be passed on to heirs (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Angela Rayner's Political Future Threatened After Tax Admission</h2>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's political future is under threat after admitting to paying the wrong amount of tax on a house, a particularly damaging admission for a housing secretary. Rayner claims she sought legal advice about the stamp duty but has now learned that advice was incorrect, leading her to defend her position and resist calls for resignation. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended Rayner, the case has raised questions about whether there is one rule for politicians and another for the public. The independent investigation into whether she has breached the ministerial code could determine her future in government.</p>

          <p>The government is considering merging all UK steel companies into one entity due to concerns about the sector's financial viability, as four of the six companies are currently receiving government support. The Department for Business and Trade prefers finding a joint buyer rather than nationalizing the companies, but any plan requires the backing of current owners. The UK steel industry has faced difficulties due to high energy prices, tariffs, and a global steel glut. The government aims to make the sector more financially sustainable in the long term (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A proposed revamp of the County Championship could be delayed until 2027 or potentially shelved altogether, as consensus on the future of the competition remains elusive. While a reduction to the T20 Blast was previously agreed upon, various proposals to cut the Championship from 14 to 12 matches have faced opposition. The choice now lies between maintaining 14 matches or reducing to 13, with discussions ongoing among county chairs. The desire to ensure the best possible decision and the approaching end of the season have contributed to the possibility of delaying any changes.</p>

          <p>To lower the risk of colorectal cancer after age 45, dietitians recommend increasing the intake of anti-inflammatory foods such as legumes, walnuts, sardines, dark leafy greens, berries, and flaxseed. These foods are rich in antioxidants, fiber, and unsaturated fats, which help reduce inflammation and support gut health. Maintaining an active lifestyle, monitoring for symptoms, and staying on top of screenings are also crucial for prevention.
