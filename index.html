            <p>This Fox News article details how a helicopter crash in South Africa was caused by a penguin inside a cardboard box. During an aerial survey, a specialist requested transporting a penguin back from Bird Island. The pilot agreed, but failed to include the penguin in the flight's risk assessment. The cardboard box containing the penguin slid onto the pilot's cyclic pitch control lever, causing the helicopter to roll and crash, sustaining substantial damage. Fortunately, no one, including the penguin, was injured.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from newly imposed tariffs, including those on Chinese imports. This decision follows concerns from US tech companies about potential price increases on these goods, many of which are manufactured in China. The exemptions, backdated to April 5, also cover semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. The White House stated the move aims to give companies more time to relocate production to the United States, though the electronics are still subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl.</p>

            <p>Luxury malls in Beijing and Shanghai are experiencing a slowdown due to decreased consumer spending on luxury goods, leading to rent reductions and changes in tenant mix. Shopping centers like Parkview Green and K11 are attracting mid-market retailers to appeal to middle-class shoppers and combat rising vacancy rates. Parkview Green in Beijing is diversifying its restaurant offerings after high-end brands exited, and its owner is considering selling the property. Shanghai K11 is also easing its tenant criteria as rental income falls, reflecting broader challenges in China's high-end consumption sector.</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe after the Chinese-owned company, Jingye, threatened to close it due to financial losses. Parliament passed emergency legislation to transfer control, ensuring the plant's two blast furnaces continue operating. The move aims to safeguard the UK's ability to produce virgin steel, vital for major construction projects. While Jingye still owns the site, the government now has sweeping powers to manage operations and workers. Public ownership remains a likely option, as no private companies are willing to buy the plant.</p>

            <p>Residents of Wigtown, Scotland, have successfully saved their local pub, The Wigtown Ploughman, from being converted into flats. The community stepped in to purchase the building, which had been in continuous use for over 200 years, after it closed following the Covid pandemic. The takeover was made possible through support from South of Scotland Enterprise and a community share issue. The reopened pub aims to boost the local economy and provide a gathering place for the community.</p>
