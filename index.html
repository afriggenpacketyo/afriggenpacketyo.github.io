            <h2>Law Firm Sues Trump Administration Over Executive Order Targeting Them</h2>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey, which previously secured a significant settlement from Fox News over false claims about Dominion voting machines, has filed a lawsuit against President Trump's executive order that seeks to block their access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. The firm argues that Trump is abusing his power to retaliate against organizations he dislikes and that the executive order is blatantly unconstitutional, targeting them for defending the integrity of the 2020 election. Susman Godfrey contends that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with government agencies. The lawsuit aims to prevent future presidents from retaliating against perceived foes, emphasizing the potential for abuse of power.</p>

The Kremlin described the meeting as productive, focusing on normalizing relations. Trump expressed frustration with the lack of progress, emphasizing the high death toll in the conflict. Meanwhile, European nations pledged billions in military aid to Kyiv, and Ukraine accused Russia of prolonging the war, alleging Chinese nationals are fighting with the Russian army.

            <p>A US judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and legal US resident, due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. The government is using a Cold War-era immigration law, arguing his presence is adverse to American foreign policy interests, despite him not being charged with any crime. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal, arguing the decision was politically motivated and based on unsubstantiated claims of antisemitism. The case raises concerns about free speech and the targeting of activists based on their political views.</p>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system impacted the code used to exempt freight from new tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. The glitch, which lasted for over 10 hours, affected shipments in transit and caused confusion for U.S. shippers. Customs advised filers to resubmit entry summaries once the issue was resolved. The incident raises concerns about Customs' ability to handle the new tariff policies and collect revenue efficiently. The tariffs are based on the sailing date, with an "on the water" clause in effect for freight bound to the U.S. before the tariff announcements.</p>

Judge Paula Xinis said the administration made no meaningful effort to answer questions about Garcia's location and steps taken to facilitate his return. The Justice Department claimed it was unable to provide the information, citing the need for vetting and concerns about foreign affairs.

            <p>Following the announcement of the successful 'resurrection' of dire wolf puppies, the Trump administration is reconsidering the U.S. Endangered Species List. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum expressed excitement about the potential of 'de-extinction' technology and its impact on biodiversity protection. He suggested the list, which he likened to 'Hotel California,' should focus on innovation rather than regulation, aiming to eliminate the need for an endangered species list altogether. The administration's shift could lead to changes in how endangered species are managed and protected.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that the record American tariffs imposed on Beijing could serve as a stress test for its ability to withstand Western economic pressure in the event of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. If China can weather this difficult period, it may boost Beijing’s confidence in facing potential Western sanctions in a future cross-strait war. Washington has imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese imports so far, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent. Like most countries, the United States does not regard self-governed Taiwan as an independent state.</p>
