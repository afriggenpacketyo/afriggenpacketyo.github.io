          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for allegedly lying to Congress about his decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigation follows a recommendation from House Republicans, who accused Cuomo of intentionally lying about the number of nursing home deaths. Cuomo issued a March 2020 directive that initially barred nursing homes from refusing to accept patients who had tested positive for COVID-19, which has been a source of controversy. Cuomo's spokesperson denied the allegations, calling it "lawfare and election interference."</p>

          <p>Dr. Rachael Bedard discusses Joe Biden's metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis and its implications for his health and ability to serve as president. The article notes that while the cancer is treatable, it is not curable, and Biden's frailty makes treatment more challenging. The author argues that avoiding a clear understanding of the health change would be an evasion of responsibility and that leaders have a special obligation to face the realities of aging. The article touches on the difficulty of making decisions about treatment and prioritizing quality of life when facing a serious illness.</p>

          <p>A bomb attack on a school bus in Pakistan's Balochistan Province has killed at least six people, including four schoolchildren. The attack occurred in the Khuzdar district, targeting a bus transporting students to a military-run school. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but Balochistan has long been troubled by violence linked to separatist militant groups. The Pakistani government condemned the attack and accused India of orchestrating it through proxy organizations, though no evidence was provided.</p>

The study simulated a U.S. Air Force penetrating counterair operation on Chinese naval fleets or inland targets, noting the destructive potential of the B61-12 air-launched tactical thermonuclear bombs.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the challenges of understanding how large language models (LLMs) work and the progress being made in AI interpretability. Researchers are beginning to identify patterns of neuron activation within LLMs that correlate with specific concepts and user characteristics. LLMs not only contain relationships among words and concepts, but also many stereotypes, both helpful and harmful, from the materials on which they‚Äôve been trained, and they actively make use of them. It argues that it's important to empower users to recognize how models stereotype them and to provide a sphere of protection between LLMs and their users.</p>

          <p>This article explores the influence of multi-level-marketing schemes (MLMs) on the American workforce, highlighting how they have shaped corporate practices. The piece examines how corporations have adopted methods similar to MLMs, such as hiring contingent workforces and encouraging employees to think like entrepreneurs. The author argues that MLMs have become closely aligned with the center of corporate life, with their reliance on temporary workers and low-paid work defining the current labor market. The article further suggests that the decline of middle-class stability has made people more vulnerable to these schemes, which promise security, freedom, and dignity.</p>

Prices are highest in San Francisco and Seattle, while Columbus, Ohio, has the most affordable fast food. Average fast food prices have risen significantly over the last decade, impacting lower- and middle-income Americans. A food industry analyst says food prices will rise due to tariffs. McDonald's reported a drop in sales, citing tariffs as a factor, and the average hourly wage for fast-food workers is $15.07, making it difficult for them to afford meals from their employer.</p>
