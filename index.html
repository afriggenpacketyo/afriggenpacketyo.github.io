          <p>Democratic Governors Wes Moore of Maryland and Tim Walz of Minnesota called for a more vigorous and proactive Democratic party during an appearance at Rep. Jim Clyburn's annual fish fry in South Carolina. Both governors emphasized the need to forcefully address the current political climate and engage with diverse constituencies well before the midterm elections. Moore stressed the importance of taking action and delivering tangible alternatives to Trump's policies, while Walz urged Democrats to compete in every district and for every school board seat. Neither governor indicated any intention to run for president in 2028, focusing instead on the immediate challenges facing the party.</p>

          <p>Trevor McEuen, a capital murder suspect in Texas who had been on the run for weeks after cutting off his ankle monitor, was apprehended by law enforcement. McEuen was facing charges related to the 2023 shooting death of his neighbor and had been released on a $2 million bond twice before fleeing. Governor Greg Abbott cited McEuen's case as a reason for bail reform, advocating for stricter measures to deny bail for violent offenders. The Texas Department of Public Safety had also issued a warrant for McEuen on arson charges after he allegedly set fire to a home while evading authorities.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day. The dispute, brought by GOP Rep. Michael Bost, centers on whether the plaintiffs have the legal standing to challenge state regulations concerning federal elections. Bost argues that the late-arriving ballots dilute the value of his vote and infringe on his rights. Illinois election officials maintain that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated how the ballot-receipt deadline affected their likelihood of success in any election.</p>

          <p>German antitrust regulators have cautioned Amazon that its pricing mechanisms for third-party sellers could violate competition laws. The Federal Cartel Office is concerned that Amazon's algorithms, which set price caps for products, may limit the visibility of merchants' products and interfere with their freedom to set prices. Amazon competes directly with other marketplace retailers on its platform, making the practice questionable from a competition perspective. The Cartel Office believes this could also harm other retailers by deterring them from offering lower prices.</p>

He suggests that default, previously not considered a risk, could become a factor in investors' calculations. Harris warns that if interest rates climb towards 5% or higher on the 10-year Treasury, investors may shift away from other assets, potentially dragging down the overall economy. The real threat, he says, is the potential for a fiscal crisis sparked by a debt ceiling crisis or loss of faith in the Federal Reserve's independence. (not investment advice)</p>
