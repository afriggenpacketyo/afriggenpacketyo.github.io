          <p>The US Senate has approved a major legislative package central to Donald Trump's second-term agenda, combining significant tax cuts with increased spending on immigration control and defense. The bill, which now heads to the House, also rolls back some climate initiatives and alters eligibility for social programs like Medicaid, drawing both praise from supporters and criticism over its projected $3.4 trillion addition to the national debt. While presented as a political victory for Trump, the bill faces opposition from fiscal conservatives and concerns over its impact on low-income Americans, setting the stage for a contentious final vote.

          <p>The UK's Parliament has voted to proscribe the direct-action group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization under the Terrorism Act 2000. The move, which passed with a large majority, will make supporting or being a member of the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. This decision follows an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and damaged two planes. While the government cited the group's increasingly aggressive methods, some MPs raised concerns about the proportionality of the measure and its potential to criminalize supporters who have not engaged in violence. The group is pursuing legal action to block the order.</p>

The team advanced to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000 under Thibodeau's leadership before being eliminated by the Indiana Pacers. Brown, who most recently coached the Sacramento Kings, brings extensive experience, having previously led the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers. He has coached legendary players like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and served as an associate head coach for the Golden State Warriors, though a formal contract with the Knicks has not yet been finalized.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration plan that sought to severely limit migrants' access to the U.S. asylum system at the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, which cited an "invasion" to justify the new rules, overstepped executive authority as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act. The judge stated that while the executive branch faces significant immigration challenges, it cannot unilaterally create an alternative system that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The order has been temporarily stayed for 14 days to allow the administration to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot prematurely end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants currently living in the United States. The administration had planned to revoke their status in September, well before the previously established 2026 deadline. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The ruling provides immediate relief for migrants who have established lives in the U.S., though the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, citing executive authority over immigration enforcement.</p>

The parents, who identified as "vegan mucus-free fruitarians," failed to provide proper nourishment and subjected the infant to high-temperature saunas and ice baths. The child is now blind, a quadriplegic, and unable to speak or eat on his own. Authorities intervened when the unresponsive baby was brought to a hospital, emaciated and catatonic. The case also resulted in a record $32 million settlement from the county's child welfare agency for failing to protect the child despite prior warnings.</p>

However, the acquittal on the racketeering charge, which alleged he ran a criminal enterprise, is a significant outcome for the defense.

Despite a battling effort from England's bowlers on a flat pitch, Gill's unflustered performance, supported by an elegant 87 from Yashasvi Jaiswal, anchored the innings. England's bowlers, particularly Chris Woakes, managed to take key wickets throughout the day to keep India in check. However, a late partnership between Gill and Ravindra Jadeja ensured India ended the day in a favorable position as they look to level the series.</p>

          <p>The punk group Bob Vylan has been dropped from music festivals in the UK and France after a controversial performance at Glastonbury. During their set, the lead singer led the crowd in chants of "death to the IDF," which prompted widespread criticism and was labeled "appalling hate speech" by the prime minister. In response, the band stated they were being targeted for speaking up for Palestine and were not calling for the death of any race or group of people. The BBC, which broadcast the set, has also faced criticism and expressed regret for not cutting the live stream during the performance.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the key pieces of evidence in the investigation into the 2020 disappearance and murder of Suzanne Morphew. The case against her husband, Barry Morphew, who was recently re-arrested, involves a complex web of clues including a "spy pen" that revealed Suzanne's affair, and a "chipmunk alibi" from Barry to explain his unusual phone activity on the day she vanished. Other critical evidence includes a tranquilizer dart needle cap found in the family's dryer, suspicious trash disposals, and text messages revealing a deeply troubled marriage. After charges were initially dropped, the discovery of Suzanne's remains in 2023 led to the case being reopened.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global's decision to pay a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit from President Trump has drawn sharp criticism from press freedom advocates and journalists. The lawsuit concerned a "60 Minutes" segment, and critics argue the settlement is a "spineless capitulation" that could embolden attacks on the media. While Paramount stated the money covers legal fees and a presidential library fund, not a direct payment to Trump, many view it as an attempt to appease the administration and secure regulatory approval for its pending sale to Skydance Media. The move has raised alarms about corporate influence on journalistic integrity and the potential for a chilling effect on news organizations.</p>

          <p>A new mission is being organized to locate Amelia Earhart's missing aircraft, spurred by a satellite image that may show wreckage on a remote Pacific island. Researchers from the Archaeological Legacy Institute and Purdue University believe the object, visible on the island of Nikumaroro, could be part of Earhart's Lockheed Electra. Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan vanished 88 years ago during their attempt to circumnavigate the globe. The expedition, planned for November, hopes to finally solve one of aviation's greatest mysteries, though some experts remain skeptical, suggesting the object in the image could be natural debris.</p>

The plan involves breeding billions of male screwworm flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This sterile insect technique has been used successfully in the past to eradicate the pest, which can kill a large animal within two weeks and has recently reappeared in southern Mexico.</p>

This article suggests asking three crucial questions before placing $10,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD). Savers should first determine whether a short-term or long-term CD is more advantageous, given that short-term rates are currently higher. They must also assess if they can afford to have a large sum of money inaccessible for the CD's entire term. Finally, it is essential to compare CDs with high-yield alternatives like savings and money market accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

The judges commended the BBC for exposing the issue and stated they could not rely on MI5's previous explanations, noting that the truth had to be "extracted from, not volunteered by, MI5," raising serious questions about the agency's candor and accountability.</p>
