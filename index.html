          <p>President Trump celebrated his administration's first 100 days of his second term at a rally in Michigan, highlighting achievements in immigration enforcement, government downsizing, and trade negotiations. He boasted about the administration's border policies and claimed significant progress in reducing illegal border crossings, while also addressing lawsuits challenging these policies. Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and defended his tariff policies, suggesting that China would absorb the costs. He also reiterated his commitment to protecting Medicare and Social Security, contrasting it with purported Democratic tax increases.

          <p>President Trump criticized Republican "grandstanders" opposing his budget reconciliation bill during a Michigan speech, claiming its failure would lead to the "highest tax increase in history." He asserted near-unanimous Republican support for the bill, which prioritizes energy, defense, border security, and tax cuts, while also raising the debt ceiling. Trump warned that Democratic opposition could result in a substantial tax increase, framing the bill as essential for maintaining economic stability.

          <p>In an interview with Dr. Phil, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false claims about vaccine safety and the FDA's approval process. Kennedy advised parents to "do your own research" on vaccines, despite scientific consensus on their safety and efficacy. He falsely stated that outside panels, not the FDA or CDC, approve new drugs and that vaccines lack safety studies. Experts criticized Kennedy's statements, emphasizing the importance of consulting reliable sources and noting the rigorous safety testing vaccines undergo.

          <p>A report suggests that the perception of U.S. stock markets outperforming European ones isn't always accurate for individual companies. The analysis shows that a significant percentage of European companies that moved to the U.S. are trading below their listing price. While there are exceptions, the report highlights that the valuation premium on U.S. markets is largely driven by highly valued tech firms. The article suggests that European companies should carefully consider whether a move to the U.S. is truly beneficial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that human wounds heal significantly slower than those of other mammals like chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice. The slower healing is attributed to the evolutionary trade-off where humans lost fur in favor of sweat glands for cooling. Hair follicles, which contain stem cells crucial for skin repair, are less abundant in human skin compared to furry animals. The abundance of sweat glands in humans, while beneficial for temperature regulation, makes them less efficient at wound repair.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Canada may be more inclined to strengthen its relationship with China, its second-largest trading partner, due to ongoing tensions with the U.S. and President Trump's tariffs. There is pressure within Canada to realistically assess possibilities with China, given the trade disputes with the U.S. It is expected that Ottawa will re-emphasize commercial relations with China and engage in talks to remove trade barriers. The article notes that certain sectors, like electric vehicles and hi-tech, will remain more difficult.</p>
