          <p>President Trump has voiced strong criticism of Vladimir Putin's recent escalation of attacks on Ukraine, labeling Putin's behavior as "absolutely crazy" and expressing frustration over the ongoing violence. Trump highlighted the senseless killing of people and warned that Putin's ambition to conquer all of Ukraine could lead to Russia's downfall. Despite his criticism of Putin, Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, stating that Zelenskyy's statements are not helping his country. The remarks come amid intensified Russian aerial bombardments of Ukrainian cities, prompting international concern and calls for tighter sanctions on Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential vision of a world divided into spheres of influence dominated by the United States, China, and Russia, according to foreign policy analysts. Trump has expressed a desire to normalize commerce with Russia and has sought to manage the fallout from his trade war by engaging with China's leader. This approach echoes a 19th-century style of imperial rule, with Trump indicating interest in expanding U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere, including Greenland and Canada. While some caution against attributing strategic intent to Trump's actions, his administration's focus on exerting American influence in the Americas aligns with the concept of spheres of influence.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated a revised system for selling government rice stockpiles, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices by early June. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the plan to sell rice produced in 2021 and 2022 at approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms through direct contracts with major retailers. This move bypasses the auction system, which was seen as contributing to rising costs, and seeks to address public concerns about inflation impacting household budgets. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to handle rice price issues and prevent consumers from turning away from rice products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Arlington National Cemetery to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and deliver remarks in honor of Memorial Day. Earlier on Monday, Trump posted a controversial message on his social media platform, Truth Social, wishing a "happy Memorial Day to all," while also targeting his political opponents. Memorial Day is a day to honor those who died in uniform as a result of battle, with the Department of Veterans Affairs estimating that over 650,000 U.S. military personnel have died in battle since the Revolutionary War.</p>

          <p>Retail investors have been credited with successfully buying the dip during recent market volatility driven by tariff concerns, earning significant returns while institutional investors reduced their exposure. Data indicates that retail investors have poured over $50 billion into equities since April 8, capitalizing on the market's rapid rebound. This trend reflects a growing "buy-the-dip" mentality among retail investors, who often benefit from longer time horizons compared to institutional investors facing pressure to meet benchmark performance. Institutional investors are often benchmarked to the S&P 500 and face career risk if they underperform the benchmark. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision marks a rare instance of Harvard forcibly stripping a tenured faculty member's position. The allegations surfaced in 2021, with accusations that Gino fabricated data in her research. After an investigation, Harvard concluded that Gino was responsible for research misconduct, leading to her administrative leave, ban from campus, and now, the revocation of her tenure. Gino maintains her innocence and has filed a lawsuit against Harvard, questioning the fairness of the process.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion from Harvard University to trade schools, amid ongoing criticism of the university's transparency and its handling of international students. This proposal comes as the Trump administration agreed to delay a 50% tariff on the European Union following a call with the president of the European Commission. The House recently passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" to fund Trump's domestic agenda, which is now under consideration in the Senate. Trump has also continued to criticize Harvard, questioning the university's transparency and demanding that it reveal the personal details of its international students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When hiring a roofing company, it is important to understand whether they use in-house crews or subcontractors, as this can impact the quality, cost, and timeline of the project. In-house crews are full-time employees who have undergone vetting processes and training, ensuring consistent quality and safety practices. Subcontractors, on the other hand, offer more flexibility and potentially lower costs, but may present risks of inconsistency and varying levels of vetting. Choosing between in-house crews and subcontractors depends on individual priorities, with in-house crews offering more accountability and subcontractors potentially offering faster timelines and lower costs.</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation develops during puberty through a complex interplay of biological and psychosocial factors, with no single cause identified. Research suggests that genetics, hormones, and social influences all contribute to an individual's sexual preference. While there is no "homosexuality gene," family studies indicate that genetics may play a role. Hormones and chemicals like pheromones also influence sexual behavior, and sexual orientation is considered stable throughout life, despite societal pressures. Understanding and accepting sexual diversity is crucial, especially in societies where sexual minorities face discrimination and persecution.</p>

          <p>A German high school has been embroiled in scandal after students proposed Nazi slogans as graduation mottos, prompting widespread condemnation and calls for action. The incident, which included slogans referencing Nazi extermination camps and book burnings, has raised concerns about the rise of right-wing extremism among young people. Education officials have called for mandatory visits to concentration camp memorials for all students, and experts are noting an increase in far-right hate crimes in schools. The incident highlights the challenge of combating extremism and preserving the memory of the Holocaust in a society where the direct connection to that history is fading.</p>

The airline has not yet announced the exact cost for checked bags, but rival airlines generally charge around $35 or $40 for a first checked bag for domestic flights.

          <p>The author presents a contrarian view of summer, arguing that it is an overrated season characterized by excessive heat, boredom, and unrealistic expectations. The essay challenges the romanticized notion of summer as a time of freedom and relaxation, pointing out the realities of extreme heat, high travel costs, and a lack of significant events. The author critiques the summer industrial complex, which promotes idealized images of beaches and vacations, and suggests that lowering expectations can lead to a more enjoyable summer experience. The piece also touches on the growing impact of climate change, with extreme heat becoming an increasing concern.</p>

The UK had the highest estimated costs due to invasive species at over $1.3 trillion, and the study noted the monetary cost of biological invasions is on a similar scale to the global costs of extreme weather attributable to climate change.</p>
