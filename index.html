        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain and the European Union have finalized a significant agreement aimed at enhancing security cooperation and reducing trade barriers that arose after Brexit. The deal intends to foster closer collaboration between the two entities, especially as the United States signals a reduction in its commitment to European security. Key aspects of the agreement include streamlined border crossings for British citizens using electronic gates, eased travel regulations for pets, and the resumption of certain British meat product sales within the EU. The agreement also addresses fishing rights, granting European boats access to UK waters until June 2038, a point of contention that drew criticism from pro-Brexit factions in Britain.</p>

          <p>Portugal's recent snap election has resulted in the center-right Democratic Alliance maintaining its position as the ruling party, albeit in a minority government. The most notable outcome of the election was the significant surge of the hard-right Chega party, which secured over 22% of the vote, establishing itself as a powerful political force. Chega's success, driven by anti-immigration sentiments and economic grievances, reflects a broader trend in Western Europe where hard-right parties are gaining traction. The party's rise signals a shift in Portugal's political landscape, potentially influencing government policies on issues such as immigration.</p>

Trump intends to discuss stopping the "bloodbath" and trade, according to a post on Truth Social. Vice President JD Vance indicated that Trump would likely press Putin on the economic benefits of de-escalating the conflict and urge him to halt the violence. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that a direct conversation between Trump and Putin could help break the stalemate. These calls follow recent talks in Istanbul attended by White House envoy Steve Wikoff, though neither Putin nor Zelenskyy were present.</p>

          <p>Born in 1925, Malcolm X became an influential figure in the Black civil rights movement, advocating for self-confidence and resistance against oppression "by any means necessary." His early life was marked by racism and violence, leading him to join the Nation of Islam (NOI) and denounce "white devils." Later, a pilgrimage to Mecca transformed his views, leading him to seek an alliance of oppressed people of color. He was assassinated in 1965, but his legacy has been renewed through hip-hop and film, reminding us of the importance of facing reality and fighting against injustice.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced turbulence as U.S. stocks and bonds declined, and the dollar weakened, reflecting investor concerns about the U.S. economy. A bill in Congress proposing to make President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent added to worries about federal debt. Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, citing fiscal deficit and growing debt costs, further unsettled markets. Higher interest rates and rising gold prices also indicated investor anxiety. Concerns about tariffs and their impact on inflation continue to weigh on the market, with Walmart announcing potential price increases due to tariff costs.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Christine Emba discusses the harmful effects of pornography on society, particularly on Gen Z, and critiques the reluctance to acknowledge its negative impact. She highlights the normalization of extreme and violent content, the connection between porn-trained behaviors and young women's distrust in young men, and the industry's exploitation of desires for profit. Emba argues that the widespread availability of pornography has led to a cultural degradation, with women being objectified and dehumanized. She calls for a more open discussion about the harms of pornography and a re-evaluation of societal norms surrounding sex and sexuality.</p>

          <p>Ahead of planned phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the White House stated that President Trump is "open" to meeting with Putin to discuss ending the conflict in Ukraine. Trump's goal is to achieve a ceasefire, as he is reportedly "weary and frustrated" with both sides of the conflict. The renewed contact with Putin follows unsuccessful peace talks in Istanbul, where Putin declined to attend despite Zelenskyy's invitation. Trump has repeatedly threatened further sanctions on Russia, but these have not yet led to a shift in Moscow's war goals.</p>

          <p>A sweeping US tax and spending bill has advanced through a key committee in the House, overcoming Republican conflict and moving closer to a full vote. The bill would extend tax cuts from President Trump's first term, end taxes on tips, and increase military and border spending. Four hard-line Republican congressmen, who had previously opposed the bill, allowed it to go forward after receiving concessions from leadership. The bill is expected to face a bumpy road ahead, with disagreements among Republicans over the depth of the cuts and provisions related to local tax deductions.</p>

          <p>After the US and China agreed to a temporary truce in the trade war, tensions have flared again, casting doubt on any lasting de-escalation. Soon after the agreement was reached, the US imposed a global ban on Chinese firm Huawei Technologies’ Ascend AI chips over alleged export control violations and national security concerns. Beijing accused Washington of “long-arm jurisdiction” and “maliciously blockading and suppressing Chinese chip products and the AI industry without justification.” According to analysts, the latest ban on Huawei chips signals that President Trump is looking to expand the battleground beyond tariffs and tighten tech restrictions on China.</p>

The watchdog group believes the documents could reveal potential political interference by the president in agency operations. The lawsuit comes after the Trump administration froze university grants and insisted the school should lose its tax-exempt status.</p>
