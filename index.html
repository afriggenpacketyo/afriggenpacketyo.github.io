          <p>President Trump has publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, even after a positive jobs report. Trump argued that the country is "doing great" while insisting on the rate cut to boost the economy. Markets, however, predict virtually no chance of such a significant rate decrease following the Federal Open Market Committee's upcoming meeting. Trump has also complained that other global central banks have been lowering rates while the Fed has not followed suit, even suggesting that Powell could raise rates again if inflation flares up.

          <p>The operator of Tokyo Disney Resort is considering lowering ticket prices for its theme parks due to increasing inflation and reduced discretionary spending. Oriental Land Co. may adjust the price range for Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, where one-day tickets currently cost between 7,900 yen ($55) and 10,900 yen per adult. This consideration aligns with the company's long-term business strategy through fiscal 2035, which includes a large-scale redevelopment of parts of its parks. The company also aims to launch and establish its cruise ship operations by fiscal 2028, offering a theme park and hotel experience at sea.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has upheld Colorado's law banning people under 21 from buying a gun, siding with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit's decision. The judge agreed that age-based requirements for firearm purchases do not fall under the Second Amendment's right to keep and bear arms, citing a "safe harbor" exclusion. Exceptions to the law are made for those in the U.S. Military and peace officers making purchases while on duty. The decision contrasts with a ruling by the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which struck down a federal restriction banning firearm sales to those under 21.</p>

          <p>A public feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump escalated after Musk accused Trump of being in the Epstein files. The accusations followed Musk's criticism of Trump's domestic megabill, citing concerns over its price tag and impact on the national debt. Trump responded by saying he was "disappointed" in Musk and suggested terminating his government subsidies and contracts. Musk, in turn, reposted a comment calling for Trump's impeachment and swiped at Trump's tariff policy, claiming it would cause a recession.</p>

          <h2>Food Firms Reduce Ingredients Amid Ultra-Processed Food Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 10:05:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food companies are increasingly reducing the number of ingredients in their products due to growing concerns about ultra-processed foods. Retailers and brands are offering more items with fewer ingredients, prompted by consumer interest in simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. Plant-based brands are launching new ranges with natural ingredients to address consumer hesitation about processed meat alternatives. However, some nutritionists caution that focusing solely on ingredient count can lead to the exclusion of fortified nutrients, which are essential for public health.</p>

          <p>The language of blood and soil has become central to public debate in many democracies, making elections existential. Economic and policy arguments matter less than deeper cultural divides, and narrow electoral results can determine the nature of the state and the future of democracy. The author argues that the triumph of centrist coalitions does not remove authoritarian populism from politics. All elections now hinge on small numbers of voters deciding the future of democracy and the independence of courts.</p>
