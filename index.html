          <p>The United States and Iran convened in Muscat, Oman, for a fourth round of negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program, mediated by Omani officials, as both nations aim to resolve their long-standing dispute through diplomacy. While both sides expressed a desire to reach an agreement where Iran limits its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of U.S. sanctions, significant disagreements persist on critical issues, including the extent of dismantling Iran's nuclear facilities, which the Trump administration advocates for, but Iran rejects. The negotiations occur as President Trump prepares for a Middle East visit and has threatened military action if diplomacy fails, raising the stakes for regional and global security. The article highlights the potential for reshaping the region's security landscape through a deal, while also acknowledging the deep distrust and challenges that remain. Optimism is cautiously expressed by both sides, but technical level discussions remain challenging.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited Israel, emphasizing Germany's commitment to Israel's security while questioning the effectiveness of military actions in resolving the Gaza conflict. Wadephul stressed the need for a political solution, urging serious negotiations for a ceasefire and the reconstruction of Gaza without Hamas, as he expressed concerns about Israel's conduct in the Gaza war and its long-term security implications. He also addressed the importance of allowing criticism of Israel without it leading to antisemitism, and reiterated Germany's commitment to returning Israeli hostages home from Gaza. Wadephul's visit included discussions on aid delivery to Gaza and the recognition of a Palestinian state, with Saar threatening 'unilateral actions' if Palestinian statehood is recognized.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of Elizabeth Holmes, has reportedly raised millions for a new blood-testing company named Haemanthus, drawing parallels to Holmes' failed Theranos venture. Haemanthus aims to diagnose illnesses through blood, urine, and saliva samples, similar to Theranos's initial claims, however, Theranos' claims about its technology helped its valuation balloon, reaching its $9bn peak in 2014. The new company intends to begin testing on animals before human trials, utilizing laser technology for rapid molecular analysis, but several investors have reportedly passed on the pitch. Evans, reportedly advised by Holmes, has secured nearly $20 million from friends and investors, despite the shadow of the Theranos scandal.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in the four-day conflict between India and Pakistan, coupled with religious nationalism, suggest the potential for more frequent battles, as a new generation of military technology fueled a dizzying aerial escalation. The conflict involved airstrikes, anti-aircraft volleys, and weaponized drones, and it was only then that international diplomacy seemed to engage, highlighting the absence of international responsibility to keep peace. Political realities in both countries, gripped by religious nationalism, create a powerful push toward further confrontations, but the positions of both sides appeared more extreme this time.</p>

          <p>Chart-topping singer Yungblud, also known as Dominic Richard Harrison, has expressed interest in potentially entering politics to "provide some good somewhere," and he feels that music events have become out of step with real people. Yungblud launched his own festival, BludFest, with tickets sold for Â£73.25 for this year's festival in the Buckinghamshire city, but he said he felt more expensive events had become "a thing of privilege" that "do not represent real people". He emphasized the importance of human connection and addressing the struggles people face, and he expressed his belief that too many music events are out of step with real people.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are facing significant challenges due to President Trump's tariffs, as Beth Benike, owner of Busy Baby, a Minnesota company that designs and sells baby products made in China, faces a 145% tax on Chinese imports. Benike is at risk of losing her house, as tariffs threaten her ability to produce and sell her products, and Marissa Held-Nordling, owner of Little Roo's, a retailer that supplies Busy Baby, is seeing changes in shopper behavior due to uncertainty, while economists expect goods to become more expensive or go out of stock. Economic analyst Kyla Scanlon suggests that these tariffs are unnecessary and create a confusing economic environment for small businesses, and President Trump maintains that the tariffs are necessary to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.</p>

AI chatbots are providing enhanced search capabilities, but they are not replacing employees in core operations, as business owners are hesitant to trust AI systems without human oversight. Building AI systems is expensive, and many smaller companies cannot afford to develop their own internal models, but although AI will eventually transform the workplace, that day is still years away.</p>
