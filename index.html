          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Policies Undermine Foundational Global Trade Principles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's approach to global trade poses a profound threat to the established international system, particularly the World Trade Organization. Beyond the immediate impact of tariffs, the piece contends that the real damage lies in the dismantling of core principles that have long governed multilateral trade. Foundational rules such as "most favoured nation," which ensures equal trade concessions for all countries, are being eroded in favor of bilateral deal-making. The author suggests this shift could lead to long-term instability and unpredictability in global commerce.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The location was chosen for its security capabilities and its historical significance, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. This meeting follows several unsuccessful rounds of peace talks and a deadline Trump set for a ceasefire. While Trump has expressed hope for a resolution, the White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise," and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend.</p>

          <p>At 20 years old, undefeated British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma is preparing for a significant career test against veteran Dillian Whyte in Saudi Arabia. Itauma, who has an impressive record of 12 wins with 10 knockouts, is seen as a major prospect in the division, drawing comparisons to champion Oleksandr Usyk for his skill set. While he has generated considerable hype since his professional debut, this fight represents a major step up in competition. A victory over a well-known name like Whyte could position Itauma for a future world title shot and validate his status as a future star.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is poised for a major expansion of its data center infrastructure, with nearly 100 new facilities planned, representing a roughly 20% increase. This construction boom is driven by the growing demands of artificial intelligence, with major tech companies like Google and Microsoft investing heavily. However, this rapid growth is raising significant concerns about the immense energy and water consumption required by these facilities. Experts warn of potential impacts on consumer utility bills and strain on local resources, particularly in regions serviced by providers like Thames Water.</p>

The White House has stated that Trump aims to explore all possible avenues for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was not invited to the talks, remains apprehensive about potential agreements made without his country's involvement.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on Tokyo to confront its history and make the "right choice" concerning Taiwan. Wang emphasized that post-war international agreements clarified Japan's responsibility and mandated the return of territories stolen from China, including Taiwan. He criticized what he described as ongoing attempts within Japan to glorify its past aggression and distort historical facts. The statement came as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed "remorse" for the war, a significant gesture from a Japanese leader.</p>

The research highlights a low waste recovery rate of just 17% in China, with most recycled material being downcycled into lower-quality products.

          <p>After winning the Premier League title in his first season, Liverpool manager Arne Slot now faces heightened pressure following an extensive summer spending spree that could exceed £300 million. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz for £116m, fundamentally changing expectations for the upcoming season. Having previously been tasked with managing a transition period, Slot is now expected to deliver more major trophies, including another league title and a strong Champions League campaign.

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has weighed in on the transfer saga surrounding Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, suggesting it will be difficult for the player to remain at the club. Isak is reportedly determined to join Liverpool, who recently had a £110m offer rejected. Rooney noted that while losing a top player is a blow, financial regulations might make selling Isak beneficial for Newcastle, allowing them to reinvest in strengthening their overall squad. He also acknowledged that for Isak, the chance to join the reigning Premier League champions represents a massive career opportunity.</p>

          <p>Surrey Police has initiated a campaign called "Jog On" to address the prevalent issue of street harassment and catcalling directed at women who are jogging. The operation involves female police officers running in plain clothes in targeted areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene when incidents occur. The initiative was prompted by a local survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, yet nearly half never reported it. The campaign aims to gather better data on this under-reported crime and educate perpetrators about the impact of their behavior.</p>

          <p>A recent advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) established that nations have a legal obligation to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. Some financial experts believe this ruling could become a pivotal moment for markets, as it implies that activities like fossil fuel subsidies and licensing may be considered internationally wrongful acts. An Allianz board member suggests that this creates a new legal risk, compelling prudent investors to re-evaluate assets tied to the fossil fuel industry. If governments and national courts begin to enforce this opinion, it could significantly impact the valuation and cashflow of affected companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vectus Global, a security firm run by Blackwater founder Erik Prince, is set to deploy nearly 200 international personnel to Haiti under a one-year contract to help quell rampant gang violence. The deployment aims to assist Haiti's government in reclaiming territory controlled by heavily armed gangs and will support the country's national police. This move comes as a UN-backed Kenyan police mission struggles with insufficient personnel and funding. The use of a private military company has raised concerns among some observers about potential violations of U.S. law and the risk of further fragmenting authority in the crisis-stricken nation.</p>

          <p>The peace summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin involves several critical and complex issues concerning the war in Ukraine. A primary point of contention is territory, with Russia occupying about a fifth of Ukraine and potentially demanding more land in exchange for a ceasefire. Another key area is security guarantees, as Ukraine seeks protection from future aggression while Russia insists on its neutrality. The lifting of economic sanctions on Russia, accountability for war crimes, funding for reconstruction, and the exchange of prisoners of war are also major topics that will shape any potential agreement.</p>

Individuals affected by the clear-out expressed feelings of fear and persecution, stating they were being treated like an eyesore.

The order eliminates local rules that limited information sharing with ICE and barred officers from making arrests based solely on administrative immigration warrants.

Fixed-asset investment also slowed, and the contraction in the property sector worsened.

The first device was found by a contractor installing new equipment, prompting a large-scale search by an explosive ordnance disposal team. The bombs, which were not live but contained a charge, were found carefully stacked in rows. It is believed they were buried at the end of the war when the site was used as a military ordnance depot, a fact unknown to generations of children who played there.</p>
