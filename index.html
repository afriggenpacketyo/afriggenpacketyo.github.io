            <h2>China Imposes Steep Retaliatory Tariffs on US Goods Amid Trade War Escalation</h2>

            <p>China has responded to the latest US tariff hikes by imposing retaliatory tariffs of 84% on U.S. goods, escalating the trade war between the two economic powerhouses. This move comes after the U.S. increased levies on Chinese goods to over 100%. The escalating trade conflict has spooked investors, causing a sharp sell-off in global equity markets, with the S&P 500 entering a bear market. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed disappointment in China's unwillingness to negotiate, but the long term effects are yet to be seen.</p>

            <p>Melanie Krause, the acting commissioner of the IRS, is resigning due to disagreements over the Treasury Department's decision to share immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The move aims to identify and deport undocumented immigrants, but critics argue it violates privacy laws. This decision is part of President Trump's agenda to secure U.S. borders, but has raised concerns about the privacy of all Americans and the potential for civil and criminal sanctions for IRS officials who sign off on the data sharing.</p>

            <p>The future of British Steel, a Chinese-owned company employing 2,700 people, is uncertain as the government considers nationalization to prevent it from running out of raw materials. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy says a "commercial solution" is within reach, but the company has rejected a Â£500m government support offer to switch to electric arc furnaces. The steel industry is also grappling with 25% tariffs on exports to the US, further complicating the situation. Nationalization is seen as a potential solution to preserve steelmaking in the UK.</p>

            <p>With the US imposing tariffs of more than 100% on Chinese goods and China retaliating with increased tariffs on American goods, a full-scale trade war is looming. The trade in goods between the two countries amounted to around $585 billion last year. The US imports electronics, computers, and toys from China, while the US exports soybeans, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum to China. The escalating conflict could hurt consumers in both countries and potentially disrupt global supply chains.</p>

            <p>President Trump's latest sweeping tariffs against America's trading partners have taken effect, imposing additional taxes on imported goods. These tariffs range from 11% to 104% for Chinese products. Trump claims the tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but economists warn of potential harm to the global economy and increased prices for consumers. Reciprocal tariffs have been introduced, but their calculation is not always based on existing tariffs or non-tariff barriers.</p>

            <p>President Trump is threatening to impose "major" tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, potentially disrupting decades of low-cost global trade in medicines. This move follows the introduction of blanket tariffs on other imports and could significantly impact pharmaceutical buyers, especially those relying on Indian imports. The US imports vast quantities of finished medicines from India, Europe, and China without tariffs. The implications of this policy shift are significant for the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare costs.</p>

            <p>Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are operating data centers that consume vast amounts of water in some of the world's driest areas, with plans for further expansion. With Trump's support, these companies are building hundreds of data centers globally, potentially exacerbating water scarcity issues. Amazon's efforts to mitigate water use have faced internal opposition, with concerns raised about the ethical implications of water offsetting.

            <p>The Trump administration's policies are threatening to worsen air quality in the US, potentially leading to increased health risks. Rollbacks of environmental rules, cuts to scientific research, and a lack of interest in regulation are contributing to this trend. The EPA's planned rollbacks of particulate matter standards are projected to result in thousands of premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of asthma cases. Scientists warn that these actions will have dire consequences for public health.</p>

            <p>A New York pediatrician accused of sex abuse has been ordered to pay $1.6 billion to 104 women, including a priest in Las Vegas. The ruling comes after years of complaints against Stuart Copperman, who was never criminally charged but had his medical license revoked in 2000. The women were able to file lawsuits due to New York's Child Victims Act. The accusers are unlikely to ever see any of the awarded money.</p>

            <p>China will impose a fresh 50% tariff on all American imports, in addition to existing levies, in response to similar tariff increases on its goods by the US. This move further escalates the trade war between the world's two largest economies. Beijing has pledged to release new supportive policies amid external shocks and resolutely defend its interests and the multilateral trade system. Analysts warn that the tit-for-tat retaliation risks further decoupling with the US.</p>
