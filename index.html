          <p>Prince Andrew's business dealings are facing increased scrutiny after it was revealed that his firm, Pitch@Palace Global, was administered by a company controlled by controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman.

          <p>Despite President Trump's earlier claims of ending the war between Russia and Ukraine in "one day," a ceasefire agreement remains elusive after his first 100 days in office. While the Trump administration has initiated discussions with both Russia and Ukraine, progress has been slow, with both sides accusing each other of sabotaging a ceasefire. The US has threatened to withdraw from negotiations if no compromise is reached soon, and there are conflicting signals about potential territorial concessions from Ukraine. European diplomats remain skeptical about Russia's commitment to peace.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party is expected to win enough seats in the House of Commons to form a government in Canada, though it is unclear if they will secure a majority. Carney is set to remain Prime Minister after assuming the role in March following Justin Trudeau's resignation. The Liberals are leading in more than 150 seats but are short of the 172 needed for a majority, while the Conservatives are set to remain in opposition.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "border czar" Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a prior "withholding of removal" order. Homan claimed the order was based on outdated information and that Abrego Garcia is now a "terrorist" affiliated with MS-13. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has refused to send Abrego Garcia back to the United States, prompting a visit to El Salvador by Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen. A federal judge has temporarily paused an order requiring the Trump administration to provide updates on its efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, giving automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent will remain in place, they will be modified to avoid "stacking" with other tariffs, and automakers will be reimbursed for some costs. Automakers have welcomed the change, but substantial tariffs will still exist, raising prices for new and used cars.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed three executive orders targeting local jurisdictions deemed "sanctuary cities" for limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The orders direct the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to publish a list of these jurisdictions and pursue legal action against them. Additional orders aim to provide legal resources to police officers, review restraints on law enforcement, and enforce English proficiency rules for truck drivers. The actions have sparked criticism from pro-immigration advocates, who accuse Trump of pursuing an anti-immigrant agenda.</p>

The outcome was influenced by Trump's actions, which led to a surge in nationalism and aided the Liberals in retaining power.</p>
