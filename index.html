          <p>Wigan Warriors secured their first-ever Women's Challenge Cup title by defeating St Helens in a dominant performance. The Warriors scored seven tries, ending St Helens' four-year reign in the competition. Megan Williams and Mary Coleman set the tone early, followed by tries from Emily Veivers, Isabel Rowe, Eva Hunter, Grace Banks, and Anna Davies. This victory marks a significant milestone for Wigan and a first piece of silverware for coach Denis Betts, who had previously won seven Challenge Cups as a player. The game saw Wigan dominate their rivals, achieving a derby win on the grandest stage of Wembley finals, with St Helens only getting on the board through Katie Mottershead. The score reflects Wigan's utter dominance and is not an optimism score.</p>

          <p>This article traces the complex and fluctuating relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, from Musk's initial criticism of Trump before the 2016 election to their eventual alliance. Musk served on Trump's economic advisory councils but left due to disagreements over climate change. The relationship saw positive moments, such as Trump's praise for Musk's SpaceX achievements. A major turning point occurred in July 2024 after an assassination attempt on Trump, leading to Musk's endorsement and campaigning efforts. The timeline culminates in a public fallout over a spending bill, with both figures exchanging insults and accusations on social media, indicating a possible end to their alliance.</p>

          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges following a tumultuous period marked by CEO Elon Musk's public dispute with President Donald Trump. The conflict, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, led to a social media feud and a sharp decline in Tesla's stock value. The fallout threatens Tesla's access to government support and tariff exemptions. This disruption compounds existing issues, including declining revenue, increased competition from Chinese EV makers, and consumer backlash against Musk's political stances. Tesla's board faces pressure to ensure the company's stability amidst Musk's polarizing behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article highlights the significant strides made in cancer treatment, noting a substantial decline in age-adjusted cancer death rates in the US since 1991. The author uses the personal story of Jon Gluck, a multiple myeloma survivor, to illustrate how advancements in treatments like stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have transformed cancer from a death sentence into a manageable condition. Contributing factors include reduced smoking rates, improved screening methods, and breakthroughs in immunotherapy. While challenges remain, particularly with rising rates of gastrointestinal cancers among younger people, the overall trend indicates a positive shift in the battle against cancer.</p>

          <h2>UK Spending Review Reveals Increased Government Spending</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 07:56:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's upcoming Spending Review is expected to reveal a significant increase in overall government spending, surpassing Â£650 billion by 2029-30, which is roughly Â£100 billion more than when Labour took office. The government is keen to highlight this increase compared to the Conservative years. However, the distribution of these funds remains a point of contention, with some departments, such as the NHS, receiving substantial allocations while others, like the Home Office, are struggling. The review will emphasize long-term projects, but short-term spending money will be tight, and the government faces pressure to present a convincing narrative to improve its public image.</p>

The claims include assertions that wind turbines are driving whales crazy, killing birds in droves, and are not truly green due to recycling issues. The fact-check reveals that there is no scientific evidence linking wind turbine noise to whale deaths, that wind turbines account for a relatively small percentage of bird deaths compared to other factors, and that efforts are being made to improve the recyclability of wind turbine blades.

          <p>This article examines the financial strategy of using 401(k) funds to delay Social Security benefits, weighing its potential benefits and drawbacks. While delaying Social Security can increase monthly benefit checks, it's crucial to consider the opportunity cost of forgoing potential investment growth within the 401(k). The decision depends on factors such as investment performance, the size of the nest egg, and individual financial circumstances. Drawing down a 401(k) may be viable for those with substantial assets, but it could pose risks for individuals with limited savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, using Delaware's program as a case study. While time limits are intended to encourage self-sufficiency and increase turnover in the system, there's little evidence they consistently boost employment or help people move off subsidies. Delaware's program includes work requirements, financial support, and savings incentives. However, the success of time limits depends on the availability of affordable housing and additional support services. Other regions, like Tacoma, Washington, have abandoned time limits due to their ineffectiveness.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on Ncuti Gatwa's brief but impactful tenure as the Fifteenth Doctor on *Doctor Who*. Gatwa's casting as the first Black, openly queer, and African-born Doctor represented a significant departure for the series. His Doctor was more emotionally available and embraced a diverse range of fashion styles, bringing a new level of queerness to the franchise. Gatwa's performance allowed the series to explore themes of racism and privilege in ways that previous Doctors could not, marking a significant contribution to the show's legacy.</p>
