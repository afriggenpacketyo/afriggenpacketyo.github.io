          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, met with a top Department of Justice official for a second consecutive day. Her lawyer stated that she answered all questions truthfully and was asked about approximately 100 different people, though no names were disclosed. The meeting comes amid public pressure for more information about the Epstein case. Maxwell's attorney emphasized that no deals for clemency or a sentence reduction have been offered in exchange for her cooperation.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits Scotland to open a new golf course and conduct trade talks, local residents near his Aberdeenshire property have voiced divided opinions. Some neighbors who refused to sell their land during the course's development remain critical of the environmental impact and the president's treatment of them. Others, including local golfers and employees, acknowledge the positive economic impact and employment the resort has brought to the area. The visit has also prompted planned protests from activists who oppose his political policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, funded by the substantial revenue collected from his administration's tariffs. He suggested the rebates could be targeted toward individuals below a certain income level, although specific details were not provided. The president also mentioned using the funds to pay down the national debt, which is projected to increase significantly. This proposal follows previous discussions of direct payments and comes as the government has collected around $100 billion from the new import duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NFL is penalizing approximately 100 players and two dozen club employees for violating league policy by reselling their Super Bowl LIX tickets for profit. The league, which can digitally track ticket usage, discovered the individuals sold their allotted tickets to "bundlers" working for resellers. Players involved will be fined 150 percent of the ticket's face value and will lose future Super Bowl ticket privileges, while employees face a 200 percent fine.

          <p>Russia's parliament has approved a new censorship law that imposes fines for searching for or accessing online content that the government has labeled "extremist." The legislation also penalizes the promotion of VPN services, which many Russians use to circumvent existing state censorship. The country's official list of extremist materials contains over 5,000 entries and includes not only materials from designated hate groups but also works critical of the government. Critics, including some pro-Kremlin figures, have condemned the law as a severe escalation of state control over information, approaching "thoughtcrime."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Education Department announced it is releasing billions of dollars in previously withheld federal grant funding to states, ending a freeze that had left school districts scrambling. The administration had held back the funds, which support programs for adult education, English language learners, and teacher development, for a review to ensure alignment with White House priorities. The decision to release the money follows bipartisan pressure from lawmakers and lawsuits from several states. School officials had warned that without the funds, critical academic services and summer programs were at risk of being eliminated.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trip to Scotland has been overshadowed by the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal, with new reports indicating his name was on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein's 50th birthday.

This comes as Maxwell concluded a second day of meetings with a top DOJ official. The developments have intensified pressure on the administration to release its investigative files on Epstein.</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that there were failings in the care provided to former England cricketer Graham Thorpe in the months before he died by suicide in August 2024. The inquest heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive Thorpe to be in a crisis situation, even after his wife reported that he was asking for help to end his life. The coroner noted "shortcomings" in his care, including the fact that he had not been seen in person for months. Thorpe, who had been struggling with depression after losing his coaching job, was 55.</p>

While some soldiers express pride in the mission, the increased militarization has raised concerns about sidestepping the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

This puts significant pressure on the Prime Minister, especially after France announced its own plans for recognition.
