          <p>Large-scale protests are planned across the US for "No Kings" Day, a demonstration against President Trump's policies and actions.  The protests are intended to counter Trump's military parade in Washington, D.C., and are being organized by the 50501 Movement.  Organizers emphasize nonviolent action and are preparing for a significant turnout.  The protests follow recent tensions related to immigration enforcement and the deployment of National Guard troops.</p>
