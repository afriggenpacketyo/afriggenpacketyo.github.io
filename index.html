          <p>This opinion article posits that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), led by China, serves as a crucial remedy for the current weaknesses in the global multilateral system. The author contends that established institutions like the United Nations are being undermined by unilateralism and trade conflicts, creating a risk of global fragmentation. The SCO is presented as a platform that champions cooperation between nations with diverse political systems and ideologies. It is argued that the organization offers a necessary alternative to a world increasingly defined by sanctions and escalating conflicts.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, Vice President JD Vance participated in a solemn ceremony, escorting the casket onto Air Force Two in Salt Lake City, Utah. The flight returned Kirk's remains to his home state of Arizona for his funeral, which President Donald Trump has announced he will attend. The transfer occurred as federal authorities, including the FBI, continue a nationwide manhunt for the suspect responsible for the shooting at Utah Valley University. A significant reward has been offered for information that leads to an arrest.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, commenced with an unusual opening day. Routh, who is representing himself, delivered a rambling philosophical statement before being cut off by the judge for making a mockery of the court. Prosecutors presented their case, alleging a carefully crafted plot, and called several witnesses, including a Secret Service agent who discovered Routh at Trump's golf course. The agent testified that Routh aimed a weapon at him before he fired his own gun and the suspect fled.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from political figures across the ideological spectrum, including past and present presidents. President Trump mourned Kirk's death and blamed radical rhetoric for fostering political violence, while former presidents Biden, Obama, and Bush also issued statements denouncing the act. The event sparked a contentious scene on the House floor when a call for prayer led to shouting. Many leaders emphasized the need for civil discourse and a reduction in political vitriol to prevent such tragedies from recurring in the future.</p>

          <p>The father of Vadim Kruglov, a Russian man killed at the Burning Man festival, has publicly appealed to President Trump to assign the FBI to the investigation. Kruglov, 37, was found dead in a pool of blood on August 30, and the case is being handled as a homicide by the local Pershing County Sheriff’s Department. Citing a lack of progress ten days after the incident, the victim's father expressed concern that the investigation is being led by a single local sheriff. Friends of Kruglov have also taken to social media to call for a more robust federal response.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of plotting a military coup. The court ruled that Bolsonaro led a conspiracy to unlawfully remain in power after losing the 2022 election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The verdict also bars him from running for public office until 2033. The case has drawn international attention, with U.S. President Donald Trump criticizing the prosecution as a "witch hunt," a sentiment echoed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which prompted a sharp rebuke from Brazil's foreign ministry.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in the UK have raised concerns that a growing number of children are starting reception class without essential skills like being toilet-trained or speaking in full sentences. A survey of over 1,000 primary school teachers revealed that nine in ten have observed a decline in speech and language abilities among new students in the last two years. Experts suggest that social isolation and increased screen time may be contributing factors. Schools are increasingly having to allocate resources, sometimes at the expense of other programs, to provide extra support for these children to get them ready to learn.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child and baby nutritionist has provided five key tips to help parents manage mealtimes with fussy eaters, a common developmental phase for many children. The advice includes allowing children autonomy by letting them choose whether to eat, avoiding labeling foods as 'good' or 'bad,' and making mealtime an enjoyable social experience not solely focused on the food. Parents are also encouraged to be mindful of natural appetite fluctuations and to involve their children in food preparation to foster familiarity. The expert stresses that if a child is active and growing, they are likely getting enough nutrition.</p>

The record features instruments like the sitar and tabla, and a collaboration with Indian superstar Arjit Singh, reflecting Sheeran's efforts to engage authentically with different musical traditions. However, this article suggests that while these elements are present, they are often assimilated into his established brand of mainstream pop rather than defining the album. The review concludes that the record plays to his strengths but misses an opportunity for a more adventurous and deeply integrated cultural sound.</p>

The Danish model also focuses on patient experience, with colorful hospital interiors, counseling centers, and options for at-home chemotherapy.

Some lawmakers are canceling public events, with Rep. Nancy Mace stating she will now carry a firearm for her own protection. The ongoing manhunt for Kirk's killer contributes to the nationwide unease, prompting enhanced security at public venues like Yankee Stadium for a presidential visit.</p>

          <p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has dismissed Kevin Struthers, a senior director of music programming who had been with the institution for 30 years. His termination is the latest in a series of firings and resignations since President Trump became the center's chair and appointed Richard Grennell as its new president. Struthers was the administrative director for the center's jazz programming, which has seen its mainstage schedule reduced significantly. The former artistic director for jazz, Jason Moran, also departed in July, raising questions about the future of the genre at the prominent arts institution.</p>

The change allows for non-cabinet level nominees to be considered in batches rather than through individual votes, a move aimed at overcoming what Republicans describe as deliberate delays by Democrats. Senate Majority Leader John Thune argued the measure restores standard practice, enabling a president to assemble their team efficiently. Democrats, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, opposed the change, calling it an act of deference to the executive branch rather than a solution to obstruction.</p>

His comments come after Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in a year amid weak demand and high costs.

          <p>The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife has issued a warning about the northward migration of the invasive hammerhead worm. Originally from Asia, this destructive pest preys on essential earthworm populations and can be an irritant to humans and pets due to a toxin it secretes. Officials advise against squishing or cutting the worms, as this can cause them to multiply through regeneration. Instead, they recommend capturing the worms and either freezing them for 48 hours or drowning them in soapy water before disposal, and reporting sightings to citizen science platforms.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike targeting a Hamas office in Doha, Qatar, has shaken the long-standing security arrangements between the United States and its Persian Gulf allies. The attack, which killed several people, occurred despite Qatar hosting a major U.S. military base and having allowed Hamas officials to reside there at Washington's request. Gulf leaders expressed outrage, viewing the strike as a violation of sovereignty and evidence that a close military relationship with the U.S. does not guarantee protection from all threats, particularly from a key U.S. ally like Israel.

          <p>This article argues that President Trump and other conservatives are irresponsibly and inaccurately framing political violence as a problem exclusive to the left, particularly in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. The author points out that while the shooter's motive is unknown, data from the Center for Strategic and International Studies shows that far-right extremists have been responsible for the majority of domestic terrorism in recent decades. The piece contends that Trump's rhetoric has often incited or excused right-wing violence, such as the January 6th Capitol assault, and that his current narrative conveniently ignores this context to create a misleading and fearful political environment.</p>
