          <p>Late-night host Stephen Colbert strongly defended fellow host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show was suspended by ABC following controversial on-air comments. In his monologue, Colbert labeled President Trump an "autocrat" and described the network's action as "blatant censorship," expressing solidarity with Kimmel and his staff. The incident has ignited a broader debate among entertainers and politicians about free speech, media independence, and the perceived pressure from the current administration on corporate media outlets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show by ABC, President Donald Trump suggested that television networks critical of his administration should potentially have their broadcast licenses revoked. He claimed that networks were overwhelmingly negative in their coverage and questioned their right to a license. This statement has intensified the debate over freedom of the press, with legal experts noting the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has very limited authority to revoke licenses based on political content.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review in the United Kingdom has concluded that sanctions for doctors found guilty of sexual misconduct are too lenient in approximately a quarter of cases. The analysis of rulings by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) revealed instances where doctors received suspensions instead of being struck off the medical register, contrary to recommendations. The report highlighted inconsistencies and a lack of proper training, prompting calls for significant reforms to better protect patients and support victims of abuse.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Joy Crookes opened up about the personal struggles that shaped her second album, "Juniper," including a battle with severe anxiety and the end of an abusive relationship. She explained that the creative process involved letting go of perfectionism, which allowed for a more honest and emotionally raw musical expression. This journey of recovery and self-acceptance is a central theme of the album, which she describes as both euphoric and a sad reminder of the difficult times she overcame.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Current forecasts from the National Hurricane Center indicate that the storm will remain over open water for several days, tracking north of the Caribbean islands. While it poses no immediate threat to land, meteorologists predict Gabrielle could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend and potentially affect Bermuda early next week.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that the new CDC vaccine advisory committee, under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is strategically targeting vaccines with perceived risks to undermine the entire U.S. immunization schedule. The article posits that the recent votes concerning the MMRV and hepatitis B vaccines are not isolated decisions but calculated steps to sow public doubt in vaccine safety. This approach is seen as a way to build momentum for broader, more significant rollbacks of established public health policies.</p>

The new measure directs the State Department to report on the impact of these changes on its anti-trafficking mission.</p>
