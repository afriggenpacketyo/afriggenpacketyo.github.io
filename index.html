          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders rallied with New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in Brooklyn, drawing a large crowd to address the rising threat of oligarchic control and advocate for progressive policies. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, campaigns on freezing rent, increasing housing, and raising taxes for the wealthiest, garnering significant grassroots support. Sanders praised Mamdani's campaign as a "test case" for democracy against billionaire influence, also criticizing mainstream Democrats for their lack of support. The event highlighted progressive priorities, including Palestinian solidarity and immigrant legal representation, amidst the ongoing mayoral contest.</p>

          <p>During Michigan's 24-13 loss to Oklahoma, ESPN announcer Chris Fowler's praise for kicker Dominic Zvada's accuracy preceded a crucial 32-yard field goal miss, leading to a perceived "announcer jinx." Zvada, an All-American kicker, hooked the attempt left, failing to cut Oklahoma's lead. This incident added to a challenging night for Michigan, whose freshman quarterback Bryce Underwood struggled against a strong Sooners defense led by John Mateer. The Wolverines fell to a 1-1 record after the game.</p>

          <p>Overnight, Russia launched drone attacks on Ukraine, resulting in at least two deaths, including a one-year-old child, and multiple injuries across cities like Kyiv, Odesa, and Kharkiv, with falling debris causing fires. Concurrently, Ukrainian drones sparked a fire at an oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar, which was quickly extinguished with no casualties reported. Poland scrambled fighter jets to protect its airspace amid the raids. The ongoing conflict continues to involve deliberate targeting of civilian areas, hindering diplomatic peace efforts despite international pledges for post-war security.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman convicted of murder and arson in her husband Todd's death, speaks out for the first time after her conviction was overturned and then reinstated. Authorities allege she set their home on fire and then ran over Todd with a van as he escaped, an account Stermer denies, attributing it to "bad luck." Her sons suspect she drugged their father and ran him over, citing a rocky marriage and financial disputes, while her daughters maintain her innocence. The complex case, involving multiple trials and appeals, continues to divide the family and legal experts.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team from the US and China has developed an innovative method for launching millimetre-scale robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles suddenly collapse, they release a strong force capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. This study, published in Science, demonstrates cavitation as an efficient launching mechanism and also allows for controlling the robots' movement in water.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born boy who died at 15 from leukaemia, is set to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint in a ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Known as "God's influencer" for creating websites documenting miracles to spread Catholic teaching, Acutis was baptized in London in 1991 before moving to Italy. His canonisation was fast-tracked after two miracles were attributed to him, including the healing of a woman with breast cancer. His story, and his preserved body in Assisi, have drawn millions of pilgrims, with the Vatican hoping to inspire faith in young people.</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team experienced a disappointing 2-0 loss to South Korea, extending a period of poor results as the home World Cup approaches. Despite initial positive flashes, head coach Mauricio Pochettino's experimental side struggled with defensive communication and failed to capitalize on scoring chances. Son Heung-min scored the opening goal, highlighting the US team's disjointed play. While Pochettino maintained the team would be ready for the World Cup, the lackluster performance against a vibrant South Korean side has raised significant alarm bells regarding the team's form.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% after the Trump administration eliminated a tariff exemption for low-cost imports, according to the Universal Postal Union (UPU). This policy change, which ended the "de minimis exemption" for parcels valued at $800 or less, has caused major operational disruptions as carriers are unwilling or unable to collect new customs duties. Eighty-eight postal operators have suspended services to the US, impacting global trade and raising concerns about the lack of sufficient time and guidance for compliance with the new regulations (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, aiming to enhance security and streamline travel for non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. Starting October 12, the system will replace manual passport stamping, requiring first-time travelers to register biometric information via kiosks. While intended to make travel smoother, concerns have been raised about potential long queues during the initial registration phase, particularly at busy points like Dover and Eurostar terminals. The EES registration will be valid for three years.</p>

          <p>Officials are sounding alarms over the escalating threat of rising sea levels, which could inundate low-lying nations like Singapore, posing an existential risk. Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the "life and death matters" as sea levels are projected to rise up to 1.15 meters by 2100, potentially reaching 5 meters with storm surges. Human-caused activities are accelerating these events, jeopardizing homes, infrastructure, and vital resources. While some island nations consider relocation, Singapore is investing billions in coastal defenses and technological solutions, alongside global efforts to combat climate change.</p>
