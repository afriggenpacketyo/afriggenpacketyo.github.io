          <p>President Trump's major domestic policy bill allocates approximately $170 billion to enhance immigration enforcement, including funding for detention centers and additional ICE personnel. The legislation also provides over $46 billion for border wall construction and security initiatives. The bill introduces new and increased immigration fees, such as a $100 fee for asylum applications, and significantly curtails access to federal safety net programs like SNAP and Medicaid for many lawfully present immigrants. Critics express concern that these changes will create barriers to due process and increase food insecurity, while supporters argue the measures are necessary for border security and fiscal responsibility.</p>

Previously earning $100,000 in reality TV production, she now works 18 hours a week as a university teacher for about $30,000 annually, a salary she says allows her to "live large" in China. Her benefits include free health insurance, housing and travel stipends, and paid vacations, enabling her to save $1,000 per month, something she couldn't do in the U.S. Despite occasional cultural challenges, she feels safer and more self-confident, highlighting a stark contrast in quality of life.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has recalled the top U.S. diplomat from Bogotá, Colombia, citing "baseless and reprehensible statements" from senior Colombian officials. The move comes after Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleged that "right-wing extremists" were plotting to overthrow him, and his former foreign minister accused him of drug addiction. This diplomatic friction follows earlier clashes between the Trump and Petro administrations over the treatment of Colombian migrants on U.S. deportation flights. Despite the recall and other unspecified measures, the State Department affirmed that Colombia remains an essential strategic partner for regional security and stability.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tripadvisor surged by 17% following the disclosure that activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake of over 9% in the online travel company. The position is valued at approximately $160 million. Starboard Value is well-known for taking significant positions in companies to advocate for strategic changes, such as new leadership or cost-cutting measures. Tripadvisor, whose stock had been underperforming, acknowledged the investment and stated its commitment to engaging constructively with shareholders to drive long-term value. This development follows the company's announcement last year that it was exploring potential strategic options.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals a widespread and open trade in illegal cigarettes across UK high streets, particularly in cities like Hull, which is linked to international organized crime. These operations, often run from mini-marts, involve counterfeit and smuggled tobacco sold for a fraction of the legal price, costing the UK billions in lost tax revenue. Authorities are struggling to combat the issue due to underfunding, low penalties, and complex criminal networks that sometimes use trafficked individuals or illegal workers. Experts warn this visible criminality erodes public trust in law enforcement and government, symbolizing a broader national decline and potentially influencing political sentiment.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues against the modern interpretation of the Declaration of Independence as a document rooted solely in individualism and liberal rationalism. The author contends that the American founding was more of a conservative effort to restore the colonists' inherited political rights as Englishmen, a view shared by figures like John Adams and Edmund Burke. Furthermore, the famous proclamation that "all men are created equal" is not a universally self-evident truth, but one deeply embedded in the biblical inheritance of Western civilization, specifically the concept of man being created in God's image. The piece concludes that America's identity is more shaped by this political and biblical inheritance than by revolutionary fervor.</p>

The administration had argued that holding the men in Djibouti posed significant risks due to dangerous conditions.

The passage followed a tense overnight session where House leadership, with pressure from Trump, persuaded several Republican holdouts to support the measure.

The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, while figures for April and May were revised upward. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, and healthcare also saw significant gains. While the report is positive, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year, citing uncertainty over President Trump's tariff policies.

          <p>British number one Jack Draper has been unexpectedly knocked out of Wimbledon in the second round, losing to 36-year-old Croatian veteran Marin Cilic. Draper, who was considered a strong contender for the title, struggled against Cilic's powerful serve and deep returns, losing the match in four sets. This marks the fourth time the 23-year-old has failed to advance past the second round at the All England Club. In a post-match conference, an emotional Draper called it one of the toughest losses of his career but gave credit to Cilic for playing an "incredible match." The loss is a significant disappointment for British tennis hopes in the post-Andy Murray era.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed President Trump's signature "big, beautiful bill" with a 218-214 vote, sending the massive tax and spending package to his desk. The legislation, which includes increased funding for defense and immigration enforcement alongside deep cuts to Medicaid and other programs, secured passage after a marathon overnight session. Republican leadership, with direct engagement from President Trump, successfully pressured a handful of initial holdouts to vote in favor of the measure. Democrats strongly opposed the bill, with Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivering a record-breaking 8-hour, 44-minute speech on the House floor to condemn its contents before the final vote.</p>

          <p>The actor Michael Madsen, celebrated for his memorable roles in Quentin Tarantino films such as "Reservoir Dogs" and "Kill Bill," has died at the age of 67. He was reportedly found unresponsive in his Malibu home and is believed to have died of cardiac arrest. Madsen's career spanned four decades, during which he became known for portraying tough, often villainous characters, most famously the ear-slicing thief Mr. Blonde in "Reservoir Dogs." His sister, actress Virginia Madsen, remembered him as "thunder and velvet," a "poet disguised as an outlaw." He is survived by his four children.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, was killed by a stray bullet during a shooting in Washington D.C. on Monday night. Tarpinian-Jachym, an intern for Rep. Ron Estes, was not the intended target of the violence, which also injured a woman and a 16-year-old boy. Police believe the shooting stemmed from an altercation between two groups and have recovered the suspect vehicle. The FBI and ATF are assisting local police in the investigation, including enhancing grainy video footage to help identify the suspect, who remains at large.

          <p>Rescuers in Gaza report that at least 69 people were killed on Thursday as Israel intensified its bombardment across the territory. One airstrike on a school serving as a shelter in Gaza City killed 15 people, mostly women and children, while another 38 were reportedly killed while trying to access aid. The Israeli military stated it was targeting Hamas operatives and that reports of extensive casualties at aid sites were "lies." The violence continues as international pressure mounts on both Israel and Hamas to agree to a new 60-day ceasefire and hostage release deal proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, though significant obstacles to an agreement remain.</p>

          <p>Nissan is recalling over 480,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada because of a manufacturing defect that could cause engine failure while driving. The recall affects certain Altima, Rogue, and Infiniti QX50 and QX55 models equipped with specific 1.5L or 2.0L turbo engines. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly manufactured engine bearings can fail, potentially leading to a loss of power. Drivers may receive advance warning through abnormal engine noises or dashboard malfunction lights. Dealers will inspect the engines for metal debris and will repair or replace them free of charge, with owner notification letters being mailed in August.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a nearly hour-long phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. The call followed the White House's confirmation that it is pausing some weapons shipments to Ukraine due to concerns about dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. According to the Kremlin, the two leaders discussed the recent passage of Trump's major legislative bill, the Middle East, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. This conversation marks another point of direct contact between the leaders as the Trump administration navigates the complex geopolitical landscape of the continuing conflict, with the President scheduled to speak with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy on Friday.</p>

          <p>A new independent study led by researchers at the University of London estimates that over 80,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between October 2023 and January 2025. This figure, derived from household surveys conducted on the ground, is substantially higher than the official tally from the Hamas-run Gazan Ministry of Health. The research found that the ministry's records are not an exaggeration but rather a conservative minimum, particularly for women, children, and the elderly. The study distinguishes between violent deaths and "indirect" deaths from disease or starvation, concluding that the conflict has killed approximately 4% of Gaza's population, likely the highest percentage for any war in the 21st century.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued a formal apology for broadcasting a performance by the rap-punk group Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury festival, during which the band led the crowd in a chant of "Death to the IDF." The broadcaster's director-general expressed deep regret for the "offensive and deplorable behavior," particularly to the Jewish community, and announced new policies to keep "high risk" acts off live broadcasts. The controversial set prompted a criminal investigation by local police and resulted in the band's U.S. visas being revoked and their agency, UTA, reportedly dropping them. The band's singer defended the act as teaching children to speak up for change.</p>

          <p>The relationship between Russia and Azerbaijan is under considerable strain following a series of escalating diplomatic incidents. The crisis was triggered by a violent police raid in Yekaterinburg, Russia, that resulted in the deaths of two ethnic Azeri men, prompting swift condemnation from Baku. In an apparent retaliation, Azerbaijan arrested Russian journalists and other citizens, accusing them of various crimes. This row exacerbates tensions that have been simmering since an Azerbaijani passenger plane was shot down over Russia last year, an event that reportedly angered President Aliyev. Experts suggest Moscow is losing its traditional influence in the Caucasus as Baku takes a more assertive independent stance.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece, written by former State Department diplomats, argues that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is overseeing the destruction of the department's human rights infrastructure. The authors condemn a plan to shutter most offices in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), which they say will eliminate crucial expertise from foreign policy debates and undermine decades of bipartisan work. They contrast this with Rubio's past advocacy for human rights during his time in the Senate. The writers warn that this retreat from promoting global justice sends a dangerous message to the world and could empower hostile regimes, ultimately making Americans less safe.</p>

          <p>After securing multi-million dollar settlements from Meta and X (formerly Twitter) over his 2021 censorship lawsuit, President Trump is now in "productive discussions" with Google. Trump sued the tech giants for restricting his accounts after January 6th, alleging they violated his First Amendment rights at the behest of political leaders. Despite a court dismissing a similar case against X, the settlements from Meta ($25 million) and X ($10 million), largely for Trump's presidential library fund, have created pressure on Google. This situation highlights Trump's strategy of using the power of his office to compel private companies into settling lawsuits, regardless of their legal merit.</p>

          <p>India has taken firm control of the second Test against England, largely thanks to a monumental score of 269 from captain Shubman Gill. His epic innings, the highest by an Indian batter in England, powered the tourists to a massive first-innings total of 587. In response, England's top order collapsed under pressure from India's bowlers, slumping to 77-3 by the close of day two. The early dismissals of Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, and Zak Crawley have left the home side facing an immense challenge to save the match. England, known for improbable comebacks, will need an extraordinary effort to overcome the dominant position established by India.</p>

With nearly the entire population displaced and facing acute food insecurity, thousands of desperate people risk Israeli airstrikes and gunfire to access scarce supplies from aid trucks and distribution points. Hundreds have been killed near these sites in recent weeks, with charities accusing the Israeli military of using lethal force against unarmed civilians, a claim the IDF has denied while also acknowledging the need to reorganize aid access.</p>
