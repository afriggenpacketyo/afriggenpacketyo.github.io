            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for allegedly sharing classified information about a U.S. airstrike in Yemen via a private Signal group chat, which included his wife, brother, and personal attorney. This revelation follows a similar incident where Hegseth inadvertently included an Atlantic editor in another Signal chat discussing the same strike. The messages contained sensitive details such as flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets, raising concerns about the handling of classified military information by senior officials. The Pentagon has not yet commented on the matter, but these incidents raise serious questions about security protocols and the use of unauthorized communication channels.</p>

Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia, stated that the deportee is now in a more comfortable setting within the Centro Industrial detention facility. The White House and President Trump have strongly criticized Van Hollen's actions, asserting Garcia's gang ties and highlighting the case amidst broader debates on immigration and border security. Garcia also has a record of domestic abuse. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," non-sexual unions driven by practical considerations like social security benefits and familial expectations, are gaining traction. A Tokyo-based agency reports over 300 such marriages in the last decade, with couples seeking companionship and societal acceptance without romantic or sexual involvement. These marriages often involve individuals with differing sexual orientations who find common ground in shared values and life goals. While some view these arrangements as a "desperate measure" due to the lack of legal same-sex marriage recognition, they reflect a growing acceptance of diverse relationship models in a society still grappling with traditional norms.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" that was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which has now expired. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian troops had violated the ceasefire nearly 3,000 times since the start of Sunday. Russia's defence ministry said it had "repelled" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. US President Donald Trump said that "hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week", without giving further details. Despite the announced ceasefire, both sides reported continued attacks, indicating the fragile nature of any potential peace agreement.</p>

This decision reflects a focus on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The PBOC's move comes after China reported stronger-than-expected economic data for the first quarter, providing room to keep rates steady. The hold was in line with expectations from economists, and the yuan traded flat following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

Paredes claims he and others were forced to sign papers stating they are part of a gang, which the ACLU corroborates with a document titled "Notice and Warrant of Apprehension and Removal under the Alien Enemies Act." Trump administration officials assert Paredes is a member of Tren de Aragua, citing a prior arrest for pointing a firearm, while his mother denies these allegations.

            <p>Sarmad Ghaled Dafar, a Texas man, has been sentenced for trafficking six vulnerable Mexican baby spider monkeys into San Diego and selling them on Facebook. The monkeys, too young to be separated from their mothers, were intercepted by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents, leading to Dafar's conviction. The crime is not only illegal due to primate ownership restrictions in California but also harmful to the endangered species, disrupting ecosystems and posing public health risks. The confiscated monkeys are now housed at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, while Dafar faces custody, home confinement, and restitution payments.</p>

            <p>As the United States escalates economic warfare against China, Beijing recognizes that America's strategic goal is to systematically hinder China's economic rise. Instead of focusing on trade rebalancing, the U.S. has imposed strict export controls, particularly on advanced technology, limiting China's access to key American products like semiconductors. To counter this, China is focusing on resolving its internal economic weaknesses, particularly the fragmentation of its domestic market. By strengthening its inner balance and core strength, China aims to overcome the challenges posed by Trump's tariffs and emerge as a faster, leaner, and stronger economy.</p>

            <p>Despite government efforts to expand "free hours" for childcare in England, parents continue to struggle with access and affordability. The rollout of 30 hours of childcare per week for eligible working parents has not been the panacea many hoped for, with nursery places increasingly difficult to find, especially in deprived areas. Private nurseries are facing rising operating costs, and some may pull out of the scheme. Eligibility requirements also exclude some families, widening the gap between those who can access subsidized childcare and those who cannot.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court directed the Trump administration to halt removals until further notice, ensuring those facing deportation have a chance to argue their case in court. The ACLU contends that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the AEA without providing adequate due process. The White House maintains the individuals are "foreign terrorists," while Justices Thomas and Alito dissented from the ruling.</p>

            <p>The WWF and Pakistan's Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) have developed AI-powered cameras to detect snow leopards and warn villagers via text message to move livestock to safety. Testing 10 cameras in Gilgit-Baltistan, the project aims to reduce retaliatory killings of snow leopards, which contribute to their declining population. The AI model differentiates between humans, other animals, and snow leopards with impressive accuracy. Challenges include community buy-in, cultural sensitivities, and technological hurdles in the rugged terrain, but attitudes in the community are changing.</p>
