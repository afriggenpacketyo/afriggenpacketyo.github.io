        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New evidence suggests legendary Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," murdered his wife Pauline in 1967. The investigation, reopened in 2022, found inconsistencies in Pusser's original account of an ambush, with forensic analysis indicating the crime scene was staged and his own gunshot wound was likely self-inflicted. Pauline's body was exhumed, revealing trauma inconsistent with the original story and a previously healed nasal fracture suggesting prior abuse. Officials believe they would have had enough probable cause to indict Pusser, who died in 1974, providing long-awaited closure for his wife's family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea has unexpectedly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision was prompted by a serious hamstring injury to fellow striker Liam Delap during Chelsea's match against Fulham, leaving the team with only one fit striker. The sudden reversal has reportedly angered Jackson, though attempts may be made to salvage the deal. This development highlights Chelsea's precarious striker situation despite significant spending on attacking players.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated rematch, the third-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the top-ranked Texas Longhorns 14-7 in Columbus. Texas quarterback Arch Manning struggled in his first career road start against a formidable Ohio State defense, completing 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards, with most of his yardage coming late in the game. The Longhorns' offense was repeatedly stopped on fourth down, failing to convert three critical attempts, including one at the goal line. The victory solidifies Ohio State's position as a top contender, while Texas will look to rebound in upcoming games.</p>

          <p>Manchester United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley with a stoppage-time penalty, but the win failed to conceal persistent goalkeeping problems under manager Ruben Amorim. Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir made a critical error leading to Burnley's second goal, continuing a trend of mistakes from United's keepers in recent matches. The article suggests these ongoing issues are a primary reason for the club's interest in signing Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens. The narrow win provides temporary relief but underscores the significant challenges Amorim faces, including new injuries to key players.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid concerns about a potential deployment of federal agents by the Trump administration. The order prohibits city departments from participating in federal enforcement actions that violate rights, and it demands that federal agents in Chicago be clearly identifiable and not wear masks. Johnson stated he has received "highly credible reports" of an imminent deployment, prompting this preemptive measure to ensure accountability and protect the right to peaceful protest.

          <p>Details have emerged about the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, where a 23-year-old gunman killed two children, aged 8 and 10, and injured 18 others during a school Mass. The shooter, identified as Robin Westman, fired a rifle through church windows before dying by suicide inside. Westman, a former student at the attached school, had legally purchased three guns and reportedly had an obsession with past mass shootings, leaving behind anti-Catholic and other hateful writings. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs," which affect a wide range of goods from most countries, are illegal because he overstepped his presidential authority. The court found that the power to impose such broad tariffs resides with Congress, not the executive branch under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. However, the ruling does not affect sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum or tariffs imposed on China during his first term. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

Starting in September, this grace period ends, and Gold Star and Business members may be denied entry before 10 a.m. The policy has drawn criticism from some customers who feel it alienates a large portion of the membership base, though Costco states it is a reward for its most loyal members.</p>

          <p>Experts continue to debate the exact amount of screen time that is safe for children, but a consensus exists around precautionary principles tied to developmental stages. For the youngest children (under 3), most German experts recommend no screen time to allow for sensory and motor skill development, while the WHO suggests a maximum of one hour for children aged two and up. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication, ensuring digital interaction doesn't replace crucial real-world social experiences and imaginative play.

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump stated that a trilateral meeting involving the US, Ukraine, and Russia "will happen" but expressed doubt about a bilateral meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also indicated he would be open to using U.S. planes as part of a security guarantee to help end the war, emphasizing that European allies would primarily be responsible. Separately, the administration's expanded use of expedited removal for deportations was blocked by a federal judge, who ruled the process unlawful for lacking due process.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

          <p>Many vulnerable Afghans who fled the Taliban to Pakistan are facing the threat of deportation back to Afghanistan while they await entry into Germany. These individuals, including those who worked for German organizations, had been promised admission but have been stuck in limbo for years due to slow processing and a recent freeze on entries. Despite Germany announcing it will resume admissions after court rulings deemed its commitments legally binding, a Pakistani deadline for a pause on deportations is expiring, leaving thousands living in constant fear of being arrested and sent back to danger.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. A UK study involving over 12,000 patients in GP surgeries showed the device significantly improved detection rates compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope analyzes subtle sounds in the heartbeat that the human ear cannot discern and cross-references them with a large patient database. Experts believe this technology could be a "game-changer" for early diagnosis and treatment, with plans for a wider rollout.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair, offers a more polished and emotionally grounded take on the Troma original. Starring Peter Dinklage as a janitor who becomes a mutant hero after being thrown into toxic sludge, the film retains the gore and parody of the source material but with a higher production value. The review suggests that while the film is a diverting and well-made homage, its slickness and sincerity might feel at odds with the deliberately cheap and tasteless spirit of the original Troma movie.</p>

          <p>The term "red pill," originating from the 1999 film "The Matrix," has evolved from an internet meme into a global political ideology rooted in anti-feminism and male insecurity. Initially used in online forums for "pick-up artists" and men's rights activists, the concept has expanded into the "manosphere," where misogynistic views and conspiracy theories are common. The ideology has been amplified by social media algorithms and figures like Andrew Tate, and its language has seeped into mainstream conservative discourse, raising concerns about its influence on young men and its connection to extremist worldviews.</p>
