          <h2>Exploring the Rising Rates and Shifting Definitions of Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:19:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the significant increase in autism diagnoses over the past two decades, examining the factors contributing to this rise. The article highlights that the expansion of diagnostic criteria, including the addition of Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS, has broadened the scope of what is considered autism. Additionally, increased awareness and research have led to better recognition of autism in women and adults, who were historically underdiagnosed. The piece also touches on the tensions within the autistic community regarding the diverse presentations of autism and the varying levels of support needed. Optimism score is based on a general understanding of the shifting nature of autism and the efforts to better understand and support individuals with autism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is planning a significant reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), signaling major staff cuts, especially in the scientific research arm. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin aims to reduce staffing to levels similar to the 1980s, potentially impacting the Office of Research and Development, which provides scientific analysis on environmental hazards. This reorganization has raised concerns among experts, who fear it could undermine research and put the country at greater risk by splitting up expertise and potentially cutting the research budget by 45%. Zeldin claims the changes will save $300 million by 2026, but scientific staff worry about the impact on independent assessments of environmental contaminants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The trial of two men accused of felling the famous Sycamore Gap tree in northern England has revealed key evidence presented to the jury. Prosecutors allege that Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers carried out the "moronic mission," with one felling the tree while the other filmed it. Cell site analysis and automatic number plate recognition data tracked the movements of Graham's phone and car to the site. Graham testified that Carruthers felled the tree without his knowledge, while Carruthers denies ever felling a tree. The felling sparked international outrage, with the defendants allegedly "revelling in" the reaction before their friendship unraveled.</p>

          <p>Canada's Conservatives are facing internal division and blame following their recent election loss. Despite leading in opinion polls, the party failed to win the election for the fourth consecutive time. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre lost his own seat, raising questions about his leadership. The party is now trying to determine how to move forward without their leader in the House. Some Conservatives blame Ontario leader Doug Ford for betraying the movement, while others feel Poilievre needs to confront the party's shortcomings.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will cancel 35 roundtrip flights a day from its Newark Liberty International Airport schedule after significant flight disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby attributes the disruptions to air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems. The flight cuts amount to about 10% of United's daily schedule at its Newark hub. Kirby is urging the FAA to control capacity at the airport by establishing flight restrictions. The FAA acknowledged staffing issues were delaying operations at Newark.

This could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites. The research focused on elapids, such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans, and kraits.
