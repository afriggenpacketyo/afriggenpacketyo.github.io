          <p>Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, expects more "embarrassing" past exchanges between himself and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to be made public, following a recently released letter calling Epstein his "best pal." Mandelson expressed deep regret over the friendship, describing it as an "albatross around my neck" and conveyed profound sympathy for Epstein's victims. He stated he was "taken in" by Epstein's charismatic deception and never witnessed any wrongdoing during their association, which he attributes partly to being a gay man. Downing Street affirmed confidence in Mandelson, citing his role in strengthening US-UK trade and securing UK jobs.</p>

          <p>Morningstar has launched the PitchBook US Modern Market 100 Index, the first benchmark to combine public and private equity exposure, aiming to reflect evolving investment opportunities in the modern asset universe. This index tracks 100 large US companies, with a 90/10 split between public and venture-backed firms like OpenAI and Stripe, recognizing that dynamic companies increasingly remain private longer. The benchmark offers a new framework for investors to gauge performance across both asset classes, despite challenges in pricing private securities and the inherent risks associated with growth companies. Morningstar believes it provides a fuller picture of the innovation economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland accused Moscow of "unprecedented" aggression after its airspace was violated by a "huge number" of Russian drones during an attack on Ukraine, prompting NATO air defenses to scramble and shoot down several objects. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described the incident as an "act of aggression" that posed a real threat and is in constant communication with NATO, which activated its defenses and deployed allied aircraft. This incident, described as the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, has led Poland to seriously consider invoking Article 4 of the NATO treaty, indicating a significant escalation.</p>

          <p>Poland's airspace was breached by multiple Russian drones during a major attack on Ukraine, prompting an "unprecedented violation" declaration and the scrambling of Polish and NATO air defenses to shoot them down. This incident, the first time Poland engaged assets in its airspace since the war began, has intensified calls from European leaders for more sanctions against Russia, with Ukrainian officials warning Russia is "testing the West." Additionally, the article notes US President Donald Trump has asked the EU to impose tariffs on China and India over their Russian oil purchases, linking the regional conflict to broader global trade pressures and airport closures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contactless card payments in the UK are poised for a significant change, with new proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) allowing banks and providers to set unlimited transaction limits, potentially making PIN entry a rarity for larger purchases. This move aims to align card payments with digital wallets on smartphones, reflecting ongoing shifts in consumer payment methods. Despite consumer preference for current limits and concerns about theft and fraud, the FCA emphasizes that card providers would bear the burden of any fraudulent activity through enhanced detection systems, while customers could also set their own lower limits.

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company behind Wegovy and Ozempic, plans to cut 9,000 jobs, representing 11% of its global workforce, in response to intensifying competition and an evolving weight-loss drug sector. This strategic move, led by new CEO Mike Doustdar, aims to achieve 8 billion Danish kroner (£927m) in cost savings by the end of next year. The company faces increasing pressure from rivals like Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro, and the emergence of "knock-off" drugs, necessitating a significant restructuring to maintain its market position and growth opportunities amidst a more consumer-driven market.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic, the NBA superstar, is highlighted as the polarizing cornerstone of the Slovenian national basketball team, celebrated for his exceptional offensive prowess in scoring and playmaking. Despite his undeniable talent, Doncic faces criticism for defensive shortcomings and frequent on-court complaining, which reportedly contributed to his controversial trade from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers. Now with the Lakers, he has signed a new $165 million contract and is reportedly motivated to enhance his fitness, aiming to lead Slovenia to a second European Championship after their 2017 victory.</p>

          <p>An exhibition titled "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau" delves into the cultural legacy of East Germany's prefabricated concrete residential blocks, known as "Plattenbau," exploring their role as both a symbol of socialist utopia and a site of post-reunification "painful transformation." The Potsdam exhibition examines the collective memory associated with these structures, which once housed nearly a quarter of the GDR's population. It highlights how these buildings, initially a modern housing solution, later became linked to social despair and extremism after 1989, and are now being re-evaluated as significant architectural and cultural heritage.</p>

The new entity will retain individual university names and campuses but operate under a single vice-chancellor, with no immediate plans for job losses despite recent cuts at both institutions, offering a model for future collaborations.</p>
