          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas was arrested for his alleged involvement in an illegal gambling ring operating out of a California mansion he owned. Prosecutors claim Arenas and five co-conspirators, including a suspected member of an Israeli organized crime group, ran high-stakes poker games from September 2021 to July 2022. Arenas faces charges of conspiracy, operating an illegal gambling business, and making false statements, to which he has pleaded not guilty. This incident adds to a history of off-court issues for the former basketball player, who was previously charged with felony gun possession in 2010.</p>

          <p>Brown University has reached a deal with the Trump administration to restore millions in frozen federal research grants. In exchange, the university agreed to donate $50 million to local workforce programs and make commitments regarding women's sports, antisemitism, and admissions. The agreement specifies that female student-athletes will have sex-segregated locker rooms and that the school will not offer racial preferences in admissions, a practice already barred by the Supreme Court. Brown's president stated the deal was necessary to end a financially painful grant freeze and preserves the university's academic integrity.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to uncertainty over auto tariffs, now projecting a net impact of $2 billion from these levies. The automaker's second-quarter revenue surpassed expectations, though its stock saw a decline in after-hours trading. The new guidance adjusts the company's expected earnings before interest and taxes to a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion. Ford's CFO mentioned constructive, near-daily communications with the Trump administration, particularly concerning steel and aluminum tariffs, as the company navigates the complex trade environment.

          <p>Shares of chip technology firm Arm Holdings fell after its first-quarter earnings report revealed that revenue from smartphone royalties was weaker than anticipated. While overall earnings and revenue were largely in line with analyst expectations, the company's net income saw a significant 42% drop compared to the previous year. CEO Rene Haas confirmed that Arm is considering designing its own processors or chiplets, a strategic shift that could position it as a competitor to its current customers. The company noted that while tariffs have limited direct impact, they create uncertainty for end-product demand. (not investment advice)</p>

The company disclosed that Azure and other cloud services generated over $75 billion in revenue for the fiscal year, a 34% increase. This achievement highlights Microsoft's significant gains from the artificial intelligence boom, placing it ahead of Apple in market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken the rare step of filing a judicial misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the president's deportation policies. The complaint accuses the judge of making improper public comments about the administration and criticizes his handling of a case involving deported Venezuelan migrants. Legal experts suggest the complaint, particularly the parts concerning judicial rulings, may be misdirected, as appeals are the standard recourse. The move initiates a complex review process and reflects the administration's increasingly confrontational stance toward the judiciary.</p>

The dismissal was based on a lack of significant action in the case over a six-month period, although Baldwin's lawyers have 30 days to file a motion to revive it.

By focusing on realistic, high-stakes workplace challenges rather than escapist fantasy, these programs resonate with viewers' own daily pressures.

The decision is motivated by the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements, which Carney stated are eroding the viability of a two-state solution.

          <p>High Noon has issued a product recall for some of its Beach Variety 12-packs because they may contain Celsius energy drink cans that were mistakenly filled with High Noon's vodka seltzer. The packaging error, traced to a supplier, poses a health and safety risk as it could lead to the unintentional consumption of alcohol, especially by those who avoid it. The affected products were distributed in late July across several states, including Florida, Michigan, and New York. The company is urging consumers to discard any misplaced cans and is offering refunds for the error.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is launching a new initiative with major tech companies like Google and Amazon to encourage millions of Americans to upload their personal health data to new apps and systems. The program aims to provide easier access to medical records and improve wellness monitoring for conditions like diabetes, but it has raised significant privacy concerns. Digital privacy advocates worry about the potential for misuse and monetization of sensitive health information, given the limited federal regulation of health apps. Officials state that patient participation will be opt-in and data will be kept secure.</p>

          <p>This opinion article champions several independent Latin artists who, despite producing some of the most creative and progressive music of the year, are likely to be overlooked by the Latin Grammy Awards. The piece highlights six artists, including Argentina's Juana Aguirre and Chile's Gepe, arguing their innovative work deserves consideration in major categories like Album of the Year, not just niche alternative fields. It makes a case for celebrating musicians who are advancing the genre without the support of major record labels. The author suggests that their forward-facing, self-produced albums represent the cutting edge of Latin music.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary series, NFL legend Tom Brady, a minority owner of Birmingham City Football Club, is shown questioning the work ethic of former manager Wayne Rooney. During a visit to the club's training ground in November 2023, Brady expressed his concerns to colleagues, saying he didn't have "great instincts" on Rooney's commitment. The series captures awkward exchanges between the two and shows Brady's disappointment with the team's performance under Rooney, whose tenure lasted only 83 days as the club's standing plummeted. Brady also described the players at the time as "lazy and entitled."</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Americans' views of the national economy have improved slightly, though they remain net negative. This uptick is partly tied to more positive ratings of the stock market, which higher-income individuals are more likely to say impacts their finances. However, the overall outlook is clouded by widespread expectation of future price increases, with two-thirds of Americans believing prices will go up. This concern is influencing spending plans, as half of the country, particularly those at lower income levels, intend to cut back on discretionary purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Trump administration's strategy to disengage from global conflicts to focus solely on containing China has largely failed. Six months into a second term, the administration finds itself more deeply entangled in Europe and the Middle East than anticipated. Instead of ending the Ukraine war, the U.S. has escalated its military support due to domestic and allied pressure. Similarly, strikes against Iran have deepened involvement in the Middle East, diverting military and diplomatic resources that were intended for a pivot to Asia, ultimately giving Beijing more strategic breathing room.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on imported copper pipes, tubes, and other semi-finished products, a move intended to protect national security. However, the levy notably excludes raw copper materials like ores, concentrates, and cathodes, falling short of the sweeping restrictions that were initially anticipated by the market. This targeted approach aids U.S. manufacturers but offers little support to the domestic copper mining industry. Following the announcement, U.S. copper prices dropped significantly as the policy was less restrictive than feared, unwinding a recent premium over the global benchmark. (not investment advice)</p>

Running for and serving as governor would have made a simultaneous presidential bid practically and politically difficult, as she would have needed to assure California voters of her full commitment to the state. While she would enter a 2028 Democratic primary with high name recognition, she would also face a potentially large field and carry the political baggage of the 2024 election loss. The decision avoids a potential gubernatorial primary against fellow Californian Gavin Newsom.</p>
