          <p>Elon Musk's brief but eventful 129-day stint at the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) under President Trump has concluded, marked by significant spending cuts and considerable controversy. Musk aimed to slash trillions in federal spending, ultimately claiming $175 billion in savings through various measures, including workforce reductions and asset sales; however, a BBC analysis questions the validity of some figures. His tenure was marred by instances of mass firings, data access disputes, and accusations of spreading misinformation. The presence of an unelected official with significant business interests also raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding potential conflicts of interest with his companies like SpaceX and Tesla. Optimism regarding the long-term benefits of his actions is tempered by the concerns raised during his time in office.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that U.S.-China trade talks have stalled, requiring direct intervention from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Despite a recent agreement in Switzerland to roll back tariff increases, disagreements persist over tech restrictions and rare earth regulations. Bessent expressed confidence that China will engage constructively once President Trump makes his preferences known. The leaders last spoke in January, and analysts believe China will only agree to another call if the U.S. provides assurance of no surprises during the discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's ruling that deemed President Trump's global tariffs illegal, allowing the administration to continue collecting import taxes for now. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly questioned the president's authority and jeopardized trade negotiations. The initial ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade would have voided tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, as well as a blanket 10% import tax on goods from other countries. While the White House is focused on challenging the court rulings, the matter is widely expected to end up at the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A senior Hamas official has stated that the Palestinian armed group will reject the latest US proposal for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. While the White House claimed Israel has "signed off" on the plan, Hamas says it does not satisfy core demands, including an end to the war. The proposal reportedly involves a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Hamas maintains that the offer lacks guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and a return to the previous humanitarian protocol.</p>
