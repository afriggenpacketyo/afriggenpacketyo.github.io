Israel's Foreign Ministry stated that the activists are being taken to Tel Aviv airport for deportation to their home countries. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which operated the vessel, confirmed the activists are in Israeli custody and may be flown out of Tel Aviv soon, while Israel maintains that its blockade on Gaza is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas fighters there.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in European regulations to smuggle ketamine, a legal medicine in some countries, into the black market. Customs officers have discovered cases where legitimate shipments of ketamine were replaced with salt or sugar during transit across multiple borders. The article highlights the case of a consignment switch at Brussels Airport, where a tonne of medical ketamine was replaced with salt after being verified in the Netherlands. The BBC investigation reveals that criminal organizations are profiting more from ketamine than from drugs like cocaine, as ketamine consumption has risen significantly, leading to concerns about abuse and health consequences.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address elevated rice prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, expecting the 2020 rice to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, as the government aims to deliver the stockpiled rice quickly to consumers at lower prices. The decision comes amid public frustration over rising rice prices, which have doubled compared to the previous year.</p>

The fight was instigated by Trent Federic's actions against Sam Bennett, leading to multiple game misconducts and ejections. The Panthers responded to the Oilers' physicality with a power-play goal and strong offensive play, including a goal from Brad Marchand, who became the oldest player in NHL history to score in each of the first three Stanley Cup Finals games. The article highlights the intensity and physicality of the game, as well as the Panthers' dominant performance.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about potential UK "complicity" in Israel's conduct in Gaza were told they could consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff had questioned the UK's continued arms sales and what they called a "stark‚Ä¶ disregard for international law" by Israel. Senior civil servants responded that while the department wanted to see "healthy challenge", resignation was an "honourable course" for those with profound disagreements over government policy. This response has been met with frustration and disappointment, with some officials feeling that the space for challenging government policy is being further restricted.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a report warning of an unprecedented decline in global fertility rates, citing financial limitations and lack of suitable partners as key factors. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries, finding that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The report emphasizes that many people feel unable to create the families they want due to the prohibitive costs of parenthood. This marks a shift in the UN's focus, as it previously concentrated on women having more children than desired and the unmet need for contraception.</p>

          <p>Gregory Hunt is scheduled to be executed in Alabama for the 1988 beating death of Karen Lane, marking the state's sixth execution using nitrogen gas. Hunt was convicted of killing Lane, his girlfriend, after sexually assaulting her in her apartment. His final request for a stay of execution focused on claims that prosecutors made false statements to jurors about evidence of sexual assault, which elevated the crime to a capital offense. Hunt, while not disputing the killing, maintains he did not sexually assault Lane and describes himself as a changed man who has led a Bible class in prison.</p>

          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2 billion of investment to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline. Sizewell C will create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the landmark decision would kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary to usher in a golden age of clean energy. The government insists that nuclear power provides enormous amounts of low-carbon, non-intermittent energy, which forms a crucial part of the government's plans to almost completely eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030.</p>

          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have seen a massive reduction, with a 47% drop in overdose risk for those aged 20 to 29. Provisional CDC data shows that fatal overdoses among people under 35 plummeted from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens and young adults.
