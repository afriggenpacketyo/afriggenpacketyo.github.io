          <p>President Trump held a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which occurred shortly after the White House confirmed a temporary halt on some weapons shipments to Ukraine. The pause in military aid was attributed to concerns about dwindling U.S. military stockpiles following a Pentagon review. According to the Kremlin, the leaders discussed the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle East during their nearly hour-long call. Trump, who has expressed frustration with the ongoing conflict, is also scheduled to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

The research, conducted independently through household surveys, suggests the Gazan Ministry of Health's figures are a conservative minimum rather than an exaggeration. The study also tallied thousands of "indirect" deaths from disease and malnutrition, highlighting the conflict's devastating and broad impact on the civilian population.

In response, the BBC is implementing new policies for live festival coverage, including keeping "high risk" acts off live broadcasts.

Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce saw further reductions. Despite the strong report, economists remain cautious, expecting growth to slow in the second half of the year due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade and fiscal policy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent U.S. decision to pause a shipment of arms to Ukraine, including critical air defense missiles, highlights the precarious nature of Kyiv's military support. While the U.S. State Department described it as a "one-off" event, analysts believe any long-term reduction in American aid would severely undermine Ukraine's ability to defend against Russia. The move comes at a critical time as Russia intensifies its attacks. European allies have increased their support, but they cannot easily replace certain advanced U.S. weapons systems, leaving Ukraine vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" championed by President Trump delivers a major victory for the fossil fuel industry while undermining the renewable energy sector. The law opens more federal lands to oil and gas drilling, slashes royalty payments, and ends long-standing tax credits for solar and wind power. These changes are expected to curtail the growth of clean energy, which has relied heavily on federal incentives. Clean energy industry leaders warn that the legislation threatens America's manufacturing comeback and could lead to factory closures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" explores the life and career of celebrated sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa, but the film is critiqued for emphasizing his global brand over his culinary genius. The review notes that the documentary offers a gentle chronological account of Matsuhisa's rise but spends little time analyzing the unique experience of dining at his restaurants. While featuring celebrity investors like Robert De Niro and famous patrons like Cindy Crawford, the film is said to feel more like a commercial for the Nobu enterprise than an intimate portrait of the artist.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the tax cuts in President Trump's major legislative bill disproportionately benefit the wealthiest U.S. households. The top 1% of earners nationwide are projected to receive an average tax cut of about $66,000. However, the benefits are even more pronounced in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming and Texas, where the top 1% could see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000. The legislation's structure clearly favors high-income individuals in low-tax states. (not investment advice)</p>
