            <p>Royal Air Force Typhoon jets were scrambled to intercept two Russian aircraft flying near NATO airspace over the Baltic Sea. The incidents occurred on April 15th and 17th, with the RAF jets taking off from Malbork Air Base in Poland. The first intercept involved a Russian Ilyushin Il-20M intelligence aircraft, while the second involved an unidentified aircraft leaving the Kaliningrad airspace. These intercepts marked the RAF's first actions since arriving in the region to bolster NATO's eastern flank, working alongside Sweden to enhance air policing efforts.</p>

            <p>The construction industry, traditionally male-dominated, is exploring new technologies like AI and robotics to attract more women. German construction company LAT uses a robotic dog equipped with cameras and sensors to automate data collection on construction sites, reducing the need for manual documentation. This digitization aims to make construction jobs less physically demanding and more appealing, particularly for women who often find it challenging to balance work with family life. Other advancements include AI-powered image recognition for billing and BIM (Building Information Modeling) platforms to simplify communication and reduce conflicts on construction sites.</p>

            <p>Two Mexican nationals were arrested in Canon City, Colorado, after a traffic stop revealed they were transporting 180,000 rounds of ammunition. Caesar Ramon Martinez Solis and Humberto Ivan Amador Gavira, both in the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas, were stopped for traffic violations, leading to the discovery of the ammunition. Martinez Solis claimed they purchased the ammunition in Salt Lake City and were transporting it to Pueblo, Colorado, but authorities are still investigating the intended destination. Both men have been charged with unlawful possession of ammunition by an alien admitted under a nonimmigrant visa, and the investigation is part of Operation Take Back America.</p>

            <p>German authorities are seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens for alleged actions at pro-Palestinian protests in Berlin. The individuals, two from Ireland, one from Poland, and one from the United States, have been served with deportation orders connected to a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. Lawyers for the protesters are appealing the deportation orders, citing concerns about potential clashes with EU law regarding freedom of movement. The deportation orders reference Germany's Staatsräson, emphasizing the country's responsibility toward Israel, which has raised concerns about the use of a political concept to justify deportation.</p>

            <p>As retirement approaches, it's crucial to protect savings from market volatility, including potential impacts from tariff policies. Financial advisors recommend rebalancing portfolios to align with risk tolerance, potentially shifting towards a 60/40 stock-bond allocation. Building cash reserves to cover two years of income can help avoid selling investments during market downturns, mitigating sequence of returns risk. Considering a bond ladder, where bonds mature at different intervals, can also provide a steady income stream and reduce interest rate risk (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Amid recession fears and tariff anxieties, analysts suggest considering dividend stocks to stabilize investment portfolios. Energy Transfer (ET) offers a 7.5% dividend yield and is favored for its diversified cash flow and potential gains from Waha price spreads. The Williams Companies (WMB), another midstream energy player, recently raised its dividend by 5.3% and is expected to benefit from long-term AI/data center growth. These stocks are viewed as capable of withstanding short-term challenges and consistently generating solid cash flows (not investment advice).</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>As the US and China engage in a trade war, China should consider requiring bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi. This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate, challenging the US dollar's dominance. With strong manufacturing capabilities, China can support considerable trade volume with the US, forcing the US to buy Chinese currency. A rapid appreciation in the renminbi would signal strong economic fundamentals, encouraging global investors to increase their holdings of renminbi assets.</p>

The expert argues that these actions disregard the lessons learned from past disasters like Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon, potentially leading to devastating consequences for communities and the economy.

This move is seen as part of a broader effort to undermine and control higher education, reminiscent of McCarthyism and authoritarian tactics.

Despite warnings from economic experts, Hitler prioritized agricultural tariffs, aiming to liberate Germany from a globalized world order. These tariffs led to trade wars with neighboring countries, damaging the German economy and foreshadowing his later military aggression.

            <p>The author argues that the US is currently ill-prepared for its trade war with China and risks strengthening China's geopolitical position and economy while diminishing its own. China has spent years preparing for economic conflict, reducing its dependence on US imports and developing offensive economic weapons. A US victory would require a coalition of allies and coordinated economic mobilization, which the Trump administration has failed to build.
