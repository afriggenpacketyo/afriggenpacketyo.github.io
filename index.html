          <p>Meta is poised to unveil its Hypernova smart glasses, featuring a digital display in the right lens, and a companion wristband for gesture control at its upcoming Connect conference. Developed in partnership with EssilorLuxottica and expected to cost around $800, these glasses offer limited visual content like text messages and utilize sEMG sensor technology for user input. This launch marks Meta's first consumer-ready glasses with a display, signifying a deeper push into augmented reality and wearables. Despite past losses in its Reality Labs unit, the company is also seeking developers for experimental AI apps to generate excitement for the new device.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to diversify its broadcast partnerships and expand its reach. NBC is set to acquire Sunday night games and wild-card playoffs for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure the Home Run Derby rights for about $50 million. ESPN will receive a new $550 million package, including MLB TV and local team in-market games, despite previously seeking to reduce its payments. These three-year deals, expiring after the 2028 season, reflect MLB's strategy to enhance both monetary and viewership opportunities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is moving to eliminate collective bargaining rights for thousands of its federal employees, a controversial action unions deem illegal. This initiative, confirmed by HHS officials, includes ending union recognition and reclaiming office space, extending a Trump administration effort previously seen at the VA and EPA. The American Federation of Government Employees argues that strong union contracts are vital for a stable and experienced workforce, especially in public health emergencies. Affected agencies include the CDC, FDA, NIH, and other critical health and family services offices.</p>

          <p>A tourist bus carrying 52 passengers from Niagara Falls crashed on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, resulting in multiple fatalities, including at least one child. The bus reportedly rolled after losing control, ejecting unbelted passengers as windows shattered, and trapping many in the wreckage. Over 40 people received treatment for injuries ranging from head trauma to broken limbs, making it one of the most significant trauma incidents in the region. Authorities are investigating the cause, with the driver surviving and cooperating, as New York Governor Kathy Hochul coordinates emergency responses.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) achieved its first new record high since 2021, surging after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated a potential adjustment to the restrictive policy stance, teasing September rate cuts. This dovish sentiment from Powell's Jackson Hole address triggered significant short liquidations in ETH, pushing its price higher as traders repositioned. Companies focused on accumulating ether saw their shares rebound, while the broader crypto market, led by ether, continues to attract institutional interest, particularly in stablecoins.

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone a dramatic modernization over the past decade, aiming to become a world-class fighting force by 2049, on par with the U.S. military. Analysts note "remarkable improvements" in information warfare, mechanization, and strategic projection, with advanced weapons and industrial support closing the capability gap with the U.S. and its Indo-Pacific allies. Beijing plans to showcase these advancements in a September military parade for the 80th anniversary of Victory Day. While geopolitical factors may limit Chinese arms sales, the world is closely observing the PLA's rapid transformation and its implications for global power dynamics.</p>

Working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an earnings test, leading to temporary deductions. Additionally, Medicare Part B premiums are often automatically deducted, with high-income earners facing Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA) that can significantly increase costs. Federal income taxes can also apply to up to 85% of benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds.

          <p>FBI agents have reportedly raided the Maryland home and office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton, investigating potential mishandling or sharing of classified material. President Trump, who fired Bolton in 2019 and called him a "lowlife," denied knowledge of the raid, despite their ongoing animosity. The investigation, which reportedly followed intelligence collected overseas, is distinct from Bolton's previous dispute with Trump over his memoir's government clearance. Despite his meticulous nature, Bolton's extensive knowledge of secrets and his public criticism of Trump's foreign policy could make him vulnerable in such an inquiry.</p>

          <p>California and Texas are at the center of an intense political battle over congressional redistricting, poised to significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas, with its Republican-majority legislature, redrew maps to create five new Republican-leaning seats, prompting California Democrats to counter with their own district re-drawing efforts. This "political arms race" aims to gain an advantage in the closely divided House of Representatives ahead of next year's midterm elections. Critics argue such partisan gerrymandering, while legal unless racially motivated, allows politicians to choose voters rather than the reverse, with Democrats threatening lawsuits over diluted minority voting power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stocks surged after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at impending interest rate cuts, but his speech at Jackson Hole also tempered optimism by suggesting the "neutral" rate might be higher long-term. This implies that while cuts are likely, rates may not return to pre-pandemic lows, making borrowing more expensive for loans like mortgages. The Fed aims for a "Goldilocks balance" between unemployment and inflation, a balance complicated by Trump's tariffs, which Powell noted are pushing up prices. The labor market's "curious kind of balance" and slowing economic activity further contribute to the Fed's consideration of rate adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vietnam has significantly expanded its island-building activities in the disputed Spratly Islands, with a U.S. think tank reporting that its scale may soon surpass China's. Satellite imagery reveals that since early this year, Vietnam has initiated dredging and landfill work at eight new features, in addition to expanding existing artificial islands. This means all 21 Vietnamese-occupied features in the chain now include artificial land, a substantial increase from four years ago. The report from CSIS's Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative highlights the growing infrastructure, including munitions storage, and suggests a runway at Barque Canada is likely.</p>

          <p>Hall of Fame jockey Ron Turcotte, renowned for riding Secretariat to the Triple Crown in 1973, has died at 84 from natural causes. Turcotte, a Canadian icon, achieved over 3,000 wins in his career, including two Kentucky Derbies, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes. His partnership with Secretariat, particularly their record-setting 31-length victory in the Belmont, cemented his legendary status in horse racing. Turcotte's career ended in 1978 after an accident left him paraplegic, but he remained an advocate for fallen riders. His family praised his faith, courage, and kindness, remembering him as a "wonderful husband, loving father, grandfather, and a great horseman."</p>

          <p>The North Carolina Supreme Court has issued favorable rulings allowing bars and their operators to continue lawsuits seeking compensation from the state for COVID-19 restrictions. These restrictions, implemented by then-Gov. Roy Cooper, shuttered bars while allowing restaurants to serve alcohol, which plaintiffs argued was unfair. The court's majority, consisting of five Republican justices, rejected state arguments for dismissal, affirming that the businesses could pursue claims that their constitutional right to earn a living was violated. This decision opens the door for trials and potential financial damages, despite the state's defense that the orders were based on public health data.</p>

          <p>Netflix has made an unusual move by releasing its viral animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" in over 1,750 U.S. and Canadian theaters for sing-along screenings this weekend. Despite industry estimates suggesting the film could top the box office with $16 million to $22 million, Netflix maintains its long-standing policy of not releasing box office figures. This theatrical run is seen as a marketing effort to capitalize on the film's streaming success, which is Netflix's most-watched original animated movie ever. The move highlights the complex, often "frenemy" relationship between the streamer and traditional exhibitors, who advocate for more collaboration.</p>

Zelensky, seeking robust security guarantees from Western allies akin to NATO's Article 5, emphasized Ukraine's willingness to meet. This diplomatic push follows an intensive week of meetings, yet Russia launched one of its heaviest attacks on Ukraine, underscoring the ongoing conflict and obstacles to peace.</p>
