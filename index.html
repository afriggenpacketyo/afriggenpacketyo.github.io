          <p>At a major Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for members to strengthen cooperation in artificial intelligence while rejecting a "Cold War mentality." Against a backdrop of ongoing US trade tensions and global conflicts, Xi positioned China as a global peacemaker, highlighting billions in investments in other SCO countries. The summit, attended by leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi, was an opportunity for China to promote a new phase of high-quality development and regional partnership.</p>

          <p>A strong earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border, resulting in at least two deaths and 15 injuries after a home's roof collapsed. The quake's epicenter was located near the city of Jalalabad and was followed by two significant aftershocks. A Taliban spokesman confirmed that rescue efforts were underway, a grim reminder of the region's vulnerability to seismic activity following a devastating quake in 2023 that killed over 2,000 people.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing sector showed surprising expansion in August, with the private RatingDog purchasing managers' index rising to 50.5, marking its fastest growth in five months. This result, which sharply beat economists' estimates, was driven by a recovery in new export orders amid a trade-war truce with the U.S. However, this optimistic private survey contrasts with China's official manufacturing PMI, which reported a fifth consecutive month of contraction, suggesting that domestic demand remains soft and the recovery may be fragile.

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD fell sharply after the company reported a 30% year-over-year drop in its second-quarter net profit. The significant decline is attributed to an aggressive and ongoing price war within China's highly competitive EV market, which the company stated has had an adverse impact on the industry. Despite the slump in profitability, BYD's overall revenue grew by 14%, largely due to the successful expansion of its overseas sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Farmers in the United Kingdom are raising alarms about potential shortages of staple vegetables like broccoli and cabbage due to a combination of prolonged drought and record-breaking summer heat. Growing conditions have been so poor that some crop yields have been slashed by more than 50%, forcing a greater reliance on dwindling water supplies for irrigation. Experts warn that while shelves are not yet empty, the situation is serious and could worsen if the dry weather continues, linking the extreme conditions to climate change.</p>

          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, driven by its superfood status and social media popularity, has led to skyrocketing prices and supply shortages, even in Japan. The boom has strained Japan's aging farming communities, who struggle with the labor-intensive process of growing the specific tea leaves, called tencha, required for high-quality matcha. As a result, tencha auction prices have jumped 170%, and many retailers in Tokyo and online have been forced to implement purchase limits to manage their dwindling stock.</p>
