The introduction of affordable Chinese EVs presents an opportunity for European consumers but also poses a threat to European carmakers struggling to produce competitive small cars.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how Indira Gandhi's government considered shifting India from a parliamentary to a presidential system during the Emergency in the mid-1970s. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, Gandhi's advisors proposed centralizing executive power and curtailing the judiciary's role. The push for a stronger presidency aimed to overcome the constraints of parliamentary democracy. Although the proposal never fully materialized, it influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act, which expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. The article sheds light on a little-known chapter in India's political history and the ambitions of Gandhi's government during a period of authoritarian rule.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw pitched effectively, earning his first win of the season as the Dodgers defeated the Cardinals 7-3, breaking a two-game losing streak. Kershaw allowed just one run on six hits in five innings, striking out seven. The performance was particularly important after Tony Gonsolin was placed on the injured list, disrupting the Dodgers' rotation. Kershaw's control was key, as he did not issue any walks, and the offense provided early support. The victory helps the Dodgers as they prepare for a series against the Padres.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister has vowed to prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching Gaza, citing the need to maintain its naval blockade to prevent Hamas from importing arms. The Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, is carrying 12 activists and aims to break the blockade. The coalition accused Israel of jamming their communication as they approached Gaza. This action follows increased scrutiny of aid distribution in Gaza, where humanitarian workers have warned of famine unless the blockade and war end.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council director, stated that the Trump administration is not specifically targeting Medicare for cuts in its budget proposal. However, he indicated that the administration would consider changes if the Senate identifies fraud or abuse in Medicare. Hassett pushed back against claims that the administration intended to cut Medicare, calling it fake news. He mentioned the administration's focus on reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid. The comments come as the Senate reviews the House-passed budget bill, which includes tax cuts and changes to Medicaid.</p>
