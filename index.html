          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing tremors felt across the New York metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake originated at a depth of about 6.2 miles. While the tremor was mild and much weaker than a 4.8-magnitude quake that struck the region in 2024, it prompted a flurry of social media activity. New York City's emergency management confirmed there were no immediate reports of significant impacts or damage from the event.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died on Saturday after being struck by a boat in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, an incident that also sent a passenger overboard. The passenger was recovered safely and is expected to be fine. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after the collision. Due to tidal conditions and the whale's location on a shallow sandbar, officials plan to tow the carcass to Island Beach State Park on Monday for a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death. Boaters are being advised to use caution in the area.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's southern Guangdong province are taking "decisive and forceful measures" to control a spreading chikungunya fever outbreak. The province reported 2,892 new cases last week, with the majority concentrated in the city of Foshan, though no severe or fatal infections have been recorded. Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, causing fever, joint pain, and fatigue, but it cannot be spread through person-to-person contact. National and provincial health officials are coordinating efforts to contain the outbreak swiftly to protect public health and maintain social stability.</p>

The incident gained widespread attention on social media, with one video accumulating over nine million views as authorities investigate the destructive event.</p>

          <p>Sir Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, has publicly stated that he was sexually abused as a teenager in 1978 by Michael Croft, the late founder of the National Youth Theatre. In an interview, Sir Chris detailed the abuse and noted that he believes Croft targeted him knowing he would likely keep it secret due to the social stigma surrounding homosexuality at the time. The National Youth Theatre issued a statement expressing sorrow and solidarity with Sir Chris and other victims of historical abuse by the same perpetrator. The MP also revealed he had been sexually assaulted by five male MPs during his time in Parliament.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and county prosecutor, to the position of top federal prosecutor for Washington, D.C. The confirmation, which passed with a 50-45 vote, fills a key role after President Trump's initial nominee was withdrawn. Pirro's appointment has been contentious, partly due to her past involvement in a libel lawsuit from Smartmatic over false 2020 election claims. Supporters point to her extensive courtroom experience as a former judge and district attorney, contrasting it with the previous nominee's lack of prosecutorial background.</p>

          <p>An American woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to eight years in prison for her part in a sophisticated scheme that helped North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at major U.S. companies. Chapman operated "laptop farms," managing computers and finances for the workers, who posed as U.S. citizens to circumvent sanctions and earn millions for the North Korean government's weapons programs. The scheme, which generated $17 million, exploited the rise of remote work during the pandemic and involved identity theft of 68 people.

A public records lawsuit filed by Radar Online is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release over 10,000 pages of documents. Additionally, civil litigation involving Epstein's victims and the Justice Department's own request to unseal grand jury transcripts could weaken the government's arguments for secrecy.

This breakthrough material addresses a critical challenge faced by the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, where existing materials proved too brittle. The new super steel can endure both the ultra-low temperatures near absolute zero and the immense magnetic forces generated during fusion. This development places China in a leading position in advanced materials science and is a significant step toward achieving viable fusion power.</p>

He also addressed the use of tariffs for geopolitical purposes, such as with Brazil and Canada, arguing it is a legitimate exercise of executive power.

A male DNA profile was recovered from one of the victims, but for years it did not match any suspects, including two men who were convicted and later exonerated. A potential match found in an anonymous FBI database in 2017 was later ruled out after more advanced testing. However, investigators still possess the original DNA sample and are hopeful that future scientific improvements will finally identify the killer and bring closure to the 30-year-old cold case.</p>

          <p>Engineers at China's Zhejiang University have developed the "Darwin Monkey," the world's first brain-like computer composed of over two billion artificial neurons. This new system, built with 960 domestically produced Darwin 3 neuromorphic chips, represents a significant advancement in brain-inspired computing. The university announced that the Darwin Monkey has already been used to perform complex tasks such as logical reasoning, content generation, and mathematical problems. This achievement marks a major step toward creating more advanced, human-like artificial intelligence and solidifies China's position in the field.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As major donors like the United States and the United Kingdom cut their foreign aid budgets, a few countries, including Spain, Ireland, South Korea, and Italy, are increasing their spending. This move comes as the global development funding gap is projected to reach $56 billion, threatening progress on health and stability worldwide. Spain has committed to more than doubling its aid budget by 2030, a decision rooted in long-standing public support. This shift could lead to a new, more collaborative and less paternalistic model for foreign aid, potentially giving recipient nations a greater voice in how assistance is delivered.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler, known for his dominant but stoic on-course demeanor, is receiving praise for his comedic cameo in the new movie "Happy Gilmore 2." The article suggests that while Scheffler's consistent excellence can sometimes lack drama for viewers, his self-effacing performance in the film presents a more fun and relatable personality. In the movie, he humorously plays off his real-life arrest earlier this year. This appearance is seen as a positive step for his public image and for golf, making one of its top stars more engaging to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>Dan Ardell, who had a brief but memorable stint with the Los Angeles Angels in 1961, looks back on a life defined not by baseball but by what came after. Though he is noted for getting a walk-off loss-inducing single in his first at-bat, Ardell quickly realized professional baseball was not his passion and retired at 23. He went on to a successful career in real estate and asset management, finding purpose in philanthropy and family. Ardell's story is one of recognizing that a childhood dream isn't always the right path and finding greater satisfaction in making a positive difference in the lives of others.</p>

This vast, hidden ecosystem is estimated to contain up to one-fifth of the planet's total biomass. The research provides a potential answer to how these isolated microbes survive without sunlight or nutrients from the surface. By analyzing geological processes, the scientists propose that the energy released during earthquakes can trigger chemical reactions that sustain these deep-earth life forms, expanding our understanding of life's resilience in extreme environments.</p>

Jesse Darjean, 36, was fatally shot in an apparently random act of violence in October, a case that remains unsolved with no suspects. In July, his uncle, Richard Ware, 48, was stabbed to death, but prosecutors declined to file charges against the known suspect, citing self-defense.
