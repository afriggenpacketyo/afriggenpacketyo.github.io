        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a low-cost, edible, and washable protein-based coating that extends the shelf life of various fruits by 2.5 times by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. Tested on 17 fruit varieties, the coating effectively delays rot for almost a week or more, costing only 9 US cents per kilogram. This eco-friendly strategy matches existing preservation methods while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and toxicity risks, offering a promising solution to global food waste, considering that around a third of all food produced globally is wasted, most of it perishable items like fruits and vegetables. The coating is universally applicable for both post-harvest and fresh-cut fruits due to its edible properties and ease of washability. </p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. The Japanese government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate the price of this staple food. Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, its highest level since January 2023, driven significantly by rising rice prices, which account for approximately 50% of core inflation. Measures to reduce rice prices could boost household spending if reductions extend to processed foods and lower restaurant prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares in Pop Mart, the company behind Labubu dolls, have continued to decline after Chinese state media called for stricter regulation of "blind box" toys. People's Daily criticized speculation around the blind box phenomenon, advocating for stricter regulation, while China's customs agency highlighted stopping cases of Labubu copycats from crossing the border. Morgan Stanley also removed Pop Mart from its China and Hong Kong focus list, contributing to the stock's negative performance. Despite recent losses, Pop Mart's year-to-date gains remain substantial, standing at over 160%.</p>

"The Tetsuwan Dash" will continue broadcasting without Kokubun, who debuted with Tokio in 1994 and has had an extensive career in television and radio.

          <p>President Trump is considering whether to strike Iran's Fordo nuclear site, viewing it as necessary to disable due to the risk of weapons production. He approved attack plans but has not made a final decision, hoping Tehran might abandon its nuclear program. White House officials say Trump will decide within two weeks, amidst diplomatic efforts by the UK and other European nations to find a resolution. Trump is aware of intelligence reports indicating Iran's potential speed in producing bombs, while the CIA director has stated that Iran is viewed as being very close to possessing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court extended its block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The unanimous order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit allows for the continued deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they are protecting federal property and immigration agents. The court stated that it is likely the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority to federalize the National Guard, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents.

Shark Angels founder Julie Andersen emphasizes the importance of shark conservation, aiming to transform fear into fascination and dispel myths.

The sites are sacred to followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon, and the pilgrimages are usually organized by the Indian government.

          <p>Chris Richards' second-half goal secured a 1-0 victory for the United States over Saudi Arabia, advancing the Americans to the CONCACAF Gold Cup quarter-finals. The win, combined with a draw in the other group match, clinched a knockout berth for the US, extending their impressive record in group play. The match, however, saw few real chances on goal, highlighting the challenges faced by the relatively untested US team. This Gold Cup serves as the last competitive test for the Americans ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>China kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged Friday, following monetary easing measures rolled out last month, and as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and 5-year LPR at 3.5%, in line with expectations. Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade between the two countries while suspending prohibitive tariffs. The trade truce has allowed some breathing space for Beijing to support its currency, while raising hopes that any hit to the economy will be smaller than previously expected.

          <p>The Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, along with other national monuments, is at risk of removal or being sold for parts due to newly proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service. The legal opinion released by the Justice Department gives presidents the ability to revoke or shrink certain national monuments for the first time since the 1930s. The proposed budget cuts could also see the closure of more than 300 park sites, and the loss of 13% of the National Park Service staff already. The monument commemorates the story of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy who was lynched in 1955.</p>
