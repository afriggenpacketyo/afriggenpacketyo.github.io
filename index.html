          <p>Amid catastrophic flooding in Central Texas that has claimed over 100 lives, Matthew Crowder performed a heroic rescue of a sleeping family from rapidly rising waters. He spotted the endangered home in the early morning and, despite dispatchers advising the family to stay put, insisted on an immediate evacuation as the house was making noises and trees were falling. The family lost their home and possessions in the flood, which brought an unexpected 15 inches of rain to the region. Crowder is now volunteering to help other affected families, highlighting a strong community response to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Oak View Group CEO Tim Leiweke has been indicted on a federal conspiracy charge for allegedly rigging a bid for the University of Texas's Moody Center arena project. The Department of Justice accuses Leiweke of conspiring to have a competitor drop its bid in exchange for subcontracts, a promise he later allegedly broke. In the wake of the indictment, Leiweke will transition to vice chairman of the board, and Oak View Group has agreed to pay a $15 million penalty. A spokesperson for Leiweke maintains his innocence, arguing the allegations misinterpret common and legal business teaming efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has acquired a recently decommissioned Marine One helicopter, a Sikorsky VH-3D, to enhance its agent training programs. The iconic aircraft, which has transported every U.S. president over the last 50 years, is now located at the Rowley Training Center in Maryland. This addition provides a realistic, hands-on environment for agents on the presidential and vice-presidential details to practice protective procedures. The acquisition is seen as a significant step in advancing the Secret Service's training capabilities and preserving a piece of presidential history.</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded 1,288 measles cases so far this year, marking the highest number of infections in over three decades. This total surpasses the 2019 record and is the worst year for the virus since 1992, with a significant outbreak in West Texas contributing over 750 cases and causing two child fatalities. Health experts attribute the surge to declining MMR vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity. The CDC maintains that the risk to the general population is low but urges vaccination as the most effective protection against the highly contagious virus.</p>

This potential relief for new buyers comes as millions of existing homeowners face an average monthly payment increase of £107 when their current mortgage deals expire, though this hike is less severe than previously anticipated.

          <p>Just two days before a devastating flood killed more than two dozen people, mostly children, state inspectors had approved the written emergency plan for Camp Mystic in Texas. Despite multiple flood warnings from the National Weather Service, the camp did not evacuate its more than 650 campers and staff before the Guadalupe River surged, overwhelming the site. The tragedy has raised serious questions about the adequacy of the camp's disaster preparedness, the details of its plan, and the effectiveness of the state's inspection and licensing requirements for youth camps.</p>

The summary highlights a cautious, wait-and-see approach, with opinions ranging from a potential cut this month to no reductions at all in 2025, reflecting ongoing uncertainty.
