            <p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) disclosed that a February email hack compromised sensitive information related to the financial condition of federally regulated banks. The breach, which the OCC is calling a 'major incident,' granted hackers access to over 150,000 emails from June 2023 until its resolution in February. The OCC has engaged external cybersecurity experts for a comprehensive review and is reassessing its IT security policies to prevent future incidents. Acting Comptroller Rodney Hood has pledged full accountability for the vulnerabilities that led to the unauthorized access.</p>

            <p>As economic challenges persist, senior homeowners are increasingly exploring reverse mortgages to supplement their income. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert a portion of their home equity into cash without monthly payments. Repayment is typically managed through the sale of the home, offering financial flexibility for seniors. Several companies like Fairway Independent Mortgage and Finance of America Reverse offer various reverse mortgage products tailored to meet different financial needs, but it's essential to evaluate lenders to find the best fit.

Critics argue that the resulting animals may only superficially resemble the extinct species and may not be able to perform the same ecological functions. Colossal also created two litters of cloned red wolves and is working on de-extincting the woolly mammoth.</p>

British Steel, owned by Chinese company Jingye since 2020, claims it has suffered significant financial losses and that its two blast furnaces are no longer financially sustainable.

            <p>President Trump and Speaker Johnson are advocating for the Senate's budget resolution, crucial for extending Trump's tax cuts, but face opposition from House Republicans who deem it insufficient in spending cuts. The House must adopt the Senate-passed resolution to advance the president's agenda, but a number of House Republicans are expressing concerns about the budget. The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, allowing Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. The Senate's plan relies on 'current policy' scoring, which some House Republicans argue does not go far enough in addressing spending.</p>
