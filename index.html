Despite threats of fines and potential jail time for organizers, the march has garnered significant international support, with over 30 embassies and European officials voicing solidarity.

          <p>Former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder made a successful return to boxing by defeating Tyrrell Herndon in a seventh-round stoppage. The victory marks Wilder's first win since 2022, following a series of high-profile losses that had cast doubt on his career. The fight was a more modest affair than his previous stadium-filling events, reflecting a stripped-back approach as he works to rebuild his confidence and skills. Post-fight, the 39-year-old stated this is a "new beginning" and that he is focused on becoming a more well-rounded fighter.</p>

          <p>A rift has emerged within Germany's coalition government regarding the country's energy policy, particularly on the roles of nuclear and gas power. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche's attendance at a pro-nuclear EU meeting has drawn criticism from Environment Minister Carsten Schneider, who insists on Germany's commitment to its nuclear phase-out. The disagreement extends to plans for building 20 new gas-fired power plants, which critics argue could jeopardize Germany's climate neutrality goals for 2045. This internal conflict highlights the challenges of balancing energy security with environmental commitments.</p>

          <p>Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, argues that China holds a "comparative advantage" in the global stablecoin race due to its mature third-party payment systems like WeChat and Alipay. He posits that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins, as they are extensions of legal tender pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and operate under a well-established regulatory framework. This perspective suggests China's existing digital payment infrastructure provides a strong foundation for developing and regulating its own digital currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NHL's first non-pandemic remote draft received criticism from some general managers, including the Kings' Ken Holland, who prefer the traditional in-person format. The new setup involved teams making selections from their home cities while top prospects were gathered at a theater in Los Angeles. Critics noted the event felt disjointed, suffered from technical glitches, and lacked the excitement of having all teams and prospects in one arena. While the league's intention is unclear, some GMs feel the change detracts from the celebratory experience for the young players being drafted.</p>

The Trump administration has indicated a possible extension but also maintains a hardline stance, creating uncertainty for Japanese exporters.

This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, successfully helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature through a neck vein. This development represents a significant potential advancement in BCI technology, promising reduced surgical risk and faster recovery times for patients.</p>

The majority opinion stated such lessons could undermine parents' ability to instill their own moral messages, while the dissent argued LGBTQ+ people are a part of society and their depiction should not be seen as a threat.</p>
