          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing universities based on their major's job prospects rather than the institution's prestige, reflecting anxieties about the current job market. This pragmatic shift means students are increasingly opting for lower-ranked schools to study high-demand subjects like computer science. The trend is further fueled by the rise of artificial intelligence, which is expected to create new career opportunities and is intensifying competition for relevant degrees.</p>

While the agreement sets a 15% tariff on many goods, it creates new challenges for industries in Germany and Ireland. The deal provides some stability by averting higher tariffs, but it still leaves many European exporters facing substantially greater costs than before the recent trade disputes began.

          <p>This article analyzes the recent surge of the far-right Sanseito party in Japan, which grew from one to 15 seats in parliament. The party's "Japan First" slogan has capitalized on public frustration with a sluggish economy, inflation, and a perceived increase in problems caused by tourists and immigrants. Analysts link the party's rise to global populist trends and its effective use of social media, presenting a significant challenge to the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>White House budget director Russell Vought stated that President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the conservative blueprint Project 2025. When asked about the project's chapter on overhauling the Fed, Vought claimed, "I don't even know what that chapter says," distancing the administration's actions from the think tank's proposals. The comments come amid sustained pressure on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell over monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sharp division has emerged within the House Republican conference over a bill to force the release of federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Speaker Mike Johnson criticized the measure as "reckless" for not adequately protecting victims, an argument co-sponsor Rep. Thomas Massie called a "straw man," insisting their bill includes necessary redactions. Massie warned that blocking a vote on the popular measure could become a political liability for the GOP in the midterm elections.</p>
