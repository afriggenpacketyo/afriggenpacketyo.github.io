          <p>Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed and handcuffed at a news conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles, where Noem was discussing immigration enforcement amidst city protests. Padilla, attempting to question Noem, was confronted by authorities and dragged away, leading to immediate condemnation from Democratic members of Congress and the LA Mayor. Some Republicans also criticized the incident. Padilla later stated he tried to interject due to unanswered immigration-related queries and urged peaceful protests against the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security claimed Padilla lunged at Secretary Noem, which the senator's office disputed, stating the Secret Service perceived him as an attacker. The events surrounding the news conference have been met with mixed reactions from both sides of the political aisle.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities, Iran declared it will not end its nuclear programs and asserted its "right to enrichment and nuclear technology and missile capability." This announcement came after the U.N.â€™s nuclear watchdog declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations. Despite the strikes and international rebuke, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian vowed to continue uranium enrichment. While Iranian officials claim nuclear negotiations with the U.S. are off, the Trump administration has not confirmed these claims.</p>

          <p>Alexander Dighton, 28, was sentenced to life in prison for attempting to murder a police officer outside the Talbot Green police station, armed with Molotov cocktails and other weapons.

He had been interviewed by counter-terrorism police a year prior but was not deemed a threat.

          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded in early June, exceeding expectations as concerns about tariffs and inflation softened, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, surpassing estimates, while the outlook for near-term inflation decreased. This improvement coincided with a less aggressive tone surrounding President Trump's tariffs, with ongoing negotiations showing potential progress. Despite the rebound, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels due to lingering worries about the impact of tariffs and geopolitical concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

This has raised concerns about a potential increase in energy prices, affecting various sectors from petrol to food. The situation's impact depends on the duration of the conflict, involvement of other countries, and potential disruption to shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. While oil prices are currently lower than the peaks seen after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the conflict's escalation could lead to higher prices if shipping is disrupted.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli strikes on Iranian military leaders and nuclear sites, Iran has warned of a strong response, characterizing the strikes as a "declaration of war." Experts suggest Iran's response is influenced by internal political factors and the need to deter further attacks. The US, while not involved in the strikes, has urged Iran to negotiate and warned of further consequences. The situation raises concerns about escalating tensions in the Middle East and the potential for a larger conflict involving the US.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes recent political developments in the United States, such as the removal of Senator Padilla from an immigration briefing and the deployment of troops to Los Angeles, through the lens of how these events would be perceived if they occurred in another country. It argues that these actions represent an escalation of authoritarian tendencies and a disregard for dissent, even from elected officials. The author suggests that the Trump administration is attempting to assert absolute authority and undermine the constitutional order.

Analysts suggest this is a tactic to coordinate vessels in open ocean, likely used to deter US forces in a Taiwan conflict.

          <p>A boat carrying 86 migrants from various African countries ran into trouble in the Mediterranean Sea while heading for Europe. During a rescue operation, the sight of the Libyan Coast Guard caused panic, leading many to jump into the sea, fearing they would be sent back to Libya. Members of the Spain-based NGO Open Arms and others were able to rescue all aboard.</p>
