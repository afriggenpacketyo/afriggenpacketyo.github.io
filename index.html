          <p>A recent survey reveals that over half of large-scale rice producers in Japan believe that current retail prices for rice are "too high," mirroring consumer concerns about the increasing cost of this staple food. The survey, conducted by an association of agricultural corporations, indicates that many producers worry consumers might reduce their rice consumption due to prices that have doubled in the past year. In response, the government has begun selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers to lower the average price of 4,200 yen per 5 kilograms. The head of the association suggests a reasonable price for both producers and consumers would be 3,000 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka has been omitted from England's squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra, with head coach Thomas Tuchel citing Saka's limited training during the week as a likely reason. Saka, who has 43 caps for England, had previously missed Tuchel's first camp due to injury and has only completed one full training session this week. Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins has also been excluded from the squad due to a minor injury, while the reason for Conor Gallagher's omission remains unclear. England remains unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, having won their opening two matches against Latvia and Albania.</p>

Vietnam has also increased construction of military-related facilities, including harbor basins, wharves, and runways, with an airstrip under construction on Barque Canada Reef expected to be about 3,000 meters long when completed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is finding it difficult to cut the amount of foreign aid used to pay for hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK. New figures reveal that the Home Office plans to spend ¬£2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only slightly less than the ¬£2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. This money primarily covers the accommodation costs of asylum seekers, despite the Home Office's stated commitment to ending the use of asylum hotels. Critics argue that diverting aid funds to domestic asylum costs undermines the purpose of foreign aid, which is intended to alleviate poverty and provide humanitarian assistance overseas.

          <p>King Charles is reportedly "livid" due to a potential shortage of pheasants at the Sandringham Estate, which may lead to the cancellation of the royal family's cherished Christmas shooting tradition. The King's preference for maintaining the estate's game population without importing birds has resulted in a decline in available birds. Experts suggest this change may prompt the King to reconsider the shooting tradition, which has faced criticism from animal rights groups. Some hope the situation will allow the King to focus on reconciling with Prince Harry and uniting the royal family during the holidays.</p>

          <p>Iran has denounced the US travel ban on Iranian citizens and nationals from 11 other mostly Middle Eastern and African countries, labeling it a sign of a ‚Äúracist mentality‚Äù. Alireza Hashemi-Raja, the Iranian Foreign Ministry‚Äôs director general for the affairs of Iranians abroad, criticized the measure, which takes effect on June 9, as discriminatory and a violation of international law. The ban targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, in addition to Iran. Hashemi-Raja asserted that the policy reflects a deep hostility towards the Iranian and Muslim people.</p>

He also provided information to authorities in the UK and Middle East, targeting rival cartels to eliminate competition. His double life came to an end after a joint operation between British and American authorities led to his extradition in 2023.</p>

His lawyer asserts that the charges are based on statements from individuals facing prosecution or in federal prison.
