        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has paused over $6 billion in congressionally-appropriated federal funding for various education programs, including after-school support, teacher training, and English language services. This decision, announced through a Department of Education memo, indicates a review of the funds to ensure alignment with the president's priorities, with decisions for the upcoming academic year still pending. Critics, including educators and Democratic lawmakers, warn that this abrupt withholding of funds could severely impact school budgets, particularly in low-income and rural areas, potentially leading to staff layoffs and the elimination of crucial student support programs. Lawsuits from state attorneys general and education advocates are anticipated, decrying the move as a "cruel betrayal" of students and an undermining of public education.</p>

          <p>China's first domestically built aircraft carrier, the Shandong, represents a significant leap in the PLA Navy's "blue-water" ambitions and long-range power projection. Commissioned in December 2019 and weighing 70,000 tonnes, this vessel's recent inaugural port call to Hong Kong underscored its growing operational capabilities. Operating with the Southern Theatre Command, primarily in the South China Sea, the Shandong signals China's expanding naval reach beyond traditional defensive boundaries. This strategic asset allows Beijing to project influence further into the Western Pacific, reflecting the nation's rapid military modernization and its intent to reshape regional power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Several women in County Durham, England, have suffered severe illness, with one requiring resuscitation and intensive care, after receiving injections of Toxpia, an illegal Botox-type anti-wrinkle treatment. The beautician, Gemma Gray, who administered the unlicensed product, has apologized to her clients, attributing the issue to a "nationwide problem" with the product, a claim that remains unsubstantiated. Victims, including a mother of three, experienced life-threatening botulism symptoms, underscoring the significant risks associated with unregulated cosmetic procedures. An ongoing investigation by the UK Health Security Agency emphasizes the urgent need for individuals to research practitioners and ensure products are legally licensed, prompting government consideration of new regulations to safeguard public health.</p>

          <p>Former England rugby captain Owen Farrell has been called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, marking a remarkable return to the Test scene as a replacement for the injured Elliot Daly. This decision by coach Andy Farrell, Owen's father, has sparked controversy, as the 33-year-old has not played international rugby in nearly two years and recently suffered a concussion, leading to a nine-week absence from competitive play. Despite his lack of recent game time, Farrell's extensive experience as a three-time Test Lion and his leadership qualities were cited as key factors in his selection. His inclusion aims to bolster the squad's options ahead of the crucial tour, despite other active contenders being overlooked.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming jobs report for June is expected to reveal a slowdown in U.S. hiring, as businesses grapple with economic uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Forecasters project 110,000 new jobs, a decrease from previous months, signaling a potential downshift in the labor market. This data precedes a deadline for new trade deals aimed at averting "reciprocal tariffs," with agreements already reached with the UK, Vietnam, and a preliminary accord with China. The Federal Reserve, which has maintained steady interest rates, is closely monitoring these developments, with Chair Jerome Powell warning of potential "stagflation" if tariffs lead to rising inflation and a slowing economy.

          <p>UK financial markets experienced volatility, with bond yields spiking and the pound falling, following an emotional appearance by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in Parliament. Her visible distress, attributed to a "personal matter," sparked speculation about her position and the stability of the government's fiscal policies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer later intervened to calm markets, affirming his full support for Reeves and stating they were "in lockstep." The incident occurred amidst pressure on Reeves to find savings after welfare spending U-turns, leaving the government with little fiscal leeway and facing difficult decisions on taxes or spending to adhere to its strict fiscal rules.

          <p>President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" (OBBB), a sprawling tax and spending package, has cleared a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives and is now poised for a final vote. The legislation, which extends 2017 tax cuts and boosts spending on border security and defense, faces opposition from Democrats and some Republican "deficit hawks" concerned about its projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit over ten years. Additionally, critics warn that the bill's cuts to Medicaid could lead to millions losing health insurance. Trump has pressed House Republicans to pass the bill by the July 4th deadline, emphasizing its potential for economic growth.</p>

          <p>Hip-hop mogul Sean Combs received a mixed verdict in his federal trial, found not guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, but guilty on two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. While a win for the defense on major charges, the trial has severely damaged Combs's public image and business interests, following numerous civil lawsuits and leaked surveillance footage depicting physical abuse. The prosecution's struggle to prove a larger criminal enterprise, despite graphic testimony of alleged sexual assault and violence, leaves the public's understanding of his culpability ambiguous. Combs still faces prison time for the convictions and numerous looming civil lawsuits.</p>

          <p>New research, aided by continuous glucose monitors, reveals that a significant portion of people without diabetes are "dippers," experiencing sharp blood sugar drops after carbohydrate consumption. These dips can lead to increased hunger, overeating, fatigue, and mood fluctuations, making weight management challenging. Scientists emphasize that you don't need a monitor to identify this; simply observe how you feel a couple of hours post-meal. To mitigate these effects, experts recommend combining carbohydrates with protein and healthy fats, increasing fiber intake, distributing carb consumption throughout the day, and eating protein/fat first in meals to stabilize blood sugar.</p>

          <p>Republican governors are largely silent on the significant Medicaid spending cuts proposed in President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," despite these reductions potentially creating multi-billion dollar holes in their state budgets. The legislation aims to cut about $1 trillion from Medicaid over ten years, primarily through new policies like work requirements and restrictions on provider taxes. This contrasts sharply with 2017, when GOP governors actively opposed similar cuts. Their current silence provides political cover for federal lawmakers, reflecting a changed political landscape and fear of drawing Trump's disapproval, even as Democratic governors vocally condemn the bill's impact on healthcare access and jobs.</p>

          <p>A two-day French air traffic control strike has severely impacted European air travel, forcing budget airline Ryanair to cancel over 170 flights and disrupt the holiday plans of more than 30,000 passengers. The industrial action, initiated by two French unions protesting working conditions, has resulted in significant flight reductions at major airports in Paris and Nice. Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, strongly condemned the strike, accusing air traffic controllers of "holding European families to ransom" during the peak holiday season. This widespread disruption, which also affects flights over French airspace, has prompted calls from aviation bodies for urgent action to ensure minimum service levels during such industrial disputes.</p>

While thirty-one survivors have been rescued, search efforts are ongoing for those still unaccounted for, amidst challenging conditions. This tragic incident, occurring on one of Indonesia's busiest inter-island routes, underscores persistent concerns about marine safety regulations and their inconsistent enforcement across the sprawling Indonesian archipelago, where such accidents remain a frequent occurrence.</p>

The council defended its actions by citing "complex" data-sharing rules aimed at preventing the jeopardization of prosecutions.

The incident occurred following a chaotic period in Westminster, including a government U-turn on disability benefits after a significant Labour MP rebellion, which has left Reeves facing a substantial fiscal challenge.

          <p>"Urban heat islands" are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than their rural surroundings due to the absorption of heat by dark concrete and asphalt, lack of cooling vegetation, and trapped air within "urban canyons." This phenomenon intensifies heatwaves, poses health risks to residents, and increases energy demand for air conditioning, further contributing to climate change. Solutions focus on mitigating this effect by greening cities with more drought-resistant trees, shrubs, and water features, implementing "cool roofs" that reflect sunlight, and installing "cool pavements" that enhance water evaporation. Cities worldwide, including New York, Tokyo, and Singapore, are actively adopting these strategies to reduce urban temperatures and enhance environmental sustainability.</p>

This research indicates that modern Uralic language speakers can trace about 5% of their DNA to this ancestral Siberian group. The findings also suggest these migrating peoples brought technological advancements, particularly in metallurgy, and influenced existing cultures and Indo-European languages.</p>

While state intervention and a modest economic recovery are expected to prevent a sharp decline, these experts believe that current stock valuations are already "fairly valued."

          <p>Saudi club Al-Hilal's surprising 4-3 victory over Manchester City in the Club World Cup quarter-finals signals a significant shift in global football, challenging the perception of the Saudi Pro League as merely a destination for aging players. Despite navigating a challenging domestic season and facing key injuries, Al-Hilal, a historically strong Asian club, demonstrated its enhanced capabilities against a European elite team. This landmark win, the first for an Asian team against a world-class opponent at this level, underscores the substantial impact of Saudi investment in football and suggests that the competitive gap between Saudi and European leagues may be narrowing faster than anticipated.</p>
