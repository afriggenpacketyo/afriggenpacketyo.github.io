          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities is facing significant legal challenges in federal courts. In Portland, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing an order blocking troop deployment, while a Chicago judge is considering a similar halt for Illinois. Local and state governments argue the deployments infringe on state sovereignty and escalate tensions, blurring the line between military and civilian law enforcement. The Trump administration defends the action as a necessary response to resistance against federal law enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An examination of the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death reveals significant procedural oversights, according to forensic experts who reviewed evidence photos. The experts point to a disorganized cell, moved items, and a failure to conduct standard forensic tests like fingerprinting or DNA analysis, suggesting the scene was not properly preserved. Despite the official ruling of suicide, these lapses, including a seven-hour delay before the FBI processed the scene, have fueled continued speculation. The review highlights a failure to follow typical protocols for a high-profile, suspicious death investigation.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has strongly criticized a US congressional report that accused Beijing of using American universities for military research purposes. A ministry spokesman dismissed the report as a "malicious" smear tactic, asserting that the House China committee lacks credibility. China emphasized that educational exchanges are mutually beneficial and promote greater understanding between the nations. Beijing urged the US to cease disrupting these cultural and educational ties and to honor President Trump's stated welcome of Chinese students.</p>

          <p>Government figures indicate a 2% rise in hate crimes across England and Wales, the first increase in three years, with notable increases in offenses motivated by race and religion. Religiously motivated hate crimes against Muslims rose by 19%, with a spike observed after last summer's Southport riots. While crimes targeting Jewish people fell by 18% outside of London, this followed a significant increase the previous year. The Home Secretary acknowledged the unacceptable levels of hate crime and pledged to ensure perpetrators face legal consequences.</p>

          <p>The annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement, anticipated in October, may be postponed due to a potential federal government shutdown. The COLA is calculated using third-quarter inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose report could be delayed. Experts project the 2026 increase to be between 2.7% and 2.8%, which would provide a modest boost to beneficiaries' monthly checks. However, the final net increase will also depend on the forthcoming announcement of Medicare Part B premium costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of luxury automaker Ferrari dropped over 16% following the company's Capital Markets Day, where it presented updated financial guidance and scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions. The company now projects that fully electric vehicles will comprise only 20% of its lineup by 2030, a significant reduction from its previous 40% target, citing a client-centric approach and market conditions. Analysts expressed disappointment, noting the new full-year and 2030 revenue forecasts fell short of expectations.

          <p>A recent Gallup poll has identified a significant trend toward sobriety within the American right wing, with the percentage of Republicans who report drinking alcohol dropping from 65% to 46% in just two years. This 19-point plunge is far more dramatic than the single-digit declines seen among Democrats and independents. While the exact cause is unknown, theories include the influence of teetotaling figures like Donald Trump, a rise in Christian temperance, and a growing "Make America healthy again" wellness movement. Prominent conservative figures have noted that elective sobriety is becoming increasingly common and accepted in their circles.</p>

Such a scenario could create an unprecedented disaster, simultaneously impacting major cities from Vancouver to San Francisco.

His lawyers have presented new evidence from medical experts suggesting the child died from an infection, not abuse.

          <p>Approximately 500 National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois have been deployed to the Chicago area to protect federal agents and property, despite a lawsuit from the state and city challenging the move. The deployment, ordered by the Trump administration, is being contested in federal court, with a judge set to hear arguments for a temporary restraining order. Governor J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson argue there is no crisis justifying the troops' presence. The U.S. government maintains that the president has the legal authority for the deployment.</p>

          <p>The number of people waiting for routine hospital treatment in England has increased for the third consecutive month, reaching 7.41 million at the end of August. This trend puts the government's key priority of tackling the NHS backlog at risk. The proportion of patients waiting longer than the 18-week target has also risen, with only 61% being seen within that timeframe, far from the 92% goal. Health experts warn of a significant challenge ahead, particularly with winter approaching, and call for urgent investment in NHS infrastructure and staff.</p>

          <p>Danish wind energy giant Orsted has announced plans to cut its global workforce by 2,000, or a quarter of its staff, by the end of 2027. The move is part of a strategy to become more competitive and refocus on the European market. The company has faced significant challenges in the United States, including an executive order from President Donald Trump suspending new wind leases and an order to halt construction on a nearly completed project. Orsted also recently cut its full-year guidance due to lower-than-expected wind speeds across its portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially designating the loosely organized, leftist movement Antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization." The order directs federal agencies to investigate and disrupt activities conducted by the group, which the administration accuses of engaging in political violence. However, legal experts question the practical and constitutional basis for the designation, as Antifa lacks a formal leadership or structure. The FBI has previously described it as an ideology rather than an organization, and critics warn the move could be used to broadly target political opponents.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's actions are dismantling the foundational wall between the U.S. military and partisan politics, a principle established by George Washington. The author contends that Washington, who warned against "unprincipled men" using political factions for their own elevation, would be appalled by Trump's efforts to create a military loyal to him personally. The piece cites the purging of top military officials and the use of military events as political rallies as evidence of this dangerous trend. It concludes that Congress and the courts have failed to check this executive overreach.</p>

          <p>The court case for Bella Culley, a 19-year-old British woman accused of drug smuggling in Georgia, has been postponed to allow for the finalization of a plea bargain. Culley, who is pregnant, was arrested at Tbilisi International Airport in May after authorities allegedly found marijuana and hashish in her luggage. She initially faced a potential life sentence but it is understood her family has raised a substantial sum of money that could significantly reduce her jail time. Her lawyer stated he plans to appeal for a presidential pardon after the deal is finalized.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis of Elon Musk's proposed $878 billion compensation package from Tesla suggests he could earn tens of billions of dollars even if he fails to meet most of the company's ambitious goals. The review found that some targets, particularly for vehicle sales, are exceptionally easy to achieve and could net him over $26 billion with only modest stock growth. Other goals related to "Full Self-Driving" and robotics are written with vague language that could allow for large payouts without delivering revolutionary products. The most challenging targets are related to company profits, but the pay structure does not require hitting them for Musk to receive substantial stock awards. (not investment advice)</p>
