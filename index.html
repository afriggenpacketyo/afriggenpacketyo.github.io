          <p>Across the globe, cities have hosted vibrant Pride Month events throughout June, celebrating the LGBTQ community while also highlighting the ongoing struggle for equal rights and inclusion. These celebrations trace their origins to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment that catalyzed the modern LGBTQ rights movement. Since then, annual marches have become a tradition, gaining federal recognition in the U.S. in 1999. This year's events, from Kathmandu to Washington D.C., saw large crowds gather for parades and festivals, continuing the legacy of advocacy and community.</p>

          <p>Following a US attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, the Trump administration has provided shifting descriptions regarding the extent of the damage, creating uncertainty about the mission's success. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated," initial intelligence assessments from the Pentagon suggested a more limited impact, potentially setting the program back by only a few months. Officials later focused on the goal of achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel as a key outcome, downplaying the physical destruction of the facilities. The conflicting narratives highlight the difficulty in assessing the true impact of the strikes.</p>

          <p>Iran's deputy foreign minister has stated that the United States must rule out any future military strikes as a precondition for resuming diplomatic negotiations. This demand follows a US bombing raid on three Iranian nuclear sites, which disrupted a planned round of talks. The minister emphasized that Iran will insist on its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes and rejected the notion of abandoning its program. Amid conflicting reports on the damage from the US and IAEA, Iran remains cautious about a ceasefire with Israel and is seeking clear assurances from the US before re-engaging in dialogue.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, citing a political environment hostile to independent and bipartisan thinking. His decision came a day after he voted against President Trump's major legislative package, prompting sharp criticism and a threat from Trump to back a primary challenger. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented that Washington's political theater and partisan gridlock have made it difficult to serve effectively. The announcement drew reactions from figures like former Senator Jeff Flake and Senator Bernie Sanders, who described the modern Republican Party as a "cult" intolerant of dissent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a major Republican budget bill could increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion and cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose health insurance over the next decade. The estimate complicates efforts to pass President Trump's signature legislation, which narrowly cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate despite opposition from two Republicans. The bill's proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act are a major point of contention, with Democrats arguing it prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy over essential healthcare services for vulnerable populations.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski delivered a standout performance, pitching six scoreless innings to secure a 5-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals. This outing marks a significant turnaround for the 24-year-old left-hander, who struggled earlier in the season but has shown remarkable improvement in June. Wrobleski's recent success is attributed to mechanical adjustments and an increase in his fastball velocity, which has consistently reached the upper 90s. His strong performance as a bulk relief pitcher is providing the Dodgers with valuable depth and solidifying his position as an impactful arm for the team.</p>

Speaking at an automotive event, Diesel stated he had presented three conditions to Universal Studios for the finale, including bringing back the iconic character. Walker passed away in 2013 during the filming of "Furious 7," which used a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins to complete his scenes.

          <p>A proposal to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill following significant bipartisan backlash. The provision, championed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, was intended to increase housing affordability but drew fierce opposition from conservation groups, recreation advocates, and several Republican lawmakers. Senator Lee withdrew the measure, stating he could not secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families and not to foreign interests or large corporations.

          <p>Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir-Saeid Iravani, has declared that his country's uranium enrichment activities "will never stop," asserting it as an inalienable right for peaceful energy under the non-proliferation treaty. His comments come as Western nations push for renewed negotiations following recent US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Iravani stated that while Iran is open to talks, the current conditions are not appropriate, and he condemned any calls for violence against IAEA officials. He suggested that a transfer of enriched uranium could be possible in a future deal but reiterated that renouncing domestic production is not an option.</p>

          <p>Doctors, nurses, and other medical experts are advising the public not to ignore seemingly minor health signs, as they can indicate serious underlying conditions. Symptoms such as sudden, unexplained weight loss, persistent calf pain when walking, and blood in the urine should prompt immediate medical attention. Other red flags mentioned include breast discharge, heavy or irregular periods, and clubbed fingernails. The professionals emphasize the importance of regular check-ups and blood work, even when feeling well, as these can lead to early detection of conditions like acute leukemia, diabetes, and cancer, significantly improving outcomes.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, has apologized after mistakenly informing thousands of Eurojackpot players that they had won significantly larger prizes than they actually had.

Although no incorrect payments were made, the incident led to public anger and disappointment. In the aftermath of the mistake and other recent technical issues, the company's CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, announced her resignation, expressing deep regret for the error and its impact on customers.</p>

Bolsonaro is facing charges of conspiring to orchestrate a coup to overturn the 2022 election results, which he denies, claiming he is a victim of political persecution. If convicted, he could face a lengthy prison sentence. Despite being barred from running for office until 2030 for separate abuses of power, Bolsonaro continues to mobilize his base, though attendance at his rallies has reportedly declined in recent months as his legal challenges mount.</p>

While some prominent figures, including Health Secretary RFK Jr., have labeled them as harmful, many nutrition researchers argue that the scientific evidence does not support these claims. These oils are high in polyunsaturated fats, particularly omega-6 fatty acids, which can be inflammatory in large quantities but are also essential for health. Most mainstream health organizations maintain that when consumed as part of a balanced diet, these oils are not detrimental and can be a healthy choice.</p>
