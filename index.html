        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's intensified criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates preemptively. Trump's comments, made via social media, exacerbated market turmoil already fueled by tariff concerns and recession fears. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all fell significantly, while gold prices surged to record highs as investors sought safe-haven assets. Experts warn that Trump's actions undermine central bank independence, which is crucial for financial stability, and that the US economy may face a downturn, impacting the rest of the world.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is facing a growing problem with cocaine use, according to the head of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), who cites a shift in the international drug trade towards Europe. While cocaine-related offenses are on the rise, the partial legalization of cannabis has complicated police work, as it becomes more difficult to prove dealing when possession of small amounts is legal. The incoming coalition government plans to evaluate the cannabis legalization policy, with some advocating for its reversal. The police chief insists that combating illegal drug dealing remains a top priority.</p>

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will provide additional guidance to ensure safe and appropriate services for all, including trans people, with consideration for privacy and dignity.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to phase out the remaining eight artificial food dyes from America’s food supply within two years. This initiative follows the previous administration's move to ban Red No. 3, an artificial dye shown to cause cancer in rats. Kennedy will also announce the approval of additional natural dyes, targeting those used in cereals, ice cream, and snacks. While the health effects of artificial dyes are not fully understood, studies suggest potential links to hyperactivity and behavioral problems in children, prompting similar bans in other countries.</p>

          <p>German beer exports have decreased by 6% over the past decade, while domestic consumption has fallen by 15.1%. Despite the decline in sales, the number of breweries in Germany has increased, though the trend is now downward. The statistics were released ahead of German Beer Day, which celebrates the country's beer purity law. While Destatis did not provide specific reasons for the sinking demand, declining alcohol consumption and a growing awareness of health consequences are potential factors.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing a lawsuit from the ACLU and other groups over the allegedly unlawful termination of student visas, potentially leading to deportation for affected students. A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order, requiring the administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students. The lawsuit claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), jeopardizing students' ability to continue their studies and remain in the country.

          <p>A survey of over 500 political scientists reveals that a majority believe the United States is moving towards authoritarianism, citing concerns about executive power, attacks on the media, and erosion of checks and balances.

While some disagree, arguing that President Trump is addressing long-standing problems, many scholars express alarm over tactics employed by the administration.

          <p>Japan is reportedly considering importing 60,000 tons of tariff-free U.S. rice annually as part of ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. This move could potentially address trade imbalances and satisfy demands from the United States for greater access to the Japanese agricultural market. The consideration reflects the complexities of international trade relations and the ongoing efforts to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Further details on the specific terms and conditions of the potential agreement are expected to be released in the coming days.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the freezing of billions of dollars in federal grants. Harvard's president, Alan M Garber, stated that the funding freeze would hinder critical disease research. The lawsuit claims the government's actions violate Harvard's constitutional rights and are being used to control academic decision-making. The Trump administration defends its decision, arguing that taxpayer funds are a privilege, not a right, and that Harvard has failed to meet basic conditions. This legal battle highlights the growing tension between the government and higher education institutions.</p>
