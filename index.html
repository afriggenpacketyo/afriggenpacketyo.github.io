The case involved a Minnesota school district that allegedly failed to provide adequate accommodations for the girl's learning needs. Lower courts had previously ruled against the family, requiring them to demonstrate "bad faith or gross misjudgment" by school officials.

          <p>Oil prices have risen due to geopolitical concerns as President Trump expresses a more negative outlook on nuclear talks with Iran and withdraws some American personnel from the Middle East. This marks a shift from previous rounds of talks described as "positive," with both the U.S. and Iran desiring a deal to alleviate sanctions. Trump's insistence on zero uranium enrichment in Iran, however, poses a significant obstacle. The IAEA has also declared Iran in noncompliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations.</p>
