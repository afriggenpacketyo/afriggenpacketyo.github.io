The Japanese conglomerate reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021. This strong performance marks a sharp turnaround from the previous year's loss and is attributed to gains from investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy.

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million. The U.S. has accused Maduro of narco-terrorism and conspiring with cartels to transport fentanyl-laced cocaine into the United States. This new amount doubles the previous reward of $25 million. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the move as "pathetic" political propaganda and a distraction from the U.S. administration's own issues.</p>

The 22-year-old rallied after losing the first set to win the match 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3). Shelton's victory makes him the youngest American to win a Masters 1000 tournament since Andy Roddick in 2004. His impressive run to the final included victories over several higher-seeded players, marking a significant milestone in his professional career.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued another nationwide preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's order seeking to limit birthright citizenship. This marks the fourth court decision to block the policy, which aims to deny automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The judge certified a class action, arguing the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their claim that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The legal battle over the policy continues to unfold across multiple federal courts.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly stated that the University of California should not "bend on their knees" to the Trump administration in negotiations to restore over half a billion dollars in frozen federal grants.

Newsom criticized settlements made by other universities, asserting that UC should uphold its principles of academic freedom.

          <p>Research published in Science Advances reveals that California's fire season is beginning significantly earlier and lasting longer due to climate change. Across the state, fire seasons now start weeks sooner than they did three decades ago, with the Cascade Range seeing a 46-day shift. Scientists attribute this change primarily to earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of vegetation caused by rising average temperatures. The findings quantify the anecdotal sense among residents that wildfire risk is becoming a more constant, year-round threat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, showed significant success in a late-stage clinical trial. Adults with obesity who took the pill lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, a result comparable to existing injectable GLP-1 therapies. While some participants experienced side effects like nausea, the company plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year. An effective oral medication could be a "game changer" by making weight-loss treatments more accessible and convenient for consumers.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning legislation that would confine serious violent and sexual offenders to specific geographical areas upon their release from prison. This new system would replace current exclusion zones, which only bar offenders from certain locations, by instead defining the area where they are permitted to be. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, the policy is intended to give victims greater peace of mind. Critics raise concerns about placing additional pressure on the already strained probation service, though the government plans to hire more staff.</p>

          <p>A US senator's claim that the FBI would help locate Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state has drawn harsh criticism from Democrats. The lawmakers left Texas to block a Republican-led effort to pass a gerrymandered congressional map, and their absence prevents a legislative quorum. Democrats have condemned the potential use of federal law enforcement to track political opponents as authoritarian overreach. The FBI has not confirmed its involvement, and legal experts question the federal government's authority to intervene in the state-level political standoff.</p>

          <p>An executive order signed by President Trump could pave the way for Americans to invest in higher-risk assets like cryptocurrency and private equity through their 401(k) retirement accounts. The order directs federal agencies to review and potentially rewrite regulations governing qualified retirement plan assets. While the changes are not immediate, the move is seen as a major win for the private equity and crypto industries, which have long sought access to the trillions of dollars in American retirement funds. Proponents argue it provides more choice, while critics worry about exposing workers to more volatile investments. (not investment advice)</p>

However, earnings per share fell short of analyst estimates due to the high cost of beef, a headwind expected to continue. The company plans a modest menu price increase to help offset some of the inflationary pressure while aiming to maintain its value proposition for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

A federal judge had restricted the tactic, which involved agents apprehending individuals based on factors like race or location, finding it likely violated the 4th Amendment. The administration argues the ban hinders its ability to enforce immigration laws in a region with a large undocumented population.
