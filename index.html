          <h2>Israel Initiates 'Tactical Pause' in Gaza to Facilitate Humanitarian Aid Amid Growing Hunger Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 19:31:02 EDT</div>

          <p>The Israeli military has implemented a daily "tactical pause" in parts of Gaza to allow aid agencies to distribute supplies amid a severe hunger crisis. This decision comes as international pressure mounts over the humanitarian situation, with food experts warning of famine and recent images of malnourished children drawing global criticism. While the UN and other nations have welcomed the move, they stress that a broader ceasefire is necessary to address the full scale of the catastrophe. Meanwhile, fighting continues in other areas of Gaza, and a separate incident saw the Israeli military intercept a Gaza-bound aid ship.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, averting the threat of new U.S. tariffs. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on EU goods, a compromise from the 30% rate previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the agreement, the EU will reportedly invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S. and purchase $750 billion in American energy, aiming to rebalance the trade relationship. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as a "huge deal" that will bring stability, though it still requires approval from EU member states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his position among the sport's legends. Despite having the overall victory virtually guaranteed, Pogačar launched a characteristic attack during the final stage in Paris, even amid treacherous rainy conditions. Although he didn't win the final stage itself, which was claimed by Belgian rider Wout van Aert, his aggressive performance underscored his dominant and daring racing style. The 26-year-old finished more than four minutes ahead of his main rival, two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard, marking the fifth consecutive year the two have finished first and second.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its earthquake early warning system significantly underestimated the severity of the deadly 2023 earthquake in Turkey, failing to send critical alerts to millions. The system should have issued a "Take Action" alarm to 10 million people in the highest-risk zone, but only 469 received it for the first 7.8 magnitude quake. Instead, most alerts were of a lower "Be Aware" level, which would not have woken sleeping residents. Following the disaster, which killed over 55,000 people, Google adjusted its algorithm, which simulations show would have correctly alerted the 10 million users.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the influential and sharp-witted musical satirist who gained fame in the 1950s and 60s, has passed away at the age of 97.

His work on the show "That Was The Week That Was" and his own records left a lasting impact on comedy, influencing generations of performers. He retired from public performance in the 1970s, stating that the political climate had shifted from being funny to making him angry.</p>

          <p>Human rights organizations in Argentina, many based at the former ESMA detention center, are experiencing mass layoffs and funding cuts under President Javier Milei's austerity measures. These groups, including the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, have been crucial in documenting the crimes of the 1976-1983 military dictatorship and finding children stolen at birth. Key government agencies like the National Archive of Remembrance have seen staff halved, threatening the ongoing work of truth, memory, and justice.

She contrasts the current environment with the era of US-China normalization, when pioneers like her "grand teacher" Michel Oksenberg purposefully invested in building a community of expertise to inform policymakers and the public. Ang highlights the historical importance of this dedicated effort to understand China, suggesting that a similar commitment is needed today. She argues that China can turn its current "polycrisis" into a "polytunity" with adaptive strategies.</p>

          <p>The latest cinematic version of the Fantastic Four, titled "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," has launched with a strong box office performance, earning an estimated $118 million in North America. This marks a significant success for the Marvel franchise, which has had previous mediocre attempts, and represents the largest Marvel opening since "Deadpool & Wolverine." The film, set in a retro-futuristic 1960s, also brought in $100 million internationally for a global debut of $218 million. The strong opening, alongside the success of "Superman," has led analysts to suggest that "superhero fatigue" is less of an issue than "bad movie fatigue."</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area has a significant opportunity to establish itself as a premier destination for sustainable tourism. Policymakers are already investing in green infrastructure, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transit system. The author suggests that to fully realize this potential, the region must move beyond just hardware and develop integrated systems, partnerships, and travel experiences that cater to the growing demand for low-carbon travel. By leveraging its role as a hub for climate innovation, the Greater Bay Area can create a unique, interconnected green tourism corridor.</p>

          <p>The newly announced trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union represents a significant breakthrough, though the full details are still emerging. For the EU, the agreed-upon 15% tariff is a better outcome than the 30% rate that had been threatened, while the U.S. secures substantial new investment commitments and tariff revenue. The deal was brokered directly by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, highlighting a pattern of personal involvement in recent trade negotiations. While the agreement is being hailed as a landmark, key questions about the timing and specifics of the EU's investments remain unanswered. (not investment advice)</p>

For many fans, the core of Comic-Con remains the cosplay, artist alleys, and exclusive merchandise rather than just the blockbuster movie announcements.

Their vehicle was last spotted on a traffic camera in Atwater, about halfway through the journey. The family, who reported them missing after a three-day miscommunication, fears Owen may have suffered a medical emergency, as she has a history of high blood pressure.
