          <h2>Stock Market Recovers After Initial Fears Over Trump's Trade Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 15:41:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from April's downturn, fueled by hopes for renewed trade discussions between the U.S. and China. Despite this recovery, investors remain concerned about the potential economic consequences of President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on various imports. While the S&P 500 has largely recovered its losses, it remains below its February high, and questions persist about the long-term impact of tariffs on economic growth, hiring, and investment. The article suggests that while recent optimism has buoyed the market, the underlying concerns about the economic fallout from trade policies have not entirely dissipated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to cut NASA's budget by approximately $6 billion, reallocating $1 billion to Mars-focused programs, aligning with Elon Musk's ambitions. This shift will require NASA to streamline operations, terminate some missions, and reduce scientific endeavors to achieve fiscal responsibility. Despite the cuts, NASA's acting administrator emphasizes the administration's support for the agency's mission and future achievements, including prioritizing a return to the Moon to surpass China. The budget would end green aviation spending and the Mars Sample Return Program, while SpaceX and Blue Origin are positioned to benefit from the absence of the SLS rocket.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists working on the National Climate Assessment report, two scientific associations are soliciting research to continue the report's work. The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union aim to "sustain the momentum" of the report, which assesses the impacts of climate change in the United States. The NCA is considered important for future projections and decision-making, and the Trump administration's decision to cancel the report has drawn criticism from scientists who emphasize the necessity of the report for dealing with the future impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased direct shipments from China to the U.S. due to the expiration of the de minimis rule and new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The company has shifted to fulfilling orders from U.S.-based warehouses and is actively recruiting local sellers to join the platform. This change in strategy aims to circumvent higher levies and maintain pricing for American shoppers. The article also notes that other retailers like Shein have raised prices to account for the new tariffs.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson is on trial in Australia, accused of poisoning her estranged husband's relatives with death cap mushrooms, resulting in three deaths. Patterson served a beef Wellington dish at a lunch in July 2023, and the guests subsequently suffered severe symptoms. The prosecution alleges Patterson deliberately poisoned her guests and lied about a cancer diagnosis to set up the lunch, while the defense argues the incident was a tragic accident. The jury has been sequestered due to the high-profile nature of the case, and the trial is expected to last about six weeks.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Budget Proposal Prioritizes Defense Spending, Cuts Discretionary Funds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 includes a 22% cut in non-defense discretionary spending while significantly increasing defense spending. The budget would reduce non-defense spending by $163 billion from current levels, with defense spending surpassing $1 trillion for the first time. Agencies would face an average of 35% in cuts, although some, like the Department of Homeland Security, would receive more funding. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are not affected, but the proposal focuses on streamlining the bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>Labour MPs are expressing concern and despair over voters' reactions to the current government, with some describing a sense of "betrayal" among constituents. The discontent stems from policies such as the withdrawal of winter fuel allowance and fears about cuts to personal independence payments for disabled people. Some MPs are calling for a change in direction, suggesting the government is not appearing "Labour enough" and allowing Reform UK to gain ground.</p>

          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed an agreement to establish a joint reconstruction investment fund, aiming to attract global investment into Ukraine. Kyiv will contribute 50% of revenues from new licenses for extracting raw materials to the fund, with the US potentially contributing military support and direct funds. Experts believe investments are unlikely until the conflict with Russia stabilizes. Some critics note the agreement lacks US security guarantees for Ukraine, while others emphasize its political advantage in maintaining cooperation with the US.</p>

          <p>Major footwear brands, including Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour, are requesting a tariff exemption from President Trump, citing an "existential threat" to the footwear industry.

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget would drastically cut federal rental aid by 40% and shift the money to states to design their own programs. The White House calls the current system "dysfunctional" and seeks to impose a two-year cap on rental assistance for able-bodied adults. Advocates warn that these cuts would lead to a surge in homelessness, especially as nearly half of all renters are already cost-burdened. The proposal also seeks to shrink HUD funding for homelessness and shift money away from permanent housing.</p>
