          <p>At least 24 people have died after catastrophic flash floods struck Texas Hill Country, an event officials are calling a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, causing widespread destruction. Search and rescue operations are ongoing for 23 to 25 people who remain missing, many of whom were attending a summer camp in the area. The state has deployed hundreds of personnel, drones, and helicopters to aid in the extensive recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite an injury to third baseman Max Muncy. Initially feared to be a season-ending injury, Muncy was diagnosed with a bone bruise and is expected to miss approximately six weeks. The team's management expressed relief that the injury was not as severe as it appeared, giving Muncy ample time to return before the playoffs. The Dodgers will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim, avoiding a desperate search for an external replacement.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in Queens, New York City, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to shore. The sightings, reported in the Far Rockaway area, prompted immediate action from city officials to ensure the safety of holiday beachgoers. Authorities utilized drone technology and lifeguards to monitor the situation, and the beaches were reopened after about an hour. New York officials had previously announced increased shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend to protect the public.</p>

          <p>South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to compete more aggressively with China in the global shipbuilding industry, particularly as the U.S. targets China's sector. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has pledged significant support to revitalize it. The government's new policy guide focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and better working conditions. These measures are intended to re-establish South Korea as a leading maritime power in the face of intense international competition.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has denied an emergency request to stop the deportation of eight migrants to South Sudan, clearing the way for their removal by the Trump administration. The men, who have criminal convictions in the U.S., were scheduled to be flown to the war-torn country on Friday evening. This ruling followed a complex legal battle that reached the Supreme Court, which ultimately allowed the administration to proceed. Lawyers for the migrants argued they could face "perilous conditions" in South Sudan, a country the U.S. government advises against traveling to due to ongoing civil war.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping tax and spending bill into law, a move observed with international interest. The legislation makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increases defense and border security funding, and implements significant cuts to social safety-net programs like Medicaid. While the administration celebrates the bill as a victory for the American economy, it faces strong criticism from Democrats for potentially adding over $3 trillion to the national debt. The move is seen as a key legislative achievement for Trump, enacted on U.S. Independence Day to maximize its symbolic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's newly signed tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65, which can lower their overall taxable income. Policy experts note that this is different from repealing the tax on benefits directly and that the primary beneficiaries will be higher-income seniors, not those who already pay no federal income tax. The change could also increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study has uncovered the significant role of tiny marine animals called zooplankton in combating global warming through a massive annual migration. These creatures feast near the surface in Antarctica's Southern Ocean, growing fat before sinking deep into the ocean to hibernate, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, is estimated to store as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars. The findings highlight the underappreciated importance of these small organisms in regulating the global climate, even as they face growing threats.</p>

          <p>Following severe flooding in Texas Hill Country, families are desperately seeking information about more than 20 girls who are unaccounted for from Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp. The camp, located along the now-overflowing Guadalupe River, has been devastated, with cabins washed away and infrastructure destroyed. A reunification center has been set up, but many parents are still waiting for news, relying on social media and official updates. The disaster has drawn painful parallels to a similar flood in 1987 that also claimed the lives of young campers in the region.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the UK. The chick is one of ten born this year in a successful breeding season for the vulnerable species. Zookeepers entrusted one of the eggs to the male pair, who have taken on the shared parenting duties of incubating the egg and feeding the chick. This instance is another example of same-sex animal pairings successfully raising offspring, highlighting a natural behavior that contributes to conservation efforts for at-risk species.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally submitted what it calls a "positive response" to the latest proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, indicating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks stated that Hamas has requested several key amendments to the plan. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail, and changes to how humanitarian aid is distributed. The response now puts the focus back on Israel and the U.S. to determine the next steps in the protracted conflict.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to rally against the Trump administration's immigration raids and the newly approved federal budget that significantly funds them. Forsaking traditional holiday celebrations, demonstrators marched from City Hall to the Federal Building, chanting and carrying signs decrying the mass deportations. Speakers, including local politicians, condemned the administration's actions and the military presence in the city. The protest highlighted the widespread fear and anger within the community following weeks of aggressive immigration enforcement actions across the Southland.</p>

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the eight-time champions secured the win, the match was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears during the first half. Gwinn has a history of two previous ACL injuries, raising significant doubt about her ability to continue in the tournament. The team's performance was solid but not flawless, leaving room for improvement as they prepare to face tougher opponents in their group.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order that will increase entry fees for international visitors to U.S. national parks and give U.S. residents preferential treatment in lotteries or permit systems. The order states that the additional revenue generated from foreign tourists will be used for park infrastructure and improvements. The same order also revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity and inclusion efforts in the management and storytelling within the national park system. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending government diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team narrowly defeated India by five runs in a dramatic T20 match at The Oval, keeping the five-match series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but England's Lauren Bell secured the win by dismissing India's captain. England's innings was a story of two halves, with openers Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge powering them to 137-0 before a shocking collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs. Despite a chaotic finish with multiple dropped catches, England held their nerve in a crucial victory.</p>
