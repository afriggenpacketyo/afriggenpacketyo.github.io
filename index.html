        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-hailing company engages in systemic discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The suit claims drivers frequently refuse service to individuals with service animals, impose illegal cleaning fees, and fail to accommodate mobility devices. While Uber asserts its policies prohibit such discrimination and that it takes action against violators, the government is seeking $125 million in damages for affected individuals, highlighting the ongoing tension between gig economy platforms and accessibility laws.</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Franklin Park, Illinois, after a vehicle stop escalated. According to the Department of Homeland Security, Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and drove his vehicle toward officers, striking and dragging one, which prompted the fatal shot. However, community members and a neighbor described him as a hardworking and kind person who was likely scared, adding a conflicting perspective to the official narrative amid heightened local tensions over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of a man by an ICE agent in Franklin Park, Illinois, is being investigated with the help of surveillance footage from nearby businesses. The video shows ICE officers approaching the vehicle of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez before he backs up and drives away; officials state an agent was dragged out of the camera's view. The footage also captured the sound of gunshots shortly before Villegas-Gonzalez's car crashed. The FBI is assisting with the investigation into the incident, which officials have described as a response to the suspect resisting arrest.</p>

          <p>Florida's Education Commissioner, Anastasios Kamoutsas, has directed state school superintendents to investigate any teachers who made inappropriate or celebratory comments online regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The memo states that educators are held to a higher standard and that such "vile, sanctionable behavior" could lead to professional sanctions, including the loss of teaching certificates. Governor Ron DeSantis publicly supported the move, emphasizing that celebrating the murder of a young father is completely unacceptable for teachers.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Jill Lepore's new book, "We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution," examines the document's physical and philosophical foundations. Lepore presents the Constitution not as a static relic but as a living entity, written with oak-gall ink on sheepskin parchment, embodying ideas that have endured and evolved over centuries. The article highlights the text's inherent design to account for the passage of time, framing it as an ingenious solution to ancient problems of governance and law.</p>

While Governor Cox made a public appeal for de-escalation and dialogue, lamenting that politics has become dominated by rage, President Trump blamed "radical-left lunatics" and promised forceful reprisals. The article posits that these two reactions showcase rival impulses within the Republican party, with Trump's more inflammatory and confrontational rhetoric currently holding more sway among his supporters.</p>

          <p>A failure in the water supply at the Guantánamo Bay naval base has disrupted operations for housing migrants, forcing the relocation of individuals held at the Migrant Operations Center. The issue, caused by structural damage to an underwater pipeline, has amplified criticism that the base's infrastructure is inadequate to support the Trump administration's plan to send thousands of migrants there. Critics point to the high costs and logistical challenges as evidence that the policy is more about political theatrics than effective or efficient detention.</p>

          <p>The state of Massachusetts has initiated a lawsuit against the predictions platform Kalshi, accusing it of offering illegal sports gambling without the required state license. The Attorney General's office argues that Kalshi's "events contracts," which allow users to wager on the outcomes of sporting events, fall under state gambling laws. Kalshi has consistently argued that it is federally regulated as a predictions market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, setting up a legal clash between state and federal oversight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis highlights that while prominent Democratic leaders have universally condemned Charlie Kirk's assassination, some conservative commentators are amplifying isolated online posts to build a narrative that "the left" is celebrating the attack. The author argues this is a deliberate strategy to create a false equivalence and legitimize President Trump's rhetoric, which casts political violence as a uniquely left-wing phenomenon. This dynamic underscores the deep partisan divisions and differing approaches to political violence within the two major parties.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the significant influence of the late Charlie Kirk on youth politics, arguing he redefined conservatism for Generation Z. Through his organization Turning Point USA, Kirk built a culturally potent movement that blended political activism with a slick, event-driven social identity that appealed to young people's anti-establishment sentiments. His mastery of social media and confrontational debate style made him a central and polarizing figure, creating a new ecosystem for young conservative media and activism that will likely endure after his death.</p>

The plan, which now goes to the governor, redraws districts to make the seat held by longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver significantly more conservative, potentially shifting the state's delegation from 6-2 to 7-1 in favor of Republicans. This mid-decade redistricting is part of a national strategy backed by President Trump to maximize GOP seats ahead of the midterm elections.</p>
