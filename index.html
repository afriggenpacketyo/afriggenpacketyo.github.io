        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Zervos, a potential candidate for Federal Reserve chair and chief market strategist at Jefferies, is advocating for aggressive interest rate reductions to stimulate the economy. He argues that the central bank should implement a half-percentage-point cut to prevent a labor market slowdown and potentially create a million new jobs. Zervos believes current monetary policy is too restrictive and that recent inflation data should not deter the Fed from easing. His market-focused background is seen as a potential asset for a role traditionally held by economists, and his position aligns with pressure from the Trump administration for significant rate cuts.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan to redraw his state's congressional maps, directly countering a Republican effort in Texas to alter districts in their favor. The move comes after Texas Republicans proposed redrawing five Democrat-held seats, a strategy that could impact the balance of power in Congress ahead of the midterm elections. Newsom stated that California must "meet fire with fire" against what he calls an attempt to "rig the system." However, California's process is more complex, likely requiring a constitutional amendment approved by voters, whereas Texas Republicans can act through the normal legislative process.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has advanced plans for over 3,000 new homes in the E1 settlement area of the occupied West Bank, a move he claims will "bury the idea of a Palestinian state." This controversial project, long frozen due to international pressure, would effectively sever the West Bank from East Jerusalem. The announcement has drawn sharp condemnation from the US, UK, EU, and the UN, who view the settlements as illegal under international law and a major obstacle to a two-state solution. The Palestinian foreign ministry described the plan as an extension of "genocide, displacement and annexation."</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has sued the online gaming platform Roblox, with Attorney General Liz Murrill alleging the company prioritizes profits over child safety. The lawsuit claims the platform is "overrun with harmful content and child predators" due to insufficient safety protocols and a lack of age verification, making it easy for adults to pose as children. The complaint cites a local case where a man was arrested while using Roblox with voice-altering technology. This legal action follows other lawsuits against the company and accuses Roblox of creating a dangerous environment for its young user base by failing to implement adequate safeguards.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have fallen to their lowest point in ten months, with the average 30-year loan rate now at 6.58%, according to Freddie Mac. This decline offers some relief to potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance, though rates remain significantly higher than the sub-3% levels seen in previous years. The article suggests that future rate drops could be influenced by upcoming economic data, including the September unemployment report and inflation figures. The Federal Reserve's next policy meeting is also highlighted as a key event that could further impact the borrowing climate and potentially push mortgage rates down again.

Over nearly a decade, Rodriguez used his position of authority to coerce and assault incarcerated women, often in areas without camera surveillance. The case has highlighted systemic issues of sexual misconduct within the California prison system, as it was revealed an abuse report against Rodriguez in 2014 did not result in his termination.

          <p>Market strategists are cautioning investors against taking oversized risks, suggesting the current economic environment is not conducive to being a "hero." Experts point to a weakening job market, with slowing growth and a declining labor force, as a precarious sign for the consumer-driven economy. Despite a rising stock market, financial advisors recommend sticking to diversified, long-term plans rather than chasing high-flying tech stocks or cryptocurrency. The potential for reignited inflation due to tariffs adds to the uncertainty, making disciplined strategies like rebalancing and avoiding emotionally-driven decisions particularly important for navigating potential volatility.

          <p>The upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin is being held in Alaska, a location with deep historical ties to both the United States and Russia. Once a Russian colony sold to the U.S. in the 19th century, Alaska became a strategic front line during the Cold War, home to military installations like the summit's venue, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The state retains Russian cultural influence, with numerous Orthodox Christian communities. The choice of venue is also practical, as its location is relatively accessible for both leaders and, importantly, the U.S. does not recognize the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.</p>

This has led to tighter warehouse capacity and higher storage costs. Experts predict that this inventory will begin moving to retail shelves in the fall, at which point consumers will likely start to see higher prices on goods, especially for the holiday season, as these accumulated costs are passed on.

The goal is to move beyond robots that perform repetitive industrial tasks to create machines capable of assisting with household chores or in medical settings.

          <p>The forthcoming meeting in Anchorage between President Trump and Vladimir Putin is set against a backdrop of a complex and often controversial history between the two leaders. Trump has consistently expressed a desire to work with Putin, famously appearing to side with the Russian leader over U.S. intelligence regarding 2016 election interference during their 2018 Helsinki summit. Although Trump has recently expressed irritation with Putin over the war in Ukraine, he maintains that his personal relationship is key to brokering peace. Analysts express concern that Putin may leverage Trump's transactional approach and desire for a deal, making the outcome of the high-stakes meeting highly uncertain.</p>

Diagnosed with Stargardt disease at age 9, Colton has refused to let her condition limit her, having already learned to snowboard and completed the Boston Marathon. She and her friends established a nonprofit, the Vorden Initiative, to educate sighted individuals on how to become allies and athletic guides for the blind. The Kilimanjaro expedition, organized by a former paralympian, will include eleven blind climbers, each with a sighted guide, on the weeklong trek to the nearly 20,000-foot peak.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a more than 1,700% surge since its 2020 public debut, driven significantly by large government contracts. U.S. government revenue, particularly from a multi-billion dollar agreement with the U.S. Army, grew 53% last quarter and accounts for over half of the company's total revenue. This growth has pushed Palantir's market capitalization past $430 billion, giving it a forward price-to-earnings ratio that dwarfs most tech giants, despite having a fraction of their revenue. While U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, international commercial revenue has declined, raising some concerns among analysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The annual Monterey Car Week auctions are underway with sales expectations that reflect a cooling market, estimated to be down 18% from a 2022 peak. Experts attribute the slowdown to a generational shift, as baby boomer collectors age out and are replaced by millennials and Gen Zers who prefer newer, more practical, and affordable collectible cars from the 1980s and later. This has led to an oversupply and falling prices for classic cars from the 1950s and 1960s. While the high end of the market is weaker, demand for modern supercars is skyrocketing, signaling a significant rotation in collector taste and investment focus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys have surpassed girls in achieving the highest A-level grades in the UK. This year, 28.4% of boys' entries were graded A* or A, compared to 28.2% for girls, reversing a long-standing trend. This shift is likely influenced by the increasing popularity of STEM subjects, particularly maths, which are studied by significantly more boys than girls and tend to yield more top grades. While entries for business and economics have also risen, humanities subjects like English and history have declined in popularity. Education officials caution against over-interpreting the small margin, noting the causes are complex.</p>

At age 12, she designed a solar-powered blanket that stores heat from the sun in a battery pack for use during cold nights. Her idea won a national engineering competition, and the engineering firm Thales developed it into a working prototype, with 35 units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, which is run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also turned into a Lego mini-figure for a digital cover of the magazine.</p>

          <p>In an opinion article, writer Rebecca Solnit argues that Donald Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force is a hypocritical power grab based on false claims about crime. She contrasts this action with the violence of January 6, 2021, which she notes was instigated by Trump and was the most violent day in the city's modern history. Solnit contends that the right-wing demonization of cities stems from their nature as diverse, progressive strongholds that disprove conservative theories. She frames the D.C. intervention as part of a broader authoritarian war on cities, rights, and diversity, fueled by propaganda and lies to justify violating civil liberties.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard and federal oversight of the police in Washington, D.C., is a move that would be difficult to replicate in other major U.S. cities, according to legal experts. Because D.C. is a federal district and not a state, the president has direct authority over its National Guard and can assume control of its police in emergencies under the Home Rule Act. In contrast, state governors command their own National Guard units, and federal military intervention in states is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. Critics argue the D.C. takeover is a political move, as federal data shows violent crime is at a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>Yue Wa, one of the last old-school grocery markets in Los Angeles' Chinatown, is closing in September after 18 years. Owner Amy Tran cites a combination of factors, including a series of robberies, the economic effects of the pandemic, and a decline in foot traffic due to neighborhood gentrification and fear from recent ICE raids. The market was a vital source of affordable, fresh produce for the area's elderly and low-income residents, a community that has seen other local grocery stores disappear in recent years. The closure marks the loss of a community hub and a testament to the mounting pressures facing small, immigrant-run businesses in rapidly changing urban centers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The definition of "genius" has evolved significantly over centuries, shifting from an innate spiritual essence to a quality sought and measured by science. This historical analysis from The Atlantic's archives explores how the 19th-century quest to understand exceptional talent, influenced by Darwinian theory, led to the field of eugenics, pioneered by Francis Galton. His work, which attempted to classify human intellect, was rooted in racial hierarchies and ultimately justified forced sterilizations in the U.S. and Nazi Germany. The article notes that while modern genetics acknowledges some heritability of intelligence, the making of a genius is far more complex, involving luck, timing, and social conditions, not just inherited traits.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump's lawyers have threatened a lawsuit of over $1 billion against Hunter Biden for claiming she was introduced to her husband by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a legal letter, her attorneys called the claim "false, disparaging, defamatory and inflammatory" and demanded a retraction and apology. Biden made the comment in a recent interview, attributing it partially to a journalist's reporting that was later retracted. In a subsequent interview, Biden defended his comments, stating he would not apologize and that a lawsuit would provide a platform to depose both of the Trumps. There is no evidence supporting the claim.</p>

Ruth, who was supposed to be under constant supervision, was left alone for 15 minutes by an agency staff member who had used fake credentials and had no prior psychiatric hospital experience. During this time, she was able to self-harm in her room at the now-closed Huntercombe Hospital in Berkshire. The jury found that insufficient staff training and unsuitable care contributed to her death.
