          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced strong revenue growth in its first earnings report since its IPO, exceeding analyst expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company anticipates continued growth, projecting revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion for 2025, driven by significant deals such as the $11.9 billion commitment from OpenAI. Despite facing competition from major cloud providers like Amazon, CoreWeave's growth is bolstered by its reliance on Nvidia GPUs and strategic partnerships with companies like Google and Microsoft. The company's future expansion hinges on securing sufficient power for its data centers, with plans to add 300 megawatts of contracted power during the quarter.</p>

          <p>Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks argues that state financial officers have an obligation to combat environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, emphasizing the importance of meritocracy and fiduciary responsibility in investments. Oaks contends that ESG introduces motives that violate fiduciary standards, potentially harming beneficiaries like firefighters, teachers, and police officers who depend on state pensions. He also links DEI to the social aspect of ESG, arguing that it can lead to discriminatory hiring practices that ultimately harm companies and their financial output. Oaks was among state financial officers who cautioned against prioritizing political agendas like DEI over financial returns.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian, and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN) found that Kroger is overcharging customers for items marked as being on sale, with expired discount tags leading to an average overcharge of $1.70 per item. The investigation, prompted by allegations from Kroger employees, examined stores across 14 states and the District of Columbia, finding pricing mistakes at over half of the locations. Kroger disputes the findings, claiming the errors represent a small fraction of overall transactions, but experts warn that such incidents can damage consumer trust, especially as Americans seek value for money amid rising grocery costs.</p>

          <p>Jacob S. Dlamini, a history professor specializing in South African apartheid, disputes the claim that white Afrikaners have a legitimate claim to refugee status, countering President Trump's decision to grant them expedited access to the U.S. as refugees. Dlamini, who grew up under apartheid, argues that Afrikaners have not been persecuted as a group and that they remain a privileged class despite the end of apartheid. He criticizes Trump's reference to the South African government's land reform bill, asserting that no white farmer has had land taken away from them. Dlamini suggests that Trump's policy reflects a broader issue of white men failing to come to terms with democracy in South Africa.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is delaying the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water and reconsidering the allowable levels for others. The compliance deadline for PFOA and PFOS, two of the most common PFAS chemicals, is being extended to 2031, while limits for other chemicals are being rescinded and reconsidered. Environmental advocates have expressed skepticism, fearing the move is about providing cost relief to water systems rather than strengthening protections, while groups representing water utilities praised the decision. The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, affecting approximately 100 million people in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Three wildfires in northern Minnesota have burned nearly 37,000 acres, with the Jenkins Creek Fire growing to over 20,000 acres. The Camp House Fire has destroyed dozens of structures, and officials are investigating suspects accused of starting the fire due to unattended campers. Weather conditions are expected to improve with incoming humidity and potential storms, and the Minnesota National Guard has been activated to aid in the firefighting efforts. Governor Tim Walz has contacted FEMA for potential federal assistance, and a portion of the Laurentian Ranger District is closed to visitors.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform back to HBO Max starting this summer, reversing a decision made just two years ago when it was rebranded as Max. The change reflects a shift in strategy to focus on quality programming and storytelling, emphasizing HBO's reputation for high-quality content. The company's streaming business has improved profitability and added millions of subscribers, and Warner Bros. Discovery aims to reach over 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026.

While the bill has passed the committee stage, it is expected to undergo changes as it moves through the House and Senate.

HELOCs are secured by the borrower's home, contributing to the lower rates, and the variable interest rates on HELOCs are expected to decline further with anticipated rate cuts.

          <p>The Texas-based rock band Lord Buffalo has canceled its European tour after its drummer, Yamal Said, a Mexican citizen and legal permanent resident of the United States, was detained by US Customs and Border Protection. Said was removed from a plane en route to the tour and has had no contact with his bandmates for two days. The band is working with an immigration lawyer to secure his release. Said's arrest comes amid a broader crackdown on immigration and border entry, with several musicians facing issues leaving or entering the US since the Trump administration took office.</p>
