            <p>A plane carrying six family members and partners crashed in an open field near Copake, New York, resulting in multiple fatalities. The NTSB is leading the investigation into the crash, which occurred as the plane was approaching the Columbia County Airport. According to the NTSB, the aircraft was intact before it crashed at a high rate of descent, and air traffic control was unable to contact the pilot after a low altitude alert. Among the deceased were Karenna Groff, an MIT alumna and NYU medical student, along with her father Michael Groff, and James Santoro, another MIT alumnus, leaving the community in mourning. </p>

            <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that Americans are split on whether President Trump has a clear plan for trade and tariffs, but most believe the tariffs are temporary negotiating tactics. A majority anticipates that new tariffs will raise prices, impacting their financial well-being. Consequently, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative. While Republicans are more patient in judging the impact and believe tariffs will create jobs, the public largely views Trump's policies as responsible for the current economic climate. </p>

            <p>Amid stock market panic and treasury bond yield surges, experts suggest a bond ladder strategy to secure 'peace of mind' income. This approach involves investing in a range of treasury maturities, holding them to maturity, and receiving regular income. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) exemplifies this, investing in treasuries from 30-day to 10-year bonds, distributing fixed monthly income until 2035. While ultrashort bond ETFs are popular, bond ladders offer immunization from liabilities and can be a psychological tool for long-term financial planning. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Greenlandic geologist warns that the prospect of a mineral bonanza in Greenland is a mirage. He argues that assumptions about quick riches from untapped resources are overstated. The geologist says there is a lack of detailed knowledge about geology, mining, and minerals, resulting in a mythological misunderstanding of what rare earth elements truly are. He suggests that focusing on developing facilities for processing raw materials and fostering a competitive market would be more effective than acquiring Greenland. </p>

The Trump administration has also moved to reinstate several recently canceled US foreign aid programs for emergency food assistance, showcasing the rapid-fire nature of the cuts to foreign aid. </p>

            <p>The Department of Justice has responded to a motion for relief by attorneys for Kilmer Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador. The DOJ argues that federal courts lack the authority to direct the executive branch to conduct foreign relations or engage with a foreign sovereign. The attorneys for Abrego Garcia requested the court to order the government to make demands of the El Salvadoran government and dispatch personnel and an aircraft to extract him from custody. The DOJ asserts that this request involves interactions with a foreign sovereign and potential violations of that sovereignty. </p>
