          <p>The Supreme Court is set to debate the legality of President Trump's restrictions on birthright citizenship and the use of nationwide injunctions by federal judges. The case, fast-tracked for a ruling, will address whether individual judges can halt temporary enforcement of executive actions across the country. Conservative justices have expressed concerns over the use of universal injunctions, arguing they disrupt the federal court system. The outcome could significantly impact numerous lawsuits against White House actions filed since January 20, testing ideological divides within the court's conservative majority.</p>

          <p>Golfers such as Scheffler, Spieth and DeChambeau have commented on McIlroy's form at the US PGA Championship, with some calling it inspiring. McIlroy recently won all four majors with his triumph at Augusta National. Scheffler said it was cool to see Rory finish that off and to be there for that moment, while Thomas said McIlroy's victory was like a wake-up call. Spieth, who is in search of the only title missing from his majors resume, said watching Rory win after giving it a try for a number of years was inspiring.</p>

The proposal seeks a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, but faces challenges regarding feasibility and U.S. investment.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's office projects that President Trump's tariff policies will reduce state revenues by $16 billion through next year. Despite better-than-expected personal and corporate tax receipts through April, Newsom attributes the expected revenue shortfall to the economic impact of Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Newsom's team is seeking a preliminary injunction to freeze the tariffs in federal court.

Critics argue that the exceptions made for white Afrikaners advance a narrative of global persecution of whites. Experts on the situation in Afghanistan questioned that reasoning, noting that security threats remain and that Afghans who cooperated with U.S. forces during America‚Äôs 20-year occupation remain at extremely high risk of imprisonment, torture or execution.</p>

She isolated useful strains of bacteria called rhizobia which inhabit nodules on soybean roots, capture nitrogen from the air and convert it into a form that feeds the plant. In Brazil, at least, studies have shown that the microbes allow farmers to get by with using less chemical fertilizer, saving money and reducing burdens on the environment.</p>

          <p>Cassandra Ventura, Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, testified in his sexual assault trial, accusing him of controlling her life and coercing her into "humiliating" sex acts. Ventura, who is pregnant, detailed alleged physical and emotional abuse she endured at the hands of Combs during so-called "freak-offs", or sexual encounters the couple had with male escorts. Ventura claimed Combs controlled her appearance and career, and would ‚Äúbash on my head, knock me over, drag me and kick me‚Äù frequently, sometimes through tears. She felt 'humiliated' by 'freak-offs', and claimed she would take myriad drugs to help her perform to Mr Combs' satisfaction, but also to "disassociate".</p>
