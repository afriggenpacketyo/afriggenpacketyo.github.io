          <p>This article explores the evolving power balance at the UN General Assembly, anticipating that China may increase its global influence as the United States, under President Trump, is perceived to be disengaging. Experts suggest Trump's approach, expected to cover topics like Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, prioritizes domestic appeal and personal accolades, potentially creating opportunities for China to assert its leadership without direct confrontation. The analysis indicates a strategic shift where China benefits from US self-goals, highlighting fundamental questions about the UN's future and the broader implications for international relations and institutional reform.</p>

          <p>German decathlete Leo Neugebauer secured a surprising gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, completing a "rollercoaster ride" season that followed his Olympic silver in Paris. The 25-year-old, who trains in the US, achieved his first major title by a narrow margin, excelling in events like discus, javelin, and the 1,500 meters, despite earlier struggles and knee problems. This victory, Germany's sole gold at the championships, also benefited from rivals' misfortunes, marking a significant milestone in his career. Neugebauer now approaches future seasons with a relaxed attitude, eyeing Olympic gold at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has unveiled a controversial policy to scrap Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for migrants, mandating five-year visa reapplications with more stringent requirements, such as increased salary thresholds and English proficiency.

This move would retroactively impact hundreds of thousands of existing migrants, potentially leading to significant uncertainty and mass deportations for those failing to meet the new conditions.

This expansion aims to increase annual flights from 280,000 to approximately 389,000 by the late 2030s, offering more destinations and potentially lower travel costs. However, the decision has drawn fierce criticism from environmental groups and the Green Party, who argue it severely jeopardizes the UK's climate goals and will exacerbate air pollution and noise. New stipulations include enhanced noise mitigation and public transport targets, though critics are exploring legal challenges.</p>

          <h2>Trump-Xi Call Signals New Era of 'Managed Rivalry' for US and China</h2>

          <p>This opinion article posits that a recent "pragmatic, positive and constructive" phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping indicates an emerging paradigm of "managed rivalry" in US-China relations. Despite persistent tensions, the conversation suggests a mutual acknowledgment of interdependence, steering both nations towards accommodation rather than escalation. The article argues that this dynamic establishes a crucial framework for global stability, recognizing the profound economic asymmetry and interconnectedness that would render an all-out conflict mutually destructive. This shift represents a significant evolution from earlier anxieties about an intensified pursuit of American primacy under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to lead a diplomatic push at the UN General Assembly, advocating for "robust action" against Russia amidst escalating concerns that the conflict could spread to NATO territory. Despite President Trump's attempts to mediate a ceasefire and Zelenskyy's offer to meet President Putin, Moscow has shown no willingness to make concessions, continuing its military assault. The article details recent alleged Russian incursions into Polish and Estonian airspace, which NATO allies interpret as tests of their collective response. Zelenskyy's visit aims to garner support for intensified sanctions, particularly targeting Russia's oil and energy trade.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's recently established mutual defense pact with Pakistan is not expected to disrupt its vital energy trade relationship with India, a significant crude oil consumer, according to a senior source. The article indicates that Riyadh is focused on enhancing its security through diversified alliances, rather than jeopardizing its commercial interests. India, a major global crude importer, views Saudi Arabia as a top supplier, despite its longstanding conflict with Pakistan. Furthermore, the piece refutes persistent speculation about Saudi Arabia moving away from US dollar pricing for oil, affirming the dollar's foundational role in its exports.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed extending the New START nuclear arms control treaty by one year, contingent on US President Donald Trump's agreement, to maintain the existing status quo for global non-proliferation. This treaty, which limits strategic nuclear warheads, is due to expire in February 2026, with renewal talks currently stalled due to ongoing tensions over the war in Ukraine. Putin's offer aims to facilitate dialogue with Washington, emphasizing Russia's willingness to voluntarily adhere to numerical limits if the US reciprocates and refrains from actions that could undermine the balance of deterrence capabilities.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te's approval rating has sharply declined, with over 60% of eligible voters expressing dissatisfaction with his management of cross-strait relations, according to a recent United Daily News survey. His positive ratings have fallen dramatically from 44% to just 26% within 16 months of his term. The poll indicates growing public anxiety over Lai's leadership amidst escalating military pressure from Beijing, as a majority of respondents favor dialogue over confrontation with mainland China.

Several key US allies, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Malta, and San Marino, are poised to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, defying strong opposition from the US and Israel. Israeli Prime Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed retaliation, vehemently rejecting a Palestinian state and labeling such recognition a "reward to terror."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the unexpected downsides of the multibillion-dollar self-help industry, questioning if its relentless pursuit of individual optimization contributes to societal isolation. Author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro, informed by her book "Promise Land," traces the historical trajectory of self-help and its pervasive cultural impact. While recognizing its potential benefits, she critically argues that the industry's focus on betterment and productivity often overlooks the vital role of community and human connection. The article suggests that an over-reliance on self-help can inadvertently weaken interpersonal relationships and exacerbate feelings of loneliness, advocating for collective engagement over purely individualistic improvement strategies.</p>

          <p>Dominican Republic authorities have announced the recovery of 377 packages of cocaine from a speedboat that was destroyed by the US Navy, as part of a controversial anti-narcotics mission in the southern Caribbean. This joint operation, described as historic, targeted a vessel allegedly transporting 1,000 kilograms of drugs, aiming to transit through the Dominican Republic to the United States. The Trump administration's naval deployment, including warships and a submarine, has drawn sharp criticism from human rights groups, who condemn the destruction of vessels and associated fatalities as extrajudicial killings.

Early clinical trials indicate that leucovorin may improve social communication in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Concurrently, the White House is reportedly preparing to suggest a link between paracetamol use in early pregnancy and an increased risk of autism, a claim that contradicts established medical guidelines. This initiative unfolds amid rising autism diagnoses and the influence of Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., known for his anti-vaccine stance and controversial medical advice.</p>
