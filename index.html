          <p>Tom Lehrer, the acclaimed musical satirist and Harvard-educated mathematician, has passed away at the age of 97. Known for his acerbic and witty songs in the 1950s and '60s, Lehrer tackled controversial topics such as militarism, racial conflict, and societal norms with dark humor. His self-produced 1953 album became an underground success, and he later contributed to the satirical news show "That Was the Week That Was." After largely retiring from public performance in the late 1960s, he dedicated himself to academia but left a lasting influence on generations of comedians and satirists.</p>

          <h2>Political Economist Yuen Yuen Ang Discusses China's Path Through Global Crises</h2>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Johns Hopkins University professor Yuen Yuen Ang analyzes China's current political and economic challenges, which she terms a 'polycrisis'. She suggests that these overlapping crises could be transformed into a 'polytunity' for adaptive development. Ang reflects on the historical context of U.S.-China relations, highlighting the deep investment early American experts made in understanding China. She expresses concern that the current decline in American students studying in China could lead to a diminished knowledge base, hindering effective diplomacy and mutual understanding in a complex world.</p>

          <p>The successful opening weekend of "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," which earned $118 million domestically, is being cited as evidence against the theory of "superhero fatigue." The film's strong debut, along with the recent success of DC's "Superman," suggests that audiences are still highly interested in comic book movies, provided they are well-made. This article discusses how the positive box office returns for these major titles are helping to dismiss the notion that the genre is in decline. Instead, analysts suggest that recent underperformers were likely a result of poor quality rather than a lack of audience interest in superheroes.</p>

          <p>The latest film adaptation of Marvel's first family, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," has debuted with a strong box office performance, earning an estimated $118 million in North America. This marks the fourth-largest opening of the year and the biggest for a Marvel film since last summer's "Deadpool & Wolverine." The film, which also grossed $100 million internationally for a global debut of $218 million, is the first iteration of the superhero team produced under the direct guidance of Walt Disney Co. and Kevin Feige. Its success, alongside DC's recent "Superman" movie, suggests that audience appetite for superhero films remains high.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a new 15% baseline tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., including automobiles. The deal, announced by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, averts the previously threatened 30% rate. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making an additional $600 billion in investments in the United States. While some European leaders expressed relief at avoiding a trade war, they also noted the challenges posed by the new, higher tariff levels.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland, with transatlantic trade and the conflict in Gaza expected to be the main topics of discussion. The meeting follows the recent announcement of a broad U.S.-EU trade deal, and Starmer is likely to press for favorable terms on remaining UK-specific tariffs. The Prime Minister will also navigate a delicate diplomatic position on the Middle East, balancing the U.S. stance with that of European allies like France, which recently announced its intention to recognize a Palestinian state.

          <p>The newly announced trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union provides political victories for both President Trump and European Commission President von der Leyen, though the long-term implications remain uncertain. For the EU, the 15% tariff is preferable to the 30% that was threatened, while the U.S. anticipates significant tariff revenue and a $600 billion influx of EU investment. This analysis suggests the agreement is a landmark moment, demonstrating President Trump's focus on renegotiating global trade terms. However, crucial details regarding the timeline and specifics of the EU's investments are still unknown, leaving room for future complexities.</p>

He asserted that the President's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell stems from a desire for monetary policy that aligns with global trends of rate reduction, not from a plan to overhaul the institution's structure.

          <p>Jordan and the UAE have resumed aid airdrops into Gaza following Israel's announcement of a daily "tactical pause" in fighting in certain areas to facilitate humanitarian assistance. The World Health Organization has warned that malnutrition in the territory has reached "alarming levels" and is on a "dangerous trajectory." Despite the pause, medics reported casualties near an aid convoy route, and an airstrike was geolocated in an area designated for the cessation of operations. International officials continue to stress that while airdrops provide some relief, sustainable land routes are essential to address the severe and widespread hunger crisis.</p>

          <p>Despite the historic Euro 2025 victory by England's Lionesses, Downing Street currently has no plans to declare a national bank holiday to mark the occasion. This stance is consistent with the government's decision following the team's previous Euro win in 2022 and the men's World Cup victory in 1966. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously supported the idea of a celebratory day off, the economic cost, estimated to be over £1 billion, is likely a significant factor. Instead of a holiday, the team will be honored with a public parade and a ceremony outside Buckingham Palace.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has officially won his fourth Tour de France, concluding the race with a comfortable lead of over four minutes. The final stage in Paris featured a novel route that included several circuits of the steep Montmartre hill before the traditional finish on the Champs-Elysées. While Wout van Aert won the final stage sprint, Pogačar's dominant performance throughout the three-week race was never in doubt. The addition of the challenging Montmartre climb was met with mixed reactions from riders, who cited concerns over safety and the break from tradition.</p>

Despite visible signs of injury during the recent Test against India, Stokes continued to bowl, highlighting his immense value and sense of responsibility to the team. The article notes that Stokes's bowling has been exceptionally effective, but his long-term availability for crucial series like the Ashes is paramount.
