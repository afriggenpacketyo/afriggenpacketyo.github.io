          <p>In a significant move, Elon Musk's business interests are expanding in India, with Tesla opening its first showroom in Mumbai and Starlink receiving regulatory approval for its satellite internet service. This expansion is seen as a strategic pivot, offering a new growth market as Musk's relationships in the U.S. and China become more complex. However, challenges remain, including the high price point of Tesla vehicles for the Indian market and the need to build out a robust charging infrastructure. The success of these ventures could pave the way for a new wave of foreign investment in the country.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, significantly surpassing market estimates due to sustained high demand for artificial intelligence chips. The company projects third-quarter revenue to grow by 38% and expects full-year 2025 revenue to rise by around 30%, driven by its industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies. Advanced chips account for 74% of TSMC's wafer revenue, though the company faces potential headwinds from U.S. trade policies and a strengthening Taiwan dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new animated musical "Smurfs" film, featuring Rihanna as the voice of Smurfette, is prompting discussions about a long-standing Hollywood trope known as the "Smurfette principle." Coined in 1991, the term describes the common practice of including a single female character in an otherwise all-male ensemble cast. The article explores how this concept has been reflected and even challenged within the Smurfs franchise itself over the years, including in the 2017 film "Smurfs: The Lost Village," which introduced an entire village of female Smurfs.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is weakening, with official statistics showing that the annual rate of pay growth slowed to 5% while the unemployment rate rose to 4.7%, its highest level in four years. The number of job vacancies has also continued to fall, reaching a ten-year low outside of the pandemic period. Economists suggest that these cooling indicators make it more probable that the Bank of England will cut interest rates in August to help stimulate the sluggish economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sweden-based Volvo Cars is altering its U.S. strategy to cope with the financial impact of trade tariffs, which has contributed to a significant drop in its quarterly operating profit. The automaker, owned by China's Geely Holding, plans to add production of its best-selling XC60 SUV to its factory in South Carolina, a move designed to better utilize the plant and mitigate tariff costs. Simultaneously, the company is reducing its sedan and station wagon offerings in the U.S. due to waning consumer interest and the challenging tariff environment.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated his desire to ship more advanced semiconductors to China, beyond the H20 AI chip that was recently cleared for sale after a previous ban. During a press conference in Beijing, Huang argued that as technology constantly improves, the products allowed for sale in China should also be permitted to advance over time. His comments highlight the company's delicate position, balancing a massive market opportunity with the complexities of U.S. export control policies.</p>

          <p>In response to concerns over a $140 million funding gap, the White House has clarified that a key federal fentanyl overdose prevention program will be paid for, but in a new manner. The funds will now be disbursed "in increments" rather than in a single annual payment, a change that has created significant uncertainty and potential disruption for state and local public health departments. Officials in states like Vermont have already paused spending due to the lack of clarity on when the full funding will arrive.</p>

          <p>U.S. air traffic controllers are voicing deep frustration, arguing that government plans to modernize equipment fail to address the system's most critical problems. According to controllers, chronic understaffing, grueling six-day workweeks, stagnating pay, and an overall decline in quality of life are the real issues leading to plummeting morale. Many feel that despite recent public attention on aviation safety, their fundamental concerns are being ignored by both the FAA and union leadership, making the job increasingly stressful.</p>
