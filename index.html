          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple must ease restrictions on its App Store and cease collecting commissions on certain app sales, marking a major victory for Epic Games in a long-running antitrust case. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found Apple in willful violation of a previous injunction, accusing the company of anticompetitive conduct and attempts to circumvent the court's order. The ruling requires Apple to allow developers to include external links for direct payments, potentially reducing costs for consumers and increasing revenue for developers. Apple plans to comply with the order but will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A US district judge has referred Apple to the US Attorney for Northern District of California for possible criminal contempt investigation after finding that the company willfully violated an injunction related to its App Store policies. The case stems from a 2021 ruling in favor of Epic Games, which challenged Apple's practice of requiring developers to use its payment system and charging a commission on purchases. The judge stated that Apple deliberately interfered with competition and accused a top Apple executive of lying under oath. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has proposed a peace offering, suggesting that Epic Games would return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation if Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have formalized an agreement to establish a "reconstruction investment" fund, aiming to bolster Ukraine's economic recovery following Russia's invasion. The agreement, reached after months of tense negotiations, grants the US privileged access to Ukrainian resources crucial for high-tech industries, while Ukraine retains full ownership of its mineral resources. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the agreement signals the Trump Administration's commitment to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine. The Ukrainian parliament must ratify the agreement before it can take effect.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has requested additional time to address the US economy's contraction, which occurred for the first time in three years, raising concerns about a potential recession. Trump attributed the downturn to companies stockpiling imports in anticipation of his tariff implementations, claiming the figure was misleading. Despite the economic contraction, Trump highlighted $8 trillion in promised inward investment, which he believes will revitalize American manufacturing. The US economy experienced a 0.3% annual contraction, a significant decline from the previous quarter's 2.4% growth.</p>

          <p>A judge has found that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction stemming from the Epic Games case and that Apple Vice President of Finance Alex Roman "outright lied" under oath.

The court has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys to investigate potential criminal contempt proceedings against Roman and Apple. The judge ordered Apple to cease imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps and to pay Epic Games' attorney fees.</p>

The outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, with Justices Alito and Kavanaugh appearing sympathetic to the school's argument against unconstitutional discrimination. Conversely, the liberal justices expressed concerns about weakening the separation between church and state. A ruling in favor of the school could disrupt laws in many states requiring charter schools to be nonsectarian.</p>

          <p>The United States will share future revenues from Ukraineâ€™s mineral reserves under a deal announced by the Trump administration that creates a joint investment fund between the countries. The agreement, which follows months of negotiations, is intended to give President Trump a personal stake in Ukraineâ€™s fate while addressing his concerns about US financial support. While the details of the agreement are not fully clear, Ukrainian officials indicate that the two countries will have equal voting rights over the fund and that Ukraine will retain full control over its subsoil, infrastructure, and natural resources.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at LAX discovered 17.41 pounds of liquid methamphetamine concealed in plastic bottles labeled as dog shampoo in an air cargo shipment destined for Australia. Officials estimate the street value of the recovered drugs to be more than $1.8 million. The officers found a "crystallized white substance" that tested positive for methamphetamine when they opened the 12 brightly colored bottles. Smugglers have tried to use a variety of creative methods to sneak meth in and out of the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board has voted in favor of higher rents for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs faced by landlords. The preliminary vote supports increases of 1.75 to 4.75 percent on one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent on two-year leases, with a final decision expected in the coming months. Tenant advocates argue that the increases will exacerbate the housing crisis, while landlords contend they are insufficient to cover rising expenses. The board's decision reflects the ongoing tension between protecting tenants and ensuring the financial viability of rent-stabilized buildings.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators have concluded a controlled fire in Pacific Palisades, hoping to determine the cause of the January blaze that killed a dozen people and destroyed thousands of homes. The fire test involved setting fire to parts of the Temescal Ridge Trail to analyze flame location and size. Investigators are exploring whether an earlier 8-acre blaze sparked by fireworks a week prior had reignited during a windstorm. The cause of the fire is believed to be human-related, given the absence of power poles and the trail's high traffic.</p>

          <p>An effort to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed in the Senate, as Republicans largely opposed the measure. The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. Despite the defeat, anxieties persist over the economic impact of the tariffs, with economic growth slowing in the first quarter of 2025. Senate Majority Leader John Thune suggested that the tariff issue would take time to realize results, while House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed limited openness to congressional intervention.</p>

The deal is a 50/50 partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that includes development of mineral, oil and gas projects, and does not set up any Ukrainian debt obligations.

The nationâ€™s gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp political jolt and an economic warning. It came at the end of a quarter in which stock prices were down sharply, and only added to the widespread uncertainty among businesses and consumers about what the rest of the year might hold. Some of Mr. Trumpâ€™s economic advisers now recognize that the timing and execution of his tariff announcements could prove to be colossal mistakes.</p>
