          <p>A young couple working for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum. Police have arrested Elias Rodriguez, who allegedly shouted "free, free Palestine" during the attack, and the incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime and act of terror. The victims were attending a networking event at the museum, and Israeli officials have condemned the attack as antisemitic, while President Trump also denounced the killings. The event was hosted by the American Jewish Committee, and the museum will reopen with increased security measures in the coming days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, granted President Trump a stay on a lower court order, allowing him to remove heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board without cause, a move previously deemed illegal. The conservative majority argued that the president's executive power allows him to remove officers exercising executive power, while the dissenting justices emphasized the importance of congressional will and precedent. The ruling also addressed concerns regarding the Federal Reserve, asserting that the case does not necessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for Federal Reserve board members, as the Federal Reserve is structured uniquely as a quasi-private entity. The decision has been closely watched due to its implications for the president's control over independent agencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision, while allowing President Trump to remove members of other federal agencies' boards, implies that Federal Reserve board members have greater protection against presidential firings. The court stated that challenges to terminations did not necessarily implicate the Federal Reserve due to its unique, quasi-private structure, suggesting any presidential attempt to fire a Federal Reserve board member would likely face strong legal resistance. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell previously stated that the president lacks the power to fire him. This ruling provides insight into the judiciary's view on the Federal Reserve's independence, amid ongoing scrutiny of the relationship between the executive branch and the central bank.</p>

In Doha, Trump claimed that the United States was very close to securing a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons program, suggesting Tehran had "sort of agreed to the terms."

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into the admissions system at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia, alleging discrimination against Asian American students. The inquiry is based on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The school changed its admissions process in 2020 to diversify its student body, leading to a decrease in the percentage of Asian students and an increase in Black, Hispanic, and low-income students. The investigation revives a legal battle over the school's admissions policy, which has faced scrutiny and debate over its impact on different racial groups.</p>

While gas prices are down, other vacation-related expenses, such as entertainment and dining out, have increased. The states with the lowest average gas prices are primarily in the South, while California and Hawaii have the highest prices.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have developed blood and urine tests that can detect the amount of ultraprocessed foods a person consumes. The tests use machine learning to identify metabolites correlated with processed food intake, creating a "biomarker score" to predict consumption levels. The findings, published in PLOS Medicine, aim to reduce errors associated with self-reported dietary questionnaires. Researchers hope the method can be used in future studies to link processed food consumption with chronic diseases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>David Brooks Analyzes Populist Narratives in American Politics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Brooks critiques the populist narrative promoted by figures like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, which idealizes a bygone era of American manufacturing and blames globalization for economic decline. Brooks argues that this narrative is historically inaccurate, pointing out that the supposed era of pure globalization never existed and that median wages have grown since NAFTA and the WTO. He contends that manufacturing job losses are primarily due to increased productivity and technological advancements, not neoliberalism or globalization. Brooks concludes that the forces driving populism are more about cultural values, immigration, and social distrust than economic decline.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, commonly known as weight loss drugs, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. The observational study compared the effects of GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP-4) inhibitors in adults with obesity and diabetes. Researchers found that patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause. The authors hope to continue their research with larger populations and those without diabetes.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that alcohol-associated cancer deaths in the United States doubled between 1990 and 2021, with significantly higher mortality rates among males and those over age 55. The study, using data from the Global Burden of Disease database, highlights the critical need for targeted prevention efforts and increased awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer development. Excessive alcohol consumption is linked to several types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, liver, and esophageal cancers. Experts recommend limiting alcohol consumption and addressing social ties to alcohol to reduce cancer risk.</p>

          <p>Over 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have entered the Gaza Strip after a three-day delay at the Kerem Shalom crossing, following an easing of an 11-week blockade by Israel. The aid, including flour, baby food, and medical equipment, was collected by UN teams and distributed to warehouses, with bakeries resuming bread production. However, the UN stated that the amount is "nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza," as the territory faces acute hunger and shortages of basic foods. The UN and other agencies have said they will not co-operate with a US-Israeli plan, saying it contradicts fundamental humanitarian principles and appears to "weaponise aid".</p>
