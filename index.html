        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized President Trump's decision to deploy additional troops to Los Angeles amid protests against immigration raids, calling it a "deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president." The state is pursuing legal action against the president, arguing that the deployment violates the US Constitution and California's sovereignty. Protests have spread to other cities, with demonstrators expressing outrage over ICE raids and resulting in arrests for various offenses, including assault and looting. The LAPD reported using hundreds of less-than-lethal rounds during the weekend to manage the unrest. Optimism surrounding the resolution of this situation is tempered by the ongoing legal challenges and the charged rhetoric from both sides.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's restrictions on rare earth exports, initially impacting the automotive and robotics sectors, are now raising concerns for Western defense giants. As US and Chinese officials resume trade talks, the restrictions, imposed in response to US tariffs, require firms to apply for export licenses for these critical minerals. Rare earth elements are crucial for advanced defense technologies, including radar systems and fighter jet construction. While some licenses have been granted to automotive suppliers, the defense industry remains vulnerable, prompting calls for coordinated efforts to boost rare earth production outside of China. This development introduces uncertainty into global supply chains and geopolitical dynamics.</p>

          <p>Marks and Spencer has resumed online orders after a cyberattack in April disrupted services and impacted profits, but the retailer is still working to fully restore its online operations. Shoppers can now purchase fashion items for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with beauty and homeware products to follow. The cyberattack, which affected click and collect services and contactless payments, is estimated to cost the company around Â£300 million in profits. While some customer data was stolen, M&S assures that payment details and passwords were not compromised, though some customers report limited stock availability and delayed communication.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reported that over 100 people were arrested during late-night protests against federal immigration sweeps, with the mayor attributing the violent protesting and vandalism to "fringe groups" rather than those supporting immigrants. The majority of arrests were for unlawful assembly, and those arrested will be evaluated for active warrants. The mayor emphasized that these late-night incidents are separate from the peaceful protests that occurred earlier in the day, which focused on advocating for immigrant rights and calling for an end to the raids.

          <p>With millions of Americans struggling with unpaid medical debt, experts suggest exploring debt relief options such as credit counseling, debt settlement, and debt management plans. Credit counseling offers budget and payment prioritization assistance, while debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to reduce the owed amount. Debt management plans consolidate debt repayment through a provider, potentially streamlining the process. Experts also advise negotiating directly with healthcare providers, inquiring about financial assistance programs, and scrutinizing bills for errors, while cautioning against using credit cards or loans to cover medical expenses.

The incident has sparked concerns about rising tensions and the need for thorough investigations into both the alleged sexual assault and the subsequent violence, with police investigating a report of arson in Cullybackey as a racially-motivated hate crime.</p>

The new services aim to meet strong demand for train travel across Europe, reducing travel time between London and Frankfurt to about five hours, and to Geneva in approximately five hours and 20 minutes. However, the expansion hinges on securing sufficient space at its depot in east London, which is also being sought by other firms looking to operate services between London and mainland Europe. The Office of Rail and Road is currently reviewing proposals to determine depot usage, potentially impacting Eurostar's expansion plans.</p>

The House of Representatives has already passed a bill that would cut billions from health programs like Medicaid and the ACA, potentially causing millions to lose their insurance. This situation is complicated by the fact that many Republicans are self-employed and rely on ACA plans, and many reside in states that did not expand Medicaid, making them more reliant on ACA subsidies. The proposed cuts could disproportionately affect Republican voters who depend on these healthcare programs.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has launched the Switch 2, its first new game console in eight years, aiming to build on the success of the original Switch, which sold 15 million units in its first year. The Switch 2 features a bigger screen, improved performance, and a higher price tag of $450. Despite the higher price, the console sold out quickly upon release, with the company expecting to sell 15 million units in its first year. Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser highlighted the enhanced gameplay and social features as key upgrades, emphasizing the company's commitment to creating the next generation of gaming platforms.</p>

This focus follows mentions of mitochondria by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Casey Means, who link mitochondrial dysfunction to various health issues. While scientists acknowledge the importance of mitochondria in cellular energy and certain diseases, the wellness industry is criticized for overstating their role and promoting products with dubious scientific backing. Experts caution against relying solely on supplements and lifestyle changes for genetically caused mitochondrial diseases and stress the importance of evidence-based medical advice.</p>

          <p>The United States risks undermining its soft power by alienating Chinese students, despite resuming the processing of student and exchange visitor visas. The Trump administration's visa restrictions have sent mixed messages, with President Trump stating that the US loves to have Chinese students while also indicating that some students cause "troubles". These restrictions have disproportionately affected Chinese students, who constitute a significant portion of international enrollment at universities like Harvard. The situation highlights the delicate balance between national security concerns and maintaining the US as a welcoming destination for international students.</p>

          <p>Republicans, traditionally focused on deficit reduction through spending cuts, face challenges as tax cuts have significantly contributed to the national debt. The US collects less revenue as a share of GDP compared to other developed countries, and the GOP's anti-tax stance limits their ability to address the structural deficit. While some Republicans propose tax hikes on the wealthy, this faces strong opposition within the party. The article suggests exploring options such as ending tax breaks for the wealthy and increasing IRS enforcement to close the gap between taxes owed and collected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts warn that dirty hummingbird feeders can be deadly to the birds, as spoiled sugar water attracts harmful microbes that cause infections. These infections, such as candida, can cause the birds' tongues to swell, leading to starvation. Experts recommend cleaning feeders every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in the summer, using hot water or a vinegar and water solution. Planting native hummingbird-friendly wildflowers is also suggested as an alternative or supplementary food source, ensuring a safe and healthy environment for the birds.</p>
