          <p>Nvidia reported strong second-quarter earnings, with sales surging 56% to $46.74 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, slightly exceeding analyst expectations. This performance was primarily driven by robust demand for AI infrastructure, which CEO Jensen Huang projects will reach $3-4 trillion in spending by the end of the decade, signaling an immense market opportunity. However, the company faces significant uncertainty regarding its future in the crucial Chinese market, where geopolitical tensions and unfinalized agreements on chip sales continue to cloud the outlook. Despite these challenges, analysts maintain a positive long-term view, emphasizing Nvidia's dominant position in the burgeoning AI sector and its consistent growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging her attempted removal from the board, which she argues is an "unprecedented and illegal attempt." Her attorney contends that President Trump's allegations of mortgage fraud, related to private applications made before her Senate confirmation, do not constitute "cause" as explicitly required by the Federal Reserve Act for a governor's dismissal. This legal battle underscores significant concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence, particularly given Trump's history of criticizing its interest rate policies. A hearing is set to determine the legality of her termination, with Cook seeking to affirm her position and have the firing declared unlawful. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police special constable, James Bubb (now identifying as Gwyn Samuels), has been found guilty of sexual assault against a child and a woman. Bubb groomed his first victim online, then sexually assaulted her when she was 12, and later sexually assaulted another woman he met online while posing as a teenager. Investigators described Bubb as a "dangerous, predatory sex offender" who leveraged his position to intimidate victims. This case underscores a severe breach of public trust by a law enforcement officer and highlights critical issues regarding online safety for young people. Sentencing is set for December, with child protection charities advocating for victim support and increased accountability for tech platforms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy grew at a robust 3.3% annualized pace in the second quarter, exceeding both initial estimates and analyst forecasts. This stronger-than-expected expansion was primarily driven by a 1.6% rise in consumer spending and a significant jump in final sales to private domestic purchasers, a key indicator for the Federal Reserve. Despite the unusual impact of tariffs on trade numbers and a contraction in the first quarter, the economy showed resilience. Experts project a slower growth rate of around 1.5% for the third quarter as the full effects of tariffs may become more visible to consumers. Inflation-related estimates remained stable, aligning with the Fed's target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia launched a "massive" overnight attack on Kyiv, killing at least 18 people, including four children, and damaging the EU delegation's office. European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen and Emmanuel Macron, strongly condemned the "deliberate" strikes, accusing Russia of terrorizing Ukraine and sabotaging ongoing peace efforts. This severe escalation occurred amidst renewed diplomatic attempts for a ceasefire, which have involved President Trump and an inconclusive summit with Vladimir Putin. The international community is intensifying calls for Russia to return to negotiations and is considering further sanctions in response to the continued aggression against civilian targets.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school church tragically killed two children and injured 17 people during morning mass. Police Chief Brian O’Hara credited the church's locked doors with saving "countless lives," as the shooter, Robin Westman, was unable to gain entry and fired through windows from outside. Westman, 23, died by suicide, and investigators are actively searching for a motive, examining disturbing online posts and a scheduled manifesto. The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, prompting widespread grief and calls for community unity.</p>

          <p>Florida is deploying 120 robot rabbits in the Everglades as an innovative strategy to combat the invasive Burmese python population. These solar-powered robots are designed to mimic real marsh rabbits by emitting heat, a natural smell, and realistic movements, thereby luring the elusive snakes into monitored pens for humane removal. Burmese pythons, which proliferated after escaping from captivity, have severely impacted native wildlife, eliminating up to 95% of small mammals in Everglades National Park. While the project is in its infancy, officials express optimism that this detection method, complementing existing hunting programs, will help mitigate the significant environmental damage caused by the species.</p>

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the action as "illegal and unjustified," warning of unspecified retaliatory measures and urging the E3 countries to reconsider.

Despite the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center's strict no-smoking policy, New York's 2021 legalization of recreational cannabis permits legal consumption in the adjacent Corona Park, from where the scent frequently drifts. Tournament officials are vigilant but acknowledge their limited jurisdiction outside the grounds. This cultural shift presents a unique challenge, contrasting the sport's traditional decorum with the city's more relaxed stance on cannabis use, impacting athlete concentration.</p>

          <p>A new statewide poll by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies reveals strong bipartisan support for the University of California system among registered California voters. Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans value UC's research, medical centers, and its crucial role in student advancement, despite the Trump administration's ongoing battles with the university over funding cuts and allegations of antisemitism. While Democrats show higher support for increased taxpayer funding, Republicans still express significant approval across various UC contributions. This finding notably contrasts with national trends of declining confidence in higher education, highlighting UC's unique and resilient standing in the state.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for discounts under a new grant scheme aimed at accelerating the transition from petrol and diesel cars. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier will receive the maximum £3,750 discount, with 26 other models qualifying for £1,500 reductions. These grants, part of a £650 million scheme, are intended to make EVs more affordable, bringing their prices closer to conventional cars. While the initiative is welcomed by some, concerns remain about upfront costs and the need for more public charging points to facilitate widespread adoption by the 2030 new petrol/diesel car ban.

The proposed amendment would allow for an average of 182 days let over several years and include charity donations towards the target. While the government claims to have "listened" to feedback, critics from Welsh-language societies and self-caterers argue the changes are insufficient and fail to address the "real crisis" facing Welsh tourism, advocating for a lower occupancy threshold to prevent properties from being reclassified as second homes.

          <p>An injunction temporarily blocking the housing of asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel in Epping is being challenged in the Court of Appeal by the Home Office and the hotel owners. Lawyers argue that the High Court ruling, which ordered the removal of 138 asylum seekers, could set a damaging precedent, potentially sparking further protests and impacting the Home Office's ability to fulfill its legal duties to migrants. The council successfully argued the hotel's use breached planning laws, following local protests and a sexual assault charge against a migrant housed there.

          <p>Kenya's political class is embroiled in a debate over corruption following President William Ruto's accusation that MPs are taking bribes, coinciding with a survey revealing pervasive graft in ministries. The 2024 National Ethics and Corruption Survey highlights that citizens frequently pay bribes for basic services, with most cases going unreported. While Ruto vowed to arrest both givers and receivers, critics demand proof and argue against collective blame, emphasizing individual accountability. Analysts point to systemic failures and weak enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Civil society groups advocate for digital service delivery and stronger whistle-blower protections as constructive paths toward accountability and rebuilding public trust.</p>
