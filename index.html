          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will be honored with a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his role in upholding the constitutional transfer of power on January 6, 2021. The JFK Library Foundation recognized Pence for resisting pressure from Donald Trump to overturn the 2020 election results, a decision that put his life and career at risk. Pence, who has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party since leaving office, will receive the award from Caroline Kennedy and Jack Schlossberg at the JFK Library in Boston. President Kennedy's book, *Profiles in Courage*, profiles senators who took principled stands and faced criticism as a result.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-focused fundraising dinners this month, one targeting wealthy political donors and another aimed at meme coin millionaires. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate dinner, will feature David Sacks, who has been influential in shaping crypto and AI regulations. The second dinner will grant access to Trump's inner circle to the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP token, determined by a blockchain-based contest. While the $TRUMP contest terms do not guarantee access to Trump, it has significantly increased demand for the coin and generated substantial trading fees for insiders, with roughly 80% of the token supply controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliates.</p>

          <p>Spanish police have launched an investigation into the theft of copper cables from the high-speed train line connecting Madrid and Andalusia, which caused significant disruptions for thousands of commuters. Transport Minister Oscar Puente described the incident as a "serious act of sabotage," and authorities are seeking information to assist with the investigation. The theft affected services between Madrid and Toledo, as well as Madrid and Andalusia, leaving many passengers stranded in trains or at railway stations overnight. The center-right opposition party has called for an audit of the rail network and compensation for affected travelers, while the ruling party has accused the opposition of exploiting the incident for political gain.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has approved plans for its forces to capture the entire Gaza Strip and maintain control of the territory for an unspecified duration, according to Israeli officials. This plan entails a significant expansion of Israel's military operations, potentially displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to southern Gaza and intensifying the existing humanitarian crisis. The European Union has voiced concerns, urging restraint to prevent further casualties and suffering among the Palestinian population. Israel aims to prevent Hamas from distributing humanitarian aid, accusing the group of using aid to strengthen its control. The plan also involves increased strikes against Hamas targets and discussions with other nations about relocating Gaza's population, with the US voicing support for Israel's plan.</p>

          <p>Rwanda has confirmed that it is in the early stages of discussions with the Trump administration regarding the acceptance of migrants deported from the United States. Foreign Affairs Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe stated that Rwanda believes in giving migrants "another chance," referencing Rwanda's prior agreement with the UK to accept deported migrants, a plan that was ultimately abandoned. The Trump administration has focused on speeding up the removal of undocumented migrants, and Rwanda has previously been criticized for its human rights record, raising concerns about the safety of deported individuals. El Salvador, Panama, and Costa Rica have also agreed to accept migrants deported from the US.</p>

          <p>New York City owes at least $1 billion to nonprofit organizations for over 7,000 unpaid invoices, according to a report by the city comptroller. These organizations provide critical social services to vulnerable New Yorkers, including shelter for the homeless, child and elder care, and legal services for immigrants. The city's late payments are due to bureaucratic delays, staffing shortages, and glitches in a new payment portal. Nonprofits are forced to borrow money to stay afloat, incurring significant interest costs. Mayor Eric Adams announced plans to increase advance payments to contractors, but deeper reforms are needed to address the systemic issues.</p>

          <p>Employees at a Norwegian fruit distributor discovered a large quantity of cocaine hidden within a shipment of bananas, leading to the seizure of 147 kilos of the drug. The haul, estimated to have a street value of $16.4 million, is the largest in Norway since 2023. The drugs were smuggled by sea from South America and transported through Sweden, likely intended for pickup at the Antwerp port. Customs officials believe a large criminal network is responsible for the attempted smuggling.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that CD interest rates are likely to remain steady or slightly decrease in May 2025, influenced by the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting and potential future rate cuts. While an increase in CD rates is unlikely, the stability or slight decrease suggests savers should consider locking in rates now to maximize returns. Factors such as ongoing economic uncertainty and inflation will play a role in the Fed's decision, impacting the CD rate climate. Shorter CD terms may offer higher interest rates due to market uncertainty, but savers should compare options and consider early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are clashing over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which are crucial for some of their constituents, particularly in rural Alaska. The credits have enabled communities like Noatak to install solar farms and reduce reliance on expensive diesel fuel. However, President Trump's efforts to defund the law and hard-right Republicans' demands for its repeal have created uncertainty, jeopardizing projects and leaving villagers unsure of their financial future. Senator Lisa Murkowski is a vocal proponent of keeping the tax credits, emphasizing their importance for isolated communities that cannot benefit from natural gas pipelines.</p>

          <p>Footwear giant Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, ending its nearly three-decade run as a public company.

          <p>China's military drills near Taiwan have raised concerns about the island's energy security in the event of a blockade. Taiwan relies heavily on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and energy imports, making it vulnerable.

Some advocate for increasing renewable energy sources and restarting the island's nuclear program to enhance energy security, though nuclear plants could also be targets in wartime.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's recent BBC interview, filled with complaints and explanations, has highlighted the royal family's ongoing struggles with effective communication. Despite the traditional motto of "never complain, never explain," the interview revealed too much without conveying any concrete information. King Charles, while nominally adhering to the rule, has used friends to speak on his behalf, creating a tawdry and inauthentic impression. The article argues that the royal family's long-standing discretion often leads to larger communication failures, as seen in the late Queen Elizabeth's awkward response to Princess Diana's death.</p>
