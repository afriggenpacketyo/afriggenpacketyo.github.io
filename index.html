          <p>The Trump administration has imposed restrictions on Harvard University's ability to admit international students, a move the university decries as retaliatory and illegal. The proclamation suspends the entry of foreign students or exchange visitors planning to attend Harvard, citing concerns that the school is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student programs. Harvard argues the order violates its First Amendment rights and has vowed to protect its international students, who make up a significant portion of the student body. The administration has repeatedly targeted Harvard, seeking to cut off federal funding and alter disciplinary practices, alleging the school has failed to address antisemitism and is being punished for protected speech. The situation underscores the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and academic institutions over issues of free speech and international relations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a new travel ban, suspending entry to the U.S. for citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The proclamation, citing national security interests, claims these countries lack sufficient vetting processes to detect potential threats. Additionally, partial restrictions have been placed on nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The policy mirrors a similar ban from Trump's first term, which was later ended by President Biden, and is set to take effect on June 9. Certain travelers, such as U.S. permanent residents and athletes attending major sporting events, are exempt from the ban.</p>

          <p>The first New York City mayoral debate saw Democratic candidates clashing over critical issues such as housing, affordability, crime, and their approach to the Trump administration. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, a frontrunner, faced attacks from rivals like Zohran Mamdani, who accused Cuomo of prioritizing wealthy donors over working-class New Yorkers. Cuomo dismissed Mamdani as inexperienced, while other candidates criticized Cuomo's record on nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations. The debate also featured criticisms of current Mayor Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent, and highlighted the diverse perspectives and policy proposals of the Democratic candidates vying for the city's top job.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education has threatened Columbia University's accreditation, alleging violations of federal anti-discrimination laws and failure to meet accreditation standards. The department accuses the university of not adequately addressing anti-Semitism on campus following the October 7 attack against Israel by Hamas, citing President Trump's executive order on accreditation standards. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students, potentially jeopardizing the university's eligibility for federal financial aid. A Columbia spokesperson stated the school is committed to combating anti-Semitism and is working with the federal government to address the concerns, while the accreditation group confirmed receipt of the Education Department's letter.</p>

This incident is one of several fatal falls that have occurred along the West Buttress route since 1980, and there are currently 500 climbers on Mount McKinley, as June marks the peak of the climbing season.</p>

GOP lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden's former aides regarding his mental and physical state, while a separate inquiry is examining clemencies Biden issued. Trump alleges that Biden's actions were invalid due to aides usurping presidential authority, and Democrats have dismissed the investigations as a distraction.</p>

President Trump has insisted that any agreement will prohibit uranium enrichment, contradicting reports that the interim proposal allows low-level enrichment.

          <p>President Trump has restricted most international students from studying at Harvard University, escalating a conflict with the Ivy League institution. The proclamation suspends the entry of foreign students unless their entry is deemed in the national interest and directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking existing visas. Harvard has criticized the order as retaliatory and a violation of its First Amendment rights, pledging to protect its international students. The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to limit Harvard's ability to enroll international students, alleging the school has failed to report disciplinary records and has ties to researchers based in China.</p>

          <p>UK news headlines focus on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected "winter fuel U-turn," restoring payments to pensioners but clawing back funds through higher taxes. Concerns arise over potential "chaos" as tax officials may pursue bereaved families to recover sums paid to deceased pensioners. Immigration policy is also a key issue, with opposing approaches from Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, and the Telegraph reports Reeves dropping net-zero cuts due to pressure from Ed Miliband.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which played a crucial role in the ability of early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in flight. Researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study, published in Science Bulletin, highlights the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as an essential feature of bird evolution. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs did not possess the same flight capabilities as modern birds.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that the first bacteria infants encounter may play a crucial role in their immune system development and overall health. A UK study found that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum in newborns was associated with a significantly reduced risk of hospitalization for lung infections in the first two years of life. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery rather than caesarean section. Researchers suggest that these early microbial interactions influence the maturation of the immune system, potentially reducing susceptibility to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other infections.</p>

The order will remain in effect until at least July 18, pending a full hearing, and Sable officials said the delay will push back their restart timeline.

          <p>A former marketing executive, Chad Bustos, is suing Terranea Resort, alleging he was fired for opposing discriminatory comments made by the resort's president, Ralph Grippo, towards pregnant women. The lawsuit claims Grippo made inappropriate inquiries about employees' pregnancy plans and scrutinized the marketing team's performance after maternity leave announcements. Bustos alleges that he was retaliated against after defending female employees and reporting Grippo's behavior to human resources. The lawsuit also alleges a history of anti-pregnancy comments made by Grippo, and the resort has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>
