          <p>According to House Speaker Mike Johnson, New York Representative Andrew Garbarino missed a crucial vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill because he fell asleep. The bill passed by a single vote, and Garbarino, who supports the legislation, was reportedly moments away from the House floor when the vote closed. Garbarino stated that he fought to lift the cap on SALT and ensure hardworking Long Island families see the benefits of this important legislation, and he is proud of the work they accomplished to deliver huge results for Long Island. Johnson joked that the vote was effectively 217-214, including Garbarino and another representative who nearly missed the vote.</p>

          <p>As gold prices surge, it's important to understand common myths surrounding the precious metal. While gold prices tend to rise over time, they do experience dips, and inflation doesn't always guarantee an increase in gold prices. Additionally, waiting for a significant price drop to invest may not be a viable strategy, as gold prices generally trend upward. Investors should be strategic and informed to avoid making costly mistakes in the gold market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has released a report led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., attributing the rise in chronic diseases among children to factors such as ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, stress, and excessive use of prescription drugs. The report calls for more research into the causes of these diseases and less reliance on treatments. While diverging from standard government thinking by omitting factors like smoking and alcohol, the report has drawn criticism for potentially misrepresenting scientific consensus on vaccines and lacking specific policy prescriptions. The report has been called an invitation to the American people and the American press to have a complex conversation about a nuanced subject.</p>

          <p>Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education following claims that its admissions policies discriminate against Asian American students. The controversy stems from changes made in 2020 to promote diversity, including the elimination of standardized testing and the implementation of a holistic review process. Virginia's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, asserts that the Fairfax County School Board intentionally reduced opportunities for Asian American students. The school district maintains that its policies are non-discriminatory and have been upheld by a federal appellate court.</p>

          <p>The House passed President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," which includes tax cuts, Medicaid restrictions, increased SALT deductions, border security funding, and more. The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts, eliminates taxes on tips and overtime, and provides $1,000 "Trump accounts" for child savings. It also imposes work requirements for Medicaid recipients and increases the age requirement for food stamp eligibility. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain future.</p>

          <p>The Republican budget bill, passed by the House, introduces nationwide work requirements for Medicaid recipients, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. The bill mandates that able-bodied adults without children report at least 80 hours of work or community activity monthly to maintain benefits. Experts estimate that millions could lose coverage due to administrative hurdles, not necessarily due to a lack of work. Critics argue that the work requirements will harm vulnerable populations without effectively increasing employment rates, as demonstrated by previous attempts in states like Arkansas.</p>
