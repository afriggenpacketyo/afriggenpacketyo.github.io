          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' expectations and indicating that consumption remains a concern for the Chinese economy. Despite this, industrial output grew by 6.1%, exceeding forecasts, suggesting that the impact of U.S. tariffs was less severe than anticipated. Fixed-asset investment also saw a slight decrease, and the urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1%. Following a meeting between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives, a trade truce was established, leading global investment banks to raise their forecasts for China's economic growth.

Bartkus, believed to have died in the blast, was not previously on the FBI's radar, and the attack is considered the largest bombing ever investigated in Southern California.

          <p>Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 103 people overnight, according to hospitals and medics, as Israel intensified its war in the territory. The strikes also forced the main hospital in northern Gaza to close. Israel says the new offensive includes plans to seize territory, displace Palestinians, and take control over the distribution of aid. Mediators are pushing for a ceasefire deal after President Trump's visit to the Middle East last week.</p>
