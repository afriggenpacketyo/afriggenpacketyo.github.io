          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that a convicted bishop and a former vicar from the Church in Wales are subjects of a new police inquiry into historical sexual abuse. The report details multiple accounts from victims who state their concerns were ignored by Church officials for years, allowing predators to remain in positions of power. In response to the findings and calls for an independent inquiry, the Church in Wales has issued an apology for its failings and promised a review of its culture and safeguarding practices, highlighting a deep-rooted institutional crisis.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Backstreet Boys member AJ McLean opened up about his long struggle with drug and alcohol addiction and his journey toward sobriety. Nearing four years sober, McLean describes himself as a former "chronic relapser" but now feels he doesn't have another relapse in him, crediting his recovery to continuous work and staying present. He emphasizes the importance of being brutally honest with his daughters about his past to control the narrative and explains how he learned to separate his identity from his stage persona, finding a new, empowering confidence.</p>

          <p>The European Union is intensifying its "de-risking" strategy from China by developing plans to regain control over key industrial sectors and reduce dependency on Chinese supply chains. These efforts include implementing tighter trade defenses, encouraging the reshoring of industries, and diversifying supply sources for critical materials where China currently holds a near-monopoly. This reflects a broader geopolitical agenda within the EU to enhance its economic resilience and treat industrial policy as a crucial tool for maintaining strategic autonomy in a challenging global environment.</p>

          <p>Following years of patient testimonials on social media about the severe pain of IUD insertions, the medical establishment is updating its guidelines for pain management. Both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommend offering local anesthetics, a significant shift from previously suggesting only over-the-counter painkillers. This change reflects a broader movement toward patient-centered care and taking women's pain more seriously, addressing historical biases in gynecology. The article explores various pain relief options, from nitrous oxide to paracervical blocks, and emphasizes the importance of open doctor-patient communication.</p>

          <p>Years before a catastrophic flood claimed over 90 lives, officials in Kerr County, Texas, recognized the need for a flood warning system but struggled to secure funding. Their applications for federal FEMA grants were denied, and a state program offered insufficient support, leaving the project unbuilt. Now, the challenge is even greater as the Trump administration has frozen or canceled billions in federal disaster preparedness funding, shifting the financial burden to states. This policy change leaves a significant gap for at-risk communities, as Texas alone has a $54 billion backlog of unfunded flood projects.</p>

          <p>The UK government has decided against implementing a "zonal pricing" system for electricity, which would have set bills based on a consumer's geographical location. Instead, it will pursue reforms to the existing national pricing system, where everyone pays the same rate. Proponents of zonal pricing, like Octopus Energy, argued it could lower bills in energy-generating regions like Scotland and encourage industry relocation. However, some major energy firms warned the change could deter investment, and the industry has largely welcomed the government's decision to maintain a stable, national framework.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Daily, China's official military newspaper, has called for careful ethical and legal research into the use of humanoid robots in warfare to avoid "moral pitfalls." The authors referenced Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics, noting that militarized robots would inherently violate the first law, which prohibits a robot from injuring a human being. The analysis reflects growing global concerns about the weaponization of artificial intelligence and the complex ethical dilemmas posed by autonomous combat systems, urging preemptive study before deployment.</p>

          <p>Survivors of a bridge collapse in India's Gujarat state that killed at least 15 people have described the chaotic moments when the structure gave way, plunging vehicles into the Mahisagar river. Eyewitnesses reported hearing a deafening, explosion-like sound as a section of the 40-year-old bridge crumbled, with some initially thinking it was an earthquake. Dramatic visuals showed vehicles, including trucks and cars, falling into the water. As search operations continue for at least four missing people, survivors recount their harrowing escapes and the tragic loss of family members.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched another massive overnight aerial assault on Ukraine's capital, killing at least two people and injuring sixteen, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The attack involved approximately 400 drones and 18 missiles, primarily targeting Kyiv and causing fires across multiple districts. Drone wreckage struck a residential building, and a primary healthcare center was almost completely destroyed. This latest barrage follows what Ukraine described as the largest Russian aerial attack of the war just two nights prior, indicating a significant escalation of Russian terror tactics.</p>

          <p>The UK and French governments are reportedly close to finalizing a new deal aimed at deterring small boat crossings of the English Channel. The agreement would see France take back a certain number of migrants who have crossed, while the UK would accept an equivalent number of asylum seekers from France with legitimate claims. While the initial pilot scheme is expected to be limited in scale, it marks a significant diplomatic shift with France's willingness to accept returns. The ultimate test of the deal's success will be whether it serves as an effective deterrent and leads to a fall in crossing numbers.</p>

          <p>The European Union is growing increasingly concerned over China's new export restrictions on rare earth metals, a move seen by some as a strategic use of economic leverage. An MEP described the situation as "dual coercion," with Europe facing both US tariffs and a potential Chinese chokehold on critical materials essential for green and digital technologies. While acknowledging the threat, analysts believe Europe will remain dependent on Chinese rare earths for at least another decade, making diversification of supply chains and increased recycling capacity long-term, rather than immediate, solutions.</p>

The court accepted the special prosecutor's argument that Yoon posed a risk of destroying evidence, sending him back to a detention center four months after his initial release. Yoon was impeached and removed from office for the authoritarian power grab, which he claimed was necessary to quash political opposition but was overturned by lawmakers within hours, leading to rebellion charges.</p>

          <p>Vienna is often cited as a benchmark for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social housing sector, which accounts for 43% of all units in the city. This system, which includes both municipally owned and limited-profit housing, caters to a wide range of incomes and keeps rent levels significantly lower than the private market. Financed in part by a levy on employee salaries, Vienna's long-term political commitment to non-market housing has prevented the large-scale privatization seen in other European cities, ensuring greater affordability and stability for its residents.</p>
