        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, is set to unveil a new economic "golden rule" aimed at reducing government borrowing and taxes. This plan mandates that half of all future government savings would go towards deficit reduction, with the other half funding economic growth policies, including tax cuts. Badenoch criticizes the Labour government's economic approach as unsustainable and warns against a "borrowing and tax doom loop." The Conservatives seek to restore fiscal credibility and differentiate themselves from past policies that spooked markets, while facing challenges like a difficult autumn budget and a rebellion over welfare spending.</p>

          <p>A medical helicopter crashed on a Sacramento freeway, Highway 50, critically injuring the three crew members aboard. The REACH helicopter, carrying a pilot, nurse, and paramedic, went down shortly after taking off from UC Davis Medical Center, en route to Redding. Miraculously, no vehicles on the freeway were involved in the incident. One crew member was trapped under the wreckage but was freed by firefighters and bystanders. All three injured individuals are receiving treatment at UC Davis Medical Center, and the cause of the crash remains under investigation by federal and local authorities.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced a "focused effort" in Chicago to combat violent crime and remove undocumented immigrants, which they correlate with criminal activity. Patel defended the FBI's unusual involvement in immigration enforcement as a "whole-of-government approach" by the Trump administration. He lauded Chicago police officers but criticized elected leadership for prioritizing immigrants over city protection. This initiative follows years of policy failures by the prior administration, according to Patel, and comes amidst legal challenges to the deployment of National Guard troops in the city.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that the UK will not relax visa rules for India, ahead of a visit to promote a recent trade agreement. Leading a delegation of over 100 business and cultural leaders, Starmer emphasized "massive opportunities" in trade and cultural ties, but reiterated that immigration policy remains unchanged. The trade deal, signed in July, aims to boost exports by making goods cheaper, but does not include broader visa concessions. Starmer also distanced himself from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to Vladimir Putin, focusing instead on UK efforts against Russia's "shadow fleet."</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani attended an Israelis for Peace vigil, an anti-occupation group, after his statement on the two-year anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks drew criticism. Mamdani's statement mourned both Israeli victims and Palestinian victims from Israel's subsequent war in Gaza, denouncing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's "genocidal war" and accusing the US government of complicity. The Israeli foreign ministry sharply rebuked Mamdani, accusing him of spreading "Hamas propaganda" and antisemitism.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Insurrection Act is a US federal law granting the president power to deploy military forces domestically to quell uprisings, a power President Trump has repeatedly threatened to invoke. This centuries-old law, an amalgamation of statutes, allows troops to perform civilian law enforcement duties, which are generally prohibited. Its use has been "exceedingly rare" since the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. Experts warn that Trump's potential invocation raises risks of military force against citizens and could precede more aggressive deployments, sparking concerns about civil liberties and the democratic process.</p>

          <p>Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted to their lowest annual level since 1970 in fiscal year 2025, according to internal federal statistics. U.S. Border Patrol recorded nearly 238,000 apprehensions, a stark contrast to the record 2.2 million under the Biden administration. The Trump administration's stringent policies, including sealing the border, closing asylum systems, and dispatching soldiers, are credited with this significant reduction. While the crackdown has faced criticism as inhumane and illegal from civil rights groups, those living along the border confirm a dramatic change in migration flows.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is examining a Colorado counselor's challenge to the state's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors, raising questions about free speech versus professional conduct. Kaley Chiles, a Christian counselor, argues the ban unconstitutionally censors her ability to discuss gender dysphoria and sexual orientation with young patients. Colorado maintains its law regulates medical treatments deemed unsafe and ineffective, not speech, and aims to protect minors. Justices expressed skepticism about Colorado's interpretation, highlighting potential viewpoint discrimination if certain therapeutic goals are permitted while others are banned. A decision is anticipated by early July.</p>

This move, driven by global overcapacity and cheap imports, impacts the UK heavily, as the EU is its primary steel export destination, worth almost £3 billion annually.

          <p>Los Angeles County has launched an investigation into its record $4-billion sex abuse settlement, approved this year, following allegations of misconduct. Supervisors unanimously voted to investigate possible fraud by "legal representatives" and set up a public hotline for tips. This action comes after a Times investigation revealed seven plaintiffs claimed recruiters paid them to sue the county, with some allegedly told to fabricate abuse claims. The county is deeply disturbed by the potential exploitation of a system meant for victims, especially as the settlement's cost impacts departmental budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang discussed his company's new "direct partnership" with OpenAI, highlighting a shift from previous indirect engagements. This collaboration marks the first time OpenAI will purchase directly from Nvidia, rather than renting through cloud service providers. Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build AI data center capacity, aiming for systems requiring 10 gigawatts of power. This significant investment underscores the growing demand for AI processing power, with Nvidia becoming the most valuable company in the market. The partnership is incremental to Nvidia's existing work with other AI firms, focusing on building OpenAI's self-operated AI infrastructure for the future.</p>

          <p>An analysis warns of an impending civil-military crisis, asserting that President Trump and his allies are making rapid progress in seizing control of intelligence, justice, and potentially the military. The article suggests that while top military leaders previously restrained Trump's impulses, a new cabinet of loyalists may enable his desires to use military power domestically. Trump's rhetoric and actions, including deploying troops to American cities and potentially illegal orders, challenge the military's traditional political neutrality and constitutional oath. The author argues that senior military officers must collectively resist illegal orders to prevent a full-blown confrontation, as Congress has been ineffective in restraining the president.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is delaying the swearing-in of Congresswoman-elect Adelita Grijalva, a new Democrat, despite earlier stating he would do so "as soon as she wants." Republicans are now backtracking, linking her swearing-in to the end of the government shutdown, a move Democrats criticize as an extraordinary power play. Grijalva's vote is crucial for a petition to force a House vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein case files, though Johnson denies any connection. This delay is seen as denying Southern Arizona constituents essential services and is labeled "outrageous" by top Democrats, further escalating political tensions during the shutdown.</p>

          <p>UFC fighter Conor McGregor has been handed an 18-month suspension for violating the UFC’s anti-doping policy, specifically for missing three attempted drug tests in 2024. Combat Sports Anti-Doping (CSAD) announced the ban, which is backdated to September 2024 and runs until March 2026. McGregor was recovering from an injury during the missed tests and fully cooperated with the inquiry, leading to a reduced penalty from the standard 24 months. CSAD emphasized the importance of accurate whereabouts filings and unannounced testing for the integrity of the anti-doping program. McGregor has since re-entered the testing pool and provided samples in 2025.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration suggested that federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown might not receive back pay, a stance lawmakers are decrying as illegal. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget claims a 2019 law guaranteeing retroactive pay does not apply to temporarily furloughed employees. President Trump stated back pay "depends on who we're talking about," implying some workers "don't deserve" it. Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, insist the law is clear that all furloughed employees are entitled to back pay.
