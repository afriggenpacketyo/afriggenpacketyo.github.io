          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting. This decision comes amidst escalating global trade tensions, particularly due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs that pose a threat to Japan's exports. The move aligns with economists' expectations, as the BOJ navigates a complex economic landscape influenced by international trade pressures and seeks to maintain stability in the Japanese economy.

          <p>Japanese energy firm Jera Co. has committed to ensuring a stable power supply this summer by leveraging one of the world's largest power plants fueled by liquefied natural gas (LNG). The Kawagoe thermal power station in Mie Prefecture, boasting a maximum output of 4.80 million kilowatts, was showcased to the media as an example of this commitment. Jera intends to use the plant to compensate for fluctuations in solar power generation, crucial as Japan aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. LNG is expected to play a vital role in Japan's transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.</p>

          <p>Stephen Cloobeck, a wealthy Democratic businessman, is suing former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for repeatedly using the phrase “proven problem solver” in campaign materials. Cloobeck, who has applied for a federal trademark of the phrase, claims he has been using it since March 2024 and that it has become distinctly associated with his campaign. Villaraigosa's representatives have dismissed the lawsuit as ludicrous, arguing that the phrase is commonly used by politicians. Legal scholars suggest the lawsuit has little chance of success, viewing it more as a political tactic than a legitimate legal claim.</p>

          <p>Ukraine holds approximately 5% of the world's critical raw materials, including substantial reserves of graphite, titanium, and lithium, essential for electric vehicles, aerospace, and battery production. However, a significant portion of these resources, estimated at $350 billion, is currently under Russian occupation, impacting Ukraine's revenue and global supply chains. The United States is interested in Ukraine's mineral resources to reduce its dependence on China, which controls a large percentage of the world's rare earth deposits.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple violated an injunction in a case brought by Epic Games, finding that the company continued to interfere with competition by imposing a 27% commission on off-app purchases and creating barriers to discourage customers from using competing platforms. The judge also accused Apple's vice president of finance, Alex Roman, of lying under oath and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a possible criminal contempt investigation. Epic Games has offered a peace proposal, suggesting it would return "Fortnite" to the App Store if Apple extends the court's friction-free framework worldwide.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has requested more time to improve the US economy, which contracted for the first time in three years, raising concerns about a potential recession. He attributed the contraction to companies stockpiling imports ahead of tariff implementations and touted $8 trillion in promised inward investment. The US economy experienced a 0.3% annual rate decline, a significant shift from the previous quarter's 2.4% growth. Trump blamed his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for the disappointing economic data and highlighted planned investments in technology, healthcare, and infrastructure.</p>

Justices Alito and Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to the school's argument that excluding it unconstitutionally discriminates against religion, while the liberal justices expressed concern about weakening the separation between church and state.
