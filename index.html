            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield decreased after a successful bond auction, alleviating concerns about demand for U.S. debt. This occurred amidst broader worries about President Trump's tariffs and their potential to trigger a recession, which have been driving equity prices lower. Usually, a market sell-off would cause investors to flee towards bonds, driving yields lower, but that hasn't been the case recently due to tariff concerns. The 10-year Treasury note yield was last up 14 basis points to 4.40% after climbing overnight above 4.51%. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced plans to impose "major" tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., a move that follows earlier exemptions for the sector from reciprocal tariffs. Drugmakers are pushing back, warning that tariffs could hurt research and development. Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks suggested that companies might reduce staff or R&D investments to offset tariff costs. Analysts predict that pharmaceutical-specific tariffs could drive up U.S. drug prices for patients, as domestic production would take years and cost more than producing medicines abroad.

Trump's strategy of using tariffs to reduce trade deficits faces challenges, including supply chain disruptions, workforce issues, and currency problems.

            <p>Former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic has criticized current goalkeeper Andre Onana, labeling him "one of the worst keepers" in the club's history. Matic's comments come in response to Onana's claims that his team is "way better" than their Europa League opponents, Lyon. Matic, who now plays for Lyon, suggested that Onana should focus on improving his performance before making such statements. The exchange has added tension to the lead-up to the Europa League quarter-final match.</p>

            <p>A Democratic senator has introduced a bill to prevent conflicts of interest by prohibiting government contracts and grants to companies owned by special government employees, targeting Elon Musk. Musk, designated as a special government employee, serves as a senior advisor to the president and de facto head of Doge. The bill seeks to address concerns that Musk is using his position to benefit his companies, such as SpaceX and Starlink, which have extensive ties with government agencies. The White House has downplayed concerns over Musk's conflicts of interest.</p>

            <p>President Trump is pressuring House Republicans to support a budget plan crucial for extending his tax cuts. He urged GOP holdouts to "close your eyes and get there," despite opposition to the low level of spending cuts in the Senate resolution. The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for implementing Trump's priorities, including border security, defense, and tax cuts. Some House Republicans are frustrated with the Senate-adopted plan, which relies on a budget scoring method that does not account for the cost of extending the Trump tax cuts.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from China could lead to a substantial increase in the price of iPhones. The new tariffs, which include a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, could raise the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max by hundreds of dollars. If Apple were to move production to the U.S., the cost of an iPhone could increase even further due to higher labor costs. Some analysts believe Apple may attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The tariffs are intended to address trade imbalances and boost domestic manufacturing. However, economists warn that the tariffs could lead to inflation and retaliatory measures from other countries. China and the European Union have already announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. (not investment advice)</p>

They argue that the restructuring could prioritize financial benefits for corporate investors and high-level employees over the original goal of benefiting humanity. The attorney general's office has sought more information regarding OpenAI's restructuring and is investigating the matter.</p>
