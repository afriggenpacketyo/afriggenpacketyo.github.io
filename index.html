          <p>Senator Ted Cruz sharply criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr for his comments threatening ABC's broadcast license over Jimmy Kimmel's monologue. Cruz compared Carr's language to that of a "mafioso," stating that while he is no fan of Kimmel, government interference in media content is a dangerous precedent that could ultimately harm conservatives. This stance places Cruz at odds with former President Trump, who praised Carr's position and Kimmel's subsequent suspension. Cruz emphasized the importance of protecting free speech, even for voices one disagrees with, to prevent government overreach.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased, with the 10-year note reaching its highest point in two weeks, even after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year. This counterintuitive market reaction reflects investor focus on broader economic indicators beyond short-term rates, such as rising GDP estimates and slight inflation increases. While the Fed signaled more cuts are likely, recent positive data, like fewer jobless claims, has eased concerns about a significant economic slowdown. Investors now await the personal consumption expenditures index for further inflation insights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key advisory committee to the CDC voted against recommending that COVID-19 vaccines require a doctor's prescription, following a contentious and divided debate. The tie-breaking vote was cast by the committee's chair, highlighting deep divisions within the panel recently reconstituted by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The meeting was marked by tense exchanges and confusion, with some experts criticizing the committee for relying on anecdotes over scientific data. The decision adds another layer of complexity to vaccine access in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new forecast from Wolfe Research predicts a significant increase in U.S. electricity demand, driven largely by the buildout of AI data centers. This projected growth is seen as a strong tailwind for industrial companies like GE Vernova and Eaton. GE Vernova, which manufactures gas turbines, is experiencing a substantial backlog, giving it strong pricing power. Eaton produces essential electrical equipment for data centers and the grid, positioning it to capitalize on the infrastructure expansion required to meet the new power needs.

Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are highlighted as one of the cheapest options, with average rates below those of home equity loans and personal loans. Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate, while personal loans provide an unsecured option that is still less expensive than credit card debt.

Additionally, a shortage of agricultural labor in the U.S., linked to immigration policies and waning interest in the work, is further contributing to the expense of groceries.</p>

It draws parallels to historical events in Athens and Weimar Germany, where democratic systems were turned against themselves.

          <h2>Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Intervene in Passport Sex Marker Dispute</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court to block a lower court's order regarding sex markers on passports. The order currently prevents the State Department from enforcing a policy that limits individuals to only male or female markers matching their birth certificate, instead allowing for an "X" designation for transgender and non-binary people. The Justice Department argues that the government cannot be forced to use what it considers inaccurate sex designations on official documents. This is part of a broader legal battle over a Trump executive order recognizing only two biological sexes.</p>

          <p>A Wyandotte County sheriff's deputy, Richard Fatherley, has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of inmate Charles Adair. An autopsy report concluded that Adair died from complications of "mechanical asphyxia" after an officer knelt on his back during an altercation, causing broken ribs and a fractured sternum. Adair, who was 50, had been arrested on misdemeanor traffic warrants a day before his death. The deputy's attorney claims his client acted reasonably, but prosecutors have filed the murder charge, with an alternative count of involuntary manslaughter.</p>

          <p>A growing number of countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Australia, have announced plans to formally recognize Palestine as a state, marking a potential shift in Western policy. This follows the formal recognition by Ireland, Norway, and Spain earlier in the year. The moves have drawn strong criticism from Israeli officials, who argue it rewards terrorism. While 147 countries worldwide already recognize Palestine, full UN membership remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council, despite overwhelming support in the General Assembly.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon, a confidante of the White House, has suggested that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent should simultaneously serve as the Chair of the Federal Reserve on an interim basis. In a podcast interview, Bannon floated the idea of Bessent holding both powerful economic positions, potentially through the midterm elections, before focusing solely on the Fed. While there is some historical precedent for Treasury involvement on the Fed board, the proposal is highly unconventional. A White House spokesman stated that such an arrangement has never been under consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Louisiana has recorded five deaths and at least 26 infections in 2025 from Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacterium found in warm coastal waters. This figure is significantly higher than the state's ten-year average of just one death annually from the bacterium. Most cases involved wound exposure to seawater, and the majority of those infected had underlying health conditions. Scientists have warned that Vibrio infections are becoming more common as rising sea surface temperatures, linked to the climate crisis, create more favorable conditions for the bacteria to thrive.</p>

          <p>Following his recent state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump is planning to invite King Charles and Queen Camilla to the United States next year. A senior White House official confirmed the planned invitation, which would be separate from the celebrations for the U.S.'s 250th anniversary. The last official state visit by a reigning British monarch was in 2007 by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Trump has often expressed admiration for the British monarchy, and the visit would aim to underscore the "special relationship" between the two nations.</p>

Stephen Colbert opened his show stating, "we are all Jimmy Kimmel," calling the suspension a "blatant assault on freedom of speech." Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon used satirical sketches to mock the idea of government-approved content, while Jon Stewart adopted a fawning persona to lampoon the situation.

          <p>President Trump is expected to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, after his office reportedly found no clear evidence of mortgage fraud against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicate that Trump administration officials had pressured Siebert to bring criminal charges against James, one of Trump's political adversaries, despite the lack of evidence. Siebert's expected dismissal is being called a "brazen attack on the rule of law" by James's attorney and has caused alarm within the prominent prosecutor's office.

Many expressed frustration with the political establishment and a feeling that Robinson speaks to the working class in a way that mainstream politicians do not.

          <p>A CNBC investigation found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace came with significant oversight problems, leading to the sale of counterfeit and potentially dangerous products. The report details how lax seller vetting processes allowed fraudulent vendors to use stolen identities of legitimate businesses to open accounts. Shoppers received fake health supplements and beauty products, with some current and former employees stating there was pressure to approve sellers quickly to compete with Amazon. In response to the findings, Walmart has reportedly tightened vetting for some product categories.</p>
