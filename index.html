          <h2>Spending Disparity Emerges Between Wealthy and Lower-Income Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 12:42:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A divergence in spending habits is evident in America, with wealthy consumers increasing their expenditures on non-essential items such as dining and luxury travel, while lower-income earners are reducing their spending to focus on essential goods and services. This trend is highlighted by the contrasting performance of credit card lenders catering to different income brackets, where companies serving wealthier clients see spending increases, and those focused on lower-income users experience declines. The shift in consumer behavior reflects growing economic anxiety and the impact of inflation on different segments of the population, influencing their purchasing decisions and financial priorities.

          <p>On the day of the Canadian election, former President Donald Trump made a provocative suggestion on social media, proposing that Canada should become the 51st state of the United States, promising economic benefits and increased military power. The remarks drew sharp criticism from Canadian political leaders, including Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, who affirmed Canada's sovereignty and independence. Despite Trump's suggestion, Canadians cannot vote for him in their election, which features multiple registered political parties, with the Liberals and Conservatives being the most prominent. </p>

Trump's administration has implemented tariffs on goods from various countries, including a significant levy on products from China. Bessent suggested that retailers likely anticipated the tariffs and pre-ordered goods and believes the market will adjust through replacements and potential de-escalation from China.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump‚Äôs second term as US president has been defined by his determination to upend the established order on nearly all fronts of domestic and foreign policy. The Trump administration‚Äôs stringent monitoring of individuals who came to the US to study and conduct research has created a chilling effect on free speech for foreign students and scholars in the US. Many students are refraining from commenting on US politics in class for fear of a classmate reporting them to immigration authorities.</p>
