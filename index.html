          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has announced a temporary pause on all shipments to the United States in April as it assesses the impact of recently imposed tariffs. The company is working to adapt to the new trading terms, which include a 25% levy on car imports, a measure that has sent ripples through global supply chains. The US is a significant market for JLR's luxury brands, with the UK exporting more cars to the US than any other goods. The company plans to develop mid-to-longer-term strategies to address these changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for Americans to "hang tough" as new tariffs, including a 10% universal duty on all US imports, went into effect. These measures are intended to revitalize American manufacturing and create jobs, according to Trump, who described them as an "economic revolution". China has responded by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all US products, escalating trade tensions. Trump has warned other countries against retaliating, maintaining that China has been negatively impacted by tariffs more than the USA.</p>

          <p>The US dollar has weakened following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs, as concerns about a potential recession outweigh any positive impact. Investors initially anticipated that the tariffs would boost the dollar, but the US economy's fragility has led to a flight to safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. While Trump has expressed varying views on the dollar's strength, the market's confidence has been shaken by the aggressive trade policies. Some analysts remain hopeful for long-term gains but acknowledge the current market uncertainty. ( </br><i>not investment advice</i>)</p>

The UK government is continuing its policy of not responding with counter-tariffs, preferring a "calm" approach focused on a UK-US trade deal. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch disagreed that globalisation was over, insisting what was happening was only "fragmentation" and that "we still have a great trading relationship with many other countries".

          <p>A Texas-based oil company is facing scrutiny for allegedly skirting California laws in its efforts to restart oil drilling off the Santa Barbara coastline. Sable Offshore Corp. has begun repairing and upgrading oil pipelines without Coastal Commission approval, prompting concerns about environmental impacts. The company argues that it has the necessary approvals and that its work is only repairing and maintaining an existing pipeline. The California Coastal Commission is considering fines and other measures to address the alleged violations.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is advocating for the $20-billion Delta Conveyance Project, a water tunnel in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, before his term ends. The project aims to modernize the state's water system and protect water supplies in the face of climate change. Opponents argue that the project is expensive and would harm the environment and communities, favoring alternative solutions.

          <p>The possibility of Donald Trump seeking a third term as president is being discussed, despite constitutional limitations. Experts dismiss the likelihood of success, but the idea highlights a pattern of extremist ideas becoming normalized in the Trump era. Trump's continued influence and the support of figures like Steve Bannon contribute to the spread of such ideas. While unlikely, the scenario raises concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and the potential for political disruption.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that the Trump administration's decision to move the federal student loan program to the Small Business Administration (SBA) will put borrowers at risk. The SBA lacks experience with student loans and is facing significant staff cuts, raising concerns about the agency's ability to manage the program effectively. Borrowers could face poor service and increased risk of default. The move comes amid changes to repayment plans and rising costs of living, adding to the uncertainty for student loan borrowers.</p>
