          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, calling it ahistoric and based on false pretenses. The board argues that there was no indication that the National Guard was needed or wanted, as local law enforcement had largely kept protests over federal immigration raids under control. They emphasize that National Guard deployments typically occur at the request of state leaders, but California's governor called the move inflammatory. The editorial board suggests that the action is creating the very chaos it is purportedly designed to prevent and that the closest the nation has come to a rebellion was the January 6th Capitol attack. </p>

          <p>Energy firms in Britain are being paid substantial sums not to provide power due to limitations in the electricity grid's capacity to handle renewable energy. Companies like Ocean Winds receive compensation payments when the system cannot take the power their wind turbines generate, while gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity. Balancing the grid in this way has cost the country over £500 million this year alone, potentially reaching almost £8 billion a year by 2030. The government is considering a radical solution involving smaller regional markets to improve efficiency and lower bills, though this is sparking debate and opposition.</p>

This move follows the Mercury Prize's decision to relocate to Newcastle, signaling a broader shift of major music ceremonies away from the capital. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham hailed the move as a "massive coup" for the area, citing the city's rich musical heritage.</p>

There is a particular need for more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types that can help treat people with sickle cell disease.

Historian Srinath Raghavan's book reveals that Gandhi's aides pushed for a centralized state with a powerful executive, inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France. The idea involved curtailing the judiciary and reducing parliament to a symbolic role, but it never fully materialized. The Forty-second Amendment Act in 1976 expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review, reflecting the genetic imprint of a presidential system.</p>
