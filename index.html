          <p>Tommy Robinson, a political activist, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of harassing Daily Mail journalists. The charges stem from alleged harassment of Andrew Young and Jacob Dirnhuber through Robinson's X social media account in August of the previous year. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court and was released on bail. He is scheduled for a further hearing at Southwark Crown Court in July, where the case will proceed further.</p>

          <p>Two major convenience store chains in Japan, Family Mart and Lawson, have begun selling government-released stockpiled rice at select stores in Tokyo and Osaka. This move aims to increase the availability of rice for consumers struggling with soaring rice prices. The stores will sell rice from the 2021 harvest in small portions to make it more affordable, particularly for individuals living alone.

          <p>India is striving to create its own advanced AI engine, despite having numerous AI startups and a growing focus on AI education. The IndiaAI Mission has been launched with a substantial budget to develop indigenous Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for critical sectors. Challenges include a shortage of high-end AI hardware, limited access to advanced GPUs, and insufficient cloud computing resources. The diversity of languages in India also poses a challenge, but experts believe that with cohesive collaboration between government, industry, and academia, India can launch a world-class LLM in a few years.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling over a dozen flights daily because tariffs are hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft.

The delayed aircraft were expected from Brazil in May, and Brazilian imports to the U.S. have been subject to a 10% tariff since April, causing the airline to cut routes served by multiple flights through July.</p>

          <p>A recent study in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a significant increase in cannabis use among people over 65, rising nearly 50% between 2021 and 2023. This trend is concerning due to misconceptions about marijuana's safety compared to alcohol or cigarettes. Research indicates that THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, can damage blood vessels, similar to cigarette smoke. Cannabis use can also lead to cognitive decline, anxiety, and psychosis, particularly problematic for seniors, and medical uses of marijuana products have never been definitively proven.</p>

Authorities can act even if no abuse has occurred, applying to offenders at least four years older than the child. The law goes into effect on August 1, aiming to protect children from the insidious threat of grooming.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, which experts predict could increase costs for consumers on a wide range of products. These include cars, homes, household items, and office supplies. While the U.S. has domestic metals manufacturing, it also relies on imports, particularly from Canada. The higher tariffs are expected to impact manufacturing costs, with businesses likely passing these costs on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

Senate Republicans are facing complications with a multi-trillion-dollar budget bill, criticized by Elon Musk, who says the bill doesn't adequately cut government spending, emboldening fiscal conservatives.</p>

The reasons cited include national security concerns, visa overstay rates, and lack of cooperation with the US. Afghanistan is accused of being controlled by the Taliban and lacking competent passport authorities, while Iran is identified as a state sponsor of terrorism. Somalia and Libya are cited for terrorist presence and incompetent passport issuance, and Haiti is flagged for illegal immigration and criminal networks.</p>

          <p>A popular Mexican band, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, has been fined over $36,000 for performing songs glorifying drug cartels in Chihuahua. Nearly a third of their songs were "narcocorridos" that glamorized drug traffickers, according to city officials. Several states in Mexico have imposed restrictions on this controversial subgenre of regional music. In April, a ban sparked a riot during a concert after a singer refused to perform some of his most popular songs.
