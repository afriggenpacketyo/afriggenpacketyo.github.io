        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seven men were found guilty of sexually exploiting two teenage girls in Rochdale over a five-year period, with the victims being groomed from the age of 13 and treated as sex slaves. The men, who worked on the town's market or as taxi drivers, plied the girls with drugs, alcohol, and places to stay in return for sexual favors. One of the victims stated that police and social workers were aware of the situation but did not intervene sufficiently. The NSPCC emphasized the need for children to be able to speak out about abuse and for adults to recognize the signs of grooming in light of the exploitation. The investigation remains ongoing with more trials scheduled.</p>

          <p>An appeals court has temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that would have returned control of California's National Guard troops to the state. Governor Gavin Newsom and other local officials had rejected President Trump's deployment of the troops, viewing it as an unnecessary provocation during protests against his immigration policies. The Trump administration asserted it took over the National Guard to restore order and protect ICE agents. The appeals court's decision allows the troops to remain in Los Angeles as the case proceeds through the courts, raising questions about presidential authority over state National Guard units.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece describes a post-pandemic China that is more open and welcoming to foreigners, contrasting it with the perception of an "angry America." The author recounts their experience obtaining a visa and traveling to China, noting the simplified application process and the friendly atmosphere upon arrival. This perspective challenges warnings of increasing authoritarianism and arbitrary detention, suggesting a shift in China's approach to international relations. The author's experience suggests a different narrative of China than the one often portrayed in Western media.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, prompting a retaliatory drone launch from Iran. The Israeli military claimed the operation, named "Rising Lion," aimed to preempt an Iranian plan to destroy Israel. Iranian officials vowed a strong response, while NATO urged de-escalation. The exchange of attacks raises the risk of a broader regional conflict and casts doubt on the future of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1 across the UK. Families and private schools argued that the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law, particularly for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). The court found that the government was aware of the potential impact on some families but was entitled to prioritize revenue generation for public services. The government estimates the policy will raise £1.8 billion annually to support pupils in state schools.</p>

          <p>A Bulgarian woman influencer, Zornitsa Gyutsova, has incited controversy with misogynistic online content that encourages violence against women. Gyutsova suggests that women prefer men who physically assault them and that men should control their partners both psychologically and physically. Despite numerous complaints filed with the prosecutor's office, no charges have been brought against Gyutsova due to Bulgaria's lack of a specific law against gender discrimination. Critics argue that this content is dangerous and can cost lives, highlighting a broader issue of impunity for abusers in Bulgarian society.</p>

He also highlights that every dad wants to do their best and that fostering a culture of compassion can make a significant difference in their lives. Recent studies show the profound effects parental separation has on children, but separated parents always want the best for their children.</p>

          <p>The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) has provided assistance to about 50 households since disorder broke out in Ballymena, including emergency accommodation for 14 families. The violence started after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, with police reporting numerous injuries from sustained attacks. The NIHE expects the number of people seeking help to rise, citing an unprecedented number of families feeling unsafe in their homes. A family in Coleraine was also moved after a racially motivated arson attack, highlighting the escalating tensions and need for support.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that Elon Musk's popularity among Republicans has declined since his public falling-out with President Trump. Fewer Republicans now view Musk "very favorably" compared to April, suggesting his opposition to Trump's policies and subsequent online exchanges may have impacted his standing within the party. Despite the shift in intensity, most Republicans still hold a positive view of Musk. Tesla's sales in Europe have also declined, and the company's shares have dropped in value following Musk's public dispute with Trump.</p>

          <p>A group of Nobel laureates, scientists, writers, and artists issued an open letter denouncing the resurgence of fascism in all its forms, drawing parallels to the defiance against Mussolini's regime in 1925. The letter warns of attacks on democratic norms, a rise in racist rhetoric, and assaults on the rights of marginalized groups. It calls on those who value democracy to defend democratic institutions, uphold facts and evidence, and join collective actions against authoritarianism. The letter emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and the protection of universal human rights.</p>

Middle-income seniors are also likely to feel the impact of a volatile market and potential increases in medical care costs.

          <p>Despite rising tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, market watchers believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Disrupting the channel could harm Iran more than benefit it, given that most of its daily consumption goods come via that route. China, Iran's largest oil customer and trade partner, would likely oppose any disruption to oil flows or price increases. Analysts suggest that a full-scale disruption of global oil flows may even be physically impossible due to the presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain.</p>
