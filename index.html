          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making and halt federal funding. The lawsuit challenges the administration's demands for changes to admissions policies and faculty hiring, sparked by campus activism related to the Gaza conflict. Harvard President Alan Garber argues that the administration's actions, including freezing $2.2 billion in grants, threaten academic independence and research. The White House defends its position, stating that taxpayer funds are a privilege and Harvard has failed to meet the necessary conditions.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions of dollars in federal funding. The lawsuit comes after Harvard rejected the administration's demands to change policies and leadership. Harvard claims the administration's actions violate constitutional rights and impede critical scientific and medical research. The Trump administration has said it is taking action against some schools to combat anti-semitism on campuses.</p>
