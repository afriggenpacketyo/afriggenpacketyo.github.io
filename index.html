          <p>The UK's Health Secretary is set to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) for crucial talks aimed at preventing a five-day strike by resident doctors scheduled for late July. The BMA insists the industrial action will only be suspended if the government presents a credible new pay offer to address the long-standing dispute over real-term pay cuts. While the government has stated its 5.4% pay increase offer is final, sources suggest a willingness to discuss improvements to doctors' working conditions. This development comes as recent polling indicates a significant drop in public support for the strikes.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of up to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was found in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the Viking space probe. The auction also features the skeleton of a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur, highlighting a growing market for unique natural history artifacts.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom continues to experience a significant heatwave, with temperatures reaching as high as 33.1°C and amber heat health alerts remaining active for southern and eastern England. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all recorded their warmest days of the year, leading to consequences like hosepipe bans and extreme wildfire warnings in some regions. The Met Office forecasts that the heat will begin to break on Sunday, with cooler temperatures and heavy rain expected for most of the country by Monday. This event is presented within the broader context of climate change making such heatwaves more frequent and intense.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its decades-long armed conflict with the Turkish state, initiating a disarmament process with a ceremonial destruction of weapons. This move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and has been cautiously welcomed by the Turkish government as an opportunity for reconciliation. The success of the peace process hinges on concessions from Turkey, including potential amnesties and legal reforms to allow former fighters to enter politics. A sustainable peace could significantly enhance Turkey's stability and improve its diplomatic standing throughout the Middle East.</p>

          <p>While installing a water pipeline in the historic Old Town harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, workers unexpectedly discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found embedded in the seabed, and marine archaeologists have confirmed its age through radiocarbon analysis, dating it to the late 1700s. This finding adds to a series of recent maritime archaeological discoveries across Europe. The site is now being protected to allow for further examination of the shipwreck, which offers a glimpse into the region's naval history during that period.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging business climate in China, some five-star luxury hotels are adopting unconventional strategies to survive, including selling low-cost street food.

This move reflects a broader trend where high-end establishments are forced to pivot their business models to cater to changing consumer habits and economic pressures.

          <p>Forty years after the historic Live Aid concerts, the event's legacy is being re-examined, celebrating its unprecedented global reach and fundraising success for Ethiopian famine relief while also acknowledging its significant flaws. Critics point to the lack of African performers and female artists in the 1985 lineup, which reinforced a "white savior" narrative that has been scrutinized in subsequent decades. While organizer Bob Geldof defends the event's impact on political agendas and debt relief, others argue it promoted a patronizing image of Africa.

Advocates argue that the use of Latin, under the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) system, puts individuals with severe allergies at serious risk, as common allergens are difficult to identify. Parents of children who have suffered allergic reactions and makeup influencers have joined the call for clearer labeling, similar to food packaging standards.

          <p>An investigation into suspected lead poisoning at a kindergarten in China's Gansu province has been escalated, with a task force from the central government's State Council now involved. The case gained attention after parents discovered the issue when their children were tested for lead in another province, as local tests had not revealed any problems. Authorities suspect the kindergarten used inedible, lead-based paint to color food, and eight people, including the principal, have been detained. The involvement of top provincial leaders and national ministries indicates the seriousness with which the government is treating the food safety scandal.</p>

          <p>Bronny James delivered a solid performance for the Los Angeles Lakers in an NBA Summer League game, scoring 14 points and showcasing strong defense in a win against the New Orleans Pelicans. His father, LeBron James, was in attendance and actively coached his son from his courtside seat, offering real-time advice on plays and encouraging aggressive drives to the basket. The younger James responded to the instruction, at one point hitting a three-pointer immediately after his father yelled encouragement. The dynamic provided a unique glimpse into the father-son relationship as Bronny begins his professional basketball career.</p>

          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a significant rise in religious conservatism, with Islamic-oriented political parties, particularly the PAS within the Perikatan Nasional coalition, gaining substantial electoral ground. This "green wave" reflects growing support for conservative Islamic policies, especially among younger Malay voters, and challenges the more moderate, multi-ethnic vision of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's government. While some view this trend as a genuine societal shift, others see it as political posturing by parties capitalizing on public dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition. The trend poses a long-term threat to Malaysia's traditionally liberal democracy and pluralistic identity.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests China's Tibetan Dam May Increase India's Dry Season Water Supply</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's large dams on the upper Brahmaputra River in Tibet may actually increase water flow to downstream countries like India during the dry season, countering widespread fears of induced drought. By analyzing data from two existing dams since 2014, researchers found that low-flow levels in February rose by more than 50%, with significant increases throughout the dry period. This suggests that reservoir regulation releases water when it is most scarce. The findings provide the first data-driven insight into the potential impact of China's planned mega-dam on the region's water security.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied access, Florida lawmakers toured a new migrant detention facility in the Everglades known as "Alligator Alcatraz," following claims of inhumane conditions from detainees. Democratic lawmakers, who had to sue for entry, reported seeing appalling conditions, including 85-degree temperatures in the medical area and detainees yelling for help. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site expressed satisfaction with the facility. Detainees have alleged they lack adequate water, food, and medicine, claims which state officials have denied, insisting the facility meets all required standards.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have voiced strong criticism of a proposal by former U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 30% tariff on their imports, set to begin August 1st. Mexico's president called the plan an "unfair deal," while the EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, threatened "proportionate countermeasures" if the tariffs are enacted, though both expressed a desire to continue negotiations. The move is part of a broader tariff strategy that also targets Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Brazil, escalating global trade tensions. Trump has warned that he will increase the tariffs further if any of the trading partners retaliate.</p>
