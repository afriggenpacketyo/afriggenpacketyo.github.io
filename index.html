          <p>A Colorado funeral home owner received a 20-year federal prison sentence for a gruesome scheme involving nearly 190 improperly stored bodies and financial fraud. Jon Hallford, of the Return to Nature Funeral Home, admitted to giving families fake ashes while the bodies of their loved ones decayed in a decrepit building. He also pleaded guilty to defrauding the government of almost $900,000 in COVID-19 aid, using the funds for luxury items. During the sentencing, victims' families shared heart-wrenching stories of their prolonged grief and trauma, with the judge acknowledging the profound emotional devastation in delivering the maximum sentence.</p>

          <p>With record heatwaves sweeping parts of the U.S., child safety advocates are issuing urgent warnings about the lethal danger of leaving children in hot vehicles. So far this year, nine children have died from vehicular heatstroke, with an average of 38 such deaths occurring annually. Experts emphasize that a car's interior can heat up by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes, and a child's body temperature can rise three to five times faster than an adult's. Advocacy groups recommend creating routines, like placing a personal item in the backseat, to prevent caregivers from accidentally forgetting a child and urge bystanders to call 911 immediately if they see a child left alone in a car.</p>

          <p>Iran held a large state funeral in Tehran for approximately 60 individuals, including high-ranking military commanders and nuclear scientists, who were killed during a recent 12-day conflict with Israel. The conflict, which saw direct U.S. involvement through bombings of Iranian nuclear sites, resulted in 627 Iranian and 28 Israeli fatalities. In response to the events, President Trump stated he would consider bombing Iran again if intelligence indicated a threat, while Iran's foreign minister warned against disrespectful rhetoric. Despite claiming victory, Iranian officials have admitted that the U.S. and Israeli strikes caused 'excessive and serious' damage to the country's nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their Australian tour with a commanding 54-7 win against the Western Force, scoring eight tries in front of a record rugby crowd in Perth. Despite a competitive first half where the Force controlled territory, the Lions were ruthlessly efficient, leading 21-7 at halftime. The second half was a different story, as the tourists ran rampant with five unanswered tries, showcasing their offensive power. However, the victory was marred by a worrying hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams, who had scored two tries before being forced off the field, creating a potential depth issue for the team.</p>

          <p>In a landmark 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has ended the practice of nationwide injunctions, which lower courts had used to block federal policies across the entire country. The ruling came in a case concerning a Trump administration order on birthright citizenship, but the decision focused solely on the remedy, not the order's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion argued that these broad injunctions have no historical basis and represent judicial overreach. However, the Court left open other avenues for expansive relief, such as class-action lawsuits and injunctions providing 'complete relief' to plaintiffs, meaning the controversial executive order itself may still be blocked through other legal means.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary was not in spite of his pro-Palestinian stance, but because of it. The author contends that years of grassroots organizing by Palestinian allies and student activists have shifted public opinion, making support for Palestine a viable, and even powerful, political position within progressive circles. The campaign's success is credited to a dedicated base of volunteers already organized around issues like divestment from Israel, who saw Mamdani as an alternative to an establishment that overlooks the Palestinian cause. The win is framed as a testament to the growing influence of this movement on domestic American politics.</p>

          <p>LGBTQ advocates argue the Trump administration is employing a 'divide and conquer' strategy by primarily targeting the transgender community with restrictive policies. This approach, they say, aims to fracture the broader LGBTQ coalition by suggesting other groups might be spared if they sacrifice trans rights. Policies include bans on gender-affirming care, restrictions on official documents, and the elimination of non-binary gender recognition from federal systems. While some conservative gay groups support the administration, critics point to these actions and the rhetoric from officials as evidence of a clear anti-LGBTQ agenda that creates a hostile environment and threatens hard-won rights for the entire community.</p>

Experts warn that Taiwan is particularly vulnerable due to its geographic proximity and extensive social and cultural ties with mainland China, which could facilitate intelligence operations and recruitment. These concerns are amplified by recent cases suggesting that Beijing's intelligence network may have already deeply penetrated Taiwan's political and defense establishments, posing a significant security threat.</p>

          <p>China's dominance over the supply of heavy rare earth elements is creating significant vulnerability for the global automotive industry, which relies on these minerals for components like catalytic converters, motors, and electronics. An export cutoff by China in April caused panic, leading to factory shutdowns and production halts for companies like Ford. While the Trump administration has announced a deal to expedite shipments, the situation remains volatile. Experts warn that China controls about 90% of rare earth processing and has a total monopoly on the heavy elements, giving it the power to cripple auto manufacturing worldwide if it chooses to restrict access again.

          <p>Stablecoins are rapidly moving from a niche crypto-asset to the corporate and policy mainstream, with major firms like Visa, Mastercard, and JPMorgan launching their own tokens. These companies see stablecoins as a way to slash transaction fees and offer instantaneous, 24/7 settlement, fundamentally reshaping how money moves. This corporate adoption is bolstered by growing political support, exemplified by the Senate's GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill aiming to create a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. While some lawmakers raise concerns about potential illicit use and conflicts of interest, the trend indicates a significant shift toward integrating blockchain technology into the core of the financial system.

          <p>This essay posits that the global economic system is in the midst of a historic 'reboot,' moving away from the era of neoliberalism and globalization that has dominated for decades. The author compares this shift to the major economic realignments of the 1930s and 1970s, arguing that the current turn toward economic nationalism and populism is not a temporary anomaly but a fundamental change. The piece suggests that the new economic 'operating system' is still being contested, with the Trump administration's regressive, tariff-focused model competing against yet-to-be-consolidated progressive alternatives. The outcome will depend on which governing ideas ultimately define what the economy is for. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This political analysis suggests the Democratic Party is facing an internal populist revolt, drawing parallels to the rise of the Tea Party movement within the GOP over a decade ago. Polling data reveals widespread dissatisfaction among the Democratic base with current leadership, with a strong desire for generational change and a more aggressive stance against President Trump. The surprising primary victory of socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City is presented as a key indicator of this anti-establishment energy. The article posits that this frustration could lead to more primary challenges against incumbents and a significant leftward shift for the party's platform and priorities.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the life and career of esteemed journalist Bill Moyers, who passed away at 91, remembering him as a foundational figure in American public broadcasting. Starting as a teen reporter and later serving as press secretary for President Lyndon B. Johnson, Moyers dedicated six decades to journalism, winning numerous prestigious awards. He was known for his thoughtful and probing interviews not just with newsmakers, but also with poets, scholars, and artists, seeking to understand what is lasting in the human heart. The author recalls Moyers' guiding questionâ€”'Is this a story that reaches into people?'â€”as a principle to honor his memory and continue his work.</p>

The government conceded on its initial plan to tighten eligibility for disability payments, applying stricter criteria only to new claimants and fast-tracking a support-to-work package. However, some Labour MPs and the Unite union are still pushing for further changes or a complete withdrawal of the bill.</p>

With the majority of workers carrying credit card debt, career experts note that financial obligations are compelling people to stay in roles longer than desired and hesitate to make career changes.

          <p>A new report from the environmental nonprofit Earthsight alleges that major luxury fashion brands, including Coach, Fendi, and Hugo Boss, are using leather sourced from cattle raised on illegally deforested land in Brazil. The investigation traced the supply chain from farms operating illegally within Indigenous territories to Brazilian meatpackers and tanneries, and then to prestigious Italian leather suppliers. The report highlights the practice of 'cattle laundering,' where animals from illegal farms are moved to legal ones before sale, obscuring their true origin. While most of the accused brands have denied the specific allegations or stated the leather they source does not come from Brazil, the findings raise serious questions about supply chain transparency and ethics in the luxury goods industry.</p>

          <p>In a unique business move, Trader Joe's has opened a new, larger store in Sherman Oaks, California, located directly across the street from one of its existing, smaller locations. The original plan was to close the older store, a neighborhood fixture since 1973, but the company ultimately decided to keep both open to serve the high customer demand in the area. The new store is 40% bigger and features a spacious underground parking garage, a major draw for shoppers frustrated with the old, cramped lot. While some customers are switching to the new location, many loyal patrons say they prefer the 'cozy' feel of the original store.</p>

          <h2>Delayed CDC Grant Funding Causes Layoffs and Halts Public Health Programs Nationwide</h2>

          <p>State and local health departments across the U.S. are facing a crisis as grant funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is severely delayed, leading to layoffs and the suspension of vital public health programs. With its 2025 fiscal year funding held up, the CDC has been operating on 30-day increments, preventing it from issuing the award notices that health departments rely on. This has halted services like HIV prevention, contact tracing, and cancer screening. Two CDC staff members, speaking anonymously, believe the funding is being intentionally withheld, a situation one described as 'rescission by inertia' that could grind public health work to a halt.</p>

          <h2>Pentagon to Cease Providing Critical Satellite Weather Data, Affecting Hurricane and Ice Monitoring</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has announced it will stop providing public access to crucial satellite weather data, a decision that could hamper hurricane forecasting and sea ice monitoring. For over 40 years, scientists and meteorologists have relied on this data, processed by the Navy, for real-time analysis of storm structures and polar ice conditions. The Pentagon cited 'cybersecurity concerns' for the abrupt change, which has surprised researchers who depend on it. While NOAA claims its own data sources are sufficient, experts worry that the loss of these satellites will create gaps in coverage, potentially delaying warnings for rapidly intensifying hurricanes as peak season approaches.</p>

          <p>During the first round of the LIV Golf event in Dallas, five-time major champion Brooks Koepka withdrew from the tournament due to illness. The withdrawal occurred after a moment of frustration on the ninth hole, where, following a poor tee shot, Koepka smashed his club into the ground and then struck a tee box marker, sending it towards a small group of spectators. The marker did not appear to hit anyone. Koepka was six over par through eight holes at the time of his withdrawal. LIV officials stated that the golfer had been feeling unwell throughout the week.</p>

          <p>A Haaretz newspaper report has prompted a furious denial from Israeli leaders after it quoted anonymous Israeli soldiers claiming they were ordered to fire on unarmed civilians near food aid sites in Gaza. The report described the areas as 'killing fields' where troops use live fire against hungry crowds. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the report 'blood libel' and 'malicious falsehoods.' Gaza's Health Ministry states over 500 people have been killed seeking aid in the past month. International aid groups, including Doctors Without Borders, have condemned the aid distribution system as inherently unsafe, with one of its clinics treating numerous patients daily with injuries from these sites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a historic policy shift, Germany is planning a massive increase in military spending with the goal of creating Europe's strongest armed forces. This dramatic reversal is driven by the war in Ukraine and the prospect of a new Trump presidency, which has raised doubts about U.S. security commitments. The German government plans to spend 3.5% of its GDP on defense, changing its constitution to allow for a special $117 billion fund to modernize its beleaguered military. This move signals a profound change in Germany's post-war identity, which has long been defined by military restraint, and aims to meet the demands of its NATO partners.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the 'respectability politics' pushed by some conservative gay figures, asserting that the true spirit of the LGBTQ+ movement is rooted in its diversity and progress, not in conforming to mainstream norms for acceptance. The author criticizes attempts to create a wedge within the community, particularly by marginalizing transgender and gender-nonconforming people. The article invokes the history of the movement, noting that trailblazers like the activists at Stonewall and early political candidates were often the most flamboyant and non-conforming members. It concludes that progress has always been won by a diverse coalition, not by a sanitized, monolithic group.</p>

          <p>In a bizarre sequence of events in Northern California, a woman's home was first repeatedly burglarized and then taken over by a group of bears. The 64-year-old homeowner fled her remote property in fear after it was ransacked so many times by a burglary ring. The extensive damage caused by the thieves allowed local wildlife to enter, with bears moving in and causing further destruction. Authorities have now charged 11 suspects in connection with the burglaries and have identified six others. The case highlights a strange intersection of crime and nature, leaving the homeowner with significant financial loss and a uniquely wild problem.</p>
