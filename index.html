          <p>An American woman, Aimee Betro, has been convicted of conspiracy to murder after a failed assassination attempt in Birmingham, UK, in 2019. Hired as a hitwoman, she disguised herself with a niqab and attempted to shoot a man at point-blank range, but her gun jammed. The plot was part of a feud between the intended victim's family and Betro's co-conspirators. She was also found guilty of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear and illegally importing ammunition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.7% year-over-year in July, a slightly cooler rate than the 2.8% economists had predicted. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.2%, aligning with forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, saw a 3.1% annual increase. Economists are closely monitoring the data for the effects of tariffs, with some analysts suggesting the resulting price increases may be more lasting than a temporary shock.

          <p>A recent U.S.-brokered peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan includes plans for a transit corridor, dubbed the "Trump Route," that has caused concern in Iran. The corridor would connect Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan through Armenian territory, offering a direct trade link to Turkey and Europe that bypasses Iran. While Iranian leadership has given mixed signals, experts view the move as a strategic effort by the U.S. to diminish Russian and Iranian influence in the South Caucasus. This development potentially reinforces Iran's geopolitical isolation amid its multiple ongoing crises.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Examine Reasons for Shift in US Trade Policy Towards China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 08:36:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has softened its trade stance on China, extending a tariff pause and capping levies at 30%, while imposing harsher penalties on countries like India. Analysts suggest this shift is driven by a desire to avoid a pre-holiday price spike and to negotiate a broader deal involving technology and rare earths. China's dominance in rare earth minerals and its willingness to endure a trade war give it significant leverage. The US is also pressuring China on other fronts, including its access to AI chips and its imports of Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has launched an anti-dumping investigation into pea starch imported from Canada, a move seen as retaliation for Canadian tariffs on Chinese steel. The probe follows complaints from domestic producers who claim that an influx of low-priced Canadian pea starch is harming the local industry. Canada was China's second-largest supplier of peas in the last agricultural season. This action is part of a series of trade measures, with China also imposing new requirements on Canadian canola oil and rubber imports.</p>

Bell fell into a crevasse in 1959 while on an expedition for the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. His remains were discovered in January and formally identified through DNA comparison with his surviving siblings, who expressed shock and astonishment at the discovery. The British Antarctic Survey praised Bell as one of many brave early explorers and noted the discovery brings closure to a long-standing mystery.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the widespread nostalgia for the 1990s, arguing that by many objective measures, life today is significantly better. It cites data showing that the 1990s had far higher rates of violent crime in the U.S. compared to the present. The article also points to massive global progress, such as a dramatic reduction in extreme poverty and major advances in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Furthermore, it highlights increased social tolerance, higher educational attainment, and narrowed opportunity gaps as evidence that the present day surpasses the "good old days."</p>

          <p>The UK's Online Safety Act is facing significant criticism from users, tech companies, and U.S. politicians over its new age verification requirements for adult content. The law mandates that large platforms implement age checks to protect children, leading sites like PornHub, Reddit, and X to require users to share personal data for access. The measures have sparked privacy concerns, a surge in VPN usage in the UK, and criticism from American officials who fear it could chill free expression and unfairly target U.S. tech firms.

Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong revenue performance reflects growing institutional interest in stablecoins, boosted by more supportive U.S. crypto legislation.

Nowinski explains the process of procuring brains for research, often in tragic circumstances, and reflects on why the public outcry over CTE in football has faded.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising temperatures, animal welfare charities like the RSPCA are reminding pet owners about the dangers of heatstroke in dogs. Experts advise against walking dogs during the hottest parts of the day, recommending a "pavement test" to check if the ground is too hot for a dog's paws. Signs of heatstroke include excessive panting, confusion, and collapse, and require immediate action to cool the animal down. The article also provides tips for keeping pets comfortable, such as providing ample shade and water, using pet-safe sunscreen, and never leaving an animal in a locked vehicle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for another 90 days, delaying a significant tariff hike that was set to take effect. President Trump signed an executive order to keep the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30%, while China will maintain its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what the White House terms "unfair trade practices." Despite the pause, the ongoing tensions have already impacted trade flows, with one U.S. business owner telling the BBC the continued uncertainty makes it impossible to plan.</p>

          <p>An Israeli strike in Gaza City killed five Al Jazeera journalists and two other individuals, drawing international condemnation. Among the dead was prominent correspondent Anas al-Sharif, whom Israel alleged was a Hamas operative, a claim Al Jazeera and media rights groups reject. The targeted attack on a tent used by journalists has been called unjustifiable by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, which stated that being a media advisor for Hamas does not make one an active combatant. This event adds to the nearly 200 journalists killed in the conflict since October 2023.</p>

          <p>A survey by the UK's National Pharmacy Association (NPA) reveals that 99% of pharmacy staff have experienced threats or abuse from customers, with a significant surge in shoplifting and aggressive incidents. Pharmacists report thieves are stealing a wide range of items, and many feel the police response is inadequate. As a result, pharmacies are spending their own money on security measures like CCTV, panic buttons, and private guards. The rise in aggression is linked not only to theft but also to public frustration with broader NHS service issues, making community pharmacies a frequent target.</p>

          <p>This report covers two major domestic developments in the United States. President Trump has vowed to use the National Guard to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C., and purge the city of its unhoused population, despite violent crime being at a 30-year low. This plan has raised concerns among residents and advocates. Separately, Ford Motor Company announced a major investment in more affordable electric vehicles, retooling its Louisville plant to produce a midsize electric pickup truck with a target price of $30,000, aiming to compete with Chinese automakers.</p>

          <p>Five months after emerging from bankruptcy, Spirit Airlines has warned it may not be able to survive without securing additional cash. The budget airline stated that adverse market conditions, including high domestic capacity and weak leisure travel demand, have created a difficult pricing environment. The company's financial results are not improving fast enough to meet creditor agreements, which could lead to defaults. Spirit is now exploring the sale of assets like aircraft and airport gates to raise necessary funds, leading management to express "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern.

The 5-2 decision rejected the NFL's attempt to move the case to binding arbitration, where the league commissioner could have designated the arbitrator. Gruden's lawsuit alleges the NFL maliciously leaked racist, homophobic, and sexist emails he wrote while working as an analyst, leading to his resignation in 2021. His attorney stated the ruling helps vindicate Gruden's reputation and clears the way for him to seek justice.</p>

          <p>Health experts argue that lung cancer is a grossly undercounted "hidden epidemic" in sub-Saharan Africa, where official statistics are misleadingly low. The disease is often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, and a lack of diagnostic resources and poor death registration systems mean most cases go unrecorded. While South Africa reports higher numbers, this is likely due to its more advanced healthcare system's ability to actually diagnose the disease. With smoking rates rising, experts warn the crisis will worsen without urgent investment in prevention, screening, and data collection.</p>
