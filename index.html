          <p>NASA's Mars Perseverance rover captured a selfie featuring a Martian dust devil, resembling a small pale puff, 3 miles behind the rover during a recent photo shoot. The selfie, a composite of 59 images, marks 1,500 Martian days for Perseverance, which landed on Mars in 2021. The rover is collecting samples for an eventual return to Earth from Jezero Crater, an ancient lakebed and river delta that could hold clues to past microbial life. This image also shows the rover's latest sample borehole on the surface.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tax and spending bill is stalled in Congress due to Republican disagreements over spending cuts, Medicaid, and state and local tax deductions (SALT). The bill combines an extension of tax cuts passed in 2017 with other tax measures and spending cuts, aiming to satisfy both budget hawks and those seeking tax reductions. House Republicans are divided over Medicaid cuts, with some seeking deeper cuts and others opposing them altogether, fearing harm to lower-income constituents. Additionally, Republicans from wealthier states are pushing for larger SALT tax credits, creating further complications for the bill's passage. (not investment advice)</p>

One of the deported men, a citizen of Myanmar convicted of sexual assault, received conflicting deportation notices in English, a language he barely speaks.

          <p>Oklahoma has been exemplary at cleaning up its streams, with more than any other state. A big part of the solution was simple: Give cows clean drinking water and keep them out of the streams. Grant Victor, an Oklahoma farmer, installed fencing around Horse Creek to keep his cattle off 220 acres, creating a protective riparian buffer. Today, Horse Creek is no longer on the stateâ€™s list of most contaminated waterways. About 100 Oklahoman streams once polluted by runoff predominantly from farmland have been restored to health.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 817 points, or 1.9%, while the S&P 500 declined 1.6%. The sell-off on Wall Street coincided with a surge in bond yields, which in turn raised the cost of U.S. borrowing and stoked investor fears about the wider impact across the economy.
