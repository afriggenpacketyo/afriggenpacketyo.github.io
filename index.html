          <p>At least 80 Labour MPs are backing an amendment to reject the government's Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits by Â£5 billion annually by 2030. The MPs are concerned about the bill's potential to increase poverty, its lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments on the job market and public health. If the reasoned amendment is selected by the House Speaker and supported by a majority of MPs, the bill's progress through Parliament will be halted. The government has a working majority of 165, requiring 83 Labour MPs to oppose the bill for it to fail, highlighting the significance of this potential rebellion within the Labour party.</p>

          <p>Florida is planning to build a migrant detention center, nicknamed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' in the Everglades, aiming to ramp up deportations of illegal migrants. The facility, located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, is expected to cost $450 million annually and hold around 1,000 people. Attorney General James Uthmeier claims the location acts as a natural deterrent due to the presence of alligators and pythons, but Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniela Levine Cava criticizes the plan, citing potentially devastating impacts on the Everglades ecosystem. The facility is intended to be funded largely by FEMA's shelter and services program, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the facility will expand bed space in days.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's USDA announced the rescission of the 2001 'Roadless Rule,' a policy protecting 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, arguing the move would enable better forest management and reduce fire risk. Environmental groups, however, denounced the decision, asserting it could harm wildlife habitats, drinking water sources, and recreational opportunities. Opponents also challenged the claim that eliminating the rule would reduce fire risk, stating that commercial logging could exacerbate climate change and increase wildfire intensity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own without advance warning or the chance to challenge their deportation. The court lifted a previous injunction, with the three liberal justices dissenting, and Justice Sotomayor expressing strong disagreement. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin praised the ruling, while the head of the legal group representing the immigrants condemned the decision, saying it strips away due process protections. The ruling allows the Trump administration to remove criminal illegal aliens and clean up this national security nightmare, according to McLaughlin.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, stating that it could lead to lasting peace, though neither country has definitively confirmed the agreement. White House officials are touting this as a diplomatic breakthrough after US airstrikes targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi indicated that Iran would cease its response if Israel halted its aggression, and Israeli attacks reportedly stopped as the deadline approached. The development follows a day of heightened tensions, including Iranian missile attacks on a US base in Qatar, which were reportedly intercepted without casualties or damage.</p>

More than 150 million Americans are under the highest level extreme heat alerts, and experts say the first few heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous because the human body has yet to adjust to the warmer temperatures.

          <p>Ispace, a Japanese company, has blamed a laser navigation tool for the crash landing of its lunar lander, Resilience, earlier this month. The lander, aiming for the moon's far north, crashed after the laser range finder failed to accurately measure its distance to the lunar surface, causing it to descend rapidly. This marks the second failed lunar landing attempt for ispace, with the first occurring in 2023 due to software issues. Despite these setbacks, ispace plans to proceed with its third moon landing attempt in 2027, in collaboration with NASA, and a fourth mission is also planned.</p>

Myanmar is a key source of heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium, crucial for high-tech manufacturing. China's dominance in rare earths is strengthened by Myanmar's production, giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain.

Organizations are providing assistance, including 'Know Your Rights' workshops and financial support, and legislation has been introduced to protect vendor data and prevent immigration enforcement.

          <p>Eight people died after a boat capsized on Lake Tahoe due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park. The Coast Guard initially reported six deaths and two missing, with the bodies of the missing individuals recovered later.

Experts emphasize the importance of being prepared before boating, including having a radio, wearing a life vest, and taking a boating course to understand weather conditions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing its plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs issued an injunction, citing the university's free speech rights under the US Constitution's first amendment. Harvard alleges that Trump is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to the administration's demands regarding governance, curriculum, and ideology. The ruling prevents the administration from blocking international students from attending the university, which has faced previous challenges from the administration.</p>

          <p>Florida will receive federal funds to set up immigration detention centers, including a proposed site in the Everglades dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz.' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the facilities will be funded largely by FEMA's shelter and services program. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced the federal government had approved the state's plan to build 'Alligator Alcatraz' and other facilities that could collectively house as many as 5,000 detainees. The facilities could start receiving detainees early next month, and Uthmeier stated that Florida officials will fight alongside the Trump administration to keep Florida safe, strong, and free.</p>

Uthmeier argued that illegal immigration continues to wreak havoc in the state while that law cannot be enforced. The state's immigration law was passed earlier this year and makes it a crime for people living in the U.S. illegally to 'knowingly enter or re-enter Florida after coming into the country by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.'</p>

The claim alleges the earplugs suffered from a design defect which meant they were unable to form a complete seal in the soldier's ear. It is also alleged 3M knew the ear plugs were defective, referring to evidence which came out of litigation in the US in which an internal memo acknowledged the ear plugs had problems. The class action follows a historic $6bn settlement made by 3M regarding the same ear plugs which were supplied to the US military.</p>

          <p>President Trump said Monday the Iranian government offered "early notice" about a series of missile strikes that targeted the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying Iran's response to the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend as "very weak." The president did not specify how much early warning Iran gave or how the warning was delivered, but Mr. Trump's message seemed to confirm speculation that Iran could telegraph its plans for retaliation in advance, giving the United States a chance to minimize the damage and avoid an escalation. Hours after the Qatar strikes on Monday, Mr. Trump announced Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire starting at midnight ET.</p>

Red River Radio, a public radio station in Shreveport, serves East Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, and relies on government funding to provide news to communities with limited access to other sources. The proposed cuts could have a vital impact on rural communities, especially during hurricane season when residents rely on public radio broadcasts for life-saving information. The cuts to public broadcasting have been touted by the Trump administration and Republicans as an effort to slash taxpayer funding for news media outlets they accuse of being politically biased.</p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson suggests the push is now irrelevant because Trump announced Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, but top Democrats say they were kept in the dark about the decision to bomb the sites. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he still hasn't been briefed by the White House and accused the president of potentially misleading the public, while Sen.

The incidents, including a robotaxi driving the wrong way and another braking abruptly in traffic, prompted NHTSA to gather additional information from Tesla. The pilot robotaxi service, operating with fewer than two-dozen vehicles, is limited to invited users and operates only during daylight hours and in good weather, with a human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat.
