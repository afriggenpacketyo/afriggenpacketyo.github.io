        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst ongoing anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests in Los Angeles, ICE agents were denied entry to Dodger Stadium. The Los Angeles Dodgers organization confirmed they denied the agents access to the parking lots, while the Department of Homeland Security stated their presence was unrelated to the Dodgers. Protests have been ongoing due to criticism of the Dodgers' silence on immigration raids, with demonstrators urging the organization to speak out. This situation arose after reports of ICE raids in Los Angeles, coinciding with President Trump's instructions to expand deportation efforts. The event underscores the tension between federal immigration enforcement and local community sentiments, particularly in diverse urban areas. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing conflict between federal directives and community resistance.</p>

          <h2>Study Shows Plastic Bag Bans and Fees Effectively Reduce Litter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 15:57:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that state and local plastic bag regulations significantly reduce plastic bag litter along U.S. shorelines. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups from 2017 to 2023, finding that plastic bag litter decreased by 25% to 47% in areas with bag policies compared to those without. The study highlights the effectiveness of these policies in curbing plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. The findings suggest that fees on plastic bags may be more effective than bans, particularly partial bans, in limiting shoreline litter. The results offer a positive outlook on environmental conservation efforts and the potential for policy interventions to mitigate plastic pollution.</p>

          <p>As tensions rise between Israel and Iran, the U.S. is considering providing Israel with the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb, a bunker-buster capable of destroying Iran's Fordo nuclear site. The MOP, weighing nearly 30,000 pounds, can only be carried and deployed by the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, known for evading air defenses. The B-2's stealth capabilities and capacity to carry two MOP bombs make it ideal for reaching heavily defended targets. The potential use of these weapons highlights the escalating concerns over Iran's nuclear program and the possible military options being considered. The decision remains controversial, with critics citing the move as potentially provocative.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a surge of approximately 3% due to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's directive for the Israeli military to intensify its attacks against Iran. Investors are closely monitoring for indications of increased U.S. involvement in the ongoing conflict. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, reached its highest settlement since January 22, while U.S. crude oil also saw a significant increase. This escalation follows an Iranian missile strike on a hospital in Beersheba, with Israel threatening further action against Iran's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

Key factors in the acquittal included the defense's claim that O'Keefe could have been killed by someone else and doubts about the integrity of the police investigation.

The studio's latest original movie, "Elio," is projected to have a soft debut, highlighting the industry's trend of audiences gravitating towards familiar franchises. While Pixar remains committed to telling original stories, recent originals from Disney and other studios have struggled. The pandemic's impact on theatrical attendance and the rise of streaming have further complicated the landscape for animated films.
