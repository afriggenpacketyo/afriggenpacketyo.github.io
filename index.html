          <h2>ICE Detention Population Sees Sharpest Growth Among Immigrants with No Criminal Record</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 21:04:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under a new mass deportation campaign, data from the Deportation Data Project reveals a significant shift in ICE's detention practices. Nearly half of the 56,000 immigrants currently held in detention do not have any criminal convictions, representing the fastest-growing segment of the detainee population. This trend contradicts the administration's stated focus on deporting violent criminals and is exemplified by cases like that of a Guatemalan pastor who was deported after 30 years in the U.S. despite having no criminal record. The data suggests a broadening of enforcement actions to include any individual without legal status.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and two injured. The blasts ignited multiple grass fires and prompted mandatory evacuations within a one-mile radius, with smaller explosions continuing into the next day. An investigation revealed that the facility, which stored commercial fireworks, lacked the necessary local permits and business licenses to operate on the agricultural property. Federal agencies, including the ATF, have joined the investigation into the cause of the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, has been released from immigration detention after being held for nearly five months. She was arrested in February while returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands, despite having lived in the U.S. since she was a child and having a pending green card application. During her confinement, the government twice attempted to deport her, once in defiance of a judge's order. Sakeik described harrowing conditions in detention and the fear of being sent to a country where she has no legal status.</p>

          <p>Imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi has warned that the Iranian government is using its recent conflict with Israel as a cover to intensify repression against its own citizens. In a message from Tehran, she stated that the regime is escalating arrests and executions to spread fear and deflect from its policy failures. Mohammadi also described extremely harsh conditions for political prisoners who were transferred from Evin Prison after it was struck by an Israeli missile, calling for renewed international scrutiny of Iran's human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>Recent budget cuts and a hiring freeze within the National Park Service (NPS) are creating significant public safety concerns as the summer season begins. An advocacy group reports that the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff under the current administration, leading to shortages of essential personnel like lifeguards at popular sites such as Assateague Island National Seashore. Local officials and park advocates warn that the lack of staff puts visitors in jeopardy, attributing the situation to a policy of widespread personnel cuts across the federal government.</p>

Partisan differences were noted, with Republicans more likely than Democrats to use the flag for political expression. Additionally, a strong majority of Americans believe it should be illegal to burn or destroy the flag as a form of protest.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's aggressive tariff policies reveals a mixed but concerning impact on the U.S. economy. While the stock market has rebounded from its initial plunge, there are emerging signs of an economic slowdown, including two consecutive months of falling retail sales and weakening consumer spending. Economists widely anticipate that American consumers will ultimately absorb the costs of the tariffs, which are now six times higher on average than at the start of the year, raising fears of a potential recession.

          <p>One year into its term, the Labour government under Sir Keir Starmer has faced significant challenges in implementing its ambitious agenda to 'change' Britain. A BBC assessment across key policy areas shows a mixed record: economic growth has been sluggish, small boat crossings have increased, and the government has performed U-turns on welfare reform. While there has been some success in resetting diplomatic relations with the EU and US, the administration continues to grapple with the harsh realities of governing.</p>

The ruling clears the way for their deportation to South Sudan, a country with which the men have no personal ties.
