His decision came just hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him for opposing the GOP's major tax and spending bill. In his statement, Tillis lamented that independent thinking and bipartisanship are becoming an "endangered species" in politics.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States is critically vulnerable to China's dominance over the rare earth minerals supply chain, which is essential for modern technology and defense systems. China's recent export controls are described as a weaponization of this dependence, revealing a long-standing failure of U.S. policy to build secure, independent capacity. The piece criticizes a recent six-month trade framework as a temporary reprieve that doesn't solve the underlying problem of China's control over 90% of refining capacity. The author urges the U.S. to adopt a coherent, long-term strategy treating critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power. (not investment advice)</p>

He specifically cited projections that 16 million people could lose health coverage and noted cuts to food assistance and clean energy jobs.

His win reflects a growing disillusionment with Israel's current government among some voters, including many younger Jews.

          <p>An early summer heatwave is bringing extreme temperatures to several European countries, breaking records and prompting official warnings. Spain recorded its hottest June temperature ever at 46Â°C (114.8Â°F), while Italy placed 21 cities on high alert, and Greece issued warnings about wildfire risks. The heat is expected to persist, with London predicted to see its hottest day of the year. Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such early heatwaves to human-driven climate change, with experts warning that society must adapt to even higher temperatures in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As temperatures rise, animal welfare experts are reminding pet owners of the serious dangers of exercising dogs in hot weather. The RSPCA notes that dogs are far more likely to suffer from heat-related illness during exercise than from being left in hot cars, as they have a very limited ability to cool themselves down. Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, lethargy, and excessive drooling. To keep dogs safe, owners should avoid walks during the hottest parts of the day, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water and shade.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment program within "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent U.S. military strikes on three of its nuclear facilities. Grossi clarified that while the strikes caused severe damage, it was not total, and Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to rebuild. He also noted that the IAEA cannot account for Iran's entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium, as some may have been moved before the attack, underscoring the need for inspectors to regain access.</p>
