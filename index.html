        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new powers allowing police to impose conditions on recurring protests by considering their cumulative impact. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood clarified the measures are about restrictions, not an outright ban, aiming to balance the right to protest with community safety. The move follows recent large-scale demonstrations and a deadly synagogue attack, prompting concerns about stretched police resources and certain communities feeling intimidated. This legislative review will also consider the possibility of outright protest bans to ensure public order.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has urged a calm and sober response to numerous drone sightings over German airports and military sites, stating they have not posed a concrete threat so far. While acknowledging Russia may be using the drones for provocation, he emphasized the need for a comprehensive situational awareness system rather than just a dedicated drone defense center. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is pushing to create a joint drone defense unit to address what he calls an "arms race," as the incidents have caused significant disruptions, including repeated closures of Munich Airport.</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains in Nepal have triggered devastating landslides and flash floods, leading to the deaths of at least 22 people with 12 others reported missing. The eastern Ilam district was hit particularly hard, where multiple villages were swept away and 18 fatalities occurred, including six members of a single family whose home was buried. Rescue efforts are being hampered by continuous rainfall and blocked roads, which have also severed major highways connecting the capital, Kathmandu. The government has declared a national holiday as the severe weather is expected to persist.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone attacks across Ukraine have resulted in at least five deaths, with four fatalities reported in the western city of Lviv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia launched over 50 missiles and hundreds of drones, targeting infrastructure and causing power outages in several regions, including Zaporizhzhia. In response to the threat, neighboring Poland scrambled its fighter jets to secure its airspace. The attacks come shortly after a US official indicated support for Ukrainian strikes deep within Russian territory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, though it is not a popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210-seat People's Assembly will be chosen by district-based electoral colleges, with the remaining third appointed by the interim president. The interim authorities cited the impossibility of creating an accurate voter registry due to widespread displacement as the reason for this system. The results are being watched as an indicator of the new government's commitment to inclusivity, especially concerning women and minorities, though the process has faced criticism for a lack of transparency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent record sales, the United States is lagging behind China and Europe in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). Analysts attribute this to weaker government support, higher average costs for EVs, and the recent expiration of a significant $7,500 tax credit, which is expected to cause a sharp drop in demand. While battery-powered cars reached a new high of 10% of U.S. sales in August, this figure is significantly lower than the market share in Europe and China. Policy differences and high tariffs on affordable Chinese models are cited as key factors hindering more widespread adoption in the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

After tracking the vehicle's VIN, detectives located it at a scrap metal yard, only to discover it had been crushed just a week before their arrival.

While the club has seen investment in its training facilities, won a domestic trophy, and qualified for the Champions League, it has not engaged in the massive spending spree many anticipated. The club's growth has been constrained by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules, forcing a more measured approach to player acquisitions and development.

          <p>Despite political disagreements stemming from the Gaza war and U.S. scrutiny, China and Israel appear to be working to maintain their crucial trade and technology relationship. China's ambassador to Israel, Xiao Junzheng, has been actively engaging with Israeli officials and visiting key joint infrastructure projects, such as the Tel Aviv light rail and a container terminal in Haifa. These efforts aim to reinforce the "comprehensive innovative partnership" established in 2017. The article suggests that both nations share a mutual interest in preserving their economic links, even as geopolitical pressures create challenges.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Democrats are now supporting an approach to homelessness long advocated by Republicans like Donald Trump: expanding the use of civil commitment to compel individuals into medical care. States like Oregon, California, and New York are exploring or enacting laws that would make it easier for judges to mandate treatment for addiction and severe mental illness.
