          <p>House Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, are facing significant challenges in securing the votes to pass President Trump's large-scale budget bill. After the legislation narrowly passed the Senate with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance, several conservative House members have publicly opposed the Senate's version. With a slim majority, Johnson can only afford to lose three Republican votes if all members are present. The situation is further complicated by potential attendance issues due to weather-related travel disruptions and a fast-approaching self-imposed July 4th deadline, creating a precarious path for the bill's passage.

          <p>As a jury deliberates in the federal trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs, legal experts are weighing the potential impact on his considerable wealth, estimated at $400 million. If convicted on charges including racketeering and sex trafficking, prosecutors could seek forfeiture of assets proven to be connected to the criminal enterprise, such as a private jet. A conviction would also likely lead to significant financial penalties, restitution payments, and would strengthen the numerous civil lawsuits he faces. Even an acquittal could harm his finances, as his damaged reputation may hinder future business deals, endorsements, and income opportunities in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Police in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, have arrested two individuals after discovering 383 corpses piled up in a private crematorium near the U.S. border. The local prosecutor's office stated the bodies, some of which may have been there for up to two years, were deposited irregularly and never cremated due to negligence. Authorities reported that the deceased had been embalmed, but their families were given other materials instead of ashes. This discovery highlights a broader crisis in Mexico's forensic system, which is overwhelmed by high body counts and resource limitations amid ongoing organized crime violence.</p>

He acknowledged China's significant development investments in Pacific nations but asserted that this should not compromise relationships with traditional partners like Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. This declaration comes as China continues to expand its influence, notably through a security pact with the Solomon Islands, raising regional concerns about potential military basing.</p>

Cheshire Police have submitted a file related to their ongoing investigation, Operation Hummingbird, which examines deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at hospitals where Letby worked, including Liverpool Women's Hospital. Letby is already serving 15 life sentences for the murder of seven babies and the attempted murder of seven others at the Countess of Chester Hospital. This development occurs as her legal team seeks to challenge her existing convictions through the Criminal Cases Review Commission, citing a report from experts who question if any harm was deliberate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal trial of music mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs centers on a complex racketeering conspiracy charge, which carries a potential life sentence. Originally designed to prosecute mob bosses under the RICO Act, this charge requires prosecutors to prove Combs directed a criminal enterprise involving his associates to commit multiple crimes over several years, including sex trafficking and obstruction of justice. The prosecution's case hinges on allegations of coerced sexual encounters, known as "freak-offs." The defense argues that for the charge to stand, prosecutors must prove that Combs' employees were knowingly complicit in a criminal enterprise, a point they contend has not been established. In addition to racketeering, Combs faces multiple civil lawsuits alleging sexual assault.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise against retiring until several key milestones are met to ensure long-term stability and well-being. A crucial first step is to create a detailed retirement budget to understand future expenses and ensure savings are adequate. It is also vital to eliminate or significantly reduce high-interest, non-mortgage debt, as this can drain retirement funds. Securing a comprehensive healthcare plan is essential to prepare for potentially high medical costs in senior years. Other important preparations include creating an estate plan, developing a social and mental plan to avoid post-career boredom, and conducting a lifestyle trial run to test the budget and daily plans.

          <p>Karen Kneller, the chief executive of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), has resigned following intense criticism over the organization's handling of high-profile cases. The CCRC, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice in the UK, admitted to "failing" Andrew Malkinson, who spent 17 years in prison for a sexual assault he did not commit. A justice select committee cited the CCRC's "inability to learn from its own mistakes" under Kneller's leadership and called for her departure. This follows the resignation of the CCRC's chair earlier in the year, as the organization faces a crisis of confidence and reviews thousands of previously rejected cases.</p>

          <p>Beijing has swiftly rejected the succession plan outlined by the Dalai Lama, stating that the selection of his reincarnation must adhere to Chinese law and tradition. The 90-year-old exiled Tibetan spiritual leader declared that the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a body he controls, holds the sole authority to identify his successor, a process to be decided by Tibetans and Buddhists. However, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman countered that the process must follow established religious traditions, including domestic recognition, the 'golden urn' lottery system, and final approval from the central government.

          <p>New research suggests that the collapse of tropical forests following the "Great Dying" mass extinction 252 million years ago was the primary reason Earth remained lethally hot for five million years. An international team of scientists analyzed a vast fossil archive, revealing that the widespread loss of vegetation crippled the planet's ability to absorb and store carbon. This disruption to the carbon cycle kept atmospheric CO2 levels extremely high long after the initial volcanic activity that triggered the extinction ceased. The findings serve as a stark warning about modern climate change, illustrating a potential tipping point where forest collapse could lock in and accelerate global warming.</p>

A significant portion of these cuts stems from a new national work requirement for many beneficiaries and a cap on state provider taxes, a key funding source for hospitals. Critics, including the American Nurses Association, warn these changes could shutter rural health centers that heavily rely on federal funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority is dangerously empowering President Trump by weakening the judiciary's ability to check his actions. The column focuses on a recent decision that limits the power of federal district court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against policies deemed illegal, a key tool used to block many of Trump's executive orders. The author contends that the court seems more concerned with a theoretical "imperial judiciary" than with the real threat of an authoritarian executive. This ruling is presented as part of a pattern of decisions that favor the Trump administration, effectively giving it a green light to continue legally questionable actions.</p>

          <p>A veterinarian in Wisconsin has successfully saved a severely injured American bald eagle using a pioneering procedure involving grafts made from Atlantic cod skin. The eagle, named Kere, was found with its leg torn open and a deep infection, making euthanasia seem likely. Dr. Kimberly Ammann of the Winged Freedom Raptor Hospital used the fish skin patches, typically used for human wounds, to repair the damage and promote tissue regeneration. After a ten-month rehabilitation, the eagle was successfully released back into the wild, a symbolic event just ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, celebrating the freedom of the nation's iconic bird.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent tour of a new migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is being seen as a celebration of the administration's increasingly draconian immigration policies. Accompanied by top officials, Trump praised the hastily constructed facility, which is located in a hot, humid marshland known for alligators and pythons. The visit is the latest in a series of escalations, including the deployment of troops against protesters and arrests of political figures.

          <p>A review of the Supreme Court's recent term indicates that social and religious conservatives, along with President Donald Trump, were the primary beneficiaries of its major decisions. The court sided with conservatives on cases involving religious opt-outs in public schools and limiting enforcement of Medicaid law, and handed a significant defeat to transgender Americans regarding access to medical care. Simultaneously, the court frequently used its 'shadow docket' to reinstate Trump administration policies that lower courts had blocked. While the court showed some moderation on business and economic issues, the overall trend reveals a judiciary willing to reshape American institutions to advance the cultural right's agenda.</p>
