          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey reveals that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level recorded since 1939. This trend is accompanied by a decrease in drinking frequency and per-capita consumption, largely attributed to growing public awareness of alcohol's health risks, as organizations like the WHO state no level is safe. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, which corresponds with a reduction in alcohol-related deaths and other negative outcomes for young people. While this shift is largely positive for public health, the article notes it could be linked to a broader trend of reduced social interaction.</p>

          <p>During a recent television appearance, actress Margaret Qualley shared a humorous anecdote about her attempt to play matchmaker for her mother, Andie MacDowell, and actor Bill Murray. After discovering Murray now lives in the same city as her mother, Charleston, she approached him with the idea. Murray candidly responded that he and MacDowell did not get along well during the filming of their 1993 movie "Groundhog Day," citing disagreements over punctuality and line memorization. Despite this, Qualley expressed her belief that their shared history and single status could still make for a compelling, if unconventional, romantic pairing.</p>

          <p>Health officials are urgently contacting hundreds of recent visitors to Grand Teton National Park who may have been exposed to rabies. The potential exposure occurred in eight specific cabins at the Jackson Lake Lodge, which were found to be infested with a colony of bats in the attic space. Although the few bats tested so far have been negative for the virus, officials are taking precautions due to the high risk and the fact that bat bites can go unnoticed, especially during sleep. Visitors who stayed in the affected cabins between May and late July are being alerted across 38 states and seven countries and advised to seek medical consultation immediately.</p>

          <p>Erin has officially become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, rapidly strengthening into a powerful Category 4 storm. While it is not currently projected to make landfall in the United States, its path is expected to pass just north of several Caribbean islands, including the Leewards, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Forecasters have issued warnings for these areas regarding life-threatening surf, heavy rainfall up to six inches, and the potential for flash floods and mudslides. The National Hurricane Center anticipates that Erin will continue to gain strength over the weekend, potentially becoming a major hurricane, before curving northward into the open ocean.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has taken an approximately 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor, urging its board to implement significant strategic changes to address chronic underperformance. In a public letter, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes focusing on operational excellence, reducing costs, optimizing the company's portfolio through divestitures, and refreshing the board of directors. The firm criticized Avantor's past leadership for costly acquisitions at peak market valuations and for rejecting a potentially lucrative takeover offer in 2023. Engine suggests that if these changes are implemented, Avantor's stock could be worth between $22 and $26 per share by 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has awarded former FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation $250,000 in a default judgment against blogger Jim Stewartson. The defamation lawsuit stemmed from a series of posts in which Stewartson accused Patel of being a "Kremlin asset" and of planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge granted the default judgment after Stewartson failed to formally respond to the lawsuit, stating that the blogger acted with malice and that punitive damages were warranted to deter similar behavior. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to contest the ruling, calling the legal action an attempt to intimidate him.</p>

          <p>Recent market data indicates that Samsung is closing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip series, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard smartphone design. While Apple still holds the top position with 49% market share, its lead has narrowed, reflecting a renewed competition centered on screen technology and device innovation. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own slimmer or foldable iPhone models in the near future to counter Samsung's momentum.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all of its operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, leading to a nationwide strike. The work stoppage, the first of its kind since 1985, began early Saturday after last-minute negotiations, which included the federal jobs minister, did not produce a deal. The primary points of contention are wages and compensation for unpaid work performed by flight attendants while not in the air. The shutdown is expected to affect approximately 130,000 travelers daily, and the airline has warned that rebooking passengers on other carriers will be challenging due to peak summer travel demand.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the U.S. Midwest are grappling with a severe economic squeeze caused by the combined effects of the climate crisis and ongoing trade tariffs. Extreme weather patterns, such as last year's drought and this year's excessive rainfall, have significantly reduced crop yields for staples like corn and soybeans. Compounding these environmental challenges are retaliatory tariffs, particularly from China, which have caused U.S. soybean exports to plummet to a 20-year low and depressed domestic prices. This perfect storm of volatile weather and unfavorable trade policies is creating immense financial and mental stress for agricultural communities, threatening the viability of many family farms.</p>

This reliance on veteran politicians in key swing states contrasts with calls from within the party to elevate a younger generation.

          <p>The article explores the growing trend of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services, which are disproportionately used by young women and marketed with slogans like "Little payments are so much cuter." These services, offered by companies like Afterpay and Klarna, allow consumers to split purchases into smaller, interest-free installments, making expensive items seem more affordable. However, missed payments can lead to significant late fees and damage to credit scores, normalizing debt for a generation often wary of traditional credit cards. The article argues that this trend is fueled by influencer culture and targeted advertising, creating a gateway to consumer debt under the guise of responsible spending.</p>

However, certified financial planners recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. Experts emphasize that beginning to save in one's early 20s, even with small monthly contributions, can lead to a significantly larger nest egg over time. While achieving retirement in one's late 50s is possible when starting at 27, it requires aggressive and consistent savings. The advice comes as many Americans express regret for not starting their retirement planning sooner, often citing debt or insufficient income as major obstacles.</p>

          <p>Hundreds gathered for a vigil in Monrovia, California, to honor Carlos Roberto Montoya, a Guatemalan day laborer who was fatally struck by a vehicle on the 210 Freeway while fleeing from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Community organizers, religious leaders, and politicians, including Rep. Judy Chu, attended the event, blaming the Trump administration's immigration policies for creating a climate of fear that led to the tragic death. Montoya, who had lived in the U.S. for three years, was remembered as a hardworking man supporting his family back home. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the individual was not being actively pursued at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>A great horned owl is facing a long and uncertain rehabilitation after being found stuck in a glue trap in Orange County, a device intended for rodents. A well-meaning rescuer cut the owl's feathers to free it, inadvertently causing severe damage that will prevent it from flying until it completes a full molt, a process that could take over a year for its species. Wildlife experts at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center are using this incident to warn the public about the indiscriminate harm caused by glue traps, which often ensnare non-target animals like birds and snakes. The owl's future is now uncertain, as a prolonged recovery could make its successful re-release into the wild impossible.</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are facing homelessness, a crisis described as a "national scandal" that is forcing healthcare organizations to intervene in housing. Groups like the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), funded by Medicare and Medicaid, traditionally help frail seniors stay in their homes but are now finding they must first secure housing for their clients. The population of homeless individuals aged 55 and over is increasing due to rising living costs, lack of economic stability, and personal crises like illness or the death of a spouse. In response, some healthcare providers are partnering with housing developers or even building their own facilities to address this critical need.</p>

This high-level diplomatic engagement signals a potential easing of tensions between the two Asian powers. During his trip, Wang is expected to meet with India's National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval, to continue discussions on disengagement and de-escalation in the contested region.</p>

          <p>Following a three-hour summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, that did not produce a ceasefire, President Donald Trump announced an upcoming meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump stated on social media that the goal is to pursue a comprehensive peace agreement rather than a temporary ceasefire, which he noted often fails to hold. The announcement came after a late-night call involving Zelenskyy and European leaders, signaling a shift in diplomatic strategy. Zelenskyy confirmed he will travel to Washington D.C. to discuss the details of a potential path toward ending the war.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to bring to justice those responsible for cutting down a memorial tree planted for Ilan Halimi, a young Jewish man who was tortured and murdered in 2006. The olive tree, located in a Paris suburb, was found felled in what officials are calling an act of antisemitic hatred. Macron described the act as an attempt to "kill him a second time" and reaffirmed that the Republic would remain "uncompromising" in the face of antisemitism. Halimi's brutal murder by a gang that targeted him because he was Jewish sent shockwaves through France and remains a painful symbol of modern antisemitism.</p>

          <p>California has approved a landmark conservation plan aimed at protecting the western Joshua tree from the long-term threats of climate change and development. The plan identifies crucial habitat areas where the species is most likely to survive in a warmer climate and recommends measures like limiting development and reducing wildfire risks. The underlying law, passed in 2023, is controversial as it requires permits and mitigation fees for removing or damaging the currently abundant trees, sparking opposition from local officials and residents in high desert communities. Proponents hail the forward-looking strategy as a groundbreaking effort to conserve a species based on future climate projections.</p>

          <p>Young people in Washington, D.C. are expressing fear and anxiety following President Trump's decision to deploy federal forces and take control of the city's police department. Teenagers interviewed by NPR stated that the heavy presence of National Guard troops and federal officers makes them feel intimidated and targeted, rather than safer. They described a climate of fear where they are hesitant to go outside, worried that any minor misstep could lead to a confrontation. This sentiment contrasts with the administration's justification for the takeover, which cited a need to control "roving mobs of wild youth" in a city where crime rates have actually been falling.</p>

One notable detail was the planned gift from Trump to Putin: an "American Bald Eagle Desk Statue." The documents also contained a seating chart for a lunch that was ultimately cancelled, showing the intended arrangement of top officials from both nations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on wild chimpanzees in Uganda suggests that young chimps primarily learn their complex communication styles, which combine vocalizations and gestures, from their mothers. Scientists observed that individuals related through their maternal line exhibited similar patterns and frequencies of these communication combinations, a resemblance not found with paternal relatives. Because young chimps spend their formative years almost exclusively with their mothers, the findings indicate that these behaviors are socially learned rather than genetically inherited. This discovery provides a potential clue into the evolution of human language, suggesting that the capacity for socially acquired communication may date back millions of years to a common ancestor.</p>
