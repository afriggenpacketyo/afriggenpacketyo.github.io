          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after more than a week of aerial attacks following Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear program. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war is over, according to Trump. Iran carried out a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday, two days after the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran. There are no reports of casualties at the base, according to a U.S. official, but the attack was in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran on Saturday, leading to what Trump called "Monumental Damage" to Iranian nuclear sites. </p>

          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments by ¬£5 billion a year by 2030. The MPs have expressed concerns about the plans, particularly proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The amendment notes the need for social security reform but lists reasons for rejecting the bill, including the expected increase in relative poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessment. The level of support for the amendment indicates a potential rebellion facing ministers, though the success of the amendment is not assured.</p>

          <p>Florida is planning to build a migrant detention center in the Everglades, dubbed the "Alligator Alcatraz," to temporarily hold migrants. The facility, to be built on the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, is intended to help ramp up deportations of illegal migrants. Attorney General James Uthmeier argued the location acts as a natural deterrent for escapees due to the presence of alligators and pythons. However, the plan has been criticized by Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniela Levine Cava, who argued that the impacts to the Everglades ecosystem could be devastating.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the 2001 ‚ÄúRoadless Rule,‚Äù eliminating protection for 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. The USDA described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, arguing that rescinding it will enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups have denounced the decision, arguing that building roads can fragment habitats, disrupt ecosystems, and increase erosion. The decision aligns with Trump's efforts to expand mining, logging, and drilling on public lands, but opponents argue it is a giveaway to timber companies that will exacerbate climate change and increase the intensity of wildfires.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to insert the U.S. into the conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire, with Trump announcing that the two countries have agreed to halt hostilities. While neither Israel nor Iran has definitively confirmed the development, White House officials are touting it as a diplomatic breakthrough. The ceasefire follows a tumultuous day in the region, with Iran retaliating for U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, and the U.S. warning of an overwhelming response to any Iranian attacks on U.S. interests. If the ceasefire holds, it would mark a significant step back from the brink of a conflict that threatened to engulf the region.</p>

The 55-year-old music mogul is accused of using his power as the leader of a business empire to facilitate the sexual assault of women and conceal his crimes. Mr. Combs has admitted to domestic violence but has pleaded not guilty to the prosecution's charges. The prosecution's case relies on laws once aimed at mob bosses to try and bring him down, and has called more than 30 witnesses, including his ex-girlfriend and musician Casandra Ventura, and rapper Kid Cudi, as well as former assistants, hotel security guards and others who say they witnessed Mr Combs' abuse.</p>

          <p>China has become reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, accounting for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar's rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018, reaching a peak of nearly 42,000 metric tons by 2023, with imports being particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents. This has strengthened China's dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain. The rare earths extracted by IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of "rare earth oxides" for further processing and refining.</p>

          <p>Street vendors in Los Angeles, particularly those who are undocumented, are facing increased economic hardship and fear due to ongoing immigration raids. Many vendors are forced to choose between staying home safely or risking deportation to provide for themselves and their families. The immigration raids have sparked protests, violence, and the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines, exacerbating the economic challenges for vendors. Organizations are stepping up efforts to assist vendors by providing financial support, hosting "Know Your Rights" workshops, and advocating for legislation to protect them from immigration enforcement.</p>

The city aspires to become a central node in the global economy, connecting Asia and Europe through rail. Shipping goods from Asean to Europe via Chongqing by rail is 10 to 20 days faster than traditional sea transport, and the city is deepening its global trade footprint amid rising geopolitical risks.</p>

The announcement illustrates a broader effort by Republican-led states to help the Trump administration carry out its promised mass deportation campaign.

          <p>Florida officials have asked the Supreme Court to allow the state to enforce a new immigration law that makes it a crime for people in the United States unlawfully to enter Florida. Attorney General James Uthmeier requested the justices to put on hold a federal judge's decision preventing law enforcement officers from enforcing the law, known as SB 4-C. The judge ruled that the measure is likely unconstitutional, but Uthmeier argued that "illegal immigration continues to wreak havoc in the state while that law cannot be enforced." The state's immigration law makes it a crime for people living in the U.S. illegally to knowingly enter or re-enter Florida after coming into the country by eluding examination by immigration officers.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that the Iranian government provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying Iran's response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites as "very weak." Trump thanked Iran for the early notice, which he said made it possible for no lives to be lost and nobody to be injured. Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack from Iran was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials meeting over the weekend to prepare. The move to give advance notice echoes Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq.</p>

The scheme aims to tackle barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, lack of time, and religious or cultural concerns that keep women away from cervical screening.

          <p>The US Supreme Court has paved the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries they are not from, including conflict-ridden places such as South Sudan. The court paused a ruling by a Boston-based federal judge who said immigrants deserved a ‚Äúmeaningful opportunity‚Äù to bring claims that they would face the risk of torture, persecution or even death if removed to certain countries. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, accusing the court of ‚Äúrewarding lawlessness‚Äù by allowing the government to violate the due process rights of the immigrants facing removal. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the decision as a ‚Äúvictory for the safety and security of the American people‚Äù.</p>
