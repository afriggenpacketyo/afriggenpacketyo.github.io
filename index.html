        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price experienced a significant jump, surpassing $100,000 for the first time since February, fueled by optimism surrounding a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's rise coincided with President Trump's announcement of a broad trade outline, which also boosted stock markets. Market analysts suggest that bitcoin's recent performance underscores its resilience and status as a safe-haven asset amid global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, including rising tensions between India and Pakistan. However, they caution that bitcoin's resilience will continue to be tested by ongoing volatility and macroeconomic factors.</p>

          <p>In a comprehensive interview, Bill Gates outlined the Gates Foundation's plans to sunset in 2045, accelerating its giving to address pressing global health and development challenges. He emphasized the urgency of the foundation's work given setbacks from the pandemic and cuts to foreign aid, particularly by the Trump administration, which he notes could result in millions of additional childhood deaths. Gates remains optimistic about leveraging advancements in biomedical tools and A.I. to combat diseases like tuberculosis and H.I.V., expressing a commitment to innovation and partnerships to improve global health outcomes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law in Washington state requires clergy, including Catholic priests, to report child abuse disclosed during confessions, leading to strong reactions from the Catholic Church and the federal government. The Seattle Archdiocese has threatened excommunication for priests who comply, while the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation, citing potential First Amendment violations. Supporters of the law argue it is necessary to protect children, while opponents claim it infringes on religious freedom and the sanctity of confession. Experts suggest the law could deter individuals from confessing sexual assault, potentially hindering referrals to mental health professionals and authorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several states, including Arkansas, Ohio, and Arizona, are attempting to reinstate Medicaid work requirements, prompting worries among low-income Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. These requirements, previously blocked by courts, mandate that recipients work a certain number of hours to maintain coverage. Critics argue that these rules create unnecessary barriers and disproportionately affect those already working or facing health challenges, while proponents claim they promote self-sufficiency. Studies suggest that most Medicaid recipients already work or are exempt due to disabilities or caregiving responsibilities, and implementing these rules could lead to significant coverage losses and increased administrative costs.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will cease tracking the costs associated with billion-dollar disasters, a move that has drawn criticism from researchers and lawmakers. This decision will leave a gap in understanding the economic impact of extreme weather events, which are increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change. Experts fear that the absence of this data will hinder efforts to budget for and address climate-related risks, as the database has been a reliable source of information for assessing economic losses from events like hurricanes and wildfires. Critics argue that this decision undermines the ability to address and mitigate the growing threats posed by climate change.</p>

          <p>Cameron Hamilton, the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was terminated after publicly opposing the Trump administration's proposal to eliminate the agency. Hamilton's dismissal came shortly after he testified before Congress, emphasizing the importance of FEMA in disaster response, contradicting statements made by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The firing raises concerns about the future of FEMA and its ability to effectively respond to natural disasters, especially as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches.

          <p>As Russia prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, the state is increasingly instrumentalizing Victory Day to shape national identity and ideology. While many Russian families associate the day with mourning the losses of World War II, the Kremlin is using it to draw parallels between the Soviet Union and present-day Russia, emphasizing the strength and legitimacy of the current regime. The military parade and other commemorations are seen as tools for mobilizing support and reinforcing the narrative of Russia as a "power for good," despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

          <p>India and Pakistan are experiencing a dangerous escalation in their armed confrontation, with both countries reporting attacks on military sites and heavy shelling along their border. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has spoken with leaders from both countries, urging immediate de-escalation amid international alarm that the conflict could spiral out of control. The latest escalation follows a terrorist attack in Kashmir, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement, which Pakistan denies. The situation is further complicated by competing claims, the presence of nuclear weapons, and a history of conflict over the disputed Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a plan to modernize the nation's air traffic control system, replacing technology at thousands of sites and building new coordination centers. The announcement follows a recent outage at Newark Liberty International Airport, highlighting the need for upgrades to the aging system. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that without modernization, similar incidents could occur at other airports. The plan includes purchasing new radios, replacing radars, and installing high-speed network connections, aiming to improve the safety and efficiency of air travel.</p>

          <h2>Companies Plan to Pass Tariff Costs to Consumers, Data Suggests</h2>

          <p>Economic data indicates that many companies intend to pass the costs of tariffs onto consumers, potentially driving up prices. Surveys reveal that a majority of manufacturers and retailers plan to pass tariff-related expenses to customers rather than absorb them internally. Economists warn that these tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, are likely to increase consumer prices in the coming months. While President Trump claims that foreign exporters will bear the costs, experts predict that low- and middle-income consumers will bear the brunt of the economic fallout.</p>

          <p>Two Republican senators are advocating for congressional approval of any future Iran nuclear deal, preferably through a treaty vote requiring a two-thirds majority in the Senate. They argue that a lasting agreement must include Iran dismantling its ballistic missile program and ceasing support for terrorist groups. Senator Tom Cotton criticized the Obama administration's deal for lacking congressional approval, making it easily reversible. The senators' stance reflects ongoing concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and the need for strict safeguards to prevent the development of nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the importance of understanding the minimum draw requirements associated with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). Lenders may require an upfront draw, even if you don't need the funds right away, and they may also have ongoing minimum usage requirements during the draw period. These rules can affect your interest costs and repayment plans, and it's important to understand how these requirements might impact the total cost of borrowing. If the terms don't align with how and when you plan to borrow, it may be worth considering alternatives like a home equity loan.</p>
