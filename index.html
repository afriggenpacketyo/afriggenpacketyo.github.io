            <h2>Nvidia Faces $5.5 Billion Charge Due to China Chip Export Restrictions</h2>

            <p>Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion charge in the current quarter related to the export of H20 graphics processing units to China and other restricted locations, causing a 6% stock dip. This follows the U.S. government's decision on April 9 to require licenses for exporting these chips, designed to comply with previous export restrictions, due to concerns over their potential military applications. CEO Jensen Huang acknowledges China's revenue decline to half of pre-export control levels and growing competition from companies like Huawei. Nvidia argues that further restrictions could hinder competition and U.S. technological competitiveness; the U.S. government has stated that the license requirement for H20 chips will be in effect indefinitely.

While maintaining its initial EPS guidance of $11.50-$13.50, the airline projects a lower range of $7-$9 EPS in a recessionary scenario. The company plans to reduce domestic flight capacity by 4% in the third quarter due to weakened demand, while international bookings remain strong. United reported a first-quarter profit of $387 million, exceeding expectations, and anticipates strong second-quarter earnings driven by premium cabin and international travel demand.

            <p>A proposed California law, named Wyland's Law, aims to expedite the reporting of restraining orders to state law enforcement databases, preventing individuals subject to such orders from purchasing firearms. The law is proposed after a man with a domestic violence restraining order was able to purchase a gun and kill his 10-year-old son. The bill would require county courts to verify submission of restraining orders and make records accessible within one day. The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence is sponsoring the bill.</p>

            <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order targeting Susman Godfrey, the law firm representing Dominion Voting Systems. The order sought to block the firm's access to government buildings and cancel government contracts due to their 'previous activities.' The judge called the order a 'shocking abuse of power' based on a personal vendetta. The ruling is a win for the law firm, which has fought back against the order instead of striking a deal with the administration.</p>

            <p>This article analyzes President Trump's governing style, arguing that his combination of authoritarian tactics could backfire. The author suggests that Trump's approach, blending the violent methods of Bukele with the subtle legal manipulation of Orbán, could inflame resistance to his policies. The analysis highlights the tension between these styles and suggests that Trump's strategic sloppiness may ultimately undermine his agenda and allow American democracy to endure.</p>

            <p>A CDC study reveals that autism has been identified in over 3% of children in the US, or one in 31, a significant increase. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attributes this to an 'epidemic' caused by environmental toxins. However, experts suggest improved screening and access to services may contribute to the rise in diagnoses. The study also notes higher prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children, which may be due to disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning.</p>

This decision follows preliminary tests revealing elevated lead levels in soil samples collected near the burn scar. The funds will be used to test residential properties downwind and within one mile of the Eaton burn scar boundary. The county is taking responsibility for contaminant testing due to the federal government's decision to discontinue soil testing on destroyed properties after fires.</p>
