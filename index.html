          <p>Protests erupted across several UK cities following the government's decision to proscribe the pro-Palestine activist group, Palestine Action, as a terrorist organization. The Metropolitan Police reported over 80 arrests, primarily for terrorism offenses related to displaying supportive placards. This governmental action, which criminalizes support for the group, was prompted by a break-in at an RAF base where activists caused significant damage. The protests coincide with a High Court challenge by the group's co-founder against the ban, highlighting ongoing tensions over activism and national security.</p>

          <p>A driver rammed a vehicle into a large crowd waiting outside an East Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 people, with seven reported in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday morning when a Nissan Versa struck the group, a taco truck, and a valet stand. Following the crash, bystanders reportedly assaulted the driver, who was also found to have sustained a gunshot wound from an unidentified suspect who fled the scene. Authorities are investigating the complex event as an assault with a deadly weapon.</p>

          <p>The article profiles Generation Life, a faith-based activist group advocating for chastity before marriage, during their outreach efforts at the Jersey shore. The activists attempt to connect with young people by discussing the negative impacts of social media on relationships and self-esteem, framing chastity as a countercultural solution. While many young people agree with the critique of modern dating culture, the core message of abstinence often struggles to gain traction. The piece explores how the group adapts its traditional message for Gen Z, a generation that is notably having less sex but is also increasingly secular.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's House of Councilors election, far-right parties are capitalizing on rising anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These nationalist groups are drawing parallels to movements like Donald Trump's MAGA, focusing on concerns over unruly tourists and crimes committed by foreigners. While Japan faces significant labor shortages due to a declining birthrate, these parties advocate against relying on foreign workers and call for stricter controls. The article notes this rhetoric resonates with some voters amid economic anxieties, even as data shows a decrease in crimes committed by foreign residents.</p>

          <h2>Bestselling Author Argues 'Follow Your Passion' Is the Worst Career Advice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bestselling author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway criticizes the common career advice to "follow your passion," arguing it's a platitude often given by those who are already wealthy. Instead, Galloway suggests that career success comes from finding the intersection of what you are good at and what can be financially rewarding. He shares his own journey, which involved enduring rejection and pivoting from his original passions to find his strengths in entrepreneurship. The article reinforces this idea with similar advice from Mastercard's CEO, emphasizing that practical skills and market opportunities are more crucial than passion alone for building a successful career.</p>

          <h2>The Resurgence of Tanning as a Cultural and Ideological Statement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 10:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores a recent cultural resurgence in tanning, linking it to an ideological shift seen within alternative-health and right-wing political circles. It notes that figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his nominated surgeon general appear to favor sun exposure, framing it as a natural need suppressed by the health establishment. This new "sun worship" often involves skepticism towards sunscreen and public health warnings about skin cancer, promoting unverified benefits instead. The piece argues that tanning has evolved from a simple aesthetic choice into a symbol of defiance against mainstream science and institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced it is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD) and will reduce its workforce by nearly 23%, or over 3,700 employees. The administration claims the move, which shifts scientific efforts into other program offices, will save nearly $750 million and better focus the agency on its core mission. Critics, including a top Democrat on the House science committee and an employee union leader, have condemned the decision, arguing that dismantling the EPA's main science arm will have devastating, long-term impacts on public and environmental health in the United States.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is under multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, with the Met Office cautioning about potential flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruption across all four nations. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast on Saturday morning did not result in the widespread flooding that was feared. However, the risk of localized flooding remains high as the ground, parched from a recent heatwave, has a reduced capacity to absorb heavy rainfall. The unsettled weather pattern is expected to continue into early next week.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that FC Barcelona has opened talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, a move the player has reportedly favored for some time. The proposed deal would be an initial loan with an option to buy, which would help United manage its wage bill. Rashford has been training separately from the main squad following a falling out with head coach Ruben Amorim, and he has not been assigned a squad number for the upcoming season. The transfer would see the 27-year-old England international join the Spanish champions after spending his entire career at his hometown club.</p>

          <p>A month after US airstrikes targeted three major Iranian nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, the full extent of the damage and potential safety risks remain unclear. The operation, which used powerful "bunker buster" bombs, was aimed at Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. While the targeted facilities are not believed to have active reactors, experts express concern about the potential release of toxic uranium hexafluoride gas. The IAEA has not detected increased radiation levels in the region, but the fate of Iran's existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium following the strikes is still uncertain.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Wipha is forecast to intensify into a typhoon before making landfall on the coast of southern China. The storm has already caused disruptions in the Philippines and Taiwan, where it prompted flight cancellations and brought heavy rainfall.

Hong Kong's flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, has also announced significant flight cancellations and delays, as the city braces for gale-force winds and potential coastal flooding from storm surges.</p>

          <h2>Approval of Trump's Spending Cuts Seen as a Test for Future Budgeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 09:28:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congress's recent approval of President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in federal spending is being viewed as a significant test case for future government appropriations. The move, which clawed back funding for programs like foreign aid and public broadcasting, passed with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes typically needed for budget bills. Analysts suggest this sets a precedent that could shift the federal budgeting process from a bipartisan norm to a more partisan one. This could dramatically alter how the government has been funded for years, allowing the party in power to enact cuts more easily. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being pulled into an active MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room against staff orders after hearing a relative screaming during a scan. The powerful magnetic force of the machine reportedly pulled the chain around his neck, drawing him into the device. Medical experts stress that strict safety protocols are in place to prevent such incidents, which are considered rare but can be catastrophic.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration, particularly Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is undermining public health by promoting anti-vaccine sentiment. The author points to rising measles cases and the administration's unusual decision to stop recommending COVID-19 boosters for healthy children and pregnant women, a move opposed by major medical associations. The piece contends that this approach is eroding trust in public health agencies and contributing to a dangerous decline in vaccination rates. It frames the administration's actions as an existential threat to decades of medical progress in preventing diseases.</p>
