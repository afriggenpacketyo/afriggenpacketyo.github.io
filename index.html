          <p>Former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given suggests that Jack Grealish's future with the club is uncertain due to limited playing time, despite his contributions to multiple title wins. Given criticizes Pep Guardiola's treatment of Grealish, pointing out his absence in crucial FA Cup final matches and the decision to bring on a debutant instead. With Kevin de Bruyne potentially leaving, Given believes Grealish could fill the midfield role but suggests he may need to explore opportunities at another club to revitalize his career. Guardiola indicates discussions about Grealish's future will involve club officials and the player's representatives, with no guarantees of increased playing time. ()</p>

          <p>China's dominance in the global supply of rare minerals, essential for manufacturing high-tech products, is emerging as a significant leverage point in its trade negotiations with the United States. Recent incidents of smuggling rare metals out of Hong Kong and Guangxi highlight the pressure on manufacturers amid China's export restrictions. The U.S. relies heavily on China for rare earth imports, and Beijing has increasingly used export controls on strategic minerals as retaliation against U.S. tariffs. This control could potentially cripple advanced manufacturing in the U.S., as significant quantities of rare earth materials are required to make essential military equipment. ()</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage interest rate has climbed above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to concerns about rising government debt. This is the first time since April 11 that rates have exceeded this threshold, impacting aspiring homebuyers who are already facing high home prices and a limited supply of affordable properties. While markets initially reacted negatively to the downgrade, stock and bond prices recovered later in the day. Experts suggest that the nation's debt issues were already factored into investor sentiment, leading to a limited long-term market impact. ()</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has advocated for a new law that criminalizes the posting of "revenge porn" and deepfake explicit content online, citing the need to protect children from harmful online behavior. The Take It Down Act mandates technology companies to remove such content within 48 hours, with violators facing up to three years in prison. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some digital rights groups express concerns that it could lead to censorship of legitimate content and undermine encryption.

          <p>Coinbase has become the first cryptocurrency exchange to be included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, marking a significant milestone for the digital assets industry. The inclusion comes as the Trump administration supports an industry that backed the Republican president’s return to the White House. However, Coinbase is facing challenges, including a recent cyberattack that could cost the company between $180 million and $400 million. The company is also dealing with an SEC investigation and a lawsuit over biometric data collection. ()</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are proposing adding work requirements to Medicaid as part of a broader tax and spending bill. The proposal would mandate Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, or attend school for at least 80 hours per month to maintain their benefits, with some exceptions. While supporters see work requirements as a way to promote self-sufficiency, studies have shown that they do not significantly increase employment and can create barriers to accessing benefits. Experts note that most Medicaid recipients are already working or unable to work due to various circumstances. ()</p>
