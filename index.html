          <p>U.S. officials have confirmed the death of Khamis Ayyad, a Palestinian American who died from smoke inhalation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The incident occurred in the village of Silwad after Israeli settlers allegedly set fire to homes and vehicles. This event follows another recent death of a Palestinian American in the region, highlighting a rise in settler attacks and ongoing violence since the October 7th Hamas attack. The U.S. State Department condemned the "criminal violence" and is providing consular assistance to the family.</p>

          <p>House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer is considering a subpoena for former Vice President Kamala Harris as part of an investigation into an alleged cover-up of former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline. Harris, who recently announced she would not run for governor of California, is now back in the national spotlight, prompting speculation about a 2028 presidential run. Legal experts suggest that while Harris is a logical witness, any attempt to compel her testimony would likely face significant legal challenges based on executive privilege, potentially leading to a prolonged court battle.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun its August recess without an agreement to advance dozens of Donald Trump's nominees, following a contentious standoff between parties. Negotiations broke down after Trump publicly told Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to "GO TO HELL!" on social media. Democrats had been blocking the nominees, demanding roll-call votes for each one to slow the process. Republicans are now contemplating changing Senate rules in September to expedite future confirmations, a move Schumer warns would be a "huge mistake."</p>

Greer explained that tariffs are being applied to approximately 70 countries, with rates determined by trade balances and existing deals, and are unlikely to be negotiated down soon. He also addressed the use of tariffs as a tool for geopolitical leverage, citing actions against Brazil and Canada related to non-trade issues like political prosecutions and foreign policy decisions.

          <p>Germany's birth rate has fallen to a historic low of 1.35 children per woman, sparking a debate about societal progress and future economic stability. Experts attribute the decline to multiple crises, including the pandemic, climate change, and inflation, which particularly affect the younger generation's decision to have children. While some view the trend as a sign of female self-determination, others, including the far-right AfD party, fear it will shrink the population and strain social systems. Sociologists suggest improving work-life balance and child care reliability could help bridge the gap between the desired and actual number of children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is bracing for Storm Floris, with an amber weather warning issued for most of Scotland due to anticipated strong winds and potential danger to life. The warning, active on Monday, forecasts gusts of 50-70mph inland and up to 90mph in exposed coastal areas, posing a risk of damage to buildings and trees. A yellow warning is also in effect for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. The storm's timing during the summer holiday season has prompted transport authorities to issue travel advisories and cancel some services.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme that could cost up to £18 billion for drivers affected by the mis-selling of car loans. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that exceptionally large commissions could be considered unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the payout scheme, which could see most eligible individuals receive under £950. The regulator stated the court's judgment provides clarity on what constitutes unfairness in these financial agreements.</p>

          <p>A satirical article from The Atlantic imagines how tours at U.S. National Parks and historic sites might sound under a directive to only present positive American history. The piece humorously reinterprets significant locations like the Manzanar internment camp, the Selma to Montgomery trail, and Gettysburg by focusing on natural beauty while comically omitting or distorting controversial historical facts. It critiques the alleged policy of removing content that "inappropriately disparages Americans" by showcasing absurdly sanitized narratives.

          <p>The U.S. auto market is showing signs of distress, with a record-high number of subprime borrowers falling behind on their loan payments. This crisis stems from inflated car prices during the pandemic, followed by declining values and rising interest rates, leaving many owners with negative equity. The situation may worsen due to potential 25% tariffs on imported cars, which could increase vehicle costs and lead to further job cuts by manufacturers. Experts advise consumers to budget carefully and consider refinancing to mitigate financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For couples facing marital difficulties without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend two key strategies to protect personal finances. The first is to gather comprehensive information about all joint assets, liabilities, and accounts while access is still readily available. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, attorneys suggest that proactively addressing these financial matters can provide security and prevent more significant conflicts later on.</p>

Instead of punitive language, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" can validate a child's emotions and help them feel safe. The approach emphasizes connection over control, reassuring the child that they are supported and that their emotions are acceptable, even if certain behaviors are not.

The philosophy, popularized by the book "Your Money or Your Life," encourages individuals to redefine their relationship with money, focusing on what is truly "enough" to be happy. This approach prioritizes liberating time for personal passions over accumulating material wealth.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that recent guilty verdicts against powerful men like Sean Combs and Harvey Weinstein should not be seen as isolated incidents, but as part of a pervasive pattern of violence against women. The author contends that society often fails to acknowledge the systemic nature of this violence, which is rooted in misogyny and serves to maintain female subordination. By treating each case as an individual aberration, the broader social problem is ignored. The article calls for a deeper societal change beyond legal convictions to address the pandemic of violence that shapes women's lives globally.</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry recently stated he does not know his exact net worth, a position financial planners say can be beneficial. Experts suggest that focusing on tangible financial goals and cash flow management is often more productive than obsessing over a net worth figure. Curry, one of the highest-paid athletes, prioritizes building a portfolio he is proud of rather than fixating on a number. Financial advisors agree that this mindset, which emphasizes aligning spending with personal values and achievable milestones, can lead to greater financial well-being and satisfaction.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, after being struck by a boat on Saturday afternoon. The collision nearly capsized the vessel and sent a passenger overboard, who was able to return to the boat unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found resting on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions, crews will wait until Monday to tow the whale to a nearby park for a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death. Boaters are being advised to use caution in the area.</p>

          <p>The use of artificial intelligence to detect and bill for damages is becoming more common in the travel industry, a practice experts call "algorithmic auditing." Following Hertz's use of AI to scan rental cars for damage, hotels are experimenting with similar technology, such as using sensors to detect smoking in rooms and automatically issue fines. While businesses see this as a way to automate loss prevention, there is a risk of customer backlash if the technology is perceived as unfair or erodes trust. Experts say transparency and maintaining a human-in-the-loop for final decisions are crucial for successful implementation.</p>

A public records lawsuit filed by Radar Online is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release thousands of pages from its Epstein investigation file. Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a civil case involving an Epstein accuser can be unsealed.
