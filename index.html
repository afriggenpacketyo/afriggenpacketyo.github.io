          <p>Over 50 million people in the American Northeast are under flood watches due to slow-moving storms capable of producing up to four inches of rain per hour. Flash flood warnings have been issued for major metropolitan areas including New York City, Washington D.C., and Baltimore, with life-threatening conditions possible in parts of New Jersey. The state's governor has declared a state of emergency, urging residents to stay indoors as heavy rainfall has already caused significant flooding and stranded vehicles in several counties.</p>

          <p>Following a period of intense heat and dry weather, more regions in England are anticipated to be officially declared as in a state of drought. This announcement is expected after a meeting of the National Drought Group, which coordinates the country's response to dry conditions. A drought declaration enables water companies to implement their management plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans, to conserve water resources amid concerns heightened by climate change and increased water usage.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that Major League Baseball is missing a significant opportunity by not having its biggest stars, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, in the Home Run Derby. The author suggests that the league should be flexible and even alter the event's rules to accommodate players like Ohtani, who has cited the physical toll of the current format as a reason for not participating. The article contends that securing their involvement would elevate the event's profile and provide valuable exposure for the sport.</p>

The federal raid resulted in 361 arrests, with the Department of Homeland Security stating it had rescued "at least 14 migrant children" from potential exploitation at the company's facilities.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has told investors to anticipate a ramp-up in corporate deal-making, suggesting that recent activity is just the beginning of a larger wave of mergers and acquisitions. He pointed to several recent deals, such as Ferrero's acquisition of WK Kellogg, as early indicators of a heating market that will likely accelerate into the fall. Cramer believes the current administration's Federal Trade Commission is more amenable to M&A activity, which could encourage more companies to pursue transformative deals.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests President Trump's recent policy shift against Russia, including new weapons support for Ukraine and tariff threats, is driven less by a strategic change and more by personal frustration. The article posits that Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to heed Trump's calls for a ceasefire has made the U.S. president feel personally slighted and appear weak. This perceived humiliation, rather than a newfound belief in transatlantic alliances, is reportedly the primary motivator for the tougher approach toward Moscow.</p>

Massie's robust fundraising signals his readiness to defend his seat against the concerted effort from the president's team, setting up a significant intra-party conflict in his expensive, multi-market district.</p>

This concept of mutualisation, which has been discussed for years, is being revisited as the government seeks a "fresh vision" and a cultural transformation following the Horizon IT scandal. While any change in ownership structure is unlikely before 2030, the consultation will explore this and other models to restore trust and determine the services the organization should offer.</p>

          <p>In a significant ruling, the Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with laying off nearly 1,400 employees at the Department of Education while legal challenges continue. The decision pauses a lower court's injunction that had blocked the firings, which are part of the administration's plan to dismantle the agency. The court's liberal justices dissented, arguing the judiciary's role is to check such executive actions, with the move seen by critics as enabling the unconstitutional "impoundment" of congressionally mandated programs.</p>
