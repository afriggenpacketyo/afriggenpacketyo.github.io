          <p>A knife attack at the main railway station in Hamburg, Germany, left seventeen people injured, some with life-threatening injuries. Police arrested a 39-year-old German woman at the scene, and believe she acted alone. Authorities are investigating whether she may have been in a state of mental distress, and a political motive has been ruled out. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed shock at the attack and thanked the emergency services for their rapid assistance.</p>

          <p>Manager Thomas Tuchel advised Trent Alexander-Arnold to improve his defensive discipline to help England win a major tournament. Tuchel noted that Alexander-Arnold, admired for his offensive abilities, sometimes neglects defensive responsibilities. Tuchel stressed the importance of defensive solidity, especially in qualifying and tournament football, where a single defensive error can be decisive. The outgoing Liverpool right-back is expected to join Real Madrid this summer.</p>
