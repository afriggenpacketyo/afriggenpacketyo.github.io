          <p>South Korea's Constitutional Court rejected the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating him as acting president.  The court's decision followed Han's impeachment by the opposition party in December, stemming from a dispute over judicial appointments during President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law.  The ruling comes ahead of an appeals court decision on opposition leader Lee Jae-myung's election law violation case.</p>
