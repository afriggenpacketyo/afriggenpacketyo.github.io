          <p>China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL), the world's largest EV battery maker, experienced a share price jump on its Hong Kong debut, raising almost HK$35.7bn. CATL supplies major carmakers, including Tesla and Toyota, and is expanding globally with new factories in Europe. The company's reliance on the Chinese market shields it from direct implications of US tariffs, though US lawmakers have expressed national security concerns. The listing was closely watched amid US-China trade tensions, with some US investors restricted from participating. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China experienced a significant net capital inflow into its bond and equities markets in April, totaling US$17.3 billion, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. This inflow contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest that investors are increasingly moving away from U.S. dollar assets due to Trump's trade war, shifting global investment dynamics towards China.</p>
