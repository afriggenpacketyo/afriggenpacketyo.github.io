          <p>Poland's Supreme Court is reviewing over 50,000 complaints alleging voting irregularities in the recent presidential election, which saw right-wing conservative Karol Nawrocki narrowly defeat pro-European candidate Rafal Trzaskowski. Opposition leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski has accused the governing coalition of fraud and vows to challenge the election results, while Prime Minister Donald Tusk calls for clarification amid social media reports of discrepancies. The Supreme Court has ordered recounts in 13 commissions and must deliver its verdict on the election's validity by July 2. Political scientist Antoni Dudek has cautioned against pushing the "myth of rigged elections" due to the potential for violence. The article explores the political tensions and legal challenges surrounding the election outcome.</p>

          <p>A 2008 public service announcement featuring Hilary Duff discouraging the use of the word "gay" as an insult has become a cult classic, resonating with a generation that grew up watching it on television. The "Think B4 You Speak" campaign, spearheaded by GLSEN, aimed to combat ambient anti-LGBTQ language, and Duff's ad, along with a similar one featuring Wanda Sykes, gained traction on social media and linear TV. Data suggests the campaign made inroads in curbing the term's use, with GLSEN's 2021 school climate survey showing a decrease in students hearing "that's so gay." The article highlights the ad's impact on LGBTQ+ representation and allyship, noting its continued relevance in media and culture.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 11 Iranian foreign nationals in a 48-hour operation across eight states, including one individual on a watchlist and others with prior criminal convictions. Mehran Makari Saheli, a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was among those arrested. All 11 Iranians are charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, with officials stating they represent a threat to public safety. The arrests are part of the Trump administration's latest crackdown on illegal immigration, aiming to increase immigration arrests significantly.

Gen Xers are the most likely to feel financially insecure, with 84% reporting they are not where they want to be financially.

          <p>The recent approval of lenacapavir, a highly promising HIV prevention drug, in the US is being overshadowed by concerns that budget cuts to public health agencies and global aid programs could undermine efforts to end the HIV epidemic. Experts worry that these cuts will limit access to the drug for vulnerable populations, such as low-income individuals, gay and bisexual men, and sex workers. The Trump administration's cost-cutting measures have affected key agencies like the NIH and CDC, as well as global initiatives like USAID and PEPFAR. These changes could reverse progress made in combating HIV both domestically and internationally.</p>
