          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used car prices, has risen to its highest level since October 2023, increasing by 4.9% year-over-year and 2.7% from March, far exceeding typical monthly increases. This surge is attributed to consumers anticipating price hikes due to new auto tariffs, even though these tariffs don't directly affect used car sales. Retail prices have followed, with the average used vehicle listing exceeding $25,000, while new vehicles approach $48,000. The article notes that used car prices are stabilizing but remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Audit Office reports that the cost of asylum accommodation in the UK is expected to triple to Â£15.3 billion over ten years, far exceeding the Home Office's initial estimate of Â£4.5 billion. This increase is primarily due to a rise in asylum seekers housed in hotels, which account for three-quarters of accommodation spending despite housing only a third of asylum seekers. Private providers are profiting significantly from these contracts, raising concerns about the government's ability to control costs.

          <p>Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, threatening to fire him for not cutting interest rates, a move unprecedented in US history. The Guardian article explains that the Fed's independence is crucial for managing the money supply and maintaining economic stability without political influence. While Powell asserts the Fed's independence is protected by law, a Supreme Court case could potentially alter the president's power over federal agencies. Trump's push for lower rates aims to offset the impact of his tariffs, but the Fed fears exacerbating inflation.</p>

A previous Israeli deal with Rwanda resulted in migrants disappearing, raising further concerns about human rights. The article emphasizes that the British Supreme Court ruled the plan unlawful due to the risk of refugees being returned to unsafe countries.</p>

          <p>The IRS has lost nearly one-third of its tax auditors due to budget cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency, according to a Treasury Inspector General report. The agency's workforce has decreased by over 11,000 employees, with revenue agents experiencing a 31% reduction. This comes as President Trump proposes further budget cuts to the IRS, aiming to end what he calls the "weaponization of IRS enforcement." Despite these challenges, the IRS has processed over 140 million tax returns this filing season, slightly more than last year.</p>
