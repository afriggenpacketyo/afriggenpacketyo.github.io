            <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto outshone Jacob deGrom in a dominant pitching performance, leading the Dodgers to a 3-0 victory over the Texas Rangers. Yamamoto pitched seven scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts, showcasing his evolving arsenal beyond his fastball and splitter, including a curveball and slider, which kept the Rangers hitters off balance.  Even without Shohei Ohtani, who is currently on paternity leave, Yamamoto's performance affirmed his status as a potential Cy Young contender in just his second MLB season. DeGrom pitched seven strong innings, giving up only one run, but it was not enough to overcome Yamamoto's dominance.</p>

            <p>The ACLU is urgently appealing to the Supreme Court to block the Trump Administration's deportation of Venezuelan detainees accused of being foreign gang members under a wartime law.  These detainees, transferred to a facility in Texas, claim they are being coerced into signing removal notices and denied due process, with some alleging they are being falsely labeled as members of Tren de Aragua. The ACLU argues that deporting these individuals to El Salvador, where they face potential life imprisonment, violates the Supreme Court's previous ruling requiring proper notice and opportunity to challenge their cases. A district judge denied the ACLU's request, citing a lack of authority, leaving the matter in the hands of higher courts.</p>

            <p>Former Congresswoman Barbara Lee has surged ahead in the Oakland mayoral race, surpassing Loren Taylor with 53% of the vote, according to the latest results.  If the results hold, Lee, a progressive icon with decades of experience in Congress, will replace recalled Mayor Sheng Thao, who faced criticism over crime, homelessness, and alleged corruption. Lee's campaign emphasized uniting the divided city and addressing its challenges, while Taylor focused on his experience in City Hall and the need for tough decisions. Lee's election would mark a significant shift in Oakland's political landscape, bringing a veteran politician with a focus on social justice to the city's top office.</p>

Van Hollen met with Abrego Garcia, who expressed feeling 'traumatized' by his initial confinement and fearful of other prisoners, highlighting the human cost of the deportation error.  Despite Supreme Court orders to facilitate his return, the Trump administration continues to resist, alleging gang affiliation, which Abrego Garcia denies. The senator's visit underscores the ongoing legal and political battle surrounding Abrego Garcia's case and the broader issue of immigration policy.</p>

            <p>The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the term "woman" legally refers to a biological woman, providing clarity that had been missing from equality law conversations for years. The ruling clarifies that for the Equality Act to be consistent, the term woman has to mean a biological woman, which does not include biological males, even if they have certificates to say they have changed gender. This means that where there are, for instance, women-only spaces, then a biological man who identifies as a woman cannot use them.</p>

            <p>Artists and creatives are expressing concerns about the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate images, particularly the recent trend of creating "starter pack" images of people as toys.  They fear that these AI-generated images devalue creativity, threaten their livelihoods, and potentially infringe on intellectual property rights. In response, the #StarterPackNoAI movement has emerged, with artists creating their own hand-drawn versions to highlight the value of human creativity and personality.</p>

            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham, England, has highlighted the disparity between wealthy and deprived areas, with waste piling up in densely populated, poorer neighborhoods while wealthier areas remain relatively unaffected.

The situation has prompted community efforts to clean up the affected areas, but residents express frustration and concern over the city's reputation.</p>
