        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Fed reports a significant spike in student loan delinquencies following the resumption of collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, increasing the risk of borrowers falling behind on other debts. With the end of pandemic-era payment pauses and on-ramps, disposable income for borrowers is reduced, potentially leading to increased credit card debt and auto loan delinquencies. Monthly collections on defaulted loans could reduce disposable personal income by billions, creating a spillover effect on other financial obligations. Experts advise borrowers to explore loan forgiveness opportunities and manage their debt carefully.</p>

          <p>The FDA has outlined stricter regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, requiring clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for healthy adults and children. This new approach differentiates approval standards based on patient risk, with less stringent evidence required for high-risk individuals like older adults and those with underlying conditions. The FDA will now demand robust data from randomized, controlled trials for healthy individuals, showing actual clinical outcomes before granting full approval. The change comes as HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls health agencies and U.S. immunization policy.</p>

Many voters are waiting to see how Trump's policies play out, and disengaged voters aren't necessarily turning to the Democrats.

Instead, the study suggests a dry origin, linking the streaks to above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, particularly near recent-impact craters.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued a rare public reprimand of Israel, condemning the renewed military offensive in Gaza as "disproportionate" and demanding a cease to the offensive. Britain has suspended talks with Israel on expanding a free-trade agreement and will impose sanctions on extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the criticism, saying the three nations had handed a “huge prize” to Hamas. The moves reflect growing international discontent with Israel’s actions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Several viral videos circulating online falsely claim that China is providing aid to Gaza. One video purports to show China delivering aid by dropping it from the sky, but the footage is from airdrops done in Gaza by other countries in March 2024. Another video falsely claims to show Chinese fighter jets flying over the pyramids on their way to deliver aid, but the footage is from a joint military exercise between China and Egypt in April. These false claims are circulating amidst limited aid deliveries to Gaza.</p>

McIver blamed federal law enforcement for instigating the clash, calling the charges political. The misdemeanor charge against Baraka was dismissed to move forward.

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, is using motion-sensing cameras to conserve jaguars by turning them from a threat to cattle into a source of financial reward for ranchers. Through the Viviendo con Felinos program, ranchers are paid for photos of wild cats on their land, incentivizing them to protect jaguars and their prey. This has led to a cultural shift, with ranchers increasingly valuing jaguars and adopting practices that protect both the felines and their livestock, demonstrating a harmonious coexistence.</p>

          <p>An inquest determined that the death of an 11-year-old girl, Kyra Hill, at a Berkshire water park was an unlawful killing due to gross breaches in health and safety.

The coroner stated that these failures, along with poor visibility in the water, contributed to Kyra's death. Her father is now campaigning for tighter safety regulations at water parks.</p>

Critics argue that work requirements would create bureaucratic challenges in verifying employment status for millions of people.

By empowering children to embrace healthy eating habits early on, they are more likely to carry these positive behaviors into adulthood.
