          <p>President Trump's call for the Washington Commanders to revert to their former "Redskins" name has gained support from HUD Secretary and ex-player Scott Turner. Trump advocated for the change on social media, also mentioning MLB's Cleveland Guardians, and threatened to block a new stadium deal if the Commanders did not comply. The team, which changed its name in 2020 amid racial tensions, is now owned by Josh Harris, who has stated he has no intention of changing the name again, citing the positive adoption of the "Commanders" identity within the organization.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over an approaching tariff deadline, market analyst Jim Cramer argues that numerous positive factors are supporting the stock market. He points to strong corporate earnings, potential economic boosts from proposed tax cuts, and increased business spending on R&D as key drivers. Cramer also highlights major infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, looser bank lending regulations, and a resurgence in the US energy sector as reasons for optimism, suggesting these elements could create a significant economic boom.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 20:13:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to address warnings that future retirees will be financially worse off than today's pensioners. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) highlighted that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. This initiative aims to build a national consensus on tackling the savings gap, which is also pronounced along gender and ethnic lines, without directly addressing the rising cost of the state pension's "triple lock" policy.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old Canadian girl, Melina Galanis Frattolin, was found dead in upstate New York after her father falsely reported she had been kidnapped. The initial report triggered an Amber Alert and a massive search near Lake George. However, authorities noted inconsistencies in the father's account, leading them to conclude no abduction occurred and that there is no ongoing threat to the public. The investigation is now focused on the father, 45-year-old Luciano Frattolin, as police investigate the circumstances surrounding his daughter's death.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based company SpinQ, founded in 2018, anticipates that quantum computing will cross a significant "usefulness" threshold within the next five years. The company currently produces small-scale educational quantum computers and more powerful industrial-grade superconducting models, which it sells to over 50 countries. SpinQ's founder, Xiang Jingen, compares the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, acknowledging that substantial development is still required before the technology achieves widespread, practical application. This indicates a key transitional phase for the emerging field.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. The decline is linked to perceptions that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals, leading to decreased approval among the general public and Hispanic Americans specifically. Concurrently, the poll shows a strong public desire for the administration to prioritize lowering prices over other issues like tariffs or spending cuts. This suggests a shift in public focus toward economic concerns over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a recent election. Despite the significant setback, which compounds a previous loss of majority in the more powerful lower house, Ishiba has stated he will not resign. The election results reflect voter frustration over rising prices, a string of political scandals, and contentious trade negotiations with the United States. This loss of control is expected to undermine the coalition's influence and could lead to political instability.</p>

The game highlighted the team's defensive struggles and an overworked bullpen, as they failed to capitalize on an early lead built by a Shohei Ohtani home run.

          <p>A new report suggests the UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now billions over budget and years behind schedule, was troubled from its inception. Insiders and analysts argue that the project's problems stem from fundamental challenges inherent to building large-scale infrastructure on a densely populated, democratic island. The initial ambition to build the world's fastest railway drove up costs, while political compromises to appease local constituencies led to expensive route changes and additions like numerous tunnels. These factors, combined with a complex planning system, have led some to believe the project was doomed from the start.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Price of Children," reveals a Vatican-run program from 1950 to 1970 that sent thousands of Italian children to the United States for adoption, many of whom were not true orphans. The children were often born to unwed mothers who were pressured or misled into relinquishing them, believing the placement was temporary. These mothers' names were removed from birth records, effectively making the children orphans on paper and eligible for U.S. visas.

          <h2>Trump Administration Announces Plan to Shutter EPA's Scientific Research Division</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is planning to close the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific research arm. This office provides the crucial scientific expertise for regulations concerning toxic chemicals, water pollution, and climate change. The move is part of a broader plan to downsize the federal government and will save an estimated $748.8 million, with the EPA stating it will reassign some functions to other offices. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, warning it will cripple the agency's ability to protect public health.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Argues 'Self-Connection' is the Most Crucial Skill for Children's Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and protects mental health by grounding a child's confidence in their own sense of self-worth. Parents are advised to foster this by validating their child's feelings, avoiding micromanagement, and modeling their own emotional awareness. These small shifts help children trust their inner voice, leading to more authentic confidence in adulthood.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, discusses the precarious position of American businesses operating in China. He states that an extension of the current 90-day tariff pause is almost inevitable, as a return to high tariffs is undesirable for both nations. While recent Chinese actions on fentanyl precursors could lead to some US tariff reductions, Stein notes the business community is concerned that bilateral discussions remain narrowly focused on tariffs. This overlooks broader systemic issues, leaving American companies to navigate an uncertain and complex commercial environment.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has launched Better Angels, a nonprofit aiming to prove that affordable housing for the homeless can be built profitably without taxpayer money. The initiative uses a $300 million investment fund to provide upfront capital, bypassing the slow and costly process of securing government tax credits and grants. Better Angels is bidding on several large projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to build hundreds of units faster and at a fraction of the typical cost. While the rents will be higher than in subsidized projects, the model aims to attract private capital to address the housing crisis.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died at a New York medical facility after being pulled into a running MRI machine by a heavy metallic necklace he was wearing. The man, identified by his wife as Keith McAllister, had entered the MRI room without permission to help his wife after her scan. The powerful magnetic field of the machine drew him in, causing a fatal "medical episode." This tragic incident highlights the extreme danger of bringing metallic objects near MRI machines, which use strong magnets that can turn any magnetic item into a dangerous projectile.</p>

According to a Vanity Fair report, Barron, who is a student at NYU and reportedly 6-foot-7, told a classmate he is "not allowed" to play pickup basketball on campus. The article suggests that due to his unique circumstances as the president's son, his college experience is limited, with his routine consisting mainly of attending classes and returning home.

          <p>President Donald Trump has refuted a Wall Street Journal report that claimed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent convinced him not to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The report suggested Bessent warned that such a move could destabilize the economy and was unnecessary as the Fed appeared poised to cut interest rates. In a social media post, Trump called the story "untruthful," asserting that he understands the markets better than anyone and does not need such matters explained to him. This denial comes amid escalating criticism of Powell from other Trump allies.</p>
