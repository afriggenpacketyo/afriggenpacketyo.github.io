          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance stated in a Fox News interview that the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end soon, suggesting it will be up to Russia and Ukraine to reach an agreement to stop the brutal conflict. Vance defended Trump's approach to the war and questioned whether continued losses of soldiers over territory were justifiable, even as Ukraine insists on regaining Crimea. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called for a breakthrough in the conflict, and Russia announced a temporary ceasefire coinciding with World War Two anniversary celebrations, while Ukraine called for a 30-day ceasefire. Recent attacks on Zaporizhzhia and accusations of drone attacks highlight the ongoing conflict. Optimism Score: 30</p>

          <p>China is considering U.S. overtures to initiate trade negotiations, signaling a potential path to resolving the ongoing trade war. A spokesperson for the commerce ministry stated that while assessing the possibility of negotiations, China insists on the removal of all unilateral tariffs by the U.S. as a sign of sincerity. The statement follows conflicting signals from both sides regarding the status of trade talks, with both nations seeking to avoid appearing to back down first.

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake, Tennessee, for the first time since Hurricane Helene caused widespread debris contamination.

          <p>The Senate approved a resolution to overturn an EPA rule tied to the Clean Air Act, which aimed to limit seven hazardous air pollutants emitted by heavy industry. The rule, passed by the Biden administration in 2024, required major sources of these pollutants to maintain strict pollution controls. Republican lawmakers argued that the rule disincentivized companies from adopting new pollution-reducing technologies. Environmental groups criticized the move, asserting that it would allow industrial polluters to release toxic air pollutants linked to cancer and other health issues. Optimism Score: 40</p>
