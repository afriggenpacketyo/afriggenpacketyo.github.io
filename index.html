          <p>The Republican chairwoman for Los Angeles County, Roxanne Hoge, an immigrant herself, argues that Democratic sanctuary city policies create a "two-tiered" legal system. She asserts these policies are designed to exploit Latino and immigrant populations, trapping them in a "permanent underclass" for political and economic gain. Hoge criticizes California leaders like Governor Gavin Newsom, claiming they use scare tactics about immigration enforcement while their policies degrade the city and state. The article highlights her perspective that these actions are cruel and unfair to minority communities.</p>

          <p>Amid persistent inflation, many homeowners are using home equity loans and HELOCs, which offer lower rates than credit cards or personal loans. However, there are significant risks to consider, such as choosing a variable-rate HELOC when predictable payments are needed, which could become costly if interest rates rise. The article also warns against borrowing more than necessary, as this can lead to financial strain if income changes or home values decline. It emphasizes the importance of understanding all associated closing costs and fees to avoid unexpected expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is set to release its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street closely watching the performance of its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, and its advertising revenue. Investors are particularly focused on the impact of President Trump's tariff policies, which the company had previously warned could affect results. Analysts suggest these tariffs may have inadvertently benefited Amazon by weakening competition from Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. The company's significant spending on artificial intelligence and its future guidance will also be key indicators for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh addressed the increasing number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration, stating that they are a necessary response to presidents using executive orders to bypass Congress. Speaking at a judicial conference, he explained that as presidents push the limits of their power, courts are inevitably drawn in to decide on the legality of their actions. Kavanaugh defended the court's process, noting internal changes to handle these cases, and emphasized the collegiality among the justices despite differing views. He likened the criticism judges face to that of sports referees, calling it part of the job.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court intensely questioned the Trump administration's legal justification for using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs. During arguments, judges probed whether the law, which has never before been used for this purpose, grants the president such broad authority, noting the absence of the word "tariff" in the statute. The challenge, brought by states and small businesses, argues the president's actions overstep constitutional power and revise the trade framework established by Congress. The court's decision in this major test of presidential power is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a rare public appearance, three federal judges described the "daunting" and "frightening" threats they have faced after ruling against Trump administration policies or speaking out against attacks on the judiciary. The judges shared experiences including death threats, "pizza doxxing" in the name of a murdered judge's son, and "swatting" incidents where false emergency calls were made to their homes. They linked the rise in harassment to inflammatory rhetoric from political leaders, which they believe emboldens individuals to threaten them. The judges called for political leaders to tone down their language and for the legal community to defend judicial independence.</p>

The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by Trump and other private donors and will replace the current East Wing. The new ballroom is designed to seat 650 guests, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity of about 200, eliminating the need for outdoor tents for large events like state dinners. This marks the latest of several aesthetic and structural changes Trump has made to the White House campus.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has solved a long-standing botanical mystery, revealing that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers analyzed hundreds of potato genomes and found that the starchy vegetable originated from a hybridization event. An ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form tubers, while a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species from Chile contributed a gene that controls their growth. This genetic combination was essential for the creation of the potato as we know it today, demonstrating how inter-species breeding can spark new evolutionary traits.</p>

          <p>The opening day of the decisive fifth Test between England and India was a bizarre affair, marked by erratic bowling, a crucial run-out, and a significant injury. England managed to reduce India to 204-6 in a day shortened by rain, but the session was marred when key pace bowler Chris Woakes suffered a shoulder injury, potentially leaving the depleted attack with only three seamers. India's captain, Shubman Gill, was dismissed in a calamitous run-out, while bowler Josh Tongue delivered both unplayable balls and wild wides. India's Karun Nair remained not out on 52, leaving the critical match evenly poised.</p>

There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The USGS website received reports of light to weak shaking across a wide area, consistent with a quake of this magnitude, which is not strong enough to cause structural damage.</p>

His "Back to Starbucks" strategy centers on a new "green apron service model," which focuses on improving hospitality, efficiency, and personalized customer interactions. The plan includes optimizing staffing, implementing a "smart queue" to reduce wait times to under four minutes, and introducing new menu items.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key consumer protection for federally backed reverse mortgages, known as the "95% rule," can significantly impact a family's ability to retain a home. This rule stipulates that if heirs wish to keep the property after the borrower passes away or moves out, they only need to pay the lesser of the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value. This is crucial because accrued interest can cause the loan balance to exceed the home's worth. The rule ensures heirs are not forced to pay more than the property's value, providing peace of mind and predictability in estate planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, rose to 2.6% annually in June, up from 2.4% in May. This increase signals that President Trump's tariffs are contributing to higher prices on some goods, with notable monthly increases in furniture, appliances, and computers. The data provides validation for the Fed's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, as inflation remains above its 2% target. The report also showed that consumer spending grew modestly, while incomes were flat after adjusting for inflation, suggesting Americans are remaining cautious. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of four spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately receiving yellow cards in four separate matches to improperly influence betting markets and faced a potential lifetime ban if found guilty. While the commission found the four main charges "not proven," it did find him guilty on two lesser counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation. Paqueta expressed his relief and gratitude, stating he has maintained his innocence from the beginning of the ordeal.</p>

He is asking the drugmakers to match their U.S. prices to the lowest price offered in other developed nations, a policy known as "most favored nation."

          <p>U.S. consumers may soon see higher prices for European wines and spirits as new tariffs are set to take effect.

Trade groups warn that these price hikes will likely be passed on to consumers, potentially reducing demand and hurting the profitability of restaurants that rely on alcohol sales. Industry experts note that unlike other goods, consumers are less likely to switch to domestic substitutes for specific types of wine and spirits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has uncovered a clandestine operation where China is evading U.S. sanctions to buy Iranian oil. The scheme involves a "dark fleet" of tankers that turn off their transponders to avoid detection while conducting ship-to-ship oil transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia. This illicit trade, which props up the Iranian regime and potentially funds its nuclear program, is estimated to have generated as much as $70 billion for Iran. Despite U.S. sanctions on vessels involved, the investigation found the activity is ramping up, with numerous transfers happening openly in the region.</p>
