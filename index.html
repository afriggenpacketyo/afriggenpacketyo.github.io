          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed approximately 150 miles off the South Carolina coast, leading to tropical storm warnings for the region. With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the storm is moving slowly and is expected to make landfall over the weekend. Forecasters anticipate some further strengthening before it reaches the coast, bringing heavy rainfall of two to four inches, potential flash flooding, and high rip currents. The National Weather Service has issued warnings from the South Santee River, SC, to Cape Fear, NC, as emergency services prepare for the impact.</p>

          <p>Indian cricket captain Shubman Gill delivered a masterful performance, scoring 161 runs to follow his first-innings 269, setting his team up for a likely victory against England. After India declared at 427-6, setting a near-impossible target of 608, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the end of day four. Gill became the first player in Test history to score over 250 and 150 in the same match. With India heavily favored to win on the final day and level the series, England faces the difficult choice of attempting a record-breaking chase or playing for a draw.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Palestinians were reportedly killed in Gaza on Saturday amid ongoing Israeli military operations, including strikes near aid distribution queues. The violence continues as Israel's government reviews a US-backed ceasefire proposal to which Hamas has reportedly given a positive initial response. Casualty figures from Palestinian sources vary, with reports of at least 50 fatalities, while the Israeli offensive's total death toll in the territory has surpassed 57,000, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The Israeli Security Cabinet is scheduled to meet to discuss the details of the proposed truce.</p>

The organization stated the attack affirms its prior warnings of credible threats from Hamas, which GHF claims has placed bounties on its American and Palestinian workers. The assailants reportedly used Iranian-origin grenades packed with ball bearings before fleeing into a crowd. GHF criticized the international community and media for what it described as silence and the amplification of misinformation about its operations.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in central Texas have caused a "mass casualty event," with at least 27 people, including nine children, confirmed dead. The tragedy occurred after the Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and campers by surprise. Officials report that dozens remain missing, including 23 to 25 children from a summer camp, prompting extensive search and rescue operations involving over 160 air rescues. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration to ensure state resources are fully available for the affected counties.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas admitted they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that struck on July 4th, as the Guadalupe River surged to near-historic levels in minutes. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly stated the county lacks a river warning system and that authorities had no reason to believe the flood would be so catastrophic, despite a flash flood warning being issued. The river reportedly rose 26 feet in 45 minutes during the night while many residents were asleep. This lack of specific forewarning is a key point of discussion in the aftermath of the disaster that has claimed dozens of lives.</p>

He emphasized that the nation was born from a bloody and divisive civil war between patriots and loyalists, a complexity that he believes makes its founding ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that understanding the deep flaws of the founders, such as owning enslaved people while writing of liberty, does not diminish their achievements but makes them more real and their lessons more accessible.

Pro-democracy advocates warn that this pattern of threatening retribution, even if not immediately acted upon, is an attack on freedom designed to instill fear in anyone who criticizes the president.

          <p>Consumers are increasingly facing prompts to tip in situations where it was not previously standard, a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation." This trend is largely driven by digital and contactless payment systems that present pre-calculated tip options of 15-25% at coffee shops, takeaway counters, and even self-service kiosks. Experts note that while this technology can increase income for workers, it also creates confusion and social pressure for customers. The design of these systems often defaults to tipping, making it awkward to opt out and leading many to tip out of guilt or to avoid holding up a line.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced that it delivered a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework. The development comes after President Trump announced that Israel had agreed to a two-month ceasefire plan, though Israeli sources indicated they had not yet fully committed. A Palestinian official noted that Hamas is seeking guarantees for a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the proposed 60-day truce. The news offers a potential breakthrough in the 21-month-long conflict, with President Trump expressing optimism that a deal could be reached soon.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes on Iran could reinforce North Korea's belief that nuclear weapons are essential for its survival, according to security analysts. Experts suggest that Pyongyang may view the U.S. as an unpredictable and untrustworthy force, making the prospect of denuclearization even more remote. This development is likely to push North Korea to further invest in a mobile, dispersed, and survivable nuclear arsenal with a robust second-strike capability. The action complicates any future diplomatic efforts, as the regime will see its nuclear program as the ultimate guarantee against a similar fate.</p>

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what is being called the "toughest group of all" for the Women's Euro 2025 tournament. Group D also features football powerhouses France and the Netherlands, meaning three of the four teams are ranked in the world's top 11. Defending champions England and 2017 winners the Netherlands both have strong tournament records, while France is on an eight-game winning streak. As debutants and the lowest-ranked team, Wales enters as the clear underdog but hopes to leverage that status to its advantage in what promises to be a highly competitive group stage.</p>

          <p>A beverage known as the "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming it can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The alcohol-free drink typically combines coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there are no scientific studies to support the idea that this combination of ingredients can reduce cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most people and can aid hydration, doctors note it's not a medical solution for stress and that managing stress through proven methods like sleep, exercise, and therapy is more effective.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of a revolutionary Chinese typewriter from the 1940s has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the "MingKwai" typewriter was an ingenious solution to typing a language with tens of thousands of characters instead of an alphabet. The machine's system, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, is now seen as a foundational concept that underlies modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing input methods. The discovery of the only prototype is being celebrated by scholars as finding a crucial missing link in the history of technology.</p>

Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team catches sharks, examines their stomach contents to assess their diet and health, and then releases them. This research provides vital data on the local ecosystem, as the health of these apex predators is a key indicator of the overall health of the ocean. Despite public fascination with sharks, researchers say securing financial support for this crucial conservation work remains a challenge.</p>

He suggested the "America Party" could focus its resources on just a handful of pivotal House and Senate races. Given the narrow margins in Congress, winning these few seats would be enough to give the party the deciding vote on contentious legislation, ensuring, in his view, that laws serve the will of the people. This targeted approach comes as Musk continues to poll his social media followers on whether he should create a third party to challenge the Republican and Democratic duopoly.</p>

However, the country remains largely closed to the outside world, with no indication that the resort will be open to most foreign tourists.

The official reason given was a "scheduling conflict," but analysts suggest it could signal domestic political turbulence or reflect growing friction with other BRICS members like India and Brazil. While the group has expanded and accounts for a large portion of the global economy, its internal strategic and ideological fragmentation continues to be a major challenge to its goal of acting as a counterweight to Western dominance.

          <p>A doctor working at a public hospital argues that new congressional work requirements for Medicaid will disproportionately harm the country's poorest and most vulnerable residents. While many beneficiaries who cannot work should qualify for exemptions, the bureaucratic hurdles of proving their status will be insurmountable for those facing homelessness, disability, or language barriers. The author contends that this "time tax" is engineered to cut costs by disenfranchising eligible people from the care they are entitled to. This will lead to nearly 12 million people losing insurance and will place an unsustainable burden on safety-net hospitals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researcher and former Google X executive Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that it takes about 90 seconds for the hormones associated with a stress response, like cortisol and adrenaline, to be flushed from the body. After this initial period, any lingering anger is a result of consciously or unconsciously rerunning the negative thought in your mind. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously choose how to react, rather than remaining stuck in an emotional loop, leading to a more fulfilled life.</p>
