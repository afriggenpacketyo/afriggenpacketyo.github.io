          <h2>Ticket Touts Allegedly Received Inside Help from Ticketing Firms to Defraud Fans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that ticket touts allegedly made millions by exploiting loopholes and receiving inside help from ticketing companies like Ticketmaster. Former employees claim they worked closely with touts, offering financial incentives and developing software to facilitate bulk ticket sales. Court documents suggest some employees even bought tickets for touts and tipped them off about upcoming sales. Ticketmaster denies current involvement in uncapped resale markets, but the report raises questions about the company's past practices and its commitment to fair ticketing. The investigation highlights the challenges fans face in securing tickets at face value. </p>

          <p>South Korea has halted its loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, a move initiated by the new liberal government to foster trust and promote peace. The broadcasts, which included K-pop songs and messages critical of the North Korean regime, were resumed last year in response to North Korea's balloon campaign involving trash-laden balloons sent into South Korean territory. President Lee Jae-myung aims to reduce military tensions and alleviate the concerns of South Korean residents living near the border. While North Korea has yet to comment, the move signals a potential shift in inter-Korean relations. </p>

Despite the gap, Huawei's Ascend chips show significant progress, with the Ascend 910C closing in on Nvidia's performance.

          <p>Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former Home Secretary Lord Leon Brittan, has criticized the decision to drop an investigation into a Met Police officer who led an inquiry into false sexual assault claims against her late husband. The claims were fabricated by Carl Beech, who was later jailed for perverting the course of justice. Lady Brittan feels the investigation was mishandled and that her husband's reputation was permanently tarnished. She describes being treated insensitively by the police after her husband's death, including during a raid on their home. </p>

          <p>A U.S. nuclear weapons expert has released satellite images of what is believed to be a new uranium enrichment facility under construction in Yongbyon, North Korea. The image, taken in April, shows a structure with similar features to an existing uranium enrichment plant in Kangson. The IAEA is monitoring the construction of the new facility, which has a central hall where centrifuges could be installed. The development raises concerns about North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its efforts to expand its production of enriched uranium. </p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul is accusing the White House of "immaturity" after he and his family were disinvited from the annual White House picnic. Paul believes the disinvitation is a result of his opposition to President Trump's spending bill, which he argues contributes to the national debt. He expressed disappointment with the White House's actions, stating that it makes him lose respect for Trump. Paul also criticized White House aide Stephen Miller, accusing him of casually discussing the suspension of habeas corpus. </p>
