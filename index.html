          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to significantly increase France's defense budget, aiming to reach €64 billion annually by 2027, three years ahead of schedule. Citing escalating threats including Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and what he termed as "uncertainty" from the United States, Macron emphasized the need for France to be powerful to remain free. The accelerated spending is intended to bolster France's military capabilities in response to a global environment where freedom is being seriously threatened.</p>

          <p>A small aircraft crashed at London Southend Airport, resulting in a large fire and the cancellation of all remaining flights for the day. Eyewitnesses described seeing the plane bank sharply after takeoff before it inverted and hit the ground, causing a significant fireball. Emergency services, including police and fire crews, responded to the scene and established a perimeter, advising the public to avoid the area. The airport confirmed a "serious incident" occurred and stated that further information would be provided as it becomes available.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon championship, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a four-set final. The victory marks a significant comeback for the Italian world number one, who avenged his recent French Open loss to Alcaraz where he had failed to convert championship points. The match showcased the high-level rivalry between the two dominant players in men's tennis, with Sinner's composed and clinical performance ending Alcaraz's 24-match winning streak. Sinner described the win as living his dream and his first major title not on a hard court.</p>

          <p>A rapidly expanding wildfire in the Grand Canyon's North Rim, known as the Dragon Bravo Fire, has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The fire's progression was fueled by high winds and also damaged a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that complicated firefighting efforts. This event is part of a larger, intense wildfire season, with another major fire in Arizona forcing evacuations and smoke from Canadian wildfires causing unhealthy air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest. Officials are warning of dangerous conditions from fire, smoke, and extreme heat.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has recorded its final day of a significant heatwave, with temperatures peaking at 31.2C in Scotland, though slightly cooler than the previous day. While millions remain under hosepipe bans due to dry conditions, the heatwave is expected to break with the arrival of heavy rain and potential thunderstorms. The extreme heat coincided with several water-related deaths and prompted emergency services to issue safety warnings. Amber heat health alerts remained in place for southern England, signifying likely pressure on the health service until the weather pattern changes.</p>

The move comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the war in Ukraine.

          <p>Two young Palestinian men, 20-year-old US citizen Sayfollah Musallet and 23-year-old Mohammed al-Shalabi, were killed in an attack in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which their families attribute to Israeli settlers. Musallet was reportedly beaten to death, while al-Shalabi was shot. The incident occurred as violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has surged, with the UN documenting over 2,000 settler attacks since January 2024. The families and US officials are demanding an investigation and accountability for the killings, which have highlighted a pattern of unresolved violence.</p>

          <p>An Arizona man in Goodyear is facing escalating fines from his homeowners association (HOA) for placing a cooler of free bottled water outside his home for neighbors and delivery drivers during triple-digit heat. David Martin says he began receiving warnings and then fines, now at $100 per citation, from the Canyon Trails HOA, which claims its rules prohibit advertising water distribution from a portable cooler. The dispute has escalated, with residents voting to recall board members, a result the board then voided, setting the stage for a potential legal battle over the compassionate gesture.</p>

          <p>According to Iran's Fars news agency, which is close to the Revolutionary Guard, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained minor leg injuries during an Israeli attack last month. The unverified report claims that on June 16, bombs targeted a secret underground facility in Tehran where the Supreme National Security Council was meeting, trapping the officials inside. Pezeshkian and others reportedly escaped through an emergency shaft. The report raises questions about Israeli intelligence capabilities, as Israel has not commented on the claim but had previously admitted to targeting top Iranian leaders.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that were set to take effect, hoping to negotiate a trade deal with the Trump administration by an August 1 deadline. The decision came after President Trump threatened to impose new 30% tariffs on EU goods, escalating trade tensions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will continue to prepare countermeasures in case a deal is not reached. The move provides a brief window to de-escalate a trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's rhetoric focusing on deporting "the worst of the worst," government data reveals that the majority of immigrants currently detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have no criminal convictions. As of late June, over 71% of the nearly 58,000 people in ICE detention had no criminal record, and of those who did, few were convicted of high-level violent crimes. This data highlights a significant disconnect between the administration's public justification for its aggressive deportation program and the reality of who is being targeted as arrests surge.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that President Trump's intention is to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), not eliminate it entirely. The comments come amid widespread criticism of the administration's response to the deadly Texas floods, where thousands of calls to FEMA reportedly went unanswered due to expired contracts. Noem defended the response as the "best" in years and dismissed reports of operational failures as "fake news." Her clarification appears to be a shift from earlier rhetoric by both her and the president, who had previously suggested phasing out the agency.</p>

This strategy would allow for faster delivery of military aid to Kyiv as it struggles to repel intensified Russian attacks. The meeting also occurs amid a bipartisan push in the Senate for a new, powerful sanctions package against Russia. The developments signal a potential turning point in the U.S. and NATO's approach to supporting Ukraine and pressuring Moscow.</p>

The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, stating that a "technical error" caused a munition targeting an Islamic Jihad militant to miss its target by dozens of meters, and that it regrets any harm to civilians. Verified video shows the aftermath of the strike, which occurred near a school in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp.
