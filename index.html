          <p>A new report from the Social Security Board of Trustees projects the trust fund's depletion by 2033, a year earlier than previously forecast.  At that point, only 77% of scheduled retirement benefits will be payable.  The combined Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance trust funds will be depleted by 2034, with 81% of benefits payable.

          <p>The Social Security trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2034, a year earlier than previously estimated, necessitating a 20% cut in monthly benefits.
