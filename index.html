          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has indicated that the recently announced tariff rates on numerous trading partners are now "pretty much set." In a recent interview, Greer explained that while trade ministers are still in contact, the current rates reflect the framework of the president's tariff strategy. The administration has imposed a 10% tariff on all imports starting August 7, and Greer stated he does not expect these rates to be negotiated down. Bank of America's CEO noted the uncertainty of the tariffs' economic impact, with economists predicting slower growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly advocating for a "military solution" to rescue the remaining hostages held by Hamas, according to an Israeli official. This shift in strategy comes amid a perceived lack of interest from Hamas in reaching a diplomatic agreement. With approximately 20 living hostages believed to be in captivity, Netanyahu's proposal involves expanding military operations in Gaza to extract them by force. The news coincides with large protests in Tel Aviv, where families and supporters are demanding the government secure the hostages' release as concerns for their well-being intensify.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic political maneuver, Democratic lawmakers have departed from Texas to prevent a vote on a new congressional map that would significantly benefit the Republican party. By leaving, they deny the legislature the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, effectively stalling the special session called by the governor. The proposed redistricting, backed by former President Trump, could create five new Republican-leaning seats. Texas's attorney general has threatened the absent lawmakers with fines and arrest, while the Democrats maintain they are protesting a rigged system that ignores their constituents.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a new AI model named Genie 2, which can generate playable, 3D interactive environments from a single static image. CEO Demis Hassabis and research scientist Jack Parker-Holder showcased how the model can transform a photograph, such as a waterfall, into a game-like world that an AI agent or human can explore. This technology not only has implications for entertainment and gaming but also serves a larger goal of building AI that understands the physical world. Hassabis explained that these simulated environments can be used to train AI agents and robots for real-world tasks more efficiently.</p>

          <p>The practice of egg freezing is rapidly increasing among American women, who view it as a way to preserve their fertility and delay motherhood without the pressure of a biological clock.

While doctors emphasize it is not a guarantee of a future pregnancy, many women see it as an empowering form of insurance against future infertility. The procedure's growing acceptance is also influencing employment decisions, as some companies now offer it as a covered benefit.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts that artificial intelligence is on an exponential curve of progress, with artificial general intelligence (AGI) potentially arriving within the next decade. In a recent interview, he suggested that AI could revolutionize human health to the point of curing all diseases and lead to an era of "radical abundance" by eliminating scarcity. Hassabis also acknowledged the significant risks, including misuse by bad actors and the challenge of ensuring advanced AI remains aligned with human values. He stressed the need for international cooperation and building safety guardrails to manage these powerful emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>A vessel carrying approximately 154 African migrants, reported to be Ethiopian nationals, has capsized off the coast of Yemen, resulting in a significant loss of life. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) confirmed the tragedy, stating that 68 people are dead and 74 remain missing, with only 12 known survivors. The incident highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route from the Horn of Africa to Gulf countries via war-torn Yemen. Despite the ongoing civil war, Yemen remains a major transit point for migrants seeking economic opportunities in countries like Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>Economist Jeffrey Sachs has cautioned that the United States' confrontational stance toward China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy of war. In an interview, he stated that the trade war was initiated by the U.S. and that a measure of rationality is needed to prevent further escalation, as both nations have much to gain from cooperation. Sachs advised that China should focus on expanding exports to markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rather than relying on the U.S. or Europe.

State-owned mining company Codelco confirmed the fatalities as search teams worked for days to clear debris from collapsed tunnels.

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, just days after a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck the region. The eruption sent a plume of ash and gas nearly 27,000 feet into the air, prompting an aviation alert for the area. The volcano is located 143 miles from the epicenter of the recent quake, and seismologists suggest the seismic waves could have triggered the eruption in a system that was already close to activity.

          <p>Counter-terrorism police have charged a fifth person in relation to a break-in at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where activists damaged two military aircraft. Muhammad Umer Khalid, 22, faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place. The incident, which caused an estimated £7 million in damage, was claimed by the group Palestine Action, which has since been proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The group, known for targeting arms companies, has been granted permission to legally challenge the ban.</p>

          <p>Approximately 3,200 Boeing workers at facilities in Missouri and Illinois are set to go on strike after voting to reject the company's latest four-year labor agreement. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union announced the decision, stating that members who build critical defense systems deserve a contract that ensures their families' security. This vote followed the rejection of a previous offer last week. In response, Boeing expressed disappointment, noting the rejected offer included significant wage growth, and stated it has implemented a contingency plan to continue supporting customers during the strike.</p>

          <p>In a recent court filing, Trump administration lawyers have denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting earlier public statements from White House officials. The filing is part of a lawsuit alleging unconstitutional immigration sweeps in Southern California. Previously, reports and a statement from adviser Stephen Miller indicated the administration was pursuing a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day. However, the Justice Department now claims that while the figure may have been discussed as a goal, no such policy or directive has been issued to ICE or its field offices.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in the installation of new utility-scale solar capacity, adding over three gigawatts last year, primarily driven by major utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is facilitated by a state rule that expedites the approval process for solar projects under 75 megawatts, making solar an increasingly cheaper option than natural gas. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to cause a significant drop in rooftop solar installations. Despite policy uncertainties, communities like the solar-powered Babcock Ranch demonstrate the technology's resilience. (not investment advice)</p>
