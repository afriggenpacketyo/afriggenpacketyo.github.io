          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department reported a $316 billion budget deficit for May, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.36 trillion, which is a 14% increase from the previous year.

Despite a 15% rise in receipts for May and a 6% year-over-year increase, expenditures also increased by 2% monthly and 8% annually.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an extra Â£29bn per year for the NHS in England, along with funding increases for defense and housing, in the UK's spending review. The review also includes more money for artificial intelligence and transport projects, with the aim of "renewing Britain." However, some departments, such as the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face day-to-day spending cuts. The government hopes increased spending in health and long-term investments will reassure voters, though many departments will grapple with frugal allocations.</p>

While the message of empathy and questioning assumptions remains relevant, the remake is considered longer and less impactful.
