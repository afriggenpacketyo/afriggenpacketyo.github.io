          <p>A semi-truck driver, Jashanpreet Singh, faces charges including gross vehicular manslaughter after a deadly eight-vehicle crash on a California freeway that killed three and injured four. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) identified Singh as an Indian national who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022, despite possessing federal Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) and a REAL ID, which California transportation officials assert were federally approved. This incident has ignited a contentious debate over federal and state responsibilities in issuing commercial driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. Florida has also filed a lawsuit against California and Washington, alleging their failure to comply with federal safety and immigration requirements for CDL issuance, highlighting a broader national concern.</p>

          <p>Summer Bushman is transforming her grief into a vital warning for parents after her 10-year-old daughter, Autumn, died by suicide following prolonged bullying and nighttime smartphone use. Autumn, a vibrant fourth-grader, was found to be on her phone just before her death, having used it in bed despite her mother's concerns. Research from Virginia Tech links nighttime screen use and easy access to over-the-counter medicines to teen suicide attempts, particularly for bullied children who lack support access at night. This article underscores the critical need for parents to restrict phone access in bedrooms and prioritize sleep hygiene to protect children's mental health.</p>

          <p>China's long-term strategic planning, underpinned by political stability, is rapidly accelerating its green energy transition, positioning it as a leading "electrostate." The article highlights massive infrastructure projects, like ultra-high-voltage power lines, that efficiently transmit clean energy from production sites in the north and west to the populous east. This commitment aims for peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, significantly boosting renewable energy's share in total power generation capacity to about 60%. In contrast, the article notes US policy shifts towards fossil fuels, reflecting a divergence in global energy strategies.</p>

          <h2>Alaska Airlines Implements Nationwide Ground Stop Due to IT Outage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 21:26:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alaska Airlines initiated a nationwide ground stop on Thursday evening, suspending all flights due to an unspecified IT outage severely impacting its operations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the temporary halt at the airline's request, with the duration and precise number of affected flights yet to be determined. This incident exacerbates recent pressures on U.S. air travel, which has already faced significant delays stemming from air traffic controller shortages, partly attributed to the ongoing government shutdown. As a major U.S. carrier serving 140 destinations, this disruption signals potential widespread travel complications for passengers.</p>

          <p>Investigators of the recent Louvre museum jewelry heist have recovered over 150 DNA, fingerprint, and other traces from items left behind by the four burglars, including a helmet, angle grinders, and gloves. The thieves, who made off with an estimated €88 million worth of jewels, initially struggled to open display cases but eventually succeeded by hand. Despite internal alarms functioning, museum staff retreated, possibly due to fear. Louvre director Laurence des Cars acknowledged security blind spots on the museum's outer walls, pledging upgrades to the CCTV network and advocating for a police station within the museum. Prosecutors express optimism that the extensive evidence will lead to arrests.</p>

The company also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, aiming to integrate Intel CPUs with Nvidia's AI graphics processors to boost its data center business. Intel's outlook for the fourth quarter aligns with analyst expectations, but the company noted potential revisions due to ongoing SEC approval for its unique accounting treatment of the government's stake, amidst the government shutdown.

The execution process appeared prolonged, with Boyd exhibiting significant movements for over 15 minutes. The U.S. Supreme Court denied his request for a stay, prompting a scathing dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, cited "mounting and unbroken evidence" that nitrogen gas executions are unconstitutionally cruel.</p>

          <p>A federal investigation has dismantled an elaborate, mafia-operated poker gambling scheme that allegedly defrauded wealthy victims of millions using high-tech cheating methods. The scam involved X-ray tables, secret cameras, chip tray analyzers, rigged shuffling machines, and special glasses that could read pre-marked cards. "Face cards," including former NBA player Damon Jones, were reportedly used to lure victims into these games, where information about players' hands was secretly relayed to "quarterbacks" at the table. This "mind-boggling" fraud, which also involved NBA coach Chauncey Billups, allegedly netted over $7 million for organized crime families, with funds laundered through cryptocurrency and shell companies.</p>

This dispute follows similar recent impasses with Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal, highlighting broader industry challenges in distribution deals.

Hamilton, drawing from his own intense 2021 battle with Verstappen, highlighted that being the "hunter" is easier than the "defender" in such high-pressure scenarios. Piastri acknowledged Verstappen's unexpected surge in form but stated his focus remains on maximizing his own performance, not worrying about rivals.</p>

Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, condemned the probe as "politically-motivated allegations" lacking evidence and merit.

          <p>A five-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) factories due to a cyberattack led to a 27% slump in UK car production in September, marking the lowest September output since 1952.

This cyber event is estimated to be the most economically damaging in UK history, costing £1.9 billion and affecting 5,000 businesses, with full recovery not expected until January 2026.
