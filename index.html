          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have apologized for the "Oaxaca Slip-On," a shoe criticized for appropriating a traditional Mexican huarache design. The article notes that Mexico's president and culture minister condemned the footwear, which was reportedly produced without consulting or crediting the Indigenous communities who originated the style. In response to the backlash, both the designer and the company have expressed deep regret and stated their commitment to engaging in respectful dialogue and providing restitution to the affected Oaxacan community.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a large outdoor gathering in Chicago's South Austin neighborhood early Sunday left a 22-year-old woman dead and five other people injured. Police responded to the scene to find multiple gunshot victims, with several reported to be in critical condition. This incident was one of three separate shootings that occurred in the same neighborhood within a three-hour period, although authorities have not yet confirmed if the events are connected. As of Sunday afternoon, no arrests had been made, and the investigation into the motive is ongoing.</p>

          <p>An in-depth report from the occupied West Bank details how Israeli settlers have intensified their efforts to displace Palestinians, particularly since the Hamas attacks of October 2023. The article interviews a settler leader who openly expresses the goal of taking over the land, viewing recent events as a turning point that has weakened Palestinian resolve. This perspective is contrasted with accounts from Palestinians and human rights groups, who accuse settlers of systemic violence and intimidation, often with the implicit or explicit support of Israeli security forces, further extinguishing hopes for a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, explains that the impact of the Second World War on the nation's development is often underestimated. The conflict, particularly the Japanese invasion, shattered much of the infrastructure and communications that had been built in the preceding decades. According to Mitter, this widespread destruction forced China to essentially restart its development process after the war. He argues that understanding this historical context is crucial for analyzing China's contemporary political and social landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for the immediate removal of homeless individuals from Washington D.C., suggesting they be relocated to distant places. In a series of social media posts, he linked homelessness to crime and filth, vowing to restore the capital's beauty and safety. This comes as he floats the idea of putting the city under federal control, a move spurred by an alleged assault on a former staffer. The administration has already increased the presence of federal law enforcement in the city, with Trump promising a press conference to announce further plans.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has intensified his standoff with state Democratic lawmakers, threatening that the fight over a contentious redistricting plan "could literally last years." More than 50 Democrats have left Texas to prevent a quorum, blocking a Republican-led effort to pass new electoral maps that would heavily favor their party. Abbott stated he would call continuous 30-day special legislative sessions and have the absent lawmakers arrested upon their return. The high-stakes battle reflects a national struggle over gerrymandering, with the outcome in Texas potentially impacting the balance of power in the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot stated he does not believe Crystal Palace fans had any "bad intention" when they disrupted a minute's silence before the Community Shield match at Wembley. The silence was held to remember former Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, who died in a car crash. The referee cut the tribute short after shouts were heard from the Palace supporters' end. Slot suggested the noise was likely from an unaware fan cheering, which then caused a chain reaction as other fans tried to quiet them, rather than a deliberate act of disrespect.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has defended his government's decision to suspend the export of certain weapons to Israel that could be used in its planned Gaza City offensive. While reaffirming Germany's fundamental solidarity with Israel, Merz stated that his government could not supply arms for a conflict where a high number of civilian casualties is possible. The decision marks a significant policy shift and has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative bloc. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu responded by saying Merz had "buckled" under pressure, expressing hope the decision would be reversed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA is facing scrutiny over its process for approving drugs for rare diseases, exemplified by the case of Sarepta Therapeutics' gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The treatment received accelerated approval in 2023 despite some internal concerns, a decision praised for its flexibility but which also led to a $3.2 million per-patient cost. However, the situation has become complicated following the deaths of three patients from liver failure, prompting the FDA to suspend the drug's distribution. This incident highlights the difficult balance the agency must strike between providing hope for patients and ensuring drug safety. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back against President Trump's threats to exert federal control over the city, defending her administration's handling of public safety. In response to White House claims of "out-of-control" violence, Bowser highlighted that violent crime has been on a steep two-year decline and is currently down 26% compared to last year. While expressing a willingness to work with the president, she suggested his plan to surge federal officers is more about showing force than addressing a non-existent crime spike. She argued the city needs more federal prosecutors and judges, not a federal takeover of its police force.</p>

Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rutte praised Trump's strategy of engaging in dialogue while also increasing pressure on Russia. He emphasized that while the Alaska summit is a crucial first step, any final peace deal must involve Ukraine and European allies. The meeting will determine if a broader negotiation process is viable or if Putin is not genuinely interested in peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Executives from Frontier and United Airlines are warning that cuts to domestic flight schedules may be on the horizon due to a lack of profitability on many routes. Frontier CEO Barry Biffle stated that the supply of flights within the U.S. has exceeded demand, making many domestic routes unprofitable for the industry as a whole. This sentiment was echoed by United CEO Scott Kirby, who predicted that airlines losing money on routes will eventually have to stop flying them. This potential reduction in capacity could lead to fewer flight options and higher fares for domestic travelers. (not investment advice)</p>
