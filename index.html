          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House to discuss potential pathways to ending the war with Russia. In a more cordial meeting than their previous encounter, Trump promised "very good protection" for Ukraine but remained vague on specifics and appeared to walk back his earlier demands for an immediate ceasefire. Following the talks, which also included European leaders, Trump stated he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin to potentially arrange a trilateral meeting. The discussions are occurring amid high stakes for Ukraine's security and the broader European geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Shares of bitcoin miner and data center operator TeraWulf surged over 10% following an announcement that Google is increasing its stake in the company to 14%. The deal involves Google providing up to $1.4 billion in additional backstop funding, bringing its total to approximately $3.2 billion, to support the expansion of TeraWulf's facility in New York. This development follows a recent spike in the company's stock after it signed significant long-term computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. The increased investment is seen as a strategic move to build out advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open reveals that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is significantly impacting contraceptive use in the United States. Researchers found that nearly a third of people who obtained the OTC pill, Opill, had previously been using no form of contraception at all. The study highlights that the OTC option is particularly beneficial for individuals facing barriers to healthcare, such as the uninsured, younger people, and those in rural areas. The primary reason cited for choosing the OTC pill was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment to get a prescription.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner described kissing her "Game of Thrones" co-star Kit Harington for their new film as a "vile" experience due to their close, sibling-like relationship. Turner and Harington, who played siblings Sansa Stark and Jon Snow, have remained close friends since the show concluded. She explained on a late-night talk show that after she recommended Harington for the role in their upcoming horror movie "The Dreadful," they realized the script required them to kiss, which made them both feel like "retching" on set. Despite the awkwardness, they proceeded with the film because they felt the script was too good to refuse.</p>

The rate at which employees voluntarily quit their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level in nearly a decade, reflecting a cooling labor market and decreased confidence in finding new employment. This stagnation is driven by factors like higher interest rates, slowing job growth, and a reduced ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. While providing stability, experts warn that job hugging could lead to wage stagnation and skill atrophy for employees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article advocates for the strategy of using dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple yet powerful way for investors to leverage compound interest and enhance their portfolio returns. Instead of receiving cash payouts, DRIPs automatically use dividends to purchase more shares of the same stock, including fractional shares. This passive approach ensures that money is consistently put to work in an investment an individual already trusts. Using the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) as an example, the article notes a significant difference in cumulative returns over a decade for those who reinvested dividends versus those who did not.

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire and hostage release proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a two-stage framework that includes an initial 60-day truce in exchange for the release of some of the remaining Israeli hostages. Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would also take place during this period. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated a preference for a deal that releases all hostages at once. This development occurs amid intense Israeli military operations in Gaza and large-scale protests in Israel demanding a deal.</p>

          <p>With high home values and rising retirement costs, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to access their home equity. This article consults financial experts to determine the best age to take out such a loan, for which homeowners must typically be at least 62. Experts suggest that waiting until one's late 60s or early 70s is often ideal, as older borrowers can access a larger percentage of their home's value. The decision should also factor in long-term goals, health, plans to age in place, and other available retirement income sources, as taking a reverse mortgage too early can deplete equity needed for future expenses or inheritances.

Critics and advocates for borrowers argue that the vague language could be used to exclude a wide range of non-profits based on political ideology.

          <p>Germany's Foreign Ministry has confirmed that 211 Afghan nationals who had been approved for resettlement in Germany were deported from Pakistan back to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. These individuals, including human rights defenders and former local staff for German institutions, had fled to Pakistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021. The German government is now in contact with Pakistani authorities to facilitate their return to Pakistan and has arranged temporary accommodation for them in Afghanistan. This situation highlights the precarious position of thousands of Afghans promised refuge in Western countries who are now at risk due to Pakistan's ongoing deportation campaign.</p>

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, resolving a defamation lawsuit over the airing of false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement was disclosed in an SEC filing and follows a similar, larger settlement paid by Fox News to Dominion in 2023. A Delaware judge had already ruled that Newsmax defamed Dominion, with internal communications revealed in the case showing that network officials knew the election fraud allegations were baseless. Despite the settlement, Newsmax issued a statement maintaining that its coverage was fair and within professional journalistic standards.</p>

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW and will no longer use the iconic NBC peacock logo. This rebranding is part of a larger corporate restructuring, as the channel spins off from its parent company, Comcast's NBC Universal, into a new entity called Versant. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to create a distinct identity for the network as it becomes an independent newsgathering organization. The spinoff will also include other NBC Universal cable channels like CNBC and USA, which will also drop the peacock logo but largely retain their existing names.</p>

          <p>Several European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, made an urgent trip to Washington to meet with President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The visit was prompted by concerns over Trump's recent shift in strategy regarding the war in Ukraine, particularly his decision to drop demands for a ceasefire before peace talks and his reluctance to impose further sanctions on Russia. European diplomats are reportedly aiming to prevent what they fear could be a "capitulation" to Russian terms, emphasizing that Ukraine's future is fundamentally tied to the long-term security of the entire European continent.</p>

          <p>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared the ongoing strike by over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants to be illegal, ordering them to return to work immediately. This decision comes after the union defied a previous back-to-work order from the government, continuing a job action that has disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers during the peak summer season. The union and the airline remain in a standoff over issues of pay and compensation for unpaid work, with union leaders expressing willingness to face penalties for their continued defiance, which has affected an estimated 500,000 travelers.</p>

          <p>The German Football Federation (DFB) has opened an investigation into two separate incidents of racist abuse that occurred during German Cup matches over the weekend. In one match, Schalke's Christopher Antwi-Adjei reported being racially abused by fans, leading to a temporary suspension of the game. In another fixture, a Kaiserslautern player was allegedly insulted by a spectator who was quickly identified and removed from the stadium. FIFA President Gianni Infantino condemned the incidents and called on the DFB to take appropriate action, reiterating that there is no place for racism or any form of discrimination in football.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Washington, an analysis of international support shows that European countries combined have committed more financial aid to Ukraine than the United States. According to the Kiel Institute, European nations have provided $165.7 billion in total support, compared to $130.6 billion from the U.S. since Russia's full-scale invasion. While the U.S. remains the largest single-country donor, these figures challenge claims that Europe is not contributing its fair share. The aid from both sides consists of a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided a larger proportion as grants compared to the European Union.</p>

          <p>In response to political pressure to lower medication costs, drugmaker Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, to cash-paying patients in the U.S. for $499 per month. This price is less than half of the drug's current monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and the drug savings company GoodRx. This move aims to expand access for uninsured or underinsured Type 2 diabetes patients and to encourage the use of the branded medication over potentially unsafe compounded alternatives.</p>

          <p>The BBC has postponed the broadcast of "Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home," a documentary chronicling the final years of the rock legend's life, which was scheduled to air just weeks after his death in July. The film was intended to cover his move back to the UK and the period leading up to his farewell concert. Originally planned as a multi-part series, the project was re-conceived as a single, hour-long film as Osbourne's health declined. The BBC did not provide a reason for the postponement but stated that new transmission details for the intimate documentary would be confirmed in the future.</p>
