            <p>President Trump has exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech devices from reciprocal tariffs, according to new guidance from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This decision reverses potential price hikes on tech products, a major win for companies like Apple, which manufactures most of its products in China. The exemptions are intended to give companies time to move production to the U.S.  White House officials stated that America cannot rely on China for critical technologies, pushing companies to onshore manufacturing.

            <p>President Trump has authorized the military to take control of land at the US-Mexico border as part of efforts to crack down on undocumented immigration. The memorandum allows the military to take a more direct role in securing the border. It authorizes the Department of Defense to exercise jurisdiction over federal lands for border-barrier construction and the emplacement of detection and monitoring equipment. The order excludes native reservations.</p>

            <p>NYPD dive teams are continuing their search in the Hudson River for the remaining wreckage from a fatal helicopter crash that killed all six people on board. Experts believe that recovering missing parts, including the main rotor and transmission, is crucial to determining the cause of the crash. A preliminary investigation suggests a rotor may have broken off, causing the helicopter to shake uncontrollably. Authorities are considering mechanical failure as a possible cause.</p>

On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump raised levies on Chinese goods to 104 per cent, before increasing them to 125 per cent the next day, later clarifying the cumulative figure at 145 per cent. Beijing countered with new levies on US goods of 125 per cent , on top of earlier-imposed tariffs, taking the cumulative total to nearly 148 per cent.</p>
