          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched precision strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, aiming to dismantle Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities and prevent nuclear threats. The strikes utilized B-2 Spirit bombers and bunker-buster bombs, marking their first operational use. Trump warned Iran against retaliation, stating that any such action would be met with greater force. The U.S. communicated to Iran that these strikes were the extent of their plans, not aimed at regime change, but to disable Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law restricting property ownership in the state by citizens of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The bill, which exempts U.S. green card holders and citizens, allows visa holders to purchase property only for primary residences. Critics are planning a lawsuit challenging the law, which is set to take effect on September 1. The bill has been in development for over two years and has faced significant debate.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear sites was the right move, contrasting it with previous administrations' approaches. It suggests that a nuclear-armed Iran posed a significant threat to Israel and regional stability. The author posits that Iran is a relatively weak state with vulnerabilities, and that its leaders are not eager for direct confrontation with the U.S. The piece acknowledges the potential for escalation but suggests that Iran's options are limited, and that the strike has significantly delayed Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>
