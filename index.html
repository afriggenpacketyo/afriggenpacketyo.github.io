          <p>CrowdStrike's stock experienced a decline of approximately 5% in extended trading on Tuesday following the company's release of a revenue forecast that fell short of expectations. While the company's earnings per share exceeded estimates at 73 cents adjusted versus the expected 65 cents, revenue matched expectations at $1.10 billion. Despite a nearly 20% increase in revenue for the fiscal first quarter, the company reported a net loss of $110.2 million, a stark contrast to the net income of $42.8 million in the same quarter of the previous year, which was attributed to rising costs in sales, marketing, research, and development. The company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program to reflect confidence in CrowdStrike's future and mission of stopping breaches. (not investment advice)</p>

Triangular diplomacy involves balancing and maneuvering between two other powers to build leverage, reduce dependency, and become indispensable to multiple sides without fully committing to any. While this approach offers agility, ambiguity, and tactical scope, it also carries the risk of entanglements that could escalate instability. The dynamics of triangular diplomacy are particularly relevant for leaders navigating a world of declining post-war institutions and reassessing multilateral commitments.</p>

This timeframe would be challenging to meet due to existing case backlogs.

Tensions between natives and new arrivals, particularly in France and Britain, are cited as potential drivers of instability. The piece explores the differences between the European and American landscapes, considering factors such as ethnic and religious divisions, elite legitimacy, and enthusiasm for communal violence.</p>

President Trump singled out the athlete in a post on Truth Social, stating that "large scale fines" will be imposed on the state.

Documents indicate that this potential renaming is part of an effort to align the U.S. military with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture." Other vessels on the Navy's "recommended list" for renaming include the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman. The proposed changes have drawn criticism from figures like Nancy Pelosi, who called it a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for civil rights.</p>
