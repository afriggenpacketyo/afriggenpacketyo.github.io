          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, surpassing market expectations. The surge is attributed to sustained high demand for its advanced artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple. Looking ahead, TSMC projects third-quarter revenue to grow by 38% and anticipates its full-year 2025 revenue will increase by around 30%, signaling continued confidence in the AI sector's growth.

          <p>The Labour Party is reviewing remarks made by veteran MP Diane Abbott, who recently reaffirmed controversial 2023 comments that led to her temporary suspension. In a BBC interview, Abbott stood by her assertion that Jewish people, Irish people, and Travellers experience a different form of racism than Black people due to skin color. This has prompted a fresh assessment by the party, which stated it takes the comments "incredibly seriously" and will evaluate them based on its internal rules regarding antisemitism.</p>

          <p>The White House has stated that a key federal grant program for fentanyl overdose prevention, which is currently underfunded by $140 million, will be paid out "in increments" rather than in a single annual payment.

While the administration insists the Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) program is not threatened, the shift in disbursement has created uncertainty for public health departments.</p>
