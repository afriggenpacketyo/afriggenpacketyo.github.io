          <p>Kaja Sokola testified in a New York retrial against Harvey Weinstein, recounting multiple instances of sexual assault beginning when she was 16 years old. Sokola described encounters where Weinstein forced her to masturbate him and later assaulted her in a hotel room. She stated that the incidents left her blaming herself and feeling as though her soul was removed from her. Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty and insists the interactions were consensual, faces charges related to the alleged assault of Sokola, as well as other women.</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have agreed to a trade deal that will reduce import taxes on British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the U.S. tariff-free. While leaders from both countries have hailed the agreement as significant, analysts suggest it may not substantially alter pre-existing trade terms. The deal will reduce tariffs on cars to 10% for up to 100,000 vehicles annually and slash tariffs on steel and aluminum, with the two sides also agreeing to reciprocal access for beef exports. The agreement is viewed as a positive step, but some critics argue that it favors the U.S.</p>

          <p>Josh Raffaelli, a former fund manager at Brookfield Asset Management, has filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of fraud, attempted bribery, and improperly limiting investments in Elon Musk's companies.

Brookfield fired Raffaelli shortly after he filed a whistle-blower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which Brookfield denies all claims and intends to defend vigorously.

          <p>Southern California Edison is facing a lawsuit claiming that the Eaton fire, allegedly triggered by the company's negligence, exposed residents to dangerous levels of lead, asbestos, and other toxic substances.

The suit seeks compensation for residents harmed by the toxic substances, as well as money for medical monitoring of their health.

          <p>A judge has declared a mistrial in the case against Christopher Schurr, a Michigan police officer, who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya, a black motorist, during a traffic stop. The jury was unable to reach a verdict in the murder trial, resulting in a partial victory for Schurr, who may face another trial. The incident, captured on video, showed Lyoya fleeing from Schurr, with the two men scuffling over Schurr's Taser before the fatal shooting. Lyoya's death sparked protests and renewed questions about racial injustice and policing, with the mistrial coming shortly after the acquittal of three officers in the Tyre Nichols case.</p>

The article contends that focusing on judges as personalities shifts the emphasis away from legal principles and precedents. It also suggests that Trump's attacks on judges who rule against his policies delegitimize the court system and risk physical harm against judges. The article acknowledges that judges are influenced by their life experiences and worldviews, but emphasizes the importance of maintaining a focus on the law.</p>

          <p>The Metro D Line in Los Angeles will be closed for 70 days, starting May 17, to facilitate construction on the rail expansion project beneath Wilshire Boulevard.

The changes have shaken the academy, leading to resignations and questioning the school's commitment to academic freedom.

The Center for American Progress estimates that tariffs could cost households an average of $5,200 annually, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income consumers.
