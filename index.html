        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Susan Collins voiced concerns regarding President Trump's intention to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar to be converted into Air Force One, citing potential political espionage, ethical issues, and constitutional problems. Collins emphasized the need for a thorough security sweep to detect any implanted listening devices, which would be time-consuming. She questioned the rationale behind pursuing this option, especially given Boeing's delays in producing a new presidential plane, suggesting that a gift jet is not the appropriate solution. Collins highlighted the frustration with Boeing but maintained that security and ethical considerations should take precedence. </p>

The hackers are demanding a $20 million ransom in exchange for not publicly releasing the stolen information, but Coinbase has refused to pay and is cooperating with law enforcement. Sensitive data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, masked bank account numbers, partial Social Security numbers, government ID images, and account balances, were compromised.

          <p>The FBI issued a warning about "malicious actors" using artificial intelligence to impersonate senior U.S. officials in voice messages, targeting current and former government officials and their contacts. Scammers are sending text messages and AI-generated voice messages, known as smishing and vishing, claiming to be from high-ranking officials to establish rapport and gain access to personal accounts. These bad actors are using malicious links to move conversations to separate messaging platforms, potentially stealing information and targeting other officials or associates.

          <p>Coinbase has confirmed that the SEC is investigating whether the company misstated its user numbers, specifically the "verified users" metric, which it reported as over 100 million.

Coinbase's chief legal officer stated that the company believes the investigation should not continue, as they stopped reporting the metric two and a half years ago and disclosed its potential to overstate unique customers.

          <p>The Trump administration is challenging the guarantee of birthright citizenship enshrined in the 14th Amendment, arguing it does not apply to children of undocumented immigrants. This move has ignited a constitutional debate, with legal experts disagreeing with the administration's assertion. The Supreme Court is reviewing the case, focusing on whether federal judges have the power to block presidential actions through nationwide injunctions. President Trump has long questioned birthright citizenship, claiming it encourages mass immigration and strains resources, while critics argue his stance is rooted in racism and division.</p>

Critics argue that these policies are designed to appeal to a specific political base with nationalist views, rather than a genuine interest in helping all children and families flourish.

          <p>New data indicates that Republican proposals to cut green tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act could raise utility bills and lead to job losses for Americans. The loss of these incentives would increase the price of electricity and gas, negatively impacting household income. A study by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (Ceba) found that at least 19 states would see increased energy costs between 2026 and 2032 if the rollbacks proceed as proposed. New Jersey is expected to experience the biggest economic losses, with households facing an average annual loss of $1,040 in income.</p>

This shift reflects a broader trend within the Republican party towards reducing military involvement in the Middle East and prioritizing US interests.

          <p>Seniors may find value in exploring key insurance policies this spring to enhance their financial protection, especially given economic uncertainties. Medicare supplemental insurance can help cover costs not fully covered by traditional Medicare, while long-term care insurance can provide financial support for nursing homes, assisted living, or in-home care. Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed against and provides a benefit to beneficiaries after death. Acting sooner rather than later can potentially secure more coverage at lower premiums, as prices tend to increase with age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new genetics study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000-30,000 years ago. The study, published in the journal Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The research also found that the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, leading to the foundation of distinct Indigenous groups in South America. The findings provide new insights into the genetic and cultural origins of underrepresented Indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy changes and policy is in flux, citing the potential for more frequent and persistent supply shocks. Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return anytime soon, even with longer-term inflation expectations largely in line with the Fed's 2% target. He cautioned that policy changes could create a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation. The remarks suggest the Fed is prepared to maintain a hawkish stance amid economic uncertainty.</p>

Sir Paul Nurse, who gave evidence, said it was "disturbing" that he did not receive a response to his concerns until July 2020.
