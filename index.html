          <p>The article discusses the difficulties associated with destroying Iran's nuclear program, highlighting the Fordow plant's hardened underground structure which requires specialized bunker-buster bombs only possessed by the U.S. Experts note that even with such weapons, multiple strikes might be needed to ensure complete destruction, potentially requiring ground forces. The article also notes that an American strike could provoke Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region, escalating the conflict. The piece questions whether the Trump administration would limit itself to nuclear sites or pursue broader regime change, a move favored by Israel.</p>

          <p>Iran's UN ambassador, Ali Bahreini, stated that Iran would respond forcefully to Israeli aggression and any U.S. involvement in the hostilities, asserting the country's right to defend its people and territory. Bahreini accused the U.S. of being complicit in Israel's actions and warned against targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, which he described as a war crime against humanity. The comments come amid ongoing strikes between Israel and Iran, leading to thousands fleeing major Iranian cities. Bahreini maintained that Iran's nuclear program is for civilian purposes, despite accusations from Israel and the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate, remaining in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, at its meeting, signaling a cautious approach amid economic uncertainties.

Analysts suggest the Fed is waiting to assess the full impact of President Trump's tariffs on the economy.

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Israeli strikes targeted two centrifuge facilities in Iran, specifically the TESA Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Center. The IAEA stated that one building at the Tehran site, used for manufacturing and testing advanced centrifuge rotors, was hit, while two buildings at Karaj, where different centrifuge components were made, were destroyed. Both sites were previously under IAEA monitoring as part of the Iran nuclear deal, from which President Trump withdrew the U.S. in 2018. Centrifuges are critical for enriching uranium, a key process in nuclear programs.</p>

          <p>As President Trump imposes tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty payments by strategically altering products to fit into lower-tariffed categories. This practice involves changing materials, dimensions, or compositions to meet different harmonized system codes. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and modifying footwear to be categorized as slippers. While legal, this approach faces challenges in heavily regulated sectors requiring extensive validation for even minor changes (not investment advice).</p>

The new law does not alter rules for abortions in clinical settings or prosecutions for those assisting women in obtaining late-term abortions.

          <p>An antitrust lawsuit led by Texas against Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, accusing them of pressuring coal companies to reduce production, may inadvertently undermine President Trumpâ€™s goal to revive the American coal industry. If successful, the lawsuit would force these companies to divest their holdings in coal companies, potentially leading to a loss of nearly $18 billion in capital. Experts argue that factors like abundant natural gas, renewable energy developments, and climate regulations are the primary drivers of coal's decline, not asset managers, making the lawsuit counterproductive.</p>

          <p>The article explores why Russia has not decisively intervened to support Iran amid escalating conflict with Israel, despite their partnership in an anti-Western agenda. Russia's interests in the Middle East are complex, including relations with Israel and OPEC, limiting its willingness to risk military entanglement for Iran. Russia benefits from a protracted war between Iran and Israel, but it also faces risks from a destabilized Iran, including nuclear proliferation. Russia seeks to leverage the conflict to re-enter great-power diplomacy but faces constraints in influencing the situation.</p>

          <p>Francis Collins, former NIH director, discusses the erosion of public trust in science, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, attributing it to evolving recommendations and the spread of misinformation. He acknowledges a naivety in assuming that providing scientific facts would be sufficient to convince people, emphasizing the need for better science communication, listening to concerns, and telling stories rather than relying solely on statistics. Collins suggests a need for scientists to embrace uncertainty and for society to prioritize truth, possibly through a truth and reconciliation commission, to rebuild trust in science.</p>

The Dodgers are aiming for a strong starting rotation by mid-July, contingent on the return of key pitchers from rehabilitation.
