          <p>Edward Spencer, a 19-year-old driver, received a two-year custodial sentence for causing the deaths of three teenagers in a car crash near Shipston-on-Stour in April 2023. Spencer, who had a history of "showing off" while driving, was speeding at 64mph when his Ford Fiesta collided with a Fiat 500. The crash resulted in the deaths of his passengers Harry Purcell, Matilda Seccombe, and Frank Wormald, while the occupants of the Fiat, including two children, sustained severe injuries. The judge cited Spencer's habitual poor driving as a major factor in the "catastrophic" incident, banning him from driving for eight years and recommending an extended retest. </p>

          <p>Brood XIV cicadas are expected to emerge in the eastern United States during the spring of 2025, with concentrations primarily in Kentucky and Tennessee. These periodical cicadas, which emerge every 17 years, will also appear in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, with smaller pockets farther north. The emergence is triggered when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, typically in late April or May in warmer states and May or early June in cooler states. Cicadas remain above ground for approximately 4 to 6 weeks, engaging in mating rituals characterized by loud buzzing sounds.</p>

          <p>Quinn Slobodian argues that the MAGA movement's obsession with IQ, shared by figures like Donald Trump and some in Silicon Valley, poses a threat to a more equitable future. The focus on IQ as a measure of human worth aligns with a belief that intelligence is fixed, undermining efforts to improve educational outcomes through state intervention. This ideology contrasts with the traditional role of the U.S. Department of Education and could lead to the dismantling of programs aimed at promoting equal opportunity. However, Slobodian suggests that the rise of AI may ultimately render IQ less relevant as automation diminishes the value of white-collar jobs.</p>

          <p>Congress has reconvened following a two-week recess, with Republicans aiming to advance President Trump's legislative agenda, including tax cuts, border security, and defense spending. Congressional committees are set to begin work on the budget reconciliation process, which allows Republicans to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold. Democrats are rallying against the GOP's budget plan, warning of potential cuts to Medicaid and other social programs. The timetable for passing the legislation is slipping, with disagreements over spending cuts and the debt limit potentially stalling the process.</p>

This mistrust stems from the former rebels' past affiliation with Al Qaeda and the new government's backing by Turkey, a long-time opponent of Kurdish power in Syria. The biggest challenge for the new rebel government is uniting the disparate armed groups into a unified national army, which is difficult due to the historical conflict between rebels and the Kurds.</p>

          <h2>Driving Becoming a Luxury in Germany Due to Rising Costs</h2>

          <p>In Germany, obtaining a driver's license is becoming increasingly unaffordable, with costs ranging from €2,500 to €3,500 or more. This is largely due to extensive and strictly regulated driving education laws. As a result, more young people are failing their practical driving tests, and calls for reform are growing louder. Proposals include simplifying the theory portion of the training and incorporating driving simulators to make lessons more accessible. However, some remain skeptical about the effectiveness of simulators and the potential for cost reduction.</p>
