          <p>The upcoming jobs report is anticipated to provide insights into the labor market's response to President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement in early April, which caused significant market volatility. Economists predict a slowdown in job growth to 133,000 in April, compared to 228,000 the previous month, following tariff escalations and subsequent suspensions. Recession fears are rising on Wall Street due to the potential disruption of global trade caused by these tariffs. Despite market uncertainty, the labor market has shown resilience with an average of 170,000 jobs added monthly this year and a historically low unemployment rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, defying expectations of a decrease, according to Eurostat data. Core inflation, excluding volatile components, rose to 2.7%, while services inflation increased to 3.9%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that the disinflationary process is nearing completion, although medium-term inflation remains uncertain due to potential tariff retaliation and fiscal shifts. The ECB is closely monitoring data for future interest rate decisions, having recently cut its key rate to 2.25%.</p>

Carney aims to establish a partnership with the U.S. on Canada's terms, addressing issues such as undocumented migration and trade imbalances, while also emphasizing Canada's vital role as a supplier of energy and critical minerals to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Eig, author of "King: A Life," reflects on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail" and its enduring relevance in today's society. Dr. King's message emphasized the power of love to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems, urging Americans to choose mercy over meanness. Eig suggests that Dr. King would call on elected leaders to change unjust policies and might advocate for economic boycotts or rely on clergy to seize the moral high ground. He emphasizes that Dr. King intentionally violated a local court order to demonstrate that American law itself was broken and in need of repair.</p>

          <p>Community kitchens in Gaza are warning that food supplies will run out within days due to the ongoing Israeli blockade, which has prevented essential goods from entering the region for two months.

Aid organizations like Anera are struggling to provide basic food items, and there are growing concerns about mass starvation and potential war crimes.

Economic factors such as gas prices, inflation, and housing affordability also play a role in their support.

Recent trades made by lawmakers around Trump's tariff announcements have raised concerns about potential insider trading, fueling the demand for reform. Lawmakers from both parties are advocating for legislation that would require members of Congress and their spouses to divest from individual stocks, transitioning to blind trusts or mutual funds. While some argue that current disclosure rules are sufficient, proponents believe a ban is necessary to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain public trust.</p>

          <p>Roche has partnered with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand's petrelintide, a next-generation weight loss candidate. Petrelintide is an amylin analog, a nascent form of weight loss treatment that mimics a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to increase satiety, which differs from GLP-1 obesity drugs. The companies will co-develop petrelintide as a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset CT-388. Early clinical data suggests amylin analogs offer comparable weight reduction to GLP-1s with potentially better tolerability and lean muscle preservation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses the exploitation and death of racehorses for sport and entertainment. It argues that despite society's technological advancements, the willingness to sacrifice horses for money and prestige exposes a primitive nature. The author reflects on personal experiences in the racing world and criticizes the industry's claims of improved safety measures, asserting that it's time to evolve away from a sport that subjects horses to misery and untimely death. The author suggests that true progress for the horse is when there is no need for it to die in the starting gate.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is raising concerns about Europe's reliance on US payment giants like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal. As Donald Trump has returned to power, there are mounting concerns across Europe about existing dependencies on the United States, and whether they could become a risk to European security. Christine Lagarde is pushing for greater European independence from US payments companies. Alternatives include the digital euro and the Wero payment system, but these face challenges in adoption and implementation. The ECB's warnings are partly a strategy to promote the idea of a so-called digital euro — a central bank-issued currency that, like cash, carries no credit risk.</p>

Hudson's involvement in shutting down a docuseries, influencing public relations, and even being present at football practices has raised concerns.
