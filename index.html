          <p>The United States and China have agreed to extend their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing the re-imposition of heightened tariffs. This move provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and what the U.S. describes as unfair practices. The extension keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%. While the White House hopes for progress, some U.S. business owners express concern that the delay only prolongs economic uncertainty for their operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif was among five of the broadcaster's staff killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists' tent in Gaza City. The 28-year-old had become a prominent voice reporting on the war from northern Gaza, continuing his work after his father was killed in a separate strike. Israel has alleged Sharif was a Hamas operative but has provided little evidence, a claim rejected by Al Jazeera and media rights groups. His death has drawn strong international condemnation and renewed focus on the dangers faced by journalists covering the conflict.</p>

          <p>A survey by the National Pharmacy Association reveals that approximately 90% of UK pharmacies have seen an increase in shoplifting and aggressive behavior towards staff over the past year. Many pharmacies report feeling that the police response to these incidents is inadequate, forcing them to invest in private security measures like CCTV and panic buttons. The trend aligns with a broader increase in retail theft across the UK, prompting calls for more effective law enforcement and government action. Pharmacy leaders warn that this rise in crime not only endangers staff but also disrupts patient access to essential healthcare.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has announced a significant investment to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, shifting production from the Ford Escape to a new line of more affordable electric vehicles. The company's strategy centers on a midsize electric pickup truck with a target price of $30,000, which is substantially cheaper than most current electric trucks. Ford CEO Jim Farley described the move as a new "Model T" moment, signaling a major bet on the EV market. This investment is driven by a desire to compete globally, particularly with Chinese automakers producing low-cost, high-quality EVs.</p>

Failure to raise more funds could lead to defaults, casting substantial doubt on the carrier's ability to survive over the next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming integrated into K-12 education, with tools like ChatGPT being used by students for everything from exam prep to completing assignments. Teachers are also adopting AI platforms like MagicSchool AI to save time on administrative tasks such as creating lesson plans and grading. While some districts are embracing the technology, others have banned it, creating a divide in AI access for students. The push for AI in schools, supported by the White House and major tech companies, raises complex questions about cheating, educational equity, and how best to prepare students for an AI-driven future.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that Vladimir Putin is preparing for new offensive operations, not a ceasefire, despite a planned peace summit with President Trump. Zelenskyy's warning comes as Russian forces reportedly made a significant advance in eastern Ukraine, threatening to divide key defensive hubs. Citing intelligence, he asserted that Putin intends to use the meeting as a personal victory before continuing military pressure on Ukraine. This diplomatic push from Kyiv aims to solidify international support for Ukraine's non-negotiable terms, including territorial integrity and its ambition to join NATO, ahead of the high-stakes talks.</p>

Gruden's lawsuit alleges the NFL maliciously leaked his private emails, which contained offensive language, to destroy his career and reputation. The emails were sent while Gruden was an ESPN analyst and were discovered during a separate investigation, leading to his resignation in 2021.</p>

The disease is often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, a common ailment in the region, leading to delayed or non-existent treatment for cancer patients. While South Africa reports higher rates, experts believe this is due to better diagnostic capabilities rather than a higher prevalence. Systemic issues like a lack of screening, insufficient healthcare training, and rising smoking rates mean many die without a proper diagnosis, highlighting a critical failure to address non-communicable diseases in the region.</p>

          <h2>UK Job Market Shows Signs of Cooling as Vacancies and Payroll Numbers Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 06:56:02 EDT</div>

          <p>The latest official figures indicate a continued cooling of the UK jobs market, with job vacancies falling by 5.8% to 718,000 between May and July. The number of employees on payrolls also saw a modest drop, falling for the tenth time in the last twelve months, with the hospitality and retail sectors most affected. Despite the slowdown, the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.7%, and average wage growth held at 5%. Economists suggest this points to a gradual cooling rather than a sharp downturn, possibly calming fears about the impact of recent rises in business taxes and the minimum wage.

          <p>The upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska brings focus to the region's history as a former Russian territory. Russia's presence began in the mid-18th century, driven by the lucrative fur trade, and was consolidated by the Russian-American Company. By the mid-19th century, following its defeat in the Crimean War, Russia viewed the remote and costly colony as a liability and sought a buyer. The United States purchased Alaska for $7.2 million in 1867, a deal initially mocked as "Seward's Folly" but later seen as a historic bargain after the discovery of gold and oil.</p>

          <p>Prostate Cancer UK reports that approximately 5,000 men in the UK each year undergo unnecessary treatment for prostate cancers that are unlikely to cause harm. The charity states that for about one in four cases, the cancer is so slow-growing that active monitoring is a safe alternative to surgery or radiotherapy, which can have severe side effects. The organization blames outdated NHS guidelines for the over-treatment and suggests that if more low-risk patients were offered monitoring, it could strengthen the case for a national prostate cancer screening program by reducing the harm of overtreatment.</p>

          <p>An incident involving a 26-year-old woman who allegedly assaulted airline staff on an Ibom Air flight has ignited a debate in Nigeria about inconsistent handling of air rage. The woman was remanded to a maximum-security prison and placed on a no-fly list, while a popular musician who recently disrupted a flight faced no immediate consequences. Critics, including presidential candidate Peter Obi, have condemned what they see as a double standard in enforcement. Nigeria's Aviation Minister also criticized the public sharing of footage of the woman, calling it unacceptable and ordering an investigation into the staff responsible.</p>

The man, Wei Qiang Lin, admitted to wrapping the live eastern box and three-toed box turtles in socks and shipping them in boxes mislabeled as toys. The turtles are protected under an international treaty on endangered species and are highly prized in the foreign pet market. Intercepted by law enforcement, the smuggling operation has led to a guilty plea that could result in up to five years in federal prison.</p>

          <p>A new report from Bankrate details a "subprime tax" that costs Americans with low credit scores an average of $3,400 extra per year. This cost comes from higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, as well as pricier insurance premiums. Over a 30-year period, these additional expenses can accumulate to over $100,000 for a borrower who does not improve their score. The report highlights the significant financial benefit of maintaining a good credit score, which generally increases access to better financing terms and lower borrowing costs for essential products.

          <p>In a trial for a lawsuit filed by California's governor against the Trump administration, a top general testified about the controversial deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman stated he never heard the term "rebellion" used to describe the protests that prompted the deployment, a key justification used by the administration. The lawsuit questions whether the use of military forces to respond to protests violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from domestic law enforcement. The trial is examining the legality and basis for the federalization of the California National Guard.</p>

Trump initiated the summit after a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire passed, and he has described it as a "feel-out meeting" to urge Putin to end the war. There is concern that Trump may propose a deal involving land swaps, a suggestion that has alarmed Kyiv, which insists on its territorial integrity.</p>

This would be the third consecutive year of serious glacier-related flooding for the state capital. A flood a year ago caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, and authorities have installed flood barriers along the Mendenhall River in an attempt to mitigate the impact.</p>

Analysts suggest the juntas, which justified their coups by citing deteriorating security, avoid publicizing military losses to prevent demoralizing troops and the public.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Democrats should resist the impulse to fight Republican gerrymandering with their own aggressive map-drawing. The author contends that this "fight fire with fire" approach is strategically flawed, as Democrats control fewer state legislatures and their voter distribution makes them more vulnerable in a gerrymandering arms race. More importantly, it is a principled error, as it involves using anti-democratic means that violate voting equality, ultimately doing the work of democracy's enemies. Instead, the piece suggests Democrats should focus on winning elections by advancing more attractive policies and mobilizing voters, thereby differentiating themselves from their opponents.</p>
