          <p>Ryan Kingerski, a 26-year-old police officer from Pennsylvania, died by suicide after experiencing debilitating side effects from corrective laser eye surgery. His parents attribute his death to complications like severe headaches, double vision, and visual disturbances following the LASIK procedure in August 2025. They claim their son was not a suitable candidate for the surgery due to thin corneas and are now advocating for greater transparency and accountability within the LASIK industry. The Kingerskis have filed a complaint with the FDA and are connecting with other families who have had similar experiences.</p>

          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is amending the "Building Energy Act" to prioritize energy supply alongside climate protection, potentially weakening previous climate goals. Reiche aims to abolish the operating ban on pre-1991 gas boilers and construct new gas-fired power plants, sparking criticism from energy experts who argue for greater investment in renewable energy sources. Despite concerns, the government has committed â‚¬100 billion of a â‚¬500 billion infrastructure investment program to climate protection, with high expectations placed on Environment Minister Carsten Schneider to drive climate foreign policy.</p>

This outcome highlights the importance of these groups in Romanian politics and their commitment to liberal democracy and Romania's Euro-Atlantic path, despite Hungarian PM Viktor Orban's backing of the anti-Hungarian candidate.</p>

The courts ruled that he misunderstood the workings of Ravec, the body organizing Royal Family protection, and that his decision to step back from royal duties created an exceptional situation. Harry argued that the state should consider his birthright and increased risks, but the courts ultimately sided with the government's assessment that his security would be decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>
