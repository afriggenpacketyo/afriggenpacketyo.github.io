          <p>U.S. military actions in Iran have sparked concerns about potential disruptions to the oil and gas industry, raising the possibility of increased energy prices for consumers. While oil prices initially surged, they later retreated as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil supply. However, ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market, particularly if Israel targets Iran's oil production facilities or if Iranian proxy groups attack facilities in Iraq. A closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though considered unlikely, could lead to a spike to $130 per barrel and significantly reduce global GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline following a missile strike by Iran on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties, boosting hopes for de-escalation. U.S. crude oil futures fell significantly, as did global benchmark Brent crude, reflecting investor optimism. The worst-case scenario for the oil market would be an attempt by Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which a substantial amount of global crude consumption flows. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cautioned Iran against closing the strait, calling it "economic suicide" and urging China to use its influence to prevent such action.

          <p>Following Iran's missile attack on Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, a U.S. official confirmed that no other U.S. bases in the Middle East have been targeted. There are no immediate reports of damage to Al Udeid, though the U.S. is still determining the number of missiles fired by Iran. This update provides a snapshot of the immediate aftermath of the Iranian strike and confirms the extent of the attacks on US military installations in the region.

          <p>The U.S. approach to the Middle East has evolved significantly from the Bush administration's War on Terror to President Trump's strategy regarding Iran. The Bush era involved regime change in Iraq and military intervention, while Trump emphasizes Mideast allies taking responsibility and using decisive force only when necessary to prevent Iranian nuclear proliferation. Trump's approach is seen as a "post-globalist" presidency, focusing on American interests and expecting allies to contribute their fair share. Unlike the long ground war in Iraq, Trump aims for a definable objective: preventing Iranian nuclear proliferation, and is prepared to use decisive force if needed.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering tapping into their home equity this summer should proceed cautiously and strategically to avoid financial pitfalls. Understanding the differences between a home equity loan and a HELOC is crucial, as loans offer a lump sum with a fixed rate, while HELOCs provide a revolving line of credit with variable rates. Shopping around for the best rates and terms is also essential, considering potential rate cuts later in the year. Finally, homeowners should use their equity for financially sound purposes, such as paying off high-interest debt, rather than discretionary spending like vacations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Super Micro Computer experienced a decline after the company announced plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes maturing in 2030. The stock drop is attributed to concerns that the eventual conversion of the notes to equity could dilute existing shareholders' stakes. The company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion. Despite the recent dip, Super Micro shares have seen substantial gains this year due to high demand for Nvidia's AI processors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk is ending its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, ceasing sales of Wegovy on the platform due to concerns about "deceptive marketing" practices. The drugmaker claims that Hims & Hers sold illegitimate versions of Wegovy, potentially endangering patient safety. This decision comes shortly after the companies announced a "long-term collaboration" to improve access to obesity treatment. Novo Nordisk stated that Hims & Hers failed to adhere to laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization, leading to the termination of the partnership.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer suggests that Wall Street's positive reaction to the U.S. bombings in Iran indicates that the country is "not as relevant" to the stock market as it once was. Oil prices initially dipped following the strikes, and the S&P 500 pushed higher, suggesting that the market is less sensitive to Middle East tensions. Cramer attributes this to the rise in U.S. oil production, which has lessened the impact of potential supply shocks. He also points to positive headlines for individual companies as a factor lifting stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

Other possible Iranian actions could involve attacking U.S. military assets across the Middle East, closing the Strait of Hormuz, and conducting asymmetric warfare, including terror and cyber attacks.

          <p>AccuWeather meteorologists forecast a swath of thunderstorms, known as a "ring of fire," to develop around a massive heat dome across the United States this week.

The affected area could extend from north-central Mexico to southeastern Canada and New England. There is a heightened risk of flash flooding in areas where storms repeat, and any thunderstorm can pulse to severe intensity with high winds, frequent lightning strikes, hail, and perhaps a brief tornado.</p>

The rise of terms like "pick-me" and "male-centered woman" reflects concerns about gender, power, and the influence of social media. Critics often focus on individual women rather than the structural forces influencing their behavior. These conversations are facilitated by social media algorithms that favor conflict and polarizing opinions, making it difficult to communicate nuanced ideas about gender and sex.</p>

While military strikes can seem like a quick solution, they can also create problems for future strategies, such as the need for a complete destruction of the targets and the potential for Iran to rebuild in secret. The bombings could also make diplomacy more difficult, as Iran may be less willing to negotiate with the US after the attacks, given Trump's history of withdrawing from agreements.</p>
