          <p>Russia launched a "massive" overnight attack on Kyiv, killing at least 18 people, including four children, and injuring dozens, with an EU office also damaged. European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, strongly condemned the strikes, calling them "terror and barbarism" and urging Russian President Putin to engage in serious peace negotiations. Turkey also offered to facilitate high-level talks between Russia and Ukraine, despite previous rounds failing to secure substantive agreements. This latest escalation, described as the deadliest since the Alaska summit, highlights Russia's continued aggression, prompting the EU to prepare a 19th package of "hard biting sanctions" and advance work on using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's defense and reconstruction.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is touring battleground states to promote a Republican-crafted domestic policy package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by President Trump. The legislation, which passed Congress, includes extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips, and providing billions for border security. However, it also restructures Medicaid and cuts food stamps, leading to nonpartisan estimates of 10 million people losing health coverage and a $3.4 trillion increase in the federal deficit. Trump is now urging Republicans to rebrand the measure as the "Working Class Family Tax Cuts" due to its unpopularity, while Democrats criticize it as a "giveaway to the richest people."</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock fluctuated as the company reported strong quarterly earnings, with sales surging 56% to $46.74 billion, slightly above estimates, and adjusted earnings per share topping projections. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized "tremendous progress" in AI, projecting $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. However, the outlook was clouded by uncertainty surrounding future sales in China, following a Trump administration block on its H20 chip. While a deal to restart sales is pending, management noted a "real possibility" for its advanced Blackwell processor in China, but H20 shipments remain conditional on the geopolitical environment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Mexican senators physically clashed during a heated debate concerning alleged opposition calls for US military intervention against drug cartels. Lawmaker Alejandro Moreno, leader of the opposition PRI party, and Senate President Gerardo Fernandez Norona of the ruling Morena party, were involved in an altercation after Moreno was denied the floor, with Moreno seen pushing and slapping Norona. The brawl erupted following accusations that opposition parties were advocating for US military involvement, a claim they deny. This incident unfolds against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's directive to the Pentagon to use military force against Latin American drug cartels, which Mexico has firmly stated it would not accept, emphasizing the high stakes of the discussion.</p>

The White House maintains Trump exercised lawful authority due to credible accusations of lying in financial documents. This unprecedented case, which names Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the board as defendants, is expected to ultimately reach the Supreme Court, raising concerns about the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) reported a 13% increase in human trafficking investigations in 2024, reaching a record 576 cases, with sexual exploitation cases at a decade high of 364. Many victims are women, young people, and minors, often lured online using the "lover-boy method." Authorities note that weak online safeguards facilitate the exploitation of minors, with over 200 cases involving children and adolescents, including two instances of children being offered for sale online. The BKA also investigated a record number of labor exploitation cases, primarily involving people from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, highlighting the hidden nature of these crimes.</p>

          <p>The UK Department for Transport has announced the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for discounts under a new £650 million grant scheme, aiming to encourage a shift from petrol and diesel cars.

The grants, available for three years, aim to make EV prices competitive with their fossil fuel counterparts. Despite government pledges to ban new petrol/diesel car sales by 2030, high upfront costs and a lack of charging points remain significant barriers for many drivers, who also advocate for incentives for hybrid vehicles.</p>

Harvey's appointment, following her previous role as senior broadcast producer, is seen as a precursor to potential larger changes, including a possible return to a single anchor and a more traditional news format.

          <p>A new power substation and 115-kilovolt transmission line are under construction in the Littlestown area of Pennsylvania, aiming to prevent lengthy outages like the one experienced this summer. Met-Ed, a FirstEnergy company, announced the East Germantown-Germantown Reliability Project is set for completion by March 2026, benefiting approximately 2,300 residents. The project, identified as necessary in 2020 due to an overloaded existing substation and lack of switching capabilities, is part of FirstEnergy's $28 billion "Energize365" initiative to modernize the electric grid. Officials emphasize the new infrastructure will enhance service reliability and support future community growth.</p>

          <p>Florida is deploying 120 robot rabbits in the Everglades as an innovative experiment to lure and control the invasive Burmese python population. These solar-powered robots mimic real rabbits by emitting heat, smell, and natural movements, helping to detect the highly camouflaged snakes that are decimating native wildlife. This effort follows previous, more costly attempts using live rabbits. The $4,000 per robot project, financed by the South Florida Water Management District and University of Florida researchers, uses cameras to alert contractors for python removal. While in its infancy, initial results are promising, with officials confident in the long-term success of this novel approach.</p>

          <p>The US is experiencing a more active flood season, with recent deadly events across several states, raising concerns about the impact of climate change which increases the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation. This comes as the Trump administration proposes significant budget cuts and staffing reductions for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), potentially hindering the nation's ability to forecast and prepare for future floods. Experts warn that hobbling NOAA's research and services, including critical precipitation data and inundation maps, would be a "double whammy" at a time when aging infrastructure is already ill-equipped to handle dramatic water influxes.</p>

          <p>A former USAID worker reflects on navigating deep political and ideological divides with her Trump-supporting family, particularly her mother, who believes disinformation about the agency. The article explores the challenge of maintaining relationships amidst a polarized information environment, where even shared grief over a father's death and a mother's cancer diagnosis couldn't fully bridge differences. The author emphasizes the importance of consistent communication, setting boundaries, holding ground on core principles like love and peace, and practicing active listening. Despite the struggles, the author finds hope in these daily efforts, seeing them as symbolic of the care and commitment needed to strengthen democracy and foster connection in a divided society.</p>

          <p>A major crisis has erupted at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) following Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership, which culminated in the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the subsequent resignations of four senior leaders. The conflict stems from Kennedy's controversial vaccine policies, layoffs, and what critics describe as "radical non-transparency" and "unskilled manipulation of data" for political ends. The FDA's limited approval of new Covid vaccines, which Monarez reportedly refused to endorse, was a final trigger. Public health experts warn this situation is an "existential battle between science and anti-science," risking national health security and eroding public trust in scientific institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the concept of diversity in business, distinguishing between acquired attributes (skills, opinions) and innate attributes (race, gender), and questioning the effectiveness of traditional DEI programs. It highlights research suggesting that cognitive and creative diversity, including ideological differences, are more valuable for innovation and protecting against groupthink than solely demographic diversity. The author notes a growing resistance to political differences in society and offers three pointers for companies to pursue truly useful diversity: avoid demographic proxies, seek individuals with high openness to new ideas, and embrace political diversity to gain market information and avoid errors. Cultivating curiosity is presented as key to achieving this.</p>

The ban, which includes BBC-funded journalists, stems from a disagreement over a story on local government reorganization. Barton justified the move by stating it upholds "responsibility and honesty" and prevents "misinformation" from shaping governance narratives, while the publication's editor called it an "unprecedented ban" and a direct attack on press freedom. Critics, including Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, condemned the decision as "dangerous and chilling," comparing it to tactics used by Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Bankruptcy filings surged by 11.5% in the past year, reflecting widespread financial struggles due to medical emergencies, job losses, and inflation. This article advises individuals considering bankruptcy to ask three critical questions: whether it will truly eliminate their debt (as student loans and recent tax debts are often excluded), if less damaging alternatives like debt consolidation or credit counseling have been explored, and if they can handle the long-term consequences on credit, employment, and housing. Emphasizing bankruptcy as a last resort, the article urges careful consideration and professional advice to build a stable financial future (not investment advice).</p>

Iran's foreign ministry condemned the action as "provocative and unnecessary," vowing an "appropriate response."

His defense argues his actions were exercises of free speech before the national security law took effect. The trial highlights a severe erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong, which now shares a "very serious" media situation label with mainland China.

Despite a strict no-smoking policy within the grounds, New York's legalization of recreational cannabis in 2021 allows legal consumption in adjacent Corona Park, from where the odor drifts.
