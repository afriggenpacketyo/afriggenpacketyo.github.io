          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has designed and built a custom printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), the state's largest employer of blind and low-vision individuals. The student-designed machine can handle materials that commercial braille printers cannot and was created with open hardware, allowing BISM's visually impaired employees to operate it easily. The invention has already been used to produce 400 labels for a charity beer, streamlining a previously manual process.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a cherished Christian girls' camp on the Guadalupe River, became the site of immense tragedy when a flash flood killed at least 27 campers and counselors. For generations, the camp was a place of friendship and adventure, but the pre-dawn deluge on July 4th turned its idyllic setting into a scene of destruction. Survivors describe terrifying moments as the river rose with shocking speed, ripping cabins apart and sweeping away belongings. As the community grieves, questions are being raised about the safety of locating camps so close to the flood-prone river.</p>

          <p>Apple is formally appealing a €500 million fine imposed by the European Commission, which found the company's App Store policies to be anti-competitive. The EU's ruling, the first under its new Digital Markets Act (DMA), stated that Apple illegally restricted developers from informing users about cheaper alternatives outside the App Store. In its appeal, Apple called the fine "unprecedented" and argued that the EU is forcing business terms that are confusing for developers and harmful to users. The company will now present its case to the EU's General Court, setting the stage for a lengthy legal battle.</p>

          <p>The jury in the retrial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon has retired to consider its verdict on charges of manslaughter by gross negligence. The couple is accused of causing the death of their newborn baby, Victoria, who died in a tent on the South Downs in January 2023. The parents, who were already convicted of concealing the birth and perverting the course of justice, claim the baby's death was a tragic accident. The prosecution argued that the baby was exposed to dangerously cold conditions with inadequate clothing, making her death inevitable.</p>

          <p>An autopsy has revealed that Juliana Marins, the 26-year-old Brazilian tourist who fell into Indonesia's Mount Rinjani volcano, died from internal bleeding and fractures caused by blunt force trauma. The report indicates her death occurred within 20 minutes of the second of two falls, which saw her plunge a total of over 600 meters. Her family has criticized the rescue efforts, claiming that delays in reaching her contributed to her death, a charge Indonesian authorities dispute by citing hazardous conditions. Marins' father blamed a lack of infrastructure and "disregard for human life" at the popular tourist destination.</p>

          <p>The opening of a new migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by supporters, has sparked outrage from human rights and environmental advocates. President Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis touted the camp's harsh, remote conditions, while the Florida GOP began selling merchandise mocking the detainees' plight. Critics, including Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost, have condemned the facility as a "hell on earth" where detainees will face extreme heat and hurricane risks. The camp is seen by many as a cruel political stunt that prioritizes performance over humane policy.</p>

The Dodgers, inspired by her work, have installed a similar tile wall in a clubhouse walkway at Dodger Stadium and placed a sign explicitly naming Bennett as the inspiration. While LAX has not officially corrected the record, the Dodgers' tribute offers a satisfying, public acknowledgment of her artistic legacy.</p>

The city of Nagasaki reversed an earlier decision and accepted Taiwan's request to attend its August 9 ceremony. This move is politically sensitive, as Japan, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Last year, Nagasaki controversially excluded Israel from the event, and this year's inclusion of Taiwan is likely to be closely watched by Beijing, which considers the island a breakaway province.</p>

          <p>A critical analysis of the Medicaid work requirement in President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" argues the policy will be ineffective and harmful. The article contends that most eligible adults on Medicaid are already working or unable to, meaning the rule primarily functions as a burdensome reporting requirement. This red tape is projected to cause millions to lose coverage, not for failing to work, but for failing to navigate a complex bureaucratic system. The policy is also expected to be extremely costly for taxpayers, with states spending billions on administrative overhead for little to no effect on employment. (not investment advice)</p>
