          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts detective, was convicted of murdering his wife, Amy Fanion, after an investigation revealed inconsistencies in his account and suspicious internet searches. The searches included inquiries about household poisons, overdoses, and, notably, "gsr testing" (gunshot residue testing) just days before Amy's death. Prosecutors argued these searches indicated premeditation, while the defense suggested alternative explanations, including concerns about household hazards for a visiting niece. Fanion maintains his wife died by suicide, but the jury found him guilty.</p>
