        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has initiated an antitrust probe into German software giant SAP over concerns regarding its software support services. The investigation will focus on whether SAP distorted competition in the maintenance and support market for its on-premise Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. SAP has stated its belief that its practices comply with EU rules but is cooperating with the commission. The probe is notable as it targets a major European company, contrasting with the EU's more frequent antitrust actions against U.S. Big Tech firms.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Guardians have made baseball history by overcoming a 15.5-game deficit to take sole possession of first place in the American League Central. Their 5-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers marks the largest comeback to take a division or league lead since MLB switched to a divisional format in 1969. The team's remarkable turnaround has been fueled by an 18-5 record in September and a starting pitching rotation that has allowed two or fewer runs in 19 consecutive games. With a one-game lead and the tiebreaker over Detroit, Cleveland's playoff chances have surged dramatically.</p>

          <p>Following the suicide of her 15-year-old daughter, Tilly, who endured severe cyberbullying, an Australian mother is calling for global social media reform. Speaking at a United Nations event, Emma Mason advocated for banning social media access for children under 16 and holding tech companies financially accountable for the harm facilitated on their platforms. She detailed how a fake nude photo of her daughter circulated on Snapchat, leading to relentless bullying and Tilly's deteriorating mental health. The call to action urges a global standard for age verification to protect vulnerable young users from online predators and harmful content.</p>

The study, conducted by economists at Arizona State University, found that the U.S. Latino GDP grew by 50% from 2015 to 2023, driven by increased education and entrepreneurship. The report also highlights the growing share of Latino consumer spending in the American economy, while warning that mass deportations could significantly undermine this economic progress and lead to a broader GDP decline.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Paris court has sentenced former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to five years in jail after finding him guilty of criminal conspiracy related to illicit campaign financing. The case involved accusations that his 2007 election campaign received millions of euros from the regime of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. While acquitted of other charges like passive corruption, the judge ruled Sarkozy allowed aides to seek financial support from Libyan officials. The sentence is a significant legal blow, marking the first time a former French president could face actual prison time for such an offense.</p>

          <p>Danish officials have stated that recent drone incursions that disrupted several airports, including in Aalborg and Billund, appear to be a "systematic operation" conducted by a "professional actor." While the defense minister described the incidents as a form of "hybrid attack," he noted there was no direct evidence of Russian involvement, despite heightened regional tensions. The drones, which pose a collision risk to aircraft, forced temporary airport shutdowns and flight diversions. The incidents have affected both civilian and military air traffic, prompting a police investigation to identify the operators of the locally launched devices.</p>

The plan also encourages councils to use existing powers to purchase derelict shops and block the opening of unwanted betting and vape shops. The government says the program is designed to put power directly into the hands of local people to restore pride in their neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>According to a recent study, 47% of Americans do not have a written financial plan, a step that experts say is crucial for effective retirement preparation. Financial advisors recommend that individuals seeking professional help should interview multiple candidates to find a good personal and professional fit. Key steps include conducting background checks through regulatory bodies like FINRA, asking direct questions about an advisor's experience and compensation structure, and ensuring they hold relevant credentials like the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation. The goal is to find a long-term financial partner who understands one's specific circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why American voters seem increasingly unfazed by political corruption scandals, particularly those surrounding Donald Trump and his associates. Using recent bribery allegations against former border czar Tom Homan as an example, the analysis suggests Trump has shattered the effectiveness of public shaming as a political deterrent. While polls show Americans are concerned about corruption, Trump's ability to withstand scandals without consequence has created a sense of resignation among opponents. This dynamic has allowed a perceived culture of corruption to persist without the electoral backlash seen in other political contexts.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Labour government grapples with the rising popularity of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, it is looking to international counterparts for effective strategies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is framing the political choice as one between Labour's unity and Reform's division, but the party is still refining its approach. Political strategists are examining how center-left governments in countries like Australia and Denmark have handled populist challenges, particularly on immigration and economic fairness. The challenge involves undermining Reform's credibility without appearing out of touch with the voter concerns that are fueling its ascent.</p>

With JLR's factories shut down until at least October, there are growing fears that smaller suppliers who rely heavily on the company could face bankruptcy. One potential measure being considered is for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts from these firms to ensure their financial viability until JLR's operations can resume.

          <p>The estate of Ta'Kiya Young, a 21-year-old pregnant Black woman fatally shot by police in 2023, has filed a federal lawsuit against the Blendon Township police chief and the township. The suit alleges that Officer Connor M. Grubb, who is facing murder charges, was improperly trained and supervised, and that he and another officer recklessly escalated their response to a minor shoplifting suspicion. Young was in her car in a grocery store parking lot when Grubb shot her through the windshield as the vehicle moved toward him; both she and her unborn daughter died.</p>

          <p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has stated that high U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods represent a "major challenge" for the country's exporters and are likely to dampen overall economic activity. After failing to secure a trade deal, Switzerland faces a 39% U.S. tariff rate, which is expected to particularly harm its machinery and watchmaking industries. Consequently, the SNB has downgraded its economic growth forecast for 2026 to just under 1%, though it does not anticipate a recession. The central bank held its key interest rate at 0% to help support the economy amid these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to make phones more usable for actual communication, Apple has introduced new features in iOS 26 to combat the deluge of spam. A new, opt-in AI-powered feature allows Siri to screen calls from unknown numbers, transcribing the caller's reason for calling in real-time so the user can decide whether to answer. The update also includes enhanced, multi-layered filtering for text messages, automatically sorting messages from unknown senders and suspected spam into separate folders. These tools represent a more aggressive approach by tech companies to reclaim communication channels from the control of scammers and robocallers.</p>

          <p>In a groundbreaking legal ruling, a Spanish court has convicted a man for animal abuse by applying a gender violence law. The man was found guilty of throwing a four-month-old puppy he co-owned with his partner off a cliff, an act the court recognized as "vicarious violence." The judge ruled that the man intentionally killed the animal as a means to inflict psychological damage on his partner. This is the first time Spain's legislation against vicarious violence, typically used in cases where children are harmed to hurt their mother, has been applied to a case of animal cruelty.</p>

          <p>A landmark survey of university students in England has revealed widespread experiences of sexual misconduct, with thousands of respondents reporting they were victims. The Office for Students (OfS) found that 14% of respondents reported experiencing sexual violence, including sexual assault and unwanted touching, while one in four reported being sexually harassed. The data indicates that women and lesbian, gay, and bisexual students are disproportionately affected. The findings confirm long-held concerns by campaigners and are intended to provide universities with stronger data to prevent misconduct and improve support for students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the widespread panic about an academic integrity crisis, new research suggests that generative AI has not necessarily increased the overall rate of student cheating. Instead, AI tools like ChatGPT appear to have captured a market share from pre-existing methods of academic dishonesty, such as copying from websites or using essay mills. Studies show that the percentage of students engaging in cheating behaviors has remained relatively stable before and after the release of ChatGPT. The analysis calls for a more nuanced conversation about why students cheat and how educational institutions should adapt to a world where AI is ubiquitous.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to improve its pricing transparency for consumers. The probe was launched after fan complaints about the sale of tickets for Oasis's reunion tour, where a tiered pricing system led to confusion and unexpectedly high costs. Ticketmaster will now have to provide more advance information about pricing structures and better clarity during online queues. The CMA stated it found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing" in the Oasis sale but emphasized that the new commitments will help fans make more informed purchasing decisions.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is strategically using soccer to connect with voters and advance his progressive platform. He recently launched a petition challenging FIFA's dynamic pricing model for the 2026 World Cup, demanding affordable tickets for local residents, which aligns with his campaign's central theme of affordability. This move is seen as a shrewd way to engage a younger, progressive-leaning demographic that has been largely ignored by Democratic leaders in recent years. By framing a popular sport through the lens of economic fairness, Mamdani is pioneering a new approach to political outreach on the left.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility is contextualized within a broader pattern of increased violence and heated political rhetoric surrounding U.S. immigration enforcement. The incident, which the FBI is investigating as "targeted violence," follows several other attacks on immigration facilities in Texas this year. The Trump administration has framed this violence as the work of "radical left terrorists," a narrative that intensifies the image of ICE being under siege. Conversely, critics and immigrant advocates point to the aggressive and sometimes violent tactics employed by ICE agents as a contributing factor to the volatile atmosphere.</p>
