          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is attempting to shield the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" from the ongoing public dispute between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Musk has voiced strong criticism of the bill, prompting a response from Trump, creating a challenge for Johnson who once enjoyed a close relationship with Musk. Despite the conflict, Johnson insists his focus remains on advancing the legislative agenda and passing the bill, downplaying the significance of the online feud. Some Republicans are concerned about Musk's influence on the bill's passage, while others urge unity and an end to the public spat.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has overridden California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority by assuming federal control of the state's National Guard troops in response to immigration-related unrest in Los Angeles. This rare move allows Trump to directly command the California National Guard, bypassing typical state oversight. Newsom has criticized the decision as inflammatory and warned it could escalate tensions, accusing the federal government of seeking a spectacle. Legal experts note this marks the first time in decades a president has activated a state's National Guard without the governor's request, raising concerns about the use of the military to suppress dissent.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles following Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to clashes between authorities and demonstrators. President Trump ordered the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles County after protests broke out in Paramount and Compton. The protests began after ICE officers executed search warrants at multiple locations, including a clothing warehouse, leading to arrests and tense confrontations. Advocates for immigrants' rights reported detentions outside Home Depot and Dale's Donuts stores, while local officials urged peaceful demonstrations amid fears within the community.</p>

          <p>Bernie Sanders has cautioned about the US's slide into authoritarianism after Donald Trump deployed the national guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. Sanders criticized Trump's actions, including attacks on universities and the media, as signs of disregard for the constitution and the rule of law. He urged Republicans in Congress to stand up for the constitution and resist Trump's power grabs. Trump's deployment of the national guard marks the first time a US president wielded such power since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.</p>
