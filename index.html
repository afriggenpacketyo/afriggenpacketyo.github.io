          <p>Actor Richard Dreyfuss, 77, announced he would not be attending the SharkCon fan event in Tampa, Florida, due to a severe case of viral bronchitis. In a video message, the "Jaws" star explained that his doctors advised him against flying to prevent his illness from worsening and to avoid spreading it to others. Dreyfuss expressed his regret to fans, stating that his health must come first, and promised to attend a future event. The convention confirmed that all pre-paid photo ops and autographs with the actor would be automatically refunded.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to significantly increase France's defense budget, citing unprecedented threats to freedom since 1945. The annual defense spending is now set to reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal previously slated for 2030 and double the amount from when Macron took office in 2017. Macron justified the accelerated spending by pointing to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and growing uncertainty from the United States. He emphasized that to be free, France must be powerful and feared on the global stage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small, 12-meter aircraft crashed at London Southend Airport, erupting into a large fireball upon impact. Eyewitnesses, including a family who had just waved to the pilots, described the plane banking unusually hard after takeoff before inverting and hitting the ground. Emergency services responded to the scene, and the airport confirmed a "serious incident," leading to the cancellation of all four scheduled flights for the evening. There have been no immediate reports on the number of occupants or their condition, and an investigation is underway.</p>

          <p>The latest "Superman" film, written and directed by James Gunn, launched with an estimated $122 million in ticket sales across the U.S. and Canada. This opening marks a crucial test for DC Studios, which has recently seen several of its superhero films underperform. The debut is the third largest of 2025 and the first DC title to surpass the $100 million opening weekend mark since 2017's "Wonder Woman." While the domestic performance was strong, international ticket sales were weaker, with the film earning $95 million from 78 markets.</p>

          <p>Italy's Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon title, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a four-set final. The victory marks a significant comeback for the world number one, who had lost a five-set match to Alcaraz at the French Open just a month prior after holding championship points. Sinner's composed performance on Centre Court ended Alcaraz's 24-match winning streak and secured his fourth career Grand Slam title. The match is being hailed as another classic installment in the growing rivalry between the two young stars of men's tennis.</p>

Though praised by some for his personal austerity, his presidency was dogged by corruption scandals, accusations of factionalism, and undisclosed health problems that led to long absences abroad.

          <p>A section of Interstate 10 in East El Paso was shut down on Sunday morning after a pedestrian was discovered on the highway near the Yarbrough Drive exit. Police responded to a call about a "traffic hazard" and the individual was transported to a hospital. The extent of the person's injuries and the reason they were on the freeway have not been disclosed. The closure of the eastbound lanes caused significant traffic backups. This particular stretch of I-10 has previously been the location of suicide attempts involving individuals walking into traffic.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," has become a prominent defender of the administration's mass deportation policies. During a weekend media tour, he confronted a heckler at a conservative conference and clarified previous remarks about immigration enforcement tactics. Homan walked back a statement that suggested ICE agents could question people based solely on physical appearance, stating that it cannot be the only factor for suspicion. He also acknowledged that U.S. citizens have been caught up in raids as "collateral arrests," as he continues to defend the administration's hardline immigration enforcement actions.</p>

Their families stated that settlers blocked medics from reaching Musallet for hours before he died. The U.S. State Department is aware of the death of an American citizen, and the Israel Defense Forces has launched a joint investigation into the incident, which it described as a "violent confrontation."</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Goodyear, Arizona, is in a dispute with his homeowners association (HOA) for placing a cooler of free bottled water outside his home for neighbors and delivery drivers. David Martin began receiving fines, escalating to $100, from his HOA, which stated its rules do not permit advertising water distribution from a cooler visible from neighboring properties. In response, Martin organized a successful petition to recall board members, though the HOA voided the results, citing procedural issues. The case highlights conflicts between community rules and compassionate actions during dangerous heatwaves.</p>

          <p>An Iranian state news agency, close to the Revolutionary Guard, has reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained minor leg injuries during an Israeli airstrike on June 16. The report claims that bombs targeted a secret underground facility in Tehran where Pezeshkian was in a meeting of the Supreme National Security Council. The strikes allegedly blocked all exits, and the president escaped through an emergency shaft. This information has not been independently verified, and Israel has not commented on the claim, which comes amid heightened tensions and a 12-day war between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that were scheduled to take effect, hoping to negotiate a trade deal with the Trump administration by August 1. The decision came after President Trump threatened to impose new 30% tariffs on EU goods, escalating trade tensions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will continue preparing countermeasures in case a deal is not reached. The move provides a brief window to de-escalate a trade dispute that could impact trillions of dollars in transatlantic commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's focus on deporting "the worst of the worst," government data reveals that the majority of immigrants currently detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. An analysis of recent ICE statistics shows that over 71% of the nearly 58,000 people in detention have no criminal record. Of those who do, a small fraction have been convicted of high-level violent crimes. This reality contrasts sharply with the administration's rhetoric, which often highlights violent acts committed by individuals to justify its large-scale deportation agenda and increased ICE arrests.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem clarified that President Trump intends to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), rather than eliminate it entirely. Speaking amid criticism of the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, Noem stated the president believes FEMA should be redeployed in a new way to better support states. Her comments appear to soften the administration's previous rhetoric, which included threats to phase out the agency. Critics argue that FEMA's capacity has already been eroded under Trump, with thousands of staff departures and cuts to grant programs.</p>

The meeting comes as the U.S. escalates its response to Russia's ongoing war, with bipartisan senators also pushing for heavy sanctions against Russia's economy. The strategy allows for faster delivery of military aid to Ukraine by using existing stockpiles in Europe. The discussions signify a potential turning point in the West's support for Ukraine, combining new military aid strategies with increased economic pressure on Moscow.</p>

He argued that a consistent strategy across all countries is necessary to prevent transshipping and achieve the goal of onshoring production. The defense comes as Trump threatens new tariffs on multiple trading partners, including the European Union and Mexico, in an effort to renegotiate trade deals. (not investment advice)</p>
