          <p>Bath & Body Works has named Daniel Heaf as its new CEO, succeeding Gina Boswell, effective immediately. Heaf previously held the role of chief strategy and transformation officer at Nike and brings experience from Nike Direct and Burberry's digital transformation. Boswell's departure follows a leave of absence for surgery, and Heaf's appointment signals a push for growth, particularly with younger demographics and international expansion. In conjunction with the announcement, Bath & Body Works preannounced strong first-quarter results, exceeding revenue and profit estimates, and reaffirmed its full-year guidance, assuming a 10% tariff on goods from China.</p>

Simion, who supports Donald Trump and Viktor Orban, would have led Romania on an isolationist path. Dan has announced plans to form a government with democratic parties and has received congratulations from international leaders, including the presidents of Moldova and Ukraine.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support following his recent diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. The diagnosis was made after Biden reported urinary symptoms, leading doctors to discover a nodule on his prostate. He received well wishes from figures across the political spectrum, including President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama, and Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as a private letter from King Charles.

The election results highlight the rise of hard-right parties in Western Europe, with Chega capitalizing on anti-immigration sentiment and economic resentments.

          <p>Israel has made a U-turn on aid to Gaza, allowing a few trucks of food to enter after a two-month blockade, while also equivocating over its battlefield strategy. This reflects disagreements within the Israeli leadership about national priorities, balancing pressure from right-wing allies against foreign allies concerned about famine. The delay in a major ground offensive also stems from internal divisions, with far-right ministers pushing for re-occupation and top generals expressing doubts about its sustainability. These actions are viewed in the context of negotiations for a new cease-fire and hostage deal, with Israel seeking to pressure Hamas to compromise.</p>

Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating due to the ballooning budget deficit and rising interest payments on the debt.

          <p>President Trump held calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to push for a ceasefire in Ukraine. In a post on Truth Social, the president said the subjects of the call would be stopping the bloodbath and trade. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said a direct conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin could help break this log jam. The talks in Istanbul broke up after less than two hours, although both sides did agree to each exchange 1,000 prisoners of war, according to official delegations.</p>

          <p>A new "reset" deal between the UK and the EU aims to deepen ties and boost economic growth by dismantling some trade barriers erected post-Brexit. The agreement reduces red tape and checks for those producing and selling foodstuffs between Britain and the EU, particularly through sanitary and phytosanitary standards. While the government claims this agreement will be worth Â£8.9bn to the UK by 2040, it would only recoup a small fraction of the GDP foregone as a result of Brexit. The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years, which will disappoint some fishing communities.</p>

Service members who do not self-identify will face a health check-up that could lead to their removal from the military.

The tariffs have unleashed anxiety in Windsor, where many parts makers are small businesses without the financial cushion to withstand the blow. Estimates suggest that upward of 12,000 parts workers have been laid off due to the tariffs, while complexities in the U.S. trade rules are making it difficult for some U.S. firms to buy from Canadian suppliers. Despite the challenges, some firms are still planning upgrades, but workers fear more jobs will move across the border.</p>
