          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 08:55:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Restaurant chain Cava has revised its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth downward, from a range of 6-8% to 4-6%, following a disappointing second quarter. While the company's net sales grew due to new openings, same-store sales only increased by 2.1%, far below Wall Street's 6.1% projection. This slowdown is attributed to the anniversary of a successful product launch last year, a trend also affecting competitors like Chipotle. Cava's stock plummeted over 20% in premarket trading following the announcement, reflecting investor concern despite the company maintaining other financial projections. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Supreme Court order in New Delhi mandating the relocation of all stray dogs to shelters within two months has sparked outrage among animal rights activists. The directive aims to address a rise in dog bites and rabies cases, but critics argue it is impractical and inhumane, given the city's estimated 800,000 to 1 million strays and limited shelter capacity. Activists contend that the established method of sterilization and vaccination is more effective for population control and public health. They warn that removing sterilized dogs creates a vacuum for unvaccinated animals to enter, potentially worsening the problem.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a list of 11 individuals to succeed Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve Chair. Among the candidates are newly named figures like Jefferies' David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, alongside previously mentioned names such as Fed governors and former officials. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is said to be leading a "deliberate process" to interview all candidates and present a final list to the president. The extensive list and thorough process suggest a decision is not imminent, potentially delaying the appointment and its impact on monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lawyers for California are challenging the legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, arguing it violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The state contends the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement created "anxiety and fear" and was an illegal use of power, seeking an injunction to limit their activities. The federal government maintains the deployment was legal under Title 10 to protect federal property and personnel during protests. The trial has scrutinized the president's authority to declare a "rebellion" and whether this creates an exception to laws restricting military use on domestic soil.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to the Cotswolds in the U.K. was met with a protest organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, dubbed a "Vance not welcome party." Local residents displayed signs with messages like "Bullies not welcome here" and used humor to mock the official, protesting what they see as the administration's controversial positions on international conflicts. The protest organizers stated that locals felt strongly about exercising their freedom of speech against a politician they do not welcome in their community. The event, attended by about 80 people, gained significant attention on social media.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated a strategic shift in ceasefire negotiations, now prioritizing a single, comprehensive deal to release all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. This moves away from the previous phased approach, which involved a 60-day truce for a partial release. While a Hamas delegation is in Cairo for talks, regional mediators reportedly see a window of opportunity for a new framework involving a complete hostage exchange for an end to the war. However, significant obstacles remain, as Israel insists on Hamas relinquishing control of Gaza, a condition Hamas is unlikely to accept.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the West misinterprets China's rise in green technology, labeling it "China Shock 2.0," when it should be seen as a constructive force. The authors contend that unlike past manufacturing disruptions, China's leadership in sectors like electric vehicles and solar power is building new global industries. China is effectively underwriting the world's green transition by dramatically driving down costs, such as halving the price of solar panels in just one year. The piece suggests that instead of reflexive protectionism, other nations should focus on investment to keep pace with this transformative shift.</p>

In 1955, she was turned into a plastic doll that was popular as a gag gift for men.

This phenomenon, exacerbated by a warming climate that is shrinking glaciers, has prompted officials to issue urgent evacuation warnings and install temporary barriers to protect hundreds of homes.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances has announced a major $3 billion, five-year investment to expand its U.S. operations, which will involve reshoring some production from China and Mexico. The plan is expected to create over 1,000 jobs across plants in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and South Carolina. As part of the shift, production of certain gas ranges will move from Mexico to Georgia, while several refrigerator models and clothes washers currently made in China will be manufactured in Alabama and Kentucky, respectively. The company cited its long-term strategy of manufacturing closer to customers as the primary driver for the investment.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark antitrust ruling that found Google illegally monopolized the search market, AI startup Perplexity has made a $34.5 billion offer to buy the Chrome browser. The U.S. Department of Justice has proposed that Google be forced to sell Chrome as a remedy for its anti-competitive practices. Losing Chrome would be a major blow to Google, as the browser is a critical gateway for data collection that fuels its dominant advertising business. While other companies like OpenAI and Yahoo have expressed interest, Perplexity's unsolicited bid marks the first formal offer in a developing situation.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes U.S.-Russia summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that there is currently "no sign" that Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing to end the war. Speaking before his own meetings with European leaders, Zelenskyy urged Ukraine's partners to learn from past experience and "prevent deception by Russia." He emphasized that a united front and coordinated pressure from Ukraine, the U.S., and Europe are necessary to compel Russia to seek a just peace. His remarks underscore Kyiv's deep skepticism about the prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough during the upcoming talks.</p>

          <p>GPU cloud provider CoreWeave reported strong second-quarter revenue of $1.21 billion, beating analyst expectations, yet its stock fell approximately 10% in pre-market trading. The company's management noted that demand for its services continues to exceed its capacity, with data-center bottlenecks limiting growth. Investor concern appears focused on profitability, as the company's operating margin fell sharply due to increased stock-based compensation costs. Despite raising its guidance for the next quarter and full year, the market's reaction suggests investors are closely watching the company's ability to manage costs and scale capacity effectively.

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of ancient whale, named Janjucetus dullardi, from a well-preserved 26-million-year-old skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast in Australia. The dolphin-sized creature was a distant relative of modern baleen whales but was a "fearsome predator" with a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth. The fossil was discovered by a local resident, Ross Dullard, for whom the species was named. This discovery adds to the understanding of early whale evolution, highlighting a period when this region was a cradle for some of the most unusual whales in history.</p>

          <p>The revival of the animated series "King of the Hill" is reviewed as presenting a comforting but perhaps unrealistic vision of American suburban life. The show's focus on close-knit neighborly relations and strong social ties feels idealistic in an era of increasing social and political fragmentation. The article argues that by largely avoiding today's divisive culture wars, the show offers a "rosy coexistence" that now seems like a fantasy. While this gentle approach is appealing, it glosses over the real-world tensions that have reshaped many American communities since the show's original run.</p>

          <p>A spending law proposed by the Trump administration includes the largest cut in history to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), raising concerns about its impact on both families and grocery stores. The article explores how reductions to the nation's primary food safety net could affect food security for millions of low-income households. It also highlights the potential downstream consequences for independent grocery stores, particularly those in low-income areas, which often rely on SNAP purchases for a significant portion of their revenue. The proposed cuts could therefore threaten the viability of these essential community businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cricket Australia's CEO, Todd Greenberg, has issued a stark warning that the current, dense calendar for traditional Test cricket is financially unsustainable and could bankrupt some participating nations. He advocated for a "quality over quantity" approach, suggesting that "scarcity in Test cricket is our friend, not our foe." Greenberg's comments support the idea of slimming down the schedule and questioning whether every nation needs to aspire to play the longest format of the game. This comes as the International Cricket Council (ICC) has formed a working group to discuss the future of the Test format.</p>

The company issued an apology, stating the situation went against its philosophy and that its preparations were inadequate.

TikTok stated it has a "zero-tolerance approach to content promoting human smuggling" and works with law enforcement to disrupt such activities.
