          <h2>Bitcoin Experiences Sharp Decline Amid Global Market Turmoil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 05:13:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price plummeted below $80,000 amidst investor concerns over global financial market volatility spurred by President Trump's restrictive global tariffs. The cryptocurrency experienced a 4% drop, settling at $76,221, with liquidations exceeding $247 million in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass. This decline mirrors broader market downturns, where global stocks lost $7.46 trillion in value following the tariff announcements, and is expected to continue as global recession fears overshadow regulatory tailwinds. Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered suggests that Bitcoin may serve as a hedge against tariff risks as U.S. isolationism increases the risks of holding fiat currency.

          <p>Overseas financial markets experienced a significant downturn, with U.S. stock futures also facing renewed selling pressure due to investor anxieties about the economic repercussions of the Trump administration's recent tariff measures. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell by 7.8%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng plunged by 13.2%, and the Shanghai Composite index decreased by 7.3%. These declines follow President Trump's announcement of a minimum 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and retaliatory tariffs from China, raising concerns about a potential global trade war and its impact on economic growth. Some economists anticipate the Trump administration will eventually ease tariffs, leading to a market rebound, while others warn of further economic damage if tariffs continue to escalate.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is set to hold a final hearing on a major NCAA settlement that could drastically alter the landscape of college athletics. The settlement, known as House vs. NCAA, proposes revenue sharing with student-athletes, roster limits instead of scholarship limits, and a third-party clearinghouse for marketing deals. This agreement would allow schools to directly pay athletes, a significant departure from the tradition of amateurism, with a salary cap starting around $20.5 million. However, the settlement faces objections from current students who may lose roster spots due to the new limits, as well as legal challenges regarding antitrust laws.</p>

          <p>American business owners are facing difficult decisions as President Trump's tariffs on imports increase, leading to concerns about survival and potential closures. Many shop owners are feeling the pinch as they shoulder the costs of tariffs, which are eating into profit margins and forcing them to consider raising prices or scaling back operations. While the Trump administration argues that tariffs will boost American manufacturing, business owners note that domestic manufacturing is often significantly more expensive and relies on imported raw materials. Small-business owners express frustration over the loss of control and the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the tariffs on consumer spending.</p>

A consortium of Chinese companies will provide 40% of the funding for the US$5.3 billion project, operating the railway and charging toll fees to recoup their investment. The Export-Import Bank of China is expected to provide 30% of the funding as loans, with the Kenyan government financing the remaining 30%. This plan involves negotiating a loan deal with a grace period until after 2029, when Kenya expects to have paid off most of the loan for the current SGR.</p>

          <p>UAW President Shawn Fain expresses support for President Trump's tariffs on the U.S. auto industry, despite disagreeing with many of Trump's stances on union labor. Fain argues that these tariffs address a historic wrong by incentivizing domestic manufacturing, which has declined significantly since the inception of NAFTA. He dismisses concerns about the stock market's decline and acknowledges that tariffs may raise prices for consumers, but views them as a necessary measure to eliminate the race to the bottom driven by cheap labor. Fain insists that the auto industry can adjust to the suddenness of Trump's move and put laid-off workers back to work in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new report from the World Health Organisation (WHO) reveals that a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare, with 260,000 maternal deaths recorded in 2023. The WHO warns that the global target to reduce maternal deaths by 2030 will be missed by a significant margin. Leading health organizations are expressing concern that cuts to international aid by the US and UK will risk reversing progress made in reducing maternal deaths. The report highlights the disparities between high- and low-income countries, with sub-Saharan Africa and India suffering the highest death rates.</p>

          <p>China is calling for national unity and resilience in the face of escalating trade tensions with the Trump administration. The People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, published a commentary explaining the government's decision to retaliate against U.S. tariffs. The country plans to focus on its domestic situation to turn challenges from the White House's measures into a strategic opportunity. The Chinese authorities announced tit-for-tat tariffs on imported American goods, prompting concerns about further return fire from Washington.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a relaxation of electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry in response to recent tariffs from the US. While the ban on producing new petrol and diesel cars will still come into effect in 2030, manufacturers will now have more flexibility on annual targets and lower fines. The government says it has worked with UK car manufacturers to "strengthen its commitment to the phase out" while introducing "practical reforms to support industry meet this ambition". Some hybrid vehicles will be able to stay on the market until 2035.</p>

          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant downturn, described as a "bloodbath," as shockwaves from President Trump's tariffs continue to reverberate around the world. Major indexes from Shanghai to Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong plunged, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan falling by 7.8%. The declines are attributed to fears that a global trade war could trigger a slowdown or even a recession in the world's biggest economy. Asian countries, heavily reliant on exports, are particularly sensitive to the impact of tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that the Japanese yen and Swiss franc are top hedges against Trump's tariffs, as investors seek safe haven assets amid economic uncertainty. The yen is considered a strong candidate due to its cheapness, the likely decline in U.S. interest rates, and Japan's lower reliance on trade. The Swiss franc is also seen as a good option. Bonds and gold are also attracting investors as they look to mitigate risk. However, some analysts caution that gold prices may be stretched on the upside.</p>

          <p>The sharp fall in stock markets across the world is raising concerns about a potential stock market "crash" following the US imposition of sweeping tariffs. While not yet meeting the definition of a crash, the declines are the biggest and quickest seen since the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020. A decline of 20% from a peak is considered a "bear market," and the US stock market is approaching that threshold. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs and their potential impact on the global economy is driving the market volatility.</p>
