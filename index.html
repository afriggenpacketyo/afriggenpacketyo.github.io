          <p>Iowa Republican Representative Randy Feenstra has announced his candidacy for governor, setting up a potentially contentious primary race as Governor Kim Reynolds will not seek reelection. The open contest has also drawn interest from Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, who is rumored to be President Trump's preferred candidate. On the Democratic side, Iowa State Auditor Rob Sand has also entered the race, seeking to break the GOP's winning streak in the state, which has not elected a Democratic governor since 2006. Other potential Republican candidates include state senator Mike Bousselot, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, state representative Bobby Kaufmann, and Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, has been released following successful negotiations between the U.S. and the terrorist organization. The International Committee of the Red Cross facilitated Alexander's transfer from Gaza to Israeli authorities, allowing him to speak with his mother and receive medical assessment at Re’im Military Base. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu credited Alexander's release to military and political pressure exerted by President Trump, while Trump hailed it as a step towards ending the conflict. Alexander was the last living American hostage held by Hamas, though the terror group is believed to also be holding the bodies of four dead American hostages, according to U.S. officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent trade deals with China and the United Kingdom, a Yale Budget Lab report indicates that the U.S. average effective tariff rate remains at 17.8%, the highest since 1934. This is equivalent to a 15.4 percentage point increase from the average effective tariff rate before Trump's second term, with current policies estimated to cost the average household $2,800 in the short run. The reduction in tariffs is primarily attributed to lower rates on Chinese imports, as the U.S.-U.K. trade deal has minimal effects on average tariff rates. Economists anticipate that businesses and consumers will adjust their purchasing behavior to mitigate the higher costs associated with tariffs.</p>

          <p>Following a US-brokered ceasefire with Pakistan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to respond strongly to any future "terrorist attack" against India. Modi stated that "this is not an era of war, but this is also not an era of terror," emphasizing peaceful negotiations for water issues while asserting that "terror and trade talks cannot happen together." Top military officials from both countries discussed troop reduction from the borders and reopening airports for civilians. The recent tensions, triggered by a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, led to military exchanges and claims of victory from both sides.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts reached a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Trump's trade policies, including 10% across-the-board tariffs on imports.

          <p>President Trump's mass-deportation campaign is facing eroding public support as attention shifts from border control to ICE enforcement within U.S. communities. The Atlantic article notes that while Trump's approval on border security remains high, aggressive ICE tactics targeting immigrants without criminal records are generating backlash. Polls indicate limited enthusiasm for deporting all undocumented immigrants, particularly those with ties to U.S. citizens or who arrived as children. The article suggests that Trump's overreach in immigration enforcement may be contributing to a decline in his approval ratings on the issue.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is urging cities and counties to ban homeless encampments, providing a model ordinance for local governments to adopt or modify. The initiative includes $3.3 billion in funding for housing and treatment options, aiming to address the growing public health and safety issues associated with homelessness. While major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco have already begun clearing encampments, critics argue that punitive policies do not effectively reduce homelessness.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices in the United States by asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce prices, but the order lacks clear legal authority to mandate lower prices. The New York Times article points out that the order calls on federal agencies to investigate why European countries get lower prices and to push them to pay more, though the administration has limited leverage to influence European drug prices. Pharmaceutical stocks rose following the announcement, as the industry had been bracing for a more damaging policy.</p>
