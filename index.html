          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were defeated 3-0 by the Arizona Diamondbacks, snapping their four-game winning streak due to a stagnant offensive performance. The team managed only three hits against pitcher Zac Gallen and the Diamondbacks' bullpen, failing to capitalize on an opportunity to extend their lead in the division race. Starting pitcher Blake Snell allowed three runs, including a two-run homer, in just over five innings of work. The loss highlights the team's inconsistency at the plate as they head into a crucial stretch of their season.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's policy to expand expedited deportations for undocumented migrants detained within the U.S. interior. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the government's approach, which allows for rapid removal without a judicial hearing for those in the country for less than two years, likely infringes on due process rights. The decision is a setback for the administration's goal of increasing deportations, with the judge asserting that even those who entered the country illegally are entitled to constitutional protections.</p>

          <p>A grand jury has indicted two civilian employees for allegedly providing false information to the Navy about a major fuel spill at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in 2021. The spill contaminated drinking water, sickening approximately 6,000 people. The indictment claims John Floyd and Nelson Wu misled the Hawaii Department of Health by significantly underreporting the amount of leaked jet fuel, stating it was 1,618 gallons instead of the actual 20,000 gallons. These are the first indictments stemming from the incident, which has drawn widespread public anger.</p>

          <p>A political fight over congressional redistricting is escalating, with California and Texas at the forefront. After Texas's Republican-led legislature passed a new map to create five more GOP-favored seats, California's Democratic lawmakers responded by advancing a plan to redraw their own maps to add five Democratic seats, effectively canceling out the move. This "political arms race" is spreading to other states like Missouri, driven by a national push to secure a congressional majority ahead of the midterm elections. The practice, known as gerrymandering, is shaping up to be a key factor in the future balance of power in Washington.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Yale University have identified over 31 kilometers of earthen walls, or "berms," being constructed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) around the besieged city of el-Fasher in Darfur. The analysis of satellite images suggests the barrier is intended to trap civilians and create a "kill box" for the RSF's final assault on the city, the last army stronghold in the region. Humanitarian access has been cut off for months, and reports from inside the city describe deliberate shelling of civilian areas and hospitals, resulting in numerous casualties.</p>

          <p>As Chinese stock markets reach a 10-year high, analysts suggest the rally could be sustained by a combination of domestic and international factors. With yields on fixed-income products at record lows, China's massive US$22 trillion in household savings may rotate into equities. Furthermore, global investors are reportedly returning to Chinese markets, attracted by what some asset managers call "undervalued innovation" in sectors like advanced manufacturing and AI. This renewed interest from both retail and overseas investors is seen as a potent catalyst for continued market growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data obtained by the BBC reveals that live-fire military training exercises have caused 385 wildfires on Ministry of Defence land in the UK since January 2023. Firefighting efforts are often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance, both from current training and historical use, such as during World War II. A recent large moorland fire in North Yorkshire was hampered by exploding bombs from that era. While the MoD states it has a robust wildfire policy, some local residents are calling for a complete ban on live-fire training during the driest months to prevent further incidents.</p>

The judges emphasized that Congress designed TPS to be insulated from shifting politics. The decision provides temporary relief for TPS holders while the legal challenge against the administration's policy continues.</p>

The White House is using a rare procedural move known as a "pocket rescission" to bypass Congress, withholding the funds so late in the fiscal year that lawmakers cannot act before they expire. The move has been condemned by Democrats, who warn it increases the risk of a government shutdown, and some Republicans, who have called the tactic illegal.

The research, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, revealed that 42% of children aged 3 to 5 were prescribed drugs within 30 days of an ADHD diagnosis. Experts recommend behavioral intervention as the first line of treatment for this age group due to the potential side effects of stimulant medications.
