          <p>Hurricane Erick has strengthened into an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 storm as it approaches Mexico's Pacific coast, prompting warnings of life-threatening floods and swells. A hurricane warning is in effect for a 500km stretch of coast from Acapulco to Puerto √Ångel, with residents in Guerrero and Oaxaca advised to seek shelter. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum urged people to stay indoors and heed official communications, while around 2,000 shelters have been set up across Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. This is expected to be the first hurricane to make landfall in Mexico this season, raising concerns after the devastation caused by Hurricane Otis in Acapulco in 2023. The storm is anticipated to make landfall later on Thursday, potentially causing devastating wind damage and mudslides in mountainous areas. </p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a major hospital in southern Israel, causing extensive damage and injuries, as Israel attacked Iran's Arak heavy water reactor. The hospital had been partially evacuated prior to the strike, averting a potentially greater disaster, according to Israeli officials. Israeli Health Minister Uriel Bosso condemned the attack as a war crime deliberately committed against civilians and medical teams. The attack on the reactor, which Iranian state television claims caused no radiation danger, occurred amidst ongoing airstrikes between Israel and Iran, which have resulted in numerous casualties on both sides. The International Atomic Energy Agency has previously urged Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites, while the IAEA has lost ‚Äúcontinuity of knowledge‚Äù about Iran's heavy water production.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel's CEO, Eiji Hashimoto, expressed confidence that the U.S. government's oversight in its $14.1 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel will not impede the U.S. unit's operations. Despite conditions including a golden share for the U.S. government and significant investment commitments, Hashimoto believes the deal is efficient and ensures profitability for both companies. He emphasized that Nippon Steel aims to expand production capacity at U.S. Steel and create jobs, aligning with U.S. government expectations. The acquisition positions Nippon Steel as the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, bolstering its global capacity and enabling expansion into overseas markets, and higher U.S. tariffs on steel products are likely to remain in place.

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in Central London by piecing together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster. Discovered in 2021, the shattered plaster reveals beautifully painted details of musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit from at least 20 walls of the building. The art offers insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London," and the artists who created them. The largest fresco, measuring about 5m by 3m, features pale pink, yellow, and green panels adorned with candelabras, lyres, white cranes, and local plants like mistletoe, showcasing a blend of classical and local influences. The discovery helps reconstruct the story of the UK's rich Roman history.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has resumed processing student visas for foreign applicants but now requires them to unlock their social media accounts for review. Consular officers will scrutinize posts for content deemed hostile to the U.S., its government, culture, institutions, or founding principles. Refusal to grant access may result in visa rejection, signaling potential evasion or concealment of online activity. This policy change comes after a temporary suspension of visa interviews and aims to enhance screening procedures. Concerns have been raised about potential chilling effects on legitimate political speech and ideological vetting reminiscent of the Cold War era.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has suspended NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over recent deals struck with China, which cover infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. Wellington, the Cook Islands' largest funder, stated it was not informed of the agreements and that funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship. The Cook Islands has responded by saying it will address the issue urgently, emphasizing its value of New Zealand's development assistance. The move comes as New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is on an official visit to China, and amid broader concerns among US allies about China's growing influence in the Pacific region.</p>

Sheehan, who missed all of last season, showcased his sharp stuff, including a mid-90s mph fastball and a tantalizing changeup-slider combination, striking out six batters and allowing only one run. Manager Dave Roberts praised Sheehan's performance, highlighting his toughness and ability to repeat his delivery, while Will Smith secured the win with a walk-off home run in the ninth inning. The Dodgers have now clinched a series victory against the Padres, extending their lead in the National League West, and Sheehan's return provides a much-needed boost to their pitching rotation.</p>

While acknowledging the repressive nature of the Iranian regime and its destabilizing actions in the region, the author cautions against a simplistic view of regime change, emphasizing that destroying a regime is not the same as rebuilding a nation. The article highlights the lack of a clear successor government and the potential for prolonged instability in a defeated Iran, warning that a weakened but angry Islamic republic is as likely an outcome as a replaced one. The author emphasizes the need for caution and a realistic assessment of the challenges involved in regime change, especially in revolutionary regimes.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is facing a significant demographic challenge as large numbers of young women are leaving the country due to the ongoing war, seeking education and opportunities abroad. With young men restricted from leaving due to martial law, the emigration of young women poses a brain drain and a demographic time bomb, raising concerns about who will rebuild the country after the war. The allure of European universities and the desire to escape the conflict are driving this trend, with Poland being a popular destination for Ukrainian students.

Legal experts suggest the high-profile case will elevate the careers of the attorneys involved, potentially leading to more celebrity and big-case representation. It is expected that Read may file lawsuits against investigators involved in her case, particularly against a former homicide detective who lost his job over texts related to the case.

          <p>Chinese ambassador Xie Feng urged the U.S. to adopt a broader perspective on tariffs and trade relations, emphasizing the need for balance and addressing restrictions on Chinese imports. Xie noted that tariffs on Chinese imports remain "unreasonably high" and that the U.S. goods deficit will persist if export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms continue. He argued that the U.S. should ease restrictions on exports of its most competitive products, such as semiconductors, and welcome Chinese investment and tourism to reduce the deficit. This statement comes amid ongoing discussions between the two countries to ease trade tensions and implement agreements reached in May regarding tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

          <p>Dongchoon Circus Troupe, South Korea‚Äôs last circus, is celebrating its 100th anniversary, continuing to perform acrobatic shows without animal acts or risky stunts. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon was a major entertainment attraction during the golden age of South Korean circuses, but later faced declining audiences due to the rise of television and other forms of entertainment. Despite challenges, the circus has survived and is now performing at a seaside tourist area in Ansan, drawing crowds on weekdays and weekends. The circus now employs Chinese acrobats, and the head of the circus hopes to build a circus school to nurture South Korean circus artists.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. imposes tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty rates by changing product materials or dimensions to fit different classification codes. This legal practice involves altering items to qualify for exemptions or lower tariffs, with companies tweaking products to meet specific requirements. Examples include adding steel or aluminum to products, switching synthetic materials for cotton, and incorporating minor design changes to shift product classifications. While tariff engineering is legal, companies must avoid fraudulent misrepresentation of product classifications, as illustrated by Ford's case involving misclassified cargo vans.
