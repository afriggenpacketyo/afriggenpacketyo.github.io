          <p>The China Coast Guard says it used a water cannon to expel a Philippine government vessel from the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. According to a Chinese spokesperson, the Philippine vessel ignored warnings and intruded into Chinese waters, prompting the response. China claims the Philippine actions violate its sovereignty and international law, while Manila has yet to comment on the incident. The confrontation follows accusations from China that the Philippines is illegally operating near Half Moon and Royal Captain shoals, further escalating tensions in the region.</p>

The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of significant impacts on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. While temperatures are record-breaking for 2025, they remain below the June peak of 35.6C recorded in 1976.

          <p>A US appeals court has ruled that President Trump can continue to control National Guard troops in Los Angeles, despite objections from California's governor. The court stated that Trump's administration provided a defensible rationale for mobilizing the guard to protect federal personnel and property. Trump hailed the decision as a "BIG WIN," asserting his authority to provide protection when state and local police are unable to do so. Governor Newsom criticized the decision, emphasizing that the President's powers are not unfettered and vowing to challenge the authoritarian use of military soldiers against citizens.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has urged local governments to carefully implement strictures on lavish banquets, amid concerns from the food and beverage industry. The party's theoretical journal, Qiushi, stated that the frugality measures are intended to limit extravagance, not ordinary dining. Some local governments have been scrutinizing every meal gathering and canceling official receptions, causing unnecessary shocks to the catering industry. The curbs on excessive official meals were introduced after the release of regulations on thrift and waste in party and government bodies, banning high-end dishes, cigarettes, and liquor at official events.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed an edible, washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. The low-cost coating has been tested on 17 varieties of fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more. This strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste. The coating costs just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit, making it an economically viable option.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's secure nuclear site, viewing its disablement as necessary due to the risk of rapid weapons production. Trump has approved attack plans but has not made a final decision, holding off in case Iran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Trump will decide whether to order a strike within two weeks, as diplomatic efforts are underway to find a resolution. The UK's Foreign Secretary David Lammy is actively involved in diplomacy to find an off-ramp to the conflict.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is facing challenges with low attendance and hot weather, despite being the largest and most lucrative global club competition in soccer history. Attendance has averaged just 36,433 through 20 matches, with many games kicking off at midday or in the early afternoon, exacerbating the effects of the summer heat. Some teams have struggled with the conditions, with players noting the difficulty of playing in the heat and humidity. FIFA's inability to convince fans and players of the tournament's necessity has also contributed to the lack of interest.</p>

An activist notes that the rise in sightings is due to more people in the water, better technology, and shifting ocean conditions.
