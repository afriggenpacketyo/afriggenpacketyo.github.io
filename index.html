        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, expressed optimism about the future of AI and biotech, emphasizing that scientific breakthroughs are universally beneficial regardless of geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. Diamandis highlighted the importance of recognizing the shared foundation of human biology, math, physics, and chemistry, asserting that progress in one country elevates humanity as a whole. He voiced concerns over cuts to scientific funding in the U.S., particularly at the National Institutes of Health, warning of long-term implications for the pace of scientific discoveries. Diamandis aims to help people view the world positively, counteracting the brain's natural inclination toward fear and scarcity, and believes in the power of incentivizing breakthroughs to solve global challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Universities in England are facing financial strain due to a drop in international student enrollment and rising inflation, leading to course cutbacks and closures. A government review is underway to address the long-term funding of higher education. A report by Universities UK suggests greater collaboration between institutions could help mitigate the risk of subject "cold spots" where students lack local study options. The Competition and Markets Authority supports collaboration where possible, but current laws designed to promote competition hinder universities from openly discussing course offerings and closures, potentially impacting students' access to education.</p>

          <p>A report by the Shared Health Foundation highlights the challenges faced by children living in temporary accommodation, including disruptions to their education and healthcare access. The report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary housing, aiming to prevent children from going "missing" from schools and GPs. The article features the story of Shanice Aird, a mother of three facing homelessness after rejecting unsuitable council housing, underscoring the instability and stress experienced by families in temporary accommodation. The government says it is investing Â£1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing a political firestorm after approving a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, drawing criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and local political parties. The government argues the law is necessary to address racial inequality in land ownership, while critics fear it threatens property rights. Legal experts suggest expropriation without compensation would only occur in limited circumstances, such as when land is unused or held for speculative purposes. The law aims to facilitate land redistribution to black people dispossessed during white-minority rule, but its implementation faces significant political and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Red Cross reported that at least 21 people were killed and dozens injured in an incident near an aid distribution center in Rafah, Gaza. The International Committee of the Red Cross stated that the majority of the 179 cases received at a Red Cross field hospital suffered gunshot or shrapnel wounds. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed an initial inquiry showed its forces did not fire at people near the aid center, while Hamas-run civil defense blamed "Israeli gunfire." MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) reported that at least two patients said they were shot while trying to get aid, and the blood bank at Nasser hospital was nearly empty.</p>
