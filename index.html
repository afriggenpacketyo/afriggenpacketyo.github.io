          <p>The UK Home Secretary is set to proscribe Palestine Action, effectively labeling them a terrorist organization, after activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed military planes with red paint. The decision follows a security review at military bases across the UK. Palestine Action stated they represent opposition to Israel's military action in Gaza, while Prime Minister Starmer condemned the act as vandalism.

          <p>The Supreme Court sided with the oil and gas industry by reviving a lawsuit challenging California's strict emissions standards in a 7-2 decision. The justices ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over California's standards, arguing that the state was improperly addressing climate change rather than local air quality issues. The decision was overshadowed by actions from Trump and congressional Republicans to disapprove of regulations allowing California to enforce stricter "zero emissions" car and truck rules.

Under RAP, borrowers would have fewer repayment plan choices and face a longer repayment timeline of 30 years before loan forgiveness. Critics argue that the plan could push more borrowers into default and delay major life milestones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with ICE in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling favored a group of 20 states that sued, arguing the administration lacked the authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. Judge McConnell stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funds. The administration's policy aimed to push back against "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>
