          <p>President Trump challenged a U.S. intelligence report suggesting that recent airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites did not completely destroy those facilities, contrary to his claims. Trump insisted the Iranian nuclear program was "obliterated," but the preliminary intelligence assessment indicated the strikes only set Iran's program back by a few months. Trump acknowledged the existence of the Defense Intelligence Agency's report but argued that the data was insufficient and the report was incomplete. He highlighted the assessment's mention of potentially "very severe" damage, criticizing news outlets for downplaying this aspect in their reporting. The remarks were made during a press conference at a NATO summit in The Hague. Optimism is diminished due to the conflicting information regarding the success of the strikes. </p>

          <p>BP's shares initially surged following reports of early-stage acquisition talks with Shell, but Shell has since denied that any discussions are taking place. The Wall Street Journal reported the potential deal, causing BP's shares to jump over 10%, while Shell's spokesperson dismissed the reports as market speculation. Sources suggest that if a deal were to occur, BP would likely be split and sold to multiple companies, as BP has underperformed its rivals in recent years, leading to acquisition target speculation. Activist investor Elliott Management recently acquired a stake in BP, adding to the pressure for the oil major to refocus on its core fossil fuel business. This situation creates uncertainty in the energy sector. </p>

          <p>Nvidia's shares rose to a record high, buoyed by investor confidence in the company's leadership in artificial intelligence, despite export controls affecting its access to the Chinese market. The stock increased nearly 3%, reaching $153.55, surpassing its previous intraday record and making Nvidia the world's largest company by market capitalization at $3.7 trillion, slightly ahead of Microsoft. Nvidia remains the dominant player in graphics processing units (GPUs) used for large language models and AI workloads. The rally is surprising given the company's limitations in accessing the world's second-largest economy. The stock market's movement is a positive sign for the economy. </p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is pushing to ban Chinese artificial intelligence systems from federal agencies, aiming to ensure the U.S. maintains its lead in the global AI race. The hearing on Capitol Hill follows concerns that China is catching up to the U.S. in AI development, despite restrictions on chips and key technologies. Witnesses emphasized the importance of winning the AI competition, highlighting the built-in values in AI systems and the need to control the flow of powerful chips to China. The proposed No Adversarial AI Act seeks to identify and ban AI systems developed by foreign adversaries within the U.S. government, with exceptions for research and counter-terrorism purposes.

These agreements enable local law enforcement to collaborate with ICE, deputizing local officers as federal immigration officers.

The commitment involves at least 3.5% of each member state's GDP on core defense expenditure by 2035, plus up to 1.5% on security infrastructure.

          <p>NASA's Curiosity rover has captured the first close-up images of ridges on Mars, providing evidence of how water once flowed on the planet. The images show ancient groundwater in crisscrossing low ridges, arranged in a "boxwork pattern," across miles of a mountain. Scientists believe the bedrock below these ridges formed when groundwater trickled through the rock, leaving behind minerals that hardened and became cement-like. The ridges also contain small fractures filled with calcium sulfate, which had not been found before in this part of Mount Sharp. This discovery provides new insights into Mars's history and potential for past life. The possibility of past life is exciting. </p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge ruled that the California FAIR Plan's smoke-damage policy violates state law by providing less coverage than required, a decision that could impact many homeowners. The ruling stated that the FAIR Plan's requirement for "permanent physical changes" to a property to qualify for fire claims violates the insurance code. The FAIR Plan's handling of smoke-damage claims has been criticized by homeowners, who claim they received low-ball offers and were told to clean up their properties themselves. This decision could have broad implications for the FAIR Plan, which has seen significant growth as insurers pull out of California's home insurance market. The decision may lead to changes in insurance policy. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A credit card grace period is the time between the end of your billing cycle and your payment due date when you won't be charged interest on new purchases, but only if you pay your full statement balance by the due date. It's a temporary, interest-free loan typically lasting 21 to 25 days, allowing users to earn rewards without incurring interest charges if balances are paid in full each month. Carrying a balance from month to month typically results in losing the grace period, causing new purchases to accrue interest immediately. Cash advances rarely have a grace period, and balance transfers may or may not, depending on the card's terms. The proper use of credit cards can help people. (not investment advice)</p>

The reforms include making it harder to access Personal Independence Payments (Pip) and cutting the rate of incapacity benefit, with the goal of saving £3bn a year. The government also plans to make it more difficult to claim the "daily living" element of Pip from 2026-27, which could save an additional £4.5bn a year.

An Assembly bill would further expand the incentive program, increasing the tax credit up to 35% for productions in the greater Los Angeles area and up to 40% outside the region.

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer is defending his leadership as the government pushes ahead with a vote on welfare reforms, despite opposition from Labour MPs. Over 120 Labour backbenchers have signed an amendment calling for the proposals to be scrapped, potentially leading to a defeat for the government. Starmer insisted the Labour party was united on reforming the welfare system and dismissed criticism as "noises off." He argued that the current welfare system is broken and needs to be changed. There is disagreement over the welfare system. </p>
