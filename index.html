          <p>China has acknowledged receiving overtures from the U.S. to initiate trade negotiations, following multiple attempts by U.S. officials to engage through relevant parties. In response, Chinese authorities have reiterated their demand for the U.S. to rectify what they view as wrongdoings by removing all unilateral tariffs. The statement emphasizes that failure to do so would be interpreted as a lack of sincerity from Washington and would further erode mutual trust between the two nations. The Chinese are waiting to see if the U.S. will remove the tariffs before engaging in talks.</p>

          <p>Former Florida Senator Marco Rubio has assumed multiple roles within the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security adviser. This accumulation of titles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage all responsibilities, especially given President Trump's unconventional approach to governance. The appointment to multiple positions has been met with surprise, even within the State Department, highlighting the unconventional nature of the decision-making process. Some analysts have expressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the archivist's role in overseeing record preservation across federal agencies, including those Rubio also leads.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz is departing from his position as National Security Advisor, with President Trump announcing his nomination to become the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as the interim National Security Advisor. This decision followed scrutiny over Waltz's inclusion of a journalist in a Signal chat discussing sensitive national security matters. Sources indicate that Waltz's departure was also influenced by concerns about his vetting of NSC staff and a perceived lack of fit within the senior team, though Trump reportedly respects Waltz and wanted to offer him a high-profile role.</p>

Felix Rojas, who has illegally entered the country multiple times, was arrested in New York City and charged with sexual assault.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton provides insights into President Trump's second term, characterizing it as even more incoherent than his first. Bolton suggests that Trump's primary motivation is to be the center of attention, lacking a coherent philosophy or grand strategy. He points to instances of retribution and constitutional infringements, but expresses confidence in the strength of American institutions to withstand any existential threat. Bolton notes that many of Trump's actions in the first 100 days are likely to be challenged in court and ultimately fail, setting precedents that will make it harder for future presidents to pursue similar policies.</p>

Factors influencing this decision range from financial considerations and concerns about climate change to prioritizing careers and simply not wanting children. Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor, notes that child-free individuals often value their relationship with their partner and don't want to alter that dynamic.

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a "soda tax" on sugar-sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban that prohibits local governments from imposing such taxes until 2031. The tax adds 2 cents per ounce to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and a certain calorie count. Proponents of the tax framed it as a battle against the American Beverage Association, arguing that it allows the city to make its own decisions. Opponents argue that the tax violates the statewide ban and unfairly burdens working families already struggling with high prices.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris is contemplating her next political move, weighing a run for governor of California, another presidential bid in 2028, or stepping away from elected office. She has been engaging with Democratic officials and strategists to shape the party's future direction. Harris is expected to announce her decision by the end of the summer and will headline a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in New York. Sources say the focus has been less about plotting her next campaign and more about helping shape the Democratic Party's path forward.</p>

          <p>A report published by federal health officials expresses concerns about the lack of scientific evidence supporting hormonal and surgical treatments for young people with gender dysphoria, prioritizing psychotherapy instead. The report questions the notion of gender identity not aligning with birth sex and criticizes medical groups for fostering intolerant work environments. Transgender rights advocates have denounced the assessment as an ideological statement disguised as science, pointing to the administration's efforts to limit recognition of transgender identities in public life. The report may set the stage for additional restrictions on gender-affirming care.</p>

Hasbro aims to shift 40% of its global sourcing out of China by the end of 2026, relocating manufacturing to countries like the U.S., Turkey, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. While China will remain an important sourcing location, Hasbro expects to increase prices but believes its sourcing flexibility will mitigate the impact.

While the slides do not include any price estimates, it would likely cost tens of millions of dollars to put on a parade of that size. High costs halted Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.</p>
