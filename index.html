          <p>Columbia University will pay over $221 million to resolve federal investigations into alleged anti-discrimination law violations, specifically concerning antisemitism on campus. The settlement, paid over three years, also resolves claims from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In return, the Trump administration will restore $400 million in federal research grants that had been withheld. The agreement formalizes new campus policies, including a ban on masks intended to conceal identity and a requirement for protestors to show university IDs, aiming to move past a period of intense federal scrutiny.</p>

          <p>An Afghan interpreter, who saved a U.S. Army officer's life multiple times and was later granted a Special Immigrant Visa, now fears deportation for his family under new administration policies. After reuniting with the officer in Kentucky, he feels the U.S. has broken its promise to allies who risked their lives. The article highlights the personal impact of the administration's efforts to end legal status for many Afghans, including those with green cards. The interpreter and the retired officer describe the situation as a betrayal and a "moral injury" to veterans.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix reported a record-breaking second-quarter operating profit and revenue, fueled by soaring demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in artificial intelligence systems. The company's revenue rose over 35% year-over-year, with HBM sales contributing 77% of the total. SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, expects to double its HBM sales in 2025 compared to 2024 and plans to increase capital expenditure to maintain its market leadership. Analysts believe the company will maintain its edge over competitors like Samsung and Micron into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive "AI Action Plan" aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence by boosting innovation and removing regulatory barriers. The plan includes over 90 policy actions and is accompanied by executive orders to promote AI exports and eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems. While officials frame it as a crucial step to outpace China, critics from groups like the AI Now Institute argue the plan prioritizes corporate interests and tech billionaires over public welfare. The plan notably reverses a prior executive order that had established safety standards for AI.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media reveals a growing trend of teenagers using AI chatbots not just for information, but for friendship, advice, and emotional support. Over 70% of teens have used AI companions, with many finding the interactions as or more satisfying than talking to human friends. Researchers and mental health experts express concern that this could hinder the development of crucial social skills, redefine human relationships, and exacerbate youth loneliness. While some teens use AI for mundane tasks, others discuss serious issues, raising questions about the unregulated industry's impact on adolescent development.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has declared President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. In a significant ruling, a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals stated the policy is invalid because it directly contradicts the 14th Amendment. The amendment grants citizenship to 'all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' This decision marks the first time an appellate court has ruled on the merits of the president's attempt to curtail birthright citizenship for children of many undocumented immigrants through executive action.</p>

The subpoena was amended by Republicans to also demand Epstein-related communications involving former President Biden and officials from his administration.

According to Redfin data, May saw 34% more sellers than buyers nationally, the highest rate since 2013, and homes are taking slightly longer to sell. However, median sale prices hit a record high in June, driven by low inventory as many homeowners are locked into low interest rates.

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's "AI Action Plan" suggests it is a significant gift to major technology companies, prioritizing rapid, unregulated development over public safeguards. The plan, heavily influenced by recommendations from firms like OpenAI and Google, aims to strip away federal and state regulations, including environmental protections for data center construction. It promotes a "try-first" culture, encouraging aggressive AI adoption across government and military sectors. Critics argue this approach pushes the nation toward a potential AI bubble bust and places its technological future entirely in the hands of Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p>Freddie Freeman delivered a clutch, two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Los Angeles Dodgers a 4-3 walk-off victory against the Minnesota Twins. The dramatic hit saved the Dodgers from another bullpen collapse, after reliever Kirby Yates surrendered a one-run lead in the eighth inning. The bullpen's struggles have become a major issue for the team, overshadowing a stellar seven-inning, 12-strikeout performance from starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow. The win also featured Shohei Ohtani hitting a home run for the fifth consecutive game, tying a franchise record.</p>

          <p>An exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument has been altered to comply with a March executive order from President Trump targeting signage deemed "unpatriotic." The exhibit, titled "History Under Construction," had added context to an existing timeline, including the role of Indigenous peoples and the complex, sometimes racist, views of figures like John Muir. Following the order, this added information was removed, restoring the original, less complete sign. A former park ranger who helped create the expanded exhibit criticized the move as censorship that erases a more complete and challenging version of American history.</p>

          <p>According to The Wall Street Journal, Attorney General Pam Bondi informed President Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times in Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein. This briefing reportedly occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not release the files to the public, a decision that sparked backlash from Trump's supporters. The report states Trump was also told many other high-profile figures were named and that the files contained unverified hearsay. The White House dismissed the report as "fake news," while the DOJ stated the briefing was routine and nothing warranted further investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed three executive orders focused on artificial intelligence, including one specifically targeting what the administration calls "woke" or ideologically biased AI models. Another order aims to expedite the construction of data center infrastructure by removing regulatory and environmental protections. These actions are part of a broader "AI Action Plan" to position the U.S. as a global leader by removing "red tape." The move against biased AI echoes long-standing conservative grievances against tech companies, while critics warn the vague criteria could be used to target companies at the administration's discretion.</p>

The decision, driven by opposition from some Republican lawmakers and landowners, appears to contradict the administration's goal of shoring up the power grid to meet the massive energy demands of new AI data centers. Project backers, including some Republicans, argued the line is critical for grid reliability and delivering cheaper power.

The program, open to those who lost property or suffered injuries, will be offered even as the official cause of the January blaze remains under investigation. A leading theory is that aging Edison equipment ignited the fire, which killed 19 people and destroyed over 9,400 structures. While Edison frames the program as a faster path to recovery, some attorneys for fire victims expressed skepticism, suggesting it could be a tactic to underpay claims.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not about monetary policy but is a dangerous power play to subordinate the central bank to political needs. The author contends this push for "fiscal dominance," where the central bank accommodates government borrowing, historically leads to inflation and economic instability. While criticizing Powell's past performance, the author asserts that the root problem is not interest rates but the federal government's excessive spending. Forcing lower rates to mask reckless deficits would erode confidence and inevitably trigger higher inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
