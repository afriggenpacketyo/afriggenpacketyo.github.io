          <p>The Trump administration has deployed 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, citing the need to protect federal officers and assets. The move follows a confrontation where a woman was shot by Border Patrol personnel during a standoff involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker condemned the deployment as an "outrageous and un-American" ultimatum, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the federal government and Democratic-led cities over the use of federal forces.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the protests in the city were not disruptive enough to justify federalizing the Guard without the governor's consent. The decision emphasized the constitutional principles separating military and civil authority, a ruling celebrated by Oregon officials as a victory for state sovereignty and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering minting a new one-dollar coin featuring President Donald Trump to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. A draft design shows Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him after his 2024 near-assassination on the other, inscribed with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." The proposal's legality is being debated, as federal law generally prohibits living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, though historical exceptions exist.</p>

          <p>After decades in business, pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced it is closing all of its locations. The company, which was founded in 1962, posted a notice on its website confirming the closures and thanking customers for their support. This follows two bankruptcy filings in the past two years, during which the company has already shuttered over 520 stores while dealing with declining sales and opioid-related lawsuits from the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed hope for the release of all hostages from Gaza in the coming days after Hamas agreed to key parts of a peace plan proposed by President Trump. The plan involves a phased Israeli withdrawal and the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with an Egyptian-hosted delegation set to finalize details. While Hamas accepted some terms, including handing over Gaza's administration to a technocratic body, Netanyahu has signaled that a full Israeli withdrawal is not guaranteed.</p>

The crisis is exacerbated by a lack of needle-exchange programs and the country's emergence as a major trafficking hub for methamphetamine, with increasingly younger people becoming infected.</p>

          <p>An FBI agent has allegedly been suspended for insubordination after refusing to take part in a planned "perp walk" for former FBI Director James Comey. The plan, which reportedly involved sending "large, beefy" agents to escort Comey to his arraignment, was deemed inappropriate by the suspended agent. Comey faces federal charges of lying to Congress, filed shortly after President Trump publicly called for more aggressive investigations into his political adversaries, raising questions about the motivations behind the prosecution.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is causing widespread disruption across the National Park Service, with many sites closing or operating with severely limited staff and services.

Some states are using their own funds or donations to keep their parks open, but visitors at other locations, like New Mexico's White Sands National Park, are being turned away.</p>

          <p>A terror attack at a Manchester synagogue on the holy day of Yom Kippur left two worshippers, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, dead and three others seriously injured. The attacker, identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, used a car to ram into people before attempting to enter the synagogue with a knife; he was shot and killed by police. One victim was tragically hit by police gunfire, and authorities, who noted the attacker was recently bailed for suspected sexual assault, are investigating his potential ties to extremist ideology.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested nearly 500 people during a demonstration in Trafalgar Square for supporting Palestine Action, a group proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government in July. The protest went ahead despite calls from police and politicians to postpone it following the recent deadly attack on a Manchester synagogue. Organizers from the group Defend Our Juries argued that canceling the vigil would be "letting terror win" and that it is possible to grieve for victims of multiple atrocities simultaneously.</p>

          <p>The annual Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach proceeded this weekend without its main attraction, the U.S. military, due to the federal government shutdown. While international participants like the British Royal Air Force and the Canadian Armed Forces filled the schedule, many attendees expressed disappointment over the absence of American aircraft like the F-35s and Thunderbirds. The event, which draws thousands, continued with a mix of civilian aerobatics and historical aircraft, but the shutdown's impact was a notable point of frustration for veterans and aviation enthusiasts.</p>
