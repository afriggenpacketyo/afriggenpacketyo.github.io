          <p>Mark Knoller, a distinguished CBS News correspondent celebrated for his meticulous record-keeping of presidential activities, has passed away at the age of 73. For decades, Knoller served as the unofficial historian of the White House press corps, single-handedly compiling an exhaustive database of presidential travel, speeches, and daily actions. This self-imposed duty made him an invaluable resource to fellow journalists, historians, and even White House staff, all of whom benefited from his remarkable generosity and dedication to public information. Colleagues remembered him as a kind, witty, and legendary figure who defined the role of a White House chronicler for a generation.</p>

          <p>The Irish government has formally expressed its concern to German authorities after a 25-year-old Irish citizen was struck by police during a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Berlin. Video footage showed the woman, Kitty O'Brien, being hit in the face before being arrested; her activist group reported she later required surgery for a broken arm. Berlin police stated that officers were compelled to use force after protesters ignored orders to disperse and that O'Brien had resisted and insulted officers. The incident has sparked protests at the German Embassy in Dublin and has drawn criticism from Irish officials, including the prime minister.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order seeks to prevent the deputization of local police, demands that federal agents not be deployed, and urges them to wear identifying information and body cameras while prohibiting masks. While largely symbolic, the mayor stated the city will use every available tool, including legal action, to counter federal actions that could violate constitutional rights like peaceful assembly. The White House dismissed the move as a publicity stunt, criticizing the city's focus on crime.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has identified the remains of Idan Shtivi, a 28-year-old hostage, who was recovered from Gaza after being held for 693 days. Shtivi was abducted from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, and was credited with saving several lives before his capture. His identification follows the recent recovery of another hostage, Ilan Weiss, leaving 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, with fears for their safety growing among family members.

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has concluded that famed McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," likely murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. For decades, her death was believed to be the result of a failed ambush on the sheriff, but modern forensic analysis of the exhumed body and crime scene evidence contradicts his account. Investigators found that Pauline Pusser was shot outside the vehicle and the scene was staged, also noting that a gunshot wound to the sheriff's own cheek was likely self-inflicted. Officials stated that if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, there would be enough evidence for a murder indictment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA), has announced the elimination of over 500 jobs, escalating a contentious battle over the future of the government-funded news outlets. The move, announced by acting CEO Kari Lake, comes just one day after a federal judge blocked her from firing the VOA director, ruling the attempt was unlawful. Employee groups have condemned the layoffs as an abhorrent attack on the agency and plan to continue their legal fight, arguing the administration is dismantling a key tool of U.S. soft power. Critics warn that weakening these broadcasters cedes the global information space to authoritarian adversaries.</p>

          <p>Recent Premier League matches were once again overshadowed by controversial decisions involving the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), fueling frustration among managers and fans. Burnley manager Scott Parker criticized the system for making football "sterile" after his team lost to a late penalty awarded by VAR against Manchester United. In another match, Fulham manager Marco Silva was left seething after a goal was disallowed for a minimal foul in the build-up. These incidents are part of a growing trend this season where marginal offsides and subjective foul interpretations by VAR are dominating conversations, leading to calls for reform, including the involvement of former players in the decision-making process.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority in imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on most countries, declaring the action illegal. The court found that the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the levies was improper, as the power to impose such taxes resides exclusively with Congress. The decision puts tariffs affecting a majority of U.S. goods imports on uncertain legal ground, though the duties will remain in effect until October 14 to allow for an appeal to the Supreme Court. However, sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, imposed under a different law, are not affected by the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

For kindergarten-aged children, a maximum of 30 minutes is suggested to ensure time for imaginative play and social interaction. As children grow older, guidelines expand to about one to two hours for teenagers, but experts stress that content quality and parental engagement are more crucial than strict time limits, warning against allowing consumption to become a secretive habit.</p>

          <p>American tennis star Coco Gauff delivered a confident performance to defeat Magdalena Frech 6-3, 6-1, securing her spot in the fourth round of the US Open. After two tense, emotional matches earlier in the week, Gauff appeared more settled, with her recently troublesome serve becoming a source of strength. The 21-year-old, who has been working with a new coaching team to address biomechanical issues, showed improved mental fortitude and aggressive play. She now advances to a highly anticipated match against two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka, setting up a compelling clash between two of the sport's biggest names.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has canceled his planned trip to Beijing as protests, which began in the capital over lawmakers' pay, have intensified and spread to other regions. The president was scheduled to attend a 'Victory Day' parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. However, with several regional parliament buildings reportedly set ablaze, a presidential spokesperson announced that the president would remain in Indonesia to monitor the situation and seek solutions. The widespread unrest, triggered by public anger and exacerbated by a fatal traffic incident involving a police vehicle, represents the first major challenge for Prabowo's nearly year-old government.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time since rumors of his death trended on social media, appearing on a family golf outing in Virginia. The 79-year-old was photographed with his grandchildren at the White House before heading to his golf course, effectively quelling the viral speculation. The online rumors were fueled by recent comments from J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in if a tragedy were to occur, which sparked concern over the president's health. The White House has previously addressed health concerns, attributing bruising on Trump's hand to frequent handshaking and a benign circulatory condition.</p>

          <p>New York City's health department has officially declared an end to the Legionnaire's disease outbreak in central Harlem, which resulted in seven deaths and 114 confirmed cases. The declaration comes after three weeks have passed without any new cases being identified among residents or workers in the affected area. An investigation traced the legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, the mayor's administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and proactive testing of cooling tower systems to prevent future outbreaks.</p>

These individuals, who often worked for Western organizations, fled the Taliban but now face arrest and forced return to Afghanistan as a Pakistani pause on deportations is set to expire. One family described the constant fear of police raids and the certainty of being killed if sent back. Although the German government has restarted the visa process after a months-long freeze for security checks, thousands remain in a precarious situation, waiting for a safe passage that has been agonizingly delayed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three serious heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. Researchers in the UK used a device that records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds with an AI trained on data from thousands of patients, picking up subtleties the human ear cannot. In a trial involving over 200 GP surgeries, the AI stethoscope significantly improved the detection rates for all three conditions compared to standard methods. Experts are calling the technology a potential "game-changer" that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair, updates the 1984 Troma cult classic with a higher production value and a well-known cast including Peter Dinklage and Kevin Bacon. Dinklage plays a janitor who, after being exposed to toxic waste, transforms into a disfigured vigilante fighting a corrupt corporation. While the film retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of the original, its polished filmmaking and sincere emotional core create a different experience from the cheap, offensive charm of its predecessor. The result is a diverting and goofy-yet-violent superhero satire that pays homage to the Troma style while being accessible to a broader audience.</p>
