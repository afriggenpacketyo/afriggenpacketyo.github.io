          <p>Bernalillo County sheriff's deputies in New Mexico successfully de-escalated a tense situation involving two young boys, ages 7 and 9, who were found holding a loaded handgun in a residential backyard. The deputies utilized a drone to gain a crucial vantage point, allowing them to communicate with the children while maintaining cover. After about five minutes of dialogue, deputies deployed a non-lethal projectile and safely retrieved the weapon, averting potential tragedy. Sheriff John Allen emphasized the drone's effectiveness in de-escalating conflicts, particularly in sensitive situations involving children, and noted the department had visited the home over 50 times due to domestic violence issues, working to provide the family with trauma therapy and behavioral support.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is set to lay off 3% of its global workforce across various levels, teams, and locations, as announced on Tuesday. The company cites the need to adapt to a dynamic marketplace as the primary reason for these organizational changes. Despite reporting strong quarterly results and an optimistic forecast in late April, Microsoft is proceeding with these cuts, which are expected to impact thousands of employees. A company spokesperson clarified that these layoffs are not performance-based, distinguishing them from a smaller round of performance-based layoffs that occurred in January, and this new round of job cuts will be Microsoft's largest since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan's conviction for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall has been overturned after he spent over 38 years in prison, marking what is believed to be the biggest miscarriage of justice in British history. New DNA evidence from a semen sample at the crime scene did not match Sullivan, leading to his release. Sullivan, now 68, has always maintained his innocence, claiming that his confession was coerced and that bite mark evidence used against him was flawed. The police have reopened the investigation into Sindall's murder, but her killer remains unidentified, raising concerns that the actual perpetrator has evaded justice for nearly four decades.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with their plan to cut hundreds of billions from Medicaid, despite facing internal divisions within their party. The proposed legislation includes imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients, conducting more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to unauthorized immigrants. Speaker Mike Johnson faces resistance from within his own party, with some Republicans expressing concerns about the impact of these cuts on their constituents. The bill also addresses culture war issues, such as stripping Medicaid funding from organizations that offer abortion services like Planned Parenthood, and includes a permanent extension of Trumpâ€™s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act.</p>

Attendees have cited issues ranging from obstructed views and poor acoustics to chaotic VIP sections and high ticket prices.

Despite the communal aspect of sharing a live experience with thousands of others, the practical challenges of stadium concerts can detract from the overall value for fans.</p>

The plaintiffs claim that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to impose such sweeping duties. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, arguing that IEEPA authorizes the president to regulate importation through tariffs under specified circumstances.</p>

Sullivan's case, like that of Andy Malkinson, hinged on DNA evidence that was not adequately pursued earlier in his sentence. Despite applying to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) in 2008 for DNA testing, his request was initially rejected due to limitations of the available technology at the time. Critics argue that the system needs reform to prevent innocent individuals from languishing in prison for decades.</p>

The club will move to a new 53,000-seater arena at Bramley-Moore Dock this summer, but will retain Goodison Park as the home for the women's team. With a capacity of 39,572, Goodison Park will become the largest dedicated women's football stadium in the country. This decision reflects the club's commitment to investing in the women's game and preserving the iconic stadium's legacy.</p>

          <p>Following recent trade talks between the US and China, both nations claimed victory after most of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs were removed. However, some analysts argue that Beijing emerged with the upper hand, reinforcing its geopolitical position and consolidating its status as a credible counterweight to Washington. China entered the negotiations from a position of strength, having learned from previous dealings with Trump and preparing for years. The real significance, therefore, lies in the performative dimension of power projection, which could prove more valuable over the long term than immediate economic gains.</p>

By openly flouting norms and enriching himself, Trump signals to his supporters that he is unafraid to challenge a system they believe is rigged against them. Experts suggest that Trump's ability to deflect accusations of corruption by attacking his opponents and framing Democratic policies as corrupt has contributed to his political success. This approach, while shocking to many, resonates with a segment of the electorate that views Trump's defiance as a sign of strength.</p>

          <p>The debate over "neoliberalism" continues within economic and political circles, particularly following Donald Trump's return to power in 2024. After his initial victory in 2016, many Democrats embraced a "post-neoliberal" approach, advocating for greater government intervention in the economy. However, Trump's recent restoration has led to renewed scrutiny of this approach, with some arguing that Biden's economic policies caused inflation and failed to resonate with working-class voters. The central question remains whether Democrats lost in 2024 despite, or because of, their embrace of post-neoliberalism.</p>

While U.S. inflation cooled slightly in April, analysts caution that this may be a temporary lull before import taxes begin to impact consumer prices. Despite a recent reduction in tariffs between the U.S. and China, economists warn that the remaining tariffs will likely stoke inflation while simultaneously denting economic growth. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation and has put interest rate cuts on hold until there is more clarity on the economic impact of Trump's policies.</p>

Options include taking out a HELOC as a safety net, downsizing and investing the proceeds, refinancing the mortgage for cash, or using a reverse mortgage for steady income. Experts advise carefully considering the terms and risks associated with each option, such as variable interest rates on HELOCs or potential foreclosure with reverse mortgages.
