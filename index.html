          <p>China's export growth experienced a slowdown in May, hitting a three-month low due to decreased shipments to the United States following the imposition of tariffs by President Trump. Exports to the U.S. fell nearly 12% from April, with overall export growth dropping from 8.1% to 4.8% year-on-year. These figures were released just before another round of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in London, highlighting the ongoing economic pressures. In response, Beijing has introduced stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts, to cushion the economic impact. Trump had lowered tariffs from 145% to 30% for 90 days to allow for talks while China also reduced its taxes on US goods from 125% to 10%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports to the United States experienced a sharp decline, dropping over 34% in May, marking the most significant decrease since February 2020. This decline contributed to an overall slowdown in China's export growth, despite increases in shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Imports from the U.S. also fell, leading to a reduced trade surplus between the two countries. The drop is attributed to the impact of tariffs, even after a temporary trade truce was implemented. The article notes that China's exports of rare earths decreased, while exports of cars and ships increased, and imports of soybeans surged. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasizes the importance of peaceful protests and the role of federal courts in resisting these developments. Reich calls on Americans to recognize the emerging infrastructure of a police state and to resist it non-violently. Reich is concerned about the future of the country.</p>

The consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, while producer price deflation deepened, falling 3.3%. A price war in the automotive industry and declining property prices have contributed to the downward pressure. Experts emphasize the need for more forceful stimulus measures to boost consumption.

          <p>A damaged North Korean warship has been moved to a drydock near the Russian border, prompting speculation about potential Russian involvement in its repair. Satellite images show the destroyer in Rajin, a port within North Korea's Rason special economic zone. Analysts suggest this location could facilitate deeper economic and military ties with Moscow. The warship sustained damage during its launch on May 21, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered its repair by the end of June. There are concerns that there is damage to sonar systems, and foreign assistance may be required. The future of this vessel remains in question.</p>
