          <p>Canadian officials are warning of challenging days ahead as they battle growing wildfires in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, exacerbated by hot and dry weather. Thousands have been evacuated, with states of emergency declared in both provinces; the entire city of Flin Flon in Manitoba has been mostly evacuated. Smoke from the fires has triggered air quality alerts in Canada and as far south as Chicago, affecting millions of people. Meteorologists predict that the hot, dry conditions will persist, worsening the wildfire situation in the immediate future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that the US will double its tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday, aiming to boost the local steel industry and decrease reliance on China. Trump also mentioned a $14 billion investment in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, although details remain unclear. While some steelworkers expressed optimism, economists warn that the tariffs could lead to global economic chaos and strained international relations. This move follows a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 250 million honeybees overturned in northwestern Washington state, resulting in the release of the insects. Authorities are urging people to avoid the area to prevent swarming and stings, while bee experts are working to contain the situation. The plan is to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen bee in the next day or two, with the goal of saving as many bees as possible. Honeybees play a critical role in pollination and food production, making their preservation vital.</p>

          <p>An off-duty NYPD officer was brutally assaulted in the Bronx, with the suspects allegedly escalating the attack upon learning he was a police officer. The incident has sparked discussions about use-of-force policies and whether they hinder officers' ability to protect themselves. Retired NYPD detectives are calling for justice and proactive measures to protect officers, citing concerns that current policies may dissuade officers from taking necessary action. The officer suffered severe injuries and will require reconstructive surgery, but has since been released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to reinstate an "asset test" for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants, requiring them to prove their assets total less than $2,000.

Health and disability advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing it would force vulnerable populations into extreme poverty. The "asset test" would go into effect on January 1, 2026, if approved.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to inflation and higher prices, leading to fewer international visitors and lower hotel occupancy rates.
