          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo regarding his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported by CBS News. This investigation follows the DOJ's decision to drop charges against current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, with both individuals competing for the mayoral position in the upcoming election. Cuomo's spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, stated that the former governor has not been contacted by law enforcement and maintains that Cuomo testified truthfully, suggesting the investigation is politically motivated. The probe adds another layer of complexity to the mayoral race, potentially influencing public perception and the dynamics of the election.</p>

          <p>The Toba Aquarium in central Japan offers a glimpse of sea otters, but this attraction is nearing its end as they are the last two in captivity in Japan, highlighting concerns for the species' future. Wild sea otter populations have declined due to hunting for their fur and environmental pollution, such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Breeding in captivity has been challenging, raising alarms among experts. The aquarium is making efforts to keep the otters healthy, including exercise during feeding, and streams their activities on YouTube. The article notes the importance of understanding why sea otters have become endangered, as rising sea temperatures due to global warming pose another threat.</p>

Johnson admitted to the crime at his 2013 trial, expressing remorse for his actions, though claiming he was under the influence of drugs at the time. Harris, a great-grandmother, suffered extensive burns and described the suspect before she died, with Johnson's execution taking place exactly 13 years after the attack. The Texas Attorney General's Office stated that Johnson's appeals were merely attempts to delay his legal death sentence.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will permit the use of COVID vaccines by adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions in the fall, but may require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. Agency leaders indicated that the additional doses offer ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù benefits to many young and middle-aged individuals who have already been vaccinated or have had COVID. The FDA anticipates the need for new clinical trials in which participants under 65 are randomly assigned to receive the new shots or a placebo. Some experts have expressed concern that the new criteria are overly restrictive and will deny the vaccine to many people who want it.</p>

Her stepfather, Peter Gregory Schuman, an attorney specializing in workers' compensation defense, is also charged in connection with the scheme.

The state will survey participants and examine retailer data to evaluate changes in spending habits. This decision signals a shift in nutrition policy, with other states like Iowa and Arkansas seeking similar waivers. Past resistance to these restrictions stemmed from concerns about feasibility and effectiveness, but the current administration views it as a way to promote healthier choices.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans for his "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to complete the ambitious project by the end of his term. The project, intended to protect against foreign missile threats, is estimated to cost between $175 billion and $542 billion. Trump expressed confidence in completing the project within three years, highlighting Canada's potential participation. The Golden Dome is designed to intercept missiles from any location, including space, and is overseen by Gen. Michael Guetlein of the Space Force. This initiative echoes President Reagan's "Star Wars" program, though experts note the technical and financial challenges of defending the vast U.S. territory.</p>

General Michael Guetlein of the US Space Force will oversee the implementation of the project.

The report attributes the increased demand to factors such as rising temperatures, emerging technologies, and large load sources like cryptocurrency mining operations. Electric grid operators are sounding alarms about potential strains on the system, with costs expected to rise significantly for households.

The report, examining 169 cases of suicide and serious self-harm, recommends assessing the safety of student halls and involving families more in post-death procedures. Specific recommendations include discouraging tributes in areas where a student has died to avoid creating "suicide locations." The review also calls for better support for struggling students and improved transparency in investigation processes. While some students report feeling supported by university staff, the review suggests that access to mental health services needs improvement, particularly for specific groups like international students.</p>

          <p>Japan's export growth slowed for the second consecutive month, according to government data released Wednesday, as the country grapples with tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. Export growth was 2%, in line with analysts' estimates, but the slowest since October of the previous year. Imports shrank by 2.2% year-over-year, less than the anticipated 4.5% decline. Japan faces a 25% levy on its auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S., along with baseline tariffs of 10% applied to most trade partners. The trade deficit narrowed to 115.8 billion yen, smaller than expected, with exports to China and the U.S. falling by 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed his chief spokesman to lead a review of the U.S. military's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The review aims to ensure accountability among senior military officials for the chaotic operation, which resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. troops and 170 civilians at Kabul International Airport. The selection of his chief spokesman to conduct such an inquiry was highly unusual and appeared to reflect a skepticism that uniformed military leaders would hold each other accountable. The review's scope is limited and will not include decisions leading up to the withdrawal, such as the deal made with the Taliban or the collapse of the Afghan military.</p>

          <p>Taku Eto has resigned as Japan's farm minister following controversy over comments that he does not buy rice because he receives it from supporters, sparking public anger amidst rising rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided to appoint former environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi as Eto's replacement. Eto's remarks came shortly after the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year. Eto, a leading expert on agricultural policy, previously served as farm minister under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>

          <p>CBS News released images showing the aftermath of an explosion at a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, three days after the incident. The explosion, believed to be intended for the American Reproductive Centers, resulted in the death of the suspect, 25-year-old Guy Bartkus, and injuries to four others. The blast pattern indicates the use of a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, with damages extending over a mile from the site. Investigators are piecing together the events leading up to the explosion, examining Bartkus' online activity to determine if he had any assistance in constructing the bomb.</p>

ICE is charging the woman $500 for every day she has remained in the U.S. since April 2005. The woman's attorney filed a motion to reopen her case in 2024, arguing she is eligible for residency due to residing in the U.S. for over 10 years with no criminal record, and is the mother of three U.S. citizen children. The attorney plans to appeal the fine, arguing the woman was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart the U.S.</p>

          <p>Japan's Agriculture Minister, Taku Eto, has resigned following public backlash over a remark he made regarding rice. Eto stated that he had "never had to buy rice" because supporters gave it to him, a statement that was considered insensitive given the current rice shortage and soaring prices in the country. Rice is a staple food in Japan, and Eto's comment was particularly ill-timed as the government has been implementing measures to curb rising prices. Public support for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has also declined sharply, with a poll indicating that most respondents view the government's response to rising rice prices as inadequate.</p>

A CBS News analysis reveals that millions of disabled students live in states without such mandates. Kira Tiller, who has epileptic seizures triggered by flashing lights, advocated for accommodations and created the organization Disabled Disrupters.

However, this total is still lower than the peak in 2018. Meanwhile, the number of international students in Japan reached a record high of 336,708, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, attributed to the popularity of Japanese subcultures and the yen's depreciation.

Lammy accused the Israeli government of "cruel and monstrous extremism" and said their actions are isolating Israel from its allies.

The Packers have proposed the ban, citing player safety and pace of play, while others argue the play is a "cheapo play" akin to a rugby scrum. The NFL's executive vice president of communications, however, stated that data does not support the claim that the play is unsafe.

Allegations included a confrontation with Suge Knight, the purchase of drugs, and a sex performance at Trump International Hotel & Tower. Combs has pleaded not guilty, with his lawyers arguing that his private conduct does not amount to sex trafficking.

The vaccine, a meningitis B vaccine, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhoea, which has seen a surge in cases, with over 85,000 in 2023. The NHS hopes this will reduce infections and combat antibiotic-resistant strains. Although not designed for gonorrhoea, the vaccine has been recommended by the JCVI and will be offered through sexual health services. This initiative marks a significant step in sexual health, potentially preventing thousands of cases and saving the NHS millions.</p>
