          <h2>Japanese Exports Decline for Second Consecutive Month Amid US Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year and missing economists' expectations. The decline is driven by reduced shipments to major partners, including a 4.7% drop to China and an 11.4% drop to the U.S. These figures intensify concerns that the export-reliant Japanese economy could enter a technical recession, especially as the U.S. prepares to implement a 25% tariff on August 1. The crucial automotive sector has been hit particularly hard, with exports to the U.S. plummeting by 26.7%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has begun against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders, with investors seeking over $8 billion in damages related to the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The lawsuit alleges that Meta failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse and violated a 2012 FTC consent order, leading to significant financial penalties. During the trial's opening, a privacy expert testified that Facebook's disclosures were misleading, while a former board member defended the company's actions. Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg are expected to testify.</p>

          <p>Vital companionship and support programs for socially isolated older adults could face significant funding cuts due to President Trump's recently passed domestic spending and tax bill. Programs like the Senior Companion Program, which provides crucial social interaction to prevent health risks such as dementia and heart disease, rely heavily on federal funding. Advocates and program directors express deep concern that these cuts could lead to increased institutionalization and higher mortality rates among the elderly. The Foundation for Social Connection is actively working to protect the funding for these essential services.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has called for the Trump administration to release all records related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, stating that "the time has come" for transparency while urging that victims' names be protected. His stance directly contrasts with President Trump, who has dismissed the matter as a "big hoax" orchestrated by Democrats. Pence refuted the idea that the issue is politically motivated, noting the investigation spanned multiple administrations. This development highlights a growing rift within the Republican party over how to handle the politically sensitive case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's justification for clawing back $7.9 billion in foreign aid, citing "waste, fraud, and abuse," is facing intense scrutiny from former and current officials. Paul Martin, the former USAID inspector general fired by Trump, stated that the administration has provided little to no proof for its claims, suggesting they are politically motivated. Anonymous USAID officials reported that program reviews were superficial, targeting keywords like "gender" or "climate" for termination rather than assessing effectiveness. This has raised concerns about the transparency and integrity of the process, with critics arguing it undermines life-saving humanitarian efforts.</p>

Her dismissal occurs amid growing pressure on the Justice Department, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, to release the "Epstein files."

          <p>A tsunami advisory for southern Alaska was canceled after being briefly issued following a 7.2 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday. The quake, which struck about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially prompted a more severe tsunami warning, leading to evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. Authorities later downgraded the alert, advising people to stay away from the water but confirming that large, widespread waves were not expected as the event occurred in shallow water. The region, located on the seismically active "Ring of Fire," experienced multiple aftershocks but no major damage was reported.</p>

Prices have increased by as much as 13% in some regions, driven by high demand and a shortage of affordable council-run options. The rising costs place a significant financial burden on working families, who often have to pay upfront before receiving any government benefits.

The lawsuit claims that freeholders received undisclosed fees from insurance companies for arranging building insurance, then passed these costs on to leaseholders through inflated service charges. Lawyers suggest each flat owner could be due up to £2,000 in compensation. The legal action targets several large freeholding companies, who deny any wrongdoing, and highlights a practice that may have become more profitable following the post-Grenfell spike in insurance costs.</p>

The legality of such a firing is unclear and would likely be challenged in court, potentially reaching the Supreme Court.

          <p>The United States has announced an agreement on "specific steps" to de-escalate violence in southern Syria, which has seen deadly sectarian clashes and retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. Israel's military struck the Syrian defense ministry in Damascus and other government targets after Syrian forces were deployed to the Druze province of Suweida, where fighting has killed over 300 people. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed confidence that the situation would end quickly, while Syria's foreign ministry welcomed the diplomatic efforts. The strikes caused significant damage in Damascus and exacerbated a dire humanitarian situation in Suweida.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic explores how President Trump's reversal on releasing the "Epstein files" has alienated some of his most ardent supporters. After years of fueling conspiracy theories about a "deep state" and promising transparency, Trump is now dismissing the Epstein issue as a "hoax" and lashing out at his own base. This has created a significant schism, as the Epstein case, unlike other issues, resonates widely and touches on core themes of Trump's anti-establishment appeal. The administration's contradictory statements and actions have only fueled more suspicion, revealing a potential limit to Trump's ability to control the narrative.</p>

          <p>Shares of online firearms retailer GrabAGun fell over 20% during their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which counts Donald Trump Jr. as a shareholder and advisor, went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Trump Jr. celebrated the public listing by ringing the opening bell, framing it as a "vindication" against 'woke' culture. The newly merged company, trading under the ticker PEW, raised $179 million in gross proceeds from the deal, but its poor initial performance marks a rocky start in the public market.

Following the leak, the government covertly set up a secret route to relocate those affected, spending £400 million so far. While the government claims the risk of harm was lower than feared, the incident is considered a catastrophic failure that increased the danger for many individuals.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace has been demoted from the prestigious Europa League to the lower-tier Conference League for breaching UEFA's multi-club ownership rules. The decision has prompted a group of Liberal Democrat MPs to ask the UK's culture secretary to intervene, calling the punishment "disgraceful" and disproportionately punitive. The issue stems from American businessman John Textor's ownership stakes in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. The club missed a deadline to restructure its ownership, leading to the demotion that fans and politicians have described as heart-breaking and unfair.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy story has grown into an uncontrollable force that not even President Trump can manage. After years of encouraging such narratives, Trump's recent attempts to dismiss the issue as a "hoax" have backfired, enraging his base and fueling further suspicion. The story's power lies in its blend of known facts, such as Epstein's crimes and connections, with the compelling mystery of a supposed unreleased client list. This has created a rare mass-attentional event that transcends partisan lines, making it an unstable and unpredictable political issue for all involved.</p>

          <p>An attempt by Nebraska lawmakers to repeal a state law that bans people with drug convictions from receiving federal food assistance has narrowly failed. The policy is a remnant of the "war on drugs" era, and while many states have opted out of the federal ban, Nebraska continues to enforce it. Proponents of the repeal argued that the ban creates barriers for individuals re-entering society and trying to rebuild their lives. The failure to pass the reform means that this restriction on accessing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will remain in place for individuals with prior drug convictions in the state.</p>

The plan, which offers a settlement fund of up to $235 million, will now go to a vote by the remaining claimants.
