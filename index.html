          <p>Following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for Iran to return to the negotiating table, emphasizing the grave threat Iran's nuclear program poses to international security and the need for regional stability. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds affirmed the UK's support for preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, noting Iran's unwillingness to engage in diplomatic efforts. Iran's ambassador to the UK condemned the US attack as a violation of the UN charter, while Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated Iran's nuclear program had been hit "substantially" following joint Israeli and US strikes. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency reported no increase in off-site radiation.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, proposes offering a Â£10,000 bonus to new army recruits after completing training and serving for two years in an effort to boost troop numbers amid concerns about global instability. The plan also includes offering former armed services personnel a Â£20,000 payment to return for two additional years of service, aiming to increase the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to over 73,000. The Lib Dems plan to fund the scheme, limited to 3,000 personnel, through an increase of the Digital Services Tax, expecting defense spending to rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. Labour criticized the proposal, pointing out Davey's involvement in previous troop cuts during the coalition government.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with reports indicating that B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles were used. Trump warned Iran against retaliating, stating that failure to make peace would result in "far greater" attacks, while also claiming the U.S. is not seeking regime change. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed no increase in off-site radiation levels following the strikes, and Homeland Security officials are monitoring for potential reprisals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following US strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran, details are emerging about the targets and weapons used. The US bombed Fordo, a uranium enrichment plant hidden in a remote mountainside, as well as sites at Natanz and Isfahan, with reports suggesting the use of GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) at Fordo. While Iranian officials confirmed the strikes, they denied major damage, with both Saudi Arabia and the IAEA reporting no increase in radiation levels. Iran's foreign minister condemned the US strike, reserving the right to respond, as experts suggest potential Iranian retaliatory actions could range from diplomatic engagement to military strikes on US bases.</p>

          <p>Global markets are bracing for reaction to the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, with investors closely watching developments and assessing the fallout.

Domestically, Germany's Day of Industry event will provide insights into the country's economic growth.

          <p>The article examines how Latinos' voting patterns shift when their community is perceived to be under threat, referencing the recent immigration raids in Los Angeles and Trump's deployment of military forces. While Latinos often prioritize economic issues, they tend to coalesce as an ethnic voting bloc when they sense a serious threat to their community, as seen in the past with Proposition 187 in 1994. The article notes that Trump's recent actions, including the treatment of Senator Alex Padilla, may be undermining his support among Latino voters. The author concludes that both Democrats and Republicans need to understand the full dimensions of Latino political identity.</p>

          <p>While California Governor Gavin Newsom has garnered attention for his nationally broadcast speech criticizing President Trump, it may be premature to overstate his standing in the 2028 presidential race. Although Newsom's speech resonated with Democrats, he faces challenges such as rampant homelessness, an exploding budget deficit, and vast income inequality in California. The fundamentals of the 2028 race remain unchanged, and it is still uncertain whether Democrats will embrace another nominee from the liberal environment of San Francisco. The 2026 midterm elections will provide a clearer picture of the political landscape.</p>

The White House defends ICE officers' actions, while Vice President JD Vance criticizes local officials for speaking out against the immigration sweeps.

Many providers, particularly those who are immigrants themselves, are taking extra precautions, such as adding extra locks, canceling field trips, and collecting emergency contact information for children. The fear has also led to a drop in attendance, as parents are hesitant to leave their children due to the risk of being detained. Providers are seeking guidance on how to respond if ICE agents arrive at their facilities and what to do if a parent disappears.</p>

          <p>Confusion surrounds the various federal agencies involved in immigration arrests in Los Angeles, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). These agencies, all branches of the Department of Homeland Security, have different missions related to immigration enforcement, border security, and criminal investigations. Recent sightings of federal agents without identifying clothing or badges have raised concerns, prompting officials to clarify that agents identify themselves verbally and wear vests with their agency's name. The article details the specific roles and responsibilities of each agency in the region.</p>

He also delves into the phenomenon of billionaire doomsday preppers, who are spending vast sums on bunkers and escape plans, reflecting a "gilded despair."

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people. Iranian missiles impacted multiple sites across Israel, including Haifa and Tel Aviv, with searches underway for those trapped under rubble. The IDF reports Iran launched approximately 30 missiles, hours after President Trump announced the U.S. military had struck three of Iran's nuclear sites. Since the beginning of Israel's "Operation Rising Lion" against Iran, Iran has fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel.</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade have accelerated the shift towards telehealth and self-managed options.
