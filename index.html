          <p>A statistical analysis of the two-year Israel-Hamas war reveals the profound devastation experienced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The conflict, which began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in one out of every ten people being killed or injured and has displaced nine out of ten residents. Infrastructure has been decimated, with eight out of every ten buildings and nine out of every ten homes damaged or destroyed, alongside the majority of cropland. The report underscores the immense human and structural toll of the prolonged military campaign.</p>

          <p>Billionaire tech investor Orlando Bravo has stated that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently "at a bubble," drawing comparisons to the dot-com era. He highlighted a key difference, noting that today's AI businesses are being financed by large, established companies with healthy balance sheets. However, Bravo expressed skepticism about the sustainability of current market values, questioning how a company with $50 million in recurring revenue can justify a $10 billion valuation given the immense cash flow required to generate returns.

          <p>A post on The Wartburg Watch, a Christian blog, played a crucial role in exposing decades-old child abuse committed by Robert Preston Morris, the founder of Gateway Church. The article, which featured a survivor's story, garnered national attention and ultimately led to Morris's resignation and a guilty plea to five counts of lewd acts with a child. The case highlights the growing influence of independent online platforms in holding powerful figures within religious communities accountable, drawing parallels to reckonings in other major denominations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering denying back pay to some of the 600,000 furloughed federal workers when the current government shutdown concludes. This potential action is based on a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget that offers a legal interpretation challenging a 2019 law designed to guarantee such payments. The move is widely seen as a political strategy to increase pressure on Democrats to approve a government funding bill without the health care subsidy extensions they have demanded.</p>

With the EU being the UK's most significant export market for steel, representing nearly £3 billion in trade, the new measures could be devastating for British companies. The EU's proposal aims to protect its own steel industry from inexpensive imports and global overcapacity, particularly from countries like China and Turkey. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article delves into why Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries, a persistent issue the Trump administration aims to address. The primary reason is the fragmented U.S. healthcare market, which lacks a single national entity to negotiate prices, unlike countries with nationalized health systems. President Trump's "most favored nation" policy seeks to tie U.S. drug prices to the lowest prices paid by comparable nations, though experts caution that undisclosed rebates in other countries make true price comparisons difficult.</p>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in the UK has announced it will appeal a chief magistrate's decision to dismiss a terrorism-related charge against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the rap group Kneecap. The case, involving the alleged display of a flag supporting the proscribed organization Hezbollah, was thrown out on a technicality because consent for the prosecution was granted one day after the six-month statutory time limit had expired. The CPS argues that an important point of law needs clarification from a higher court.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has officially named Tropical Storm Jerry, the tenth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed over the central Atlantic. The system is currently far from any landmass but is moving westward and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane over the next few days. While a direct landfall is not anticipated, the storm is expected to pass near the northern Leeward Islands, generating life-threatening surf and rip currents for the area later this week.</p>

          <p>When questioned about a potential presidential pardon for convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, President Trump responded noncommittally, stating he would "have to take a look at it." This remark followed the Supreme Court's decision to reject Maxwell's appeal of her 20-year sentence. The president's ambiguity prompted a swift and public warning from far-right influencer Laura Loomer, a staunch ally, who urged him on social media not to consider a pardon, claiming it would be a politically irrecoverable act.</p>
