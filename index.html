          <p>The Trump administration has officially confirmed new "reciprocal" tariffs on numerous countries, with rates varying from 10% to 41% based on the trading partner. A significant new measure imposes an additional 40% duty on any goods determined to have been transshipped to circumvent original tariffs. This executive order is designed to close loopholes in trade enforcement and increase pressure on international trading partners. The updated rates are scheduled to take effect seven days after the order's signing, aiming to reshape global trade dynamics.</p>

Authorities identified him as 26-year-old Dakota Hawver, who killed three people and injured three others in what appears to be a random attack in the casino's parking lot. Hawver, who had no prior criminal or mental health history, fired approximately 80 rounds from a legally purchased handgun. The community and local officials have expressed their sorrow over the tragic event, which adds to the nation's epidemic of gun violence.</p>

          <p>During a state legislative hearing, the emergency manager for Kerr County, Texas, admitted he was sick and asleep when catastrophic flash floods struck on July 4, killing at least 135 people. The hearing examined the preparedness and response to the disaster, which heavily impacted campers and residents along the Guadalupe River. Survivors shared harrowing stories of the rapidly rising waters and criticized the lack of timely warnings and assistance. The testimony has raised serious questions about leadership and systemic failures during the crisis, prompting calls for improved disaster response protocols.</p>

          <p>Michael Donilon, a long-serving advisor to former President Joe Biden, testified to a House committee that he could have earned up to $8 million if Biden had secured re-election in 2024. The testimony was part of an ongoing investigation by the House Oversight Committee into allegations of a cover-up regarding the former president's health. Donilon defended Biden's capabilities, stating his communication skills grew stronger in office, and suggested that critics overreacted to his debate performance.

          <p>The perpetrator of a deadly office shooting in Manhattan, who killed four people, legally obtained a concealed carry permit in Nevada despite a history of mental health incidents. The 27-year-old gunman purchased the AR-15 style rifle used in the attack from a coworker and legally bought a handgun with his permit. The incident highlights the stark differences between state gun laws, as it is illegal to possess such weapons in New York, sparking renewed calls for a national assault weapon ban. Legal experts note the difficulty of enforcing state-level restrictions on weapons transported across state lines.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Edward Zakrzewski for the 1994 machete killings of his wife and two young children, marking the state's ninth execution this year. This sets a new record for the highest number of executions in Florida in a single year since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Zakrzewski committed the murders after his wife sought a divorce. In his final words, he thanked the state for what he sarcastically called a humane and efficient death. The execution proceeds despite appeals that highlighted his military service and a non-unanimous jury recommendation for his death sentence.</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong third-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales. The company's overall revenue grew by 10%, its most significant quarterly growth since December 2021, leading to a rise in its stock price. The Mac division also saw robust growth of nearly 15%, while the services business continued its steady expansion. Despite weaker sales for iPads and wearables, Apple saw a reversal of recent declines in the crucial China market, with sales there rising 4% annually.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reviving the presidential fitness test, a program first initiated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 to address concerns about the physical fitness of American youth compared to their European counterparts. The test typically assessed cardiovascular fitness, strength, and flexibility through exercises like a one-mile run and sit-ups. The article provides historical context, noting Eisenhower's original motivation was linked to national security and military preparedness. However, it also points to modern data suggesting that child health metrics in the U.S. have worsened significantly over the decades despite such programs.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the cybersecurity director under the Biden administration, had her appointment to a distinguished chair position at West Point rescinded. The decision by the Secretary of the Army came after a pro-Trump activist, Laura Loomer, publicly criticized the hire on social media, accusing Easterly of undermining the Trump administration. Easterly described the rescission as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." The incident is the latest example of a former Biden official facing professional consequences amid heightened political polarization and pressure from online activists.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing division, posted 18% revenue growth in the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's recent trade policy decisions are motivated more by a form of warped idealism than his proclaimed "America First" economic strategy. The article points to punitive tariffs against Brazil, seemingly in defense of ally Jair Bolsonaro, and threats against Canada over its stance on Palestinian statehood as examples. These actions use U.S. economic power to achieve non-economic, personal, and political goals, which contradicts Trump's original promise to avoid foreign entanglements. This approach risks alienating allies and ultimately harming U.S. consumers and credibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current elevated interest rate environment, this article compares the earnings potential of high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts for a $20,000 deposit. While both offer significantly better returns than traditional savings, high-yield savings accounts currently tend to have a slight edge on interest rates, potentially earning slightly more over time. However, the difference is often negligible, and the choice may come down to other features, such as the check-writing capabilities typically offered by money market accounts. Savers are advised to compare specific account features and current rates to determine the best fit for their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>
