          <p>A large portion of the Southern United States, stretching from Texas to the Carolinas, is under threat from multiple rounds of severe weather this weekend, impacting over 40 million Americans. The storms may bring damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes, with some areas already experiencing torrential rain and flash flooding. Following reports of at least nine tornadoes in Texas and Oklahoma on Friday, the severe weather threat is expected to continue into Sunday and Monday, posing significant risks to areas including Oklahoma City and Dallas, with residents urged to stay informed and prepared. The potential for very large hail and destructive wind gusts remains a major concern as the storms progress. The optimism score is relatively low due to the widespread threat and potential for damage and injuries.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism at the 157th Belmont Stakes in Saratoga Springs, New York, marking a repeat of the Kentucky Derby's top finishers. Sovereignty, with jockey Junior Alvarado, secured the win on a fast track after earlier rain, while Journalism finished second and Baeza third, mirroring the Derby's results. This victory makes Sovereignty the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness Stakes, and then win the Belmont; the last horse to win both the Derby and Belmont, while running all three legs of the Triple Crown, was Thunder Gulch in 1995. The Belmont was held at Saratoga due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles.</p>

          <p>A dispute between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has amplified uncertainty surrounding NASA's budget, which is facing significant cuts. The proposed budget slashes funding for science projects, potentially leading to the termination of numerous ongoing and developing missions. While funding for astronaut missions to Mars has increased, other sectors face savings, raising concerns about the agency's overall focus and long-term planning. Critics argue the cuts could undermine international collaborations and hinder efforts to monitor climate change, while supporters claim the budget provides NASA with a clearer purpose.</p>

Budget airlines maintain their policies comply with the law and keep fares low, but pressure is mounting for fairer and more consistent rules to reduce passenger confusion and unexpected fees.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Elon Musk would face "serious consequences" if he supports Democratic candidates who challenge Republicans supporting the "big, beautiful bill." Trump also indicated that his relationship with Musk is likely over after their recent public feud. He accused Musk of being "disrespectful to the office of the president" and highlighted the breaks he gave Musk during his first administration. Trump's remarks signal a further deterioration of their relationship and the potential repercussions for Musk's business ventures.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are scrambling to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity rules, as inspectors conduct checks on office modesty, meal receipts, and lavish gifts.
