          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized judges Hannah Dugan and Joel Cano, who were arrested for allegedly assisting undocumented immigrants, some of whom were accused of violent crimes, in evading arrest. Bondi dismissed accusations that the Trump administration was intimidating judges, asserting that no one is above the law, including judges. Judge Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant charged with domestic abuse evade ICE officers, while Judge Cano is accused of destroying evidence related to an alleged gang member. Wisconsin's governor and Milwaukee's mayor criticized the arrests, while Bondi defended the administration's actions as necessary to protect citizens. </p>

          <p>Amazon sellers are raising prices on hundreds of goods due to tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, with average price hikes nearing 30%. A price analysis software tool shows that costs have risen on various items, including tech accessories and women's clothing. Other e-commerce sites like Shein and Temu are also increasing prices to offset higher import costs after the U.S. closed a duty-free loophole.

They contend that the nonprofit's mission to ensure AI benefits all of humanity is invaluable and cannot be sold for any amount of money. The scholars are urging the attorneys general of California and Delaware to intervene, arguing that the move would violate the nonprofit's fiduciary duty.

Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest by directing him through a non-public exit. This arrest highlights the ongoing tension between federal immigration enforcement and local courts, particularly in "sanctuary cities" where cooperation with federal deportation efforts is limited.

          <p>Joseph Koenig was found guilty of first-degree murder for throwing a rock that killed Alexa Bartell in Colorado. The jury also convicted Koenig on other charges related to rock-throwing attacks on other vehicles. Two co-defendants testified against Koenig as part of their plea agreements. The defense argued that Koenig's actions constituted manslaughter, not murder, while the prosecution emphasized the intentional nature of his actions. Koenig's sentencing is scheduled for June 3, and sentencing hearings for the co-defendants are scheduled for the following week.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article explores how pornography has shaped American culture, influencing attitudes towards women, sexual openness, and cruelty. The author interviews Sophie Gilbert, who argues that certain types of porn have normalized regressive and dehumanizing behavior. Gilbert also notes that the mainstreaming of sexual openness can sometimes obscure the more problematic aspects of the industry. She suggests that stories that affirm people's humanity and complexity can serve as an antidote to a culture saturated with porn.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves suggested that the UK's trade relationship with the EU is arguably "more important" than its relationship with the US. Despite ongoing talks with the US, Reeves emphasized the importance of rebuilding trading relationships with European neighbors. She noted the government is preparing for a summit with the EU to "reset" the relationship.
