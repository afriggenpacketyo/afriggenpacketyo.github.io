          <p>During a visit to a U.S. Park Police facility in Washington D.C., former President Donald Trump promoted his administration's federal crackdown on crime in the city. While flanked by top officials, he declared the operation a success and also made extensive, unrelated remarks about his intention to re-grass the city's parks to resemble his personal golf courses, citing his expertise in turf management. The visit occurs amid a controversial federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department, which has drawn criticism from local officials who dispute the administration's claims about crime rates and its methods, including the use of federal agents for immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a legislative package that will place a proposal on a special November ballot to redraw the state's congressional maps. The move is a direct response to Republican-led efforts in Texas, encouraged by Donald Trump, to gerrymander maps in their favor. If approved by voters, the California plan could create up to five new Democratic-held seats in the U.S. House, effectively neutralizing the gains Republicans seek in Texas. The decision marks a significant escalation in the national political battle over electoral maps ahead of the midterm elections and a departure from California's use of an independent redistricting commission.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite a strong quarterly performance and an increased forecast for full-year sales and earnings. Simon highlighted Walmart's success in growing its top-line revenue and expanding margins while effectively managing the impact of tariffs, stating the company is "hitting it on all cylinders." He suggested that investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by restructuring costs rather than a systemic issue. Simon now believes Walmart's combination of low prices and convenience has created a sustainable advantage in attracting and retaining shoppers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global race to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is intensifying. China and Russia are currently considered the leaders in this advanced weapons technology, having invested heavily in their programs while Western nations were focused on counter-terrorism efforts. The United States and the United Kingdom are now increasing investment to catch up, with the U.S. debuting its "Dark Eagle" weapon. Experts note that the primary threat from these weapons lies in the difficulty of detection and interception, which could alter strategic timeframes in a conflict and create ambiguity over whether an attack is conventional or nuclear.</p>

          <h2>American Midfielder Dante Polvara's Standout Performance Sparks Aberdeen Comeback in Europa League</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 19:09:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aberdeen midfielder Dante Polvara made a significant impact in a Europa League playoff match, coming off the bench to score a crucial goal and lead his team to a 2-2 draw against FCSB. The 25-year-old American, who has been used sparingly this season, entered the game with his team down 2-0 and immediately revived their hopes with a skillfully taken goal just three minutes later. His energetic performance, which included creating multiple chances and winning most of his duels, has intensified calls for manager Jimmy Thelin to give him a starting role. Polvara's future at the club is currently under discussion, with his contract expiring at the end of the season.</p>

          <p>An active shooter alert that prompted a lockdown and a major law enforcement response at Villanova University's law school was determined to be a hoax. The university's president, Rev.

The false report, an act known as "swatting," is being investigated by the Delaware County District Attorney's Office and the FBI. This event occurred on the same day as another unfounded active shooter scare at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga, highlighting a concerning trend of malicious false alarms targeting educational institutions.</p>

While the court upheld the finding that Trump was liable for fraud, it deemed the massive financial penalty excessive and a likely violation of constitutional protections against severe punishment. The original ruling from Judge Arthur Engoron included a $355 million fine, which grew to over $500 million with interest. Non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state for three years, were kept in place by the appellate decision, which the New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>Software company Workday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, but its stock declined in after-hours trading. The company's guidance for the upcoming quarter was in line with estimates, and CEO Carl Eschenbach warned of challenges in its business with state and local governments due to uncertainty around funding. He also noted that the higher education sector is facing pressure from the Trump administration's plan to shut down the Department of Education. For the full fiscal year, Workday projects total revenue of approximately $9.52 billion, aligning with market consensus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alina Habba, a former lawyer for Donald Trump, is unlawfully holding the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Chief U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann found that the Trump administration's maneuvers to keep her in the role without Senate confirmation did not comply with federal law. Habba's interim appointment had legally expired in July, and the administration's subsequent efforts to reinstall her were deemed invalid. The judge has disqualified her from ongoing prosecutions but has put the order on hold to allow for an appeal from the administration.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic Ocean, away from the North Carolina coastline. Although the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it generated life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast, prompting warnings for beachgoers to stay out of the water. Storm surge warnings and evacuation orders remained in effect for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks, which experienced tropical storm conditions. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will gradually weaken over the next few days and is expected to become a post-tropical storm by Saturday.</p>

He also revealed that for a time he personally donated money to families who reached out to him on social media after being affected by the raids.

          <p>In a major expansion of its immigration policies, the Trump administration is reviewing the records of all 55 million foreign nationals who currently hold valid U.S. visas. The State Department announced that all visa holders are now subject to "continuous vetting" for any information that could make them ineligible, including criminal activity or indications of overstaying their visa. If such evidence is found, the visa will be revoked, and the individual could face deportation if already in the country. This policy follows a related announcement that immigration officials will now also review social media for "anti-American" views when vetting applicants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wealthy investors are increasingly using a tax strategy known as a 351 conversion to defer capital gains on highly appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, which legally postpones the tax liability until the ETF shares are sold. While some financial advisors praise the method for its effectiveness, the article notes there are strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, typically around $1 million. The strategy also has potential downsides, such as limited flexibility once the assets are converted into the specific ETF. (not investment advice)</p>

The rebranding is part of a broader effort by the 55-year-old restaurant chain to modernize its image and menu to stay relevant. In a statement, the company assured customers that its values remain unchanged and that the character, "Uncle Herschel," will still be featured in its restaurants. (not investment advice)</p>
