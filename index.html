          <p>In an interview, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul explained his support for a significant legislative package, emphasizing its funding for border security, the Department of Defense, and the extension of tax cuts. He dismissed concerns about the bill's impact on Medicaid and the federal deficit, arguing that the tax cuts would stimulate revenue through dynamic scoring. McCaul also addressed national security, stating that recent military action against Iran has enhanced deterrence and that the FBI is actively monitoring potential threats from sleeper cells within the United States. He asserted the bill is crucial for the country and that Republican lawmakers risk their re-election if they vote against it. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This op-ed argues that the United States is critically vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems. China's control over the global supply chain, accounting for over 90% of refining capacity, gives it the ability to weaponize this dependence, as seen with recent export controls. The article criticizes years of U.S. inaction and suggests that recent diplomatic agreements are only temporary fixes that do not address the core problem. It calls for a sustained, coherent national strategy to build a secure, independent supply chain to counter China's geopolitical leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The SÃ¡ttÃ­tla Highlands in northeastern California, a sacred area for the Pit River Tribe, was recently designated a national monument by President Biden, protecting nearly 230,000 acres from industrial development. This victory for the tribe and environmental groups is now under threat, as former President Trump has stated his intention to undo the designation to open the land for economic use. Legal experts are debating whether a president has the authority to completely rescind a monument, setting the stage for a potential legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court if the administration moves forward with the rollback.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has publicly called for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, posting "MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!" on his social media platform. His plea comes as the Israeli military ordered new evacuations in northern Gaza. In separate posts, Trump also criticized the ongoing corruption trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling it a "POLITICAL WITCH HUNT" that interferes with negotiations. This intervention in an ally's domestic legal and foreign policy matters is considered unusual, adding another layer to the complex diplomatic situation.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," explores the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the modern conservative movement. The article details how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," catalyzed a political shift that elevated figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. The book argues that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics that reshaped the Republican Party. It also suggests that Buckley's intellectual and populist groundwork ultimately paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government was forced to make a significant U-turn on its flagship welfare reform bill after facing a rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. The original plans included controversial cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) aimed at saving Â£5 billion annually. Following intense criticism that the changes would harm vulnerable and disabled people, the government announced major concessions, including limiting Pip cuts to new claimants. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had to learn from the mishandled rollout of the bill.</p>

These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, can be their authentic selves, are genuinely curious about each other's inner worlds, and take accountability for their mistakes. The article explains that negative answers to these questions can indicate a lack of emotional intimacy, trust, and mutual support.

          <h2>BeyoncÃ© Faces Criticism for Wearing Shirt with Language Deemed Anti-Indigenous</h2>

          <p>BeyoncÃ© is facing backlash after wearing a T-shirt during a performance that featured a description of the historic Buffalo Soldiers, which framed "warring Indians" and "Mexican revolutionaries" as enemies. Indigenous influencers and fans criticized the superstar for promoting anti-Indigenous language and a one-sided historical narrative that ignores the U.S. Army's role in the subjugation of Native peoples. The controversy highlights the complexities of reclaiming American history, as the Buffalo Soldiers, comprised of Black soldiers, are a source of pride in Black history but also participated in violent campaigns against Indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will consider the "most appropriate" governing framework for his coalition following a critical upper house election in July. The ruling coalition is fighting to retain its majority amid voter frustration over persistent inflation, stagnant wages, and economic uncertainty. Ishiba called securing a majority a "must-attain" goal but acknowledged it will be challenging. The election will serve as a public verdict on his minority government, which has had to rely on opposition support to pass legislation since losing its lower house majority.
