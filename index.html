          <p>A recent report by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates that the "true rate" of unemployment in April stood at 24.3%, significantly higher than the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate of 4.2%. LISEP's measure includes not only unemployed workers but also those seeking full-time employment who are unable to find it, as well as individuals stuck in poverty-wage jobs. This measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion. The report highlights that Hispanic, Black, and women workers are disproportionately affected by functional unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments on Gaza, calling for a swift end to the war, signal a shift in attitude toward Israel's actions. This shift aligns with increasing criticism from other allies, including Germany, Britain, and France, who have expressed concerns over Israel's expanded attacks in Gaza. These countries are placing overt pressure on Israel, with Britain suspending trade negotiations and France organizing a conference to discuss a Palestinian state. The article suggests that Israel's strongest partners are beginning to lose patience with Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Mass federal cuts initiated by the Trump administration are disrupting wildfire recovery efforts in Los Angeles, affecting agencies such as AmeriCorps, FEMA, the EPA, and the Small Business Administration. These cuts have led to staff layoffs, reduced disaster aid, and hindered debris cleanup efforts. The loss of AmeriCorps volunteers has impacted direct assistance to wildfire survivors, while cuts to the SBA may make it harder for businesses and homeowners to secure disaster loans. Critics argue that these cuts are shifting the burden of disaster preparedness onto state and local governments.</p>
