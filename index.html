          <p>A surge in data center construction to meet the growing demands of artificial intelligence is expected to significantly increase electricity consumption in the U.S., potentially raising electricity bills for consumers. A report from Schneider Electric projects a 16% increase in electricity demand by 2029, largely due to data centers which require substantial power for computing and cooling. As utilities build new infrastructure to meet this demand, they are likely to raise rates, impacting everyday households while tech companies may benefit from favorable deals. Experts also warn that this increased energy demand could strain the reliability of the electrical grid (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A battle for influence over President Trump's foreign policy is occurring within the American right, pitting traditional hawks against an "America First" faction.

This faction has challenged the hawkish consensus in Washington, questioning involvement in NATO and potential conflicts with China and Iran.

          <p>European leaders are showing renewed interest in Southeast Asia as an alternative ally amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for stronger ties between the two regions, noting shared challenges and the potential for a "new special relationship." Southeast Asia offers Europe access to defense markets, diversified supply chains, and essential raw materials, but analysts doubt Europe can surpass the established influence of the U.S. or China without significantly increasing trade ties and investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland will begin exporting up to 100 truckloads of waste per day to England due to an upcoming landfill ban on biodegradable municipal waste. The Scottish government acknowledges that there are currently not enough incinerators to handle the extra demand, creating a "capacity gap." While the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the short-term impact will be a rise in emissions from transporting the waste. The long-term strategy involves increasing recycling rates and using more energy-from-waste incinerators, but domestic recycling rates have seen minimal improvement in recent years.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is pushing forward with plans to cut the benefits bill by Â£5 billion by 203, despite potential rebellion within the Labour Party. The measures include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for disabled individuals with less severe conditions. While some Labour MPs have expressed concerns, the prime minister insists the system needs reform, as it is not working for those needing support or for taxpayers. The proposals could impact up to 1.3 million people and potentially push an additional 250,000 people into relative poverty.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of this century due to global warming. As warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart, it can refreeze and accumulate downstream, leading to destructive flooding. The study, based on 160 years of data, suggests that while climate warming is decreasing ice jam flood frequency overall, it is shifting the hotspots downstream, threatening coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. The Yellow River, known for its history of devastating floods, faces increasing risks from these localized hazards.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an expansion of the detention and deportation of migrants across the country, targeting sanctuary cities and directing federal agencies to increase their efforts. The order comes amid ongoing protests against Trump's immigration policies, with the president calling for the "largest mass deportation programme in history." This follows a pause on raids targeting farms, hotels, restaurants, and meatpacking plants, and signals a renewed focus on deporting undocumented migrants (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A rare copy of the first complete translation of the Bible into Welsh, printed in 1588, will be displayed in Wales for the first time at St Davids Cathedral. Translated by Bishop William Morgan, the book has been kept in Westminster Abbey's library collection and will be on public display from June 17 to July 9. This edition, commissioned to provide scriptures in a language people understood, is in remarkably good condition compared to other copies used regularly in Wales. The display is considered a special treasure of the Welsh language and heritage.</p>
