          <p>Primary school teacher Alice Cole returned to work part-time after having her first child and emphasizes the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents in addressing teacher recruitment and retention issues. She believes offering flexibility allows teachers to confidently balance their personal and professional lives, which is especially crucial given the recent data showing a decline in the number of new teachers entering the profession. Computer science teacher Sam Alner highlights the challenge of balancing work-life balance and the potential for burnout, especially in disadvantaged schools that struggle to recruit teachers in specialist subjects. Overall, the article underscores the need for schools to offer flexible working options to retain experienced staff and attract new talent, ensuring that all students have access to quality education. The future of education hinges on supporting teachers' needs.</p>

          <p>Following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations and numerous arrests, protests erupted across Los Angeles, leading President Trump to order the deployment of National Guard troops to the county. ICE operations, which targeted employers using fictitious documents, sparked demonstrations and clashes between law enforcement and protestors. Among those detained was a regional president of the Service Employees International Union, further fueling the unrest. The deployment of the National Guard under Title 10 authority has drawn criticism from local officials, who view it as an inflammatory move that will escalate tensions. The situation underscores the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the federal government's response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have discovered that the rare mineral tellurium can be used to create an artificial retina, restoring sight in blind animals and providing them with the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, details how tellurium nanowire implants were used in a biocompatible device to restore vision in mice and a monkey. Tellurium's photoelectric properties allow it to convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, making it a potential replacement for damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. This breakthrough offers hope for treating human blindness and potentially enhancing vision beyond normal capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to send National Guard troops to Los Angeles under Title 10 authority has sparked legal debate and criticism, with Governor Gavin Newsom opposing the move. Title 10 allows the activation of National Guard troops for federal service, but critics argue that using the military to quell protests is an abuse of power. The ACLU has raised concerns about the use of the military domestically, citing restrictions on providing direct assistance to civilian law enforcement. Some fear Trump may also invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to federalize National Guard units to suppress insurrections, though experts caution this should be reserved for extreme circumstances. The situation raises questions about executive power and the appropriate response to protests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, offering a fresh approach to China's deepening demographic challenges. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong argue that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. The findings are particularly relevant as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study also found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women to perform most childcare duties persist in China and other East Asian countries, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>A British woman, Alicia Kemp, has been charged in Australia over the death of Thanh Phan, whom she allegedly hit while riding an e-scooter after consuming alcohol. Kemp, who had a blood alcohol content level of 0.158, is charged with death by dangerous driving while under the influence, which carries a maximum 20-year prison term. The incident has prompted Perth's city council to suspend the use of hire e-scooters, and Western Australia's police minister is reviewing e-scooter regulations. The family of the deceased called for a review of safety regulations around the use of hire e-scooters.</p>

          <p>NTT Docomo, a Japanese telecom giant, will retire its original set of emoji after 26 years, as they have "fulfilled their role" in shaping digital communication. The Docomo emoji, introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, gained massive popularity in Japan before spreading globally. New mobile phones will adopt Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji instead. The company's i-mode service, which introduced the emojis, is also planned to be terminated in 2026. The set of 176 emoji was included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b, molecules typically produced by living organisms on Earth. However, subsequent research by multiple teams challenges these findings, citing noisy data and modeling issues. These teams found insufficient evidence of DMS or DMDS and suggest other molecules, like ethane, could fit the same profile, but do not signify life. The original study's lead author maintains that DMS remains a promising candidate, although more observations are required for confirmation, sparking ongoing scientific discourse and highlighting the challenges in detecting biosignatures on distant planets.</p>
