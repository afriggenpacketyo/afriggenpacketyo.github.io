          <p>Thousands of protesters gathered in Budapest to demonstrate against Prime Minister Viktor Orb치n's government, citing concerns over anti-democratic practices and alleged corruption. Speakers criticized a recent law effectively banning public LGBTQ+ events and a draft bill that could blacklist critical media and NGOs, viewing these measures as authoritarian tactics to silence opposition. The demonstration, attended by writers, actors, musicians, and journalists, reflects growing resistance to Orb치n's leadership as national elections approach in 2026. Protesters believe support for Orb치n is waning, expressing hope for a change in government after 16 years.</p>

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that the tariffs imposed by President Trump can remain in effect until at least the end of July, pending further legal proceedings. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that had blocked the tariffs. The ruling extends a legal battle over the president's trade policies. The tariffs, which have been in place on imports from various countries, have faced criticism and legal challenges (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported and later returned to the U.S., stated that his case is about defending constitutional protections. Chris Newman, representing Abrego Garcia's family, said the case is a potential turning point in the erosion of due process rights. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador despite a judge's ruling, and the Trump administration admitted the deportation was an administrative error. The case has sparked debate about immigration and due process.</p>
