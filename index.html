          <p>Cassie Ventura, the star witness in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sexual assault and racketeering case, testified about the alleged abuse she endured during their relationship. She claimed that Combs coerced her into participating in "freak-off" sessions, which he then used as blackmail to control her. Ventura also recounted instances of violence, including being hit in the head and thrown onto a bed, resulting in injuries. She described how the trauma led her to contemplate suicide and seek professional help, eventually settling a lawsuit against Combs for $20 million. The trial continues to reveal disturbing details of their relationship and its impact on Ventura's life.</p>

          <p>Smartmatic has accused Fox News and Fox Corp of orchestrating the destruction of text messages related to the 2020 election claims that led to a multibillion-dollar defamation lawsuit. Smartmatic alleges that key Fox executives, including Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, deleted texts from November and December 2020, creating an "evidentiary void." Fox News denies the allegations, calling them a desperate attempt to distract from Fox's recent legal victory granting them access to documents related to a Department of Justice investigation into Smartmatic executives. The legal battle continues as Smartmatic seeks an adverse inference instruction to the jury, while Fox accuses Smartmatic of failing to preserve evidence.</p>

President Trump, who had previously hinted at attending, will also skip the talks but will send Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

          <p>The EPA plans to weaken limits on some "forever chemicals" (PFAS) in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS. The EPA will keep standards for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion but give utilities until 2031 to comply. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin cited the need for "common-sense flexibility," but health advocates criticized the move, calling it illegal and a betrayal of promises for clean water. Water utilities, who sued the EPA over the original rule, have been granted a two-year extension.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, in Saudi Arabia, marking a significant shift in US policy. Trump announced the lifting of US sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the nation "a chance at greatness." Al-Sharaa, who previously led an al-Qaeda-linked rebel group, now heads a government seeking to rebuild ties with the West. Trump urged al-Sharaa to normalize relations with Israel, remove foreign terrorists, and assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers. Despite al-Sharaa's controversial past, the Trump administration hopes the new Syrian government can curb Iranian influence in the region.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling and the adoption of the decision by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. The increase, lower than the initially proposed 21.8%, aims to address State Farm's financial distress after the Los Angeles-area wildfires. Administrative Judge Karl Seligman found evidence of "extraordinary financial distress" for the company. State Senator Sasha RenÃ©e PÃ©rez criticized the decision, citing hardships faced by fire victims. Lara assured residents that he considered all options and is focused on ensuring State Farm pays claims fully and fairly, while also acknowledging the statewide insurance crisis.</p>

Petrova was detained by immigration officials in February and has been held in a Louisiana detention facility. Her lawyer calls the case "meritless" and questions the timing, suggesting it's intended to justify deportation efforts. Petrova, who left Russia after protesting the Ukraine war, fears deportation due to her political stances and her research on aging, which she says has stalled without her involvement. Her supervisor has praised her research as "spectacular."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's foreign policy towards South Africa is being shaped by a focus on white Afrikaner farmers, leading to controversial decisions such as prioritizing their asylum claims. The administration has halted foreign aid to South Africa, citing "race-based discrimination," and expelled the South African ambassador after he criticized Trump's views on race. Influenced by Afrikaner activists and a conversation with golfer Gary Player, Trump's administration is welcoming white South Africans into the U.S. refugee program while suspending it for others. Critics argue this policy caters to white grievance and overlooks the broader context of South Africa's history and current challenges.</p>

Lively's lawyer has denied these claims as "categorically false." Swift was subpoenaed as a witness, but her spokesperson denied any significant connection to the film "It Ends With Us" beyond licensing a song.

Kristine Wojnovich reported a strange taste and smell in her water in 2023, but Sunoco initially found nothing. After 16 months and an investigation by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, a leak was discovered. At least 38 wells have been impacted, and Wojnovich found 15 gallons of jet fuel on top of her well. Sunoco's partner company, Energy Transfer, says it has installed filtration systems, but residents feel unsafe and Wojnovich is suing the company.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, dropping by nearly 30,000, signaling progress in combating the opioid crisis. The CDC credited President Trump's 2017 declaration of a public health emergency for the improvement. However, these gains are threatened by proposed budget cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing drug addiction. Experts caution that these cuts could undermine the progress made, particularly as addiction is a complex issue requiring comprehensive care and support beyond emergency responses and treatment. Despite the decline, drug fatalities remain high, emphasizing the need for continued investment in prevention and treatment.</p>
