          <h2>Elton John Criticizes Government Over AI Copyright Exemptions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elton John has publicly condemned the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, labeling them "absolute losers" and feeling "incredibly betrayed." Speaking to the BBC, John argued that allowing AI firms to use artists' content without payment constitutes "theft" and would disproportionately harm young artists lacking resources to fight big tech companies. The government defended its position, stating that no changes to copyright laws would be considered unless they benefit creators and emphasized the need for further consultation and economic impact assessments. Sir Paul McCartney has also voiced similar concerns, warning of a potential "Wild West" scenario where artists' copyrights are not adequately protected.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two fatalities and nineteen injuries. The incident occurred at approximately 8:30 p.m. when the ship reportedly lost power and mechanical function, causing it to drift into one of the bridge's pillars. Cellphone videos captured the collision, showing crew members dangling from the masts. The ship was en route to Iceland from Pier 17 when the accident occurred. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, with preliminary information suggesting a mechanical issue with the sailboat.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings for the Chicago area for the first time ever. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil from parched farmland. Visibility dropped drastically in minutes, creating hazardous driving conditions and a dramatic scene in Chicago. Meteorologists attribute the storm's severity to exceptionally dry soil conditions in the region, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reshaping decades of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East by proceeding without Israel on issues such as Iran, Gaza, Syria, and Yemen. His recent interactions with Syria's new leader and promises to lift sanctions demonstrate a departure from the traditional U.S. approach of prioritizing Israel's interests in the region. While the U.S. maintains its support for Israel, Trump's focus on negotiating peace deals and economic partnerships with Gulf nations signals a shift in priorities.

          <p>The discovery of bloody, bare footprints at the scene of Jeanie Childs' murder in Minneapolis in 1993 led to a decades-long search for her killer. The investigation involved comparing the footprints to multiple suspects, including a man who lived with Childs at the time. DNA testing on items collected at the crime scene revealed an unknown profile that kept repeating itself. Investigative genetic genealogy was used to find a match to potentially two brothers, one of whom was Jerry Westrom. The bloody footprints, beyond showing guilt, also helped clear people who might have been under suspicion.</p>

          <p>Walmart is warning that President Trump's tariffs will force the company to raise prices for consumers, prompting a response from the President who suggests that Walmart absorb the costs. The President wrote on Truth Social, that Walmart should “EAT THE TARIFFS” and keep prices down. About a third of Walmart’s products come from abroad, John David Rainey, the company’s chief financial officer, has said. The article examines the potential impact of these tariffs on the retail sector and the broader economy, with economists predicting that businesses will ultimately have to pass on the costs to consumers or reduce their workforce.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for attributing potential price increases to his tariffs, asserting that the retailer should absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Trump's comments follow Walmart's warning that tariffs would force it to raise prices, despite the company's efforts to keep them low. This article delves into the broader implications of Trump's trade policies on retailers and consumers. The impact on grocery stores is of particular concern, given their tight margins.

          <p>The discovery of bloody, bare footprints at the murder scene of Jeanie Childs in 1993 became a pivotal clue in a decades-long investigation. The investigation focused on documenting the crime scene, and gathering DNA evidence, and comparing footprints to potential suspects. Despite initial leads, the case went cold until 2015, when advancements in DNA technology allowed investigators to identify an unknown DNA profile at the crime scene. The use of investigative genetic genealogy eventually led them to Jerry Westrom, a hockey dad and local businessman, who was later arrested and charged with the murder.</p>

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to make community service a more meaningful form of punishment, with offenders working for free and the money earned going to a fund for victim's groups. This initiative comes as prisons face overcrowding issues. Offenders would not be paid wages, but the money earned would be paid into a fund for victim's groups.</p>

          <p>Despite strong vocals and a spirited performance, the UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, finished in 19th place. The article analyzes the reasons behind the disappointing result, suggesting that the song's manic mishmash of musical styles and lack of a clear hook hindered its appeal. While the staging was energetic and highlighted the band's friendship, it may have been too busy and lacked the impact of other entries.

While Gove doesn't believe another referendum is currently necessary, he acknowledged that the UK government may need to reconsider its position if SNP popularity and support for independence significantly increase. This message is surprisingly similar to the one delivered by SNP leader John Swinney, who has called for "demonstrable support" for independence.
