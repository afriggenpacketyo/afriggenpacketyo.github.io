            <p>Patients in South West England suffering from inflammatory skin diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, and acne are facing excessively long waiting times for NHS dermatology treatments. This is primarily due to increased urgent skin cancer referrals and a shortage of dermatologists, causing significant emotional and psychological distress for those affected. Many patients are turning to costly private healthcare while others face a 'living hell' of pain, itching, and social isolation. Experts are calling for increased resources and innovative solutions to address the imbalance in prioritization between skin cancer and other debilitating skin conditions.</p>

            <p>A BBC investigation reveals that some veterinarians in the UK are experiencing significant pressure to prioritize income generation, particularly within practices owned by large corporate groups like IVC Evidensia. Vets report being monitored against financial targets and encouraged to upsell treatments, potentially compromising clinical decisions based on pet owners' budgets. IVC Evidensia, which owns over 900 surgeries, denies these claims, stating that animal welfare remains their top priority and that vets have clinical freedom. The investigation raises concerns about the increasing corporatization of veterinary services and its impact on animal care and ethical practice.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Since the Taliban's takeover in 2021, Afghan girls barred from education and women restricted from many jobs are increasingly turning to carpet weaving for income. This is one of the few trades where the Taliban allows women to work. While carpet exports are booming, weavers earn meager wages, around $27 per square meter which takes about a month to produce, despite long hours. This situation highlights the economic hardship and limited opportunities for women and girls under the current regime, trapping them in low-paid labor to support their families.</p>

            <p>The BBC smuggled phones into El-Fasher, Sudan, a city under siege, to document the experiences of civilians trapped in the conflict between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Residents report constant bombardment, lack of clean water, and food shortages, with fears of famine looming. They are also from non-Arabic communities and worry about potential ethnic violence and sexual assault if the city falls to the RSF. These accounts highlight the dire humanitarian situation and the pervasive fear among civilians in a city cut off from the outside world.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump stated that Volodymyr Zelenskyy shares blame with Vladimir Putin for the deaths in the Ukraine war, also criticizing Joe Biden's handling of the conflict.

These comments followed a deadly Russian missile attack on Sumy, Ukraine, which killed at least 35 people. Trump insisted that he wants to stop the killing and signaled that proposals would be forthcoming.</p>

He also emphasized the need for Europe to strengthen its self-defense capabilities and reiterated the administration's stance on understanding both sides in the Ukraine conflict. Vance's remarks come amidst market jitters following the implementation of new tariffs and ongoing discussions between the US and UK governments.</p>

            <p>A Chinese research team has discovered a key mechanism by which breast cancer cells utilize the amino acid arginine to evade the immune system and proliferate. The study reveals that metabolic interaction between cancer cells and macrophages plays a dominant role in arginine-driven breast cancer progression. This finding could pave the way for new precision therapies targeting arginine metabolism to starve tumors and improve treatment outcomes for women with breast cancer. The research highlights the complex interplay within the tumor micro-environment and its influence on cancer behavior.</p>

Experts suggest that while every major decline starts with a 'death cross,' not every 'death cross' leads to a major decline.

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing federal funds for Harvard University after the institution rejected demands to change its policies on antisemitism and diversity. Harvard rejected the White House's list of demands, citing attempts to "control" the university's community. The White House had sent a list of demands to Harvard last week which it said were designed to fight antisemitism on campus. They included changes to its governance, hiring practices and admissions procedures.</p>
