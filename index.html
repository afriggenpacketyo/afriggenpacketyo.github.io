          <h2>Cash Grants in Kenya Show Significant Reduction in Child Mortality, but Cost-Effectiveness and US Applicability Questioned</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 07:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new GiveDirectly study in rural Kenya found that one-time cash grants of $1,871 per household reduced infant and child mortality by 48%, largely due to increased hospital deliveries and improved food security. While this outcome is impressive for a non-health intervention, the study notes it wasn't the most cost-effective method for saving lives compared to other interventions like Vitamin A supplementation. Previous US-based cash experiments have shown null effects on child development, suggesting that the impact of such programs may vary significantly between developing and developed nations. The article emphasizes the need for modest takeaways, highlighting that cash transfers are effective for poverty reduction but require complementary health infrastructure to maximize life-saving potential.</p>

          <p>An unverified photo circulating online appears to show a large, low-observable, flying-wing drone in flight, resembling the Rainbow CH-7 stealth reconnaissance drone under development by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. The image, taken from the rear with landing gear down and split rudders visible, lacks high resolution, making detailed identification challenging. While the exact timing and location of the photo are unknown, the CH-7 was anticipated to have its maiden flight this year. This development indicates China's continued advancements in stealth drone technology, potentially enhancing its reconnaissance and military capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Questions if Trump's Economic Interventions Align with State Capitalism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether former President Donald Trump's recent economic interventions, such as cutting a revenue-sharing agreement with Nvidia, taking partial control of US Steel, and brow-beating companies over prices, push the US towards a "state capitalism" model. While traditional Republicans embrace free-market capitalism, Trump's approach is characterized by unprecedented government meddling, drawing comparisons to countries like Russia and China. A socialist commentator, Bhaskar Sunkara, notes that while state intervention isn't inherently socialist, Trump's actions appear ad hoc and self-serving rather than part of a coherent long-term plan. The analysis suggests that these policies, though appealing to some working-class voters, may ultimately make the US a poorer country.</p>

          <p>China's top engineering institute, the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), has shortlisted a record number of private-sector executives and chief scientists for academicianship, including figures from AI, new energy, and biopharmaceutical industries. This move signals the country's increasing recognition of private enterprises' scientific and technological innovation capabilities, aiming to infuse new blood into the traditionally state-dominated academy. With about 600 nominations for no more than 100 new seats, the CAE has specifically reserved eight for leading private technology companies. This initiative reflects China's strategic focus on leveraging private sector dynamism to drive national innovation and technological advancement.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debate Challenges of Designing Investor Test for Private Assets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 06:50:01 EDT</div>

          <p>Regulators are considering a knowledge test for "accredited investors" to access private market assets, currently restricted by wealth thresholds. The US House recently approved a proposal for the SEC to devise such a test, amidst a broader push to open these potentially higher-return, higher-risk investments to more people. Experts warn that designing an effective test is difficult, as it must gauge understanding of complex securities, limited liquidity, and subjective valuations, beyond basic financial literacy. Even some current accredited investors lack deep understanding, highlighting the need for robust protections for the end investor.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke lost his libel case against The Guardian, which had published allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, finding that the newspaper successfully defended its stories on grounds of truth and public interest. The judgment stated that the meaning of each article was "substantially true" and found Clarke to be an incredible witness, rejecting his conspiracy claim. The Guardian's editor welcomed the decision as a victory for the women who suffered and for investigative journalism, while Clarke expressed disappointment but maintained he is not the person described.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has immediately halted issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers, an announcement made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This decision is based on concerns that the increasing number of foreign drivers endangers American lives and undercuts domestic truckers' livelihoods, with the State Department citing recent deadly accidents where English proficiency may have been a factor. The Trump administration is also reviewing over 55 million valid U.S. visas for potential violations that could lead to deportation. This move comes despite an estimated shortage of 60,000 truck drivers in the U.S. industry, prompting scrutiny of entry-level driver training standards.</p>

Drawing parallels with Finland's "whole society defense" model against Russia, it suggests Canada needs to reorchestrate its entire national framework, including conscription and integrating all government facets into a security system.

The author suggests that while these tactics might seem unseemly, they could resonate with voters who value a combative political style. Despite potential "left coast liberal" baggage and a mixed governing record, Newsom's willingness to "fight" on Trump's terms might position him as a strong contender in the current political landscape.</p>

          <p>This article critically examines the argument that tariffs could serve as an efficient tax base, particularly in the context of President Trump's policies. The author contends that tariffs cannot simultaneously protect domestic producers and reliably raise substantial revenue, as high protective tariffs reduce imports and thus collections. Furthermore, tariffs are deemed inefficient and distortive, falling heavily on capital inputs and lacking the neutrality and stability of consumption taxes like a VAT. The analysis concludes that tariffs are an arbitrary, unstable, and regressive tax, yielding only a fraction of federal revenue, and are therefore not a realistic foundation for replacing income taxes.

          <p>Following a recent plague infection in South Lake Tahoe, this article explains why the disease, commonly associated with the Black Death, still exists and its current dangers. Caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the plague primarily affects small animals and can spread to humans via infected fleas or rodents, particularly in rural areas like national forests. While medical advancements make it treatable with antibiotics, the disease hasn't been eradicated due to the difficulty of eliminating infections in mammalian populations spread by vectors. Experts emphasize that timely treatment is crucial, and while it's a serious disease, it's largely under control and not a top public health priority.</p>

          <p>Residents and environmental groups are suing the city of Twentynine Palms to block a proposed 152-acre luxury "glamping" resort near Joshua Tree National Park, alleging inadequate environmental impact assessment. The lawsuit claims the project, slated for a wildlife corridor, threatens endangered species like the desert tortoise and will negatively impact traffic, water, and air quality. While the city manager defends the project as a source of jobs and revenue, he dismisses environmental concerns as a "ruse" by wealthy elites. Opponents argue the development undermines state housing law by rezoning residential land and sets a dangerous precedent for future commercialization of the area.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleges that Southern California Edison (SCE) was deceptive about its role in the 2019 Saddle Ridge fire in Sylmar, which destroyed over 100 homes and killed at least one person. Lawyers contend the fire, and a more recent 2025 Sylmar fire, were caused by an improperly grounded transmission line that SCE failed to fix, a claim the company denies. A fire department captain's deposition suggests SCE withheld information about equipment failure and attempted to buy surveillance video. This scrutiny follows the devastating Eaton fire, also linked to Edison equipment, raising questions about the utility's maintenance and transparency.</p>

          <p>A Pew Research Center analysis of census data shows that for the first time in over 50 years, the number of immigrants leaving the U.S. has surpassed those arriving, signaling the impact of President Trump's mass deportation efforts. Between January and June, the foreign-born population decreased by over a million, a significant drop since its peak in January. While the administration hails this as a success for border law and order, experts caution that a continued decline could lead to negative economic effects and labor shortages, especially with a falling US birth rate. The study highlights recent policy changes, including asylum restrictions and widespread enforcement operations, contributing to this demographic shift.</p>
