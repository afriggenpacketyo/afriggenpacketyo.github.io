          <p>A new BBC documentary investigates the "Jesus Army," a disgraced evangelical movement in the UK described as one of the country's most abusive cults. The article details the widespread physical and sexual abuse of children within the group's communal houses, which the leadership allegedly covered up for years. The piece explores the lasting trauma for hundreds of survivors and the complex reasons people remained in the cult, which formally disbanded in 2019.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has resumed humanitarian aid airdrops into Gaza amid a severe hunger crisis and increasing international pressure. The move comes as reports detail starvation-related deaths, including children, and the UN warns of widespread famine. While Israel states it is improving the humanitarian response, aid organizations report that military restrictions and looting hamper distribution efforts. The airdrops are considered insufficient by some UN officials to address the scale of the man-made hunger crisis.</p>

This has also increased coastal upwelling, where strong winds bring cold, deep ocean water to the surface, further lowering air temperatures in the Bay Area.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the Illinois landlord sentenced to 53 years in prison for the hate-crime murder of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy, has died in custody. Czuba was convicted in February for the October 2023 attack on Wadee Alfayoumi and his mother, Hanan Shaheen, which he committed in response to the Israel-Hamas war. During the trial, Shaheen testified that Czuba told her "You, as a Muslim, must die" before stabbing her and then brutally attacking her son.</p>

The FAA is investigating the incident, which resulted in minor injuries to a flight attendant but no reported injuries among passengers, though some were jostled from their seats.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team faces uncertainty over the fitness of captain Ben Stokes heading into the final day of the fourth Test against India. After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on day four due to being "a bit stiff and sore," according to the team's assistant coach. The all-rounder, who has a history of injuries, is crucial to England's attack, and his potential absence is a major concern as they push for a series-leveling victory at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's response to a question about potentially pardoning convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has drawn sharp criticism. When asked, Trump stated, "It’s something I haven’t thought about," a non-committal answer that a CNN legal analyst described as botching the "easiest question in human history." The exchange comes amid increasing public pressure on Trump regarding his past association with Jeffrey Epstein and the files related to his case.</p>
