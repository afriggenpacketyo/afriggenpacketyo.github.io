          <p>The U.S. military has conducted its eighth strike on a vessel suspected of narco-trafficking since September, this time in the Pacific Ocean off Colombia. The strike, ordered by the President, resulted in the deaths of two individuals on board, bringing the total number of fatalities in these operations to at least 34. This action is part of a declared "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, though some lawmakers have raised concerns about the legal and constitutional basis for these strikes, arguing the administration has not provided sufficient rationale or transparency.</p>

          <p>A prominent child abuse expert has withdrawn his candidacy to chair the UK's grooming gang inquiry, citing a "highly charged and toxic environment" dominated by political point-scoring. His departure follows the resignation of four survivors from the inquiry's advisory panel, who are demanding the Safeguarding Minister steps down and that the inquiry's focus remains strictly on grooming gangs. The turmoil highlights deep divisions over the inquiry's leadership and scope, with some survivors insisting on a judicial chair and others concerned about the process being diluted or politicized.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced expanded export controls on a range of rare earth elements and related processing technologies, citing national security and non-proliferation obligations. These measures are seen as a strategic response to U.S. technology restrictions, directly targeting materials critical for Western military systems like the F-35 fighter jet. The policy aims to leverage China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain, where it processes the vast majority of the world's supply, creating a significant challenge for the U.S. and its allies who are heavily dependent on these imports.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue, reaching $28.10 billion and marking a return to growth after two consecutive declines. However, the company's adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents missed analyst estimates, causing the stock to fall in after-hours trading. The drop in net income was attributed to lower electric vehicle prices and a 50% rise in operating expenses, partly driven by investments in AI and other research projects.

          <p>A study from Tokyo Medical and Dental University suggests that the process of hair turning gray may be linked to the body's defense mechanisms against melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Researchers found that pigment-producing stem cells, when stressed or damaged, can either die off, resulting in gray hair, or multiply in a way that could lead to cancer. This process is described as a biological trade-off, where eliminating damaged cells to prevent cancer results in graying. The findings reframe graying and melanoma as two different outcomes of the same cellular stress response.</p>

          <p>IBM reported strong third-quarter financial results, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, and raised its full-year guidance. The company cited positive momentum from its artificial intelligence business, which has grown to a $9.5 million book of business. Despite the positive report, which showed a 9% increase in revenue from the previous year, the company's stock fell by 5% in extended trading. All of IBM's major segments, including software, consulting, and infrastructure, reported revenue growth for the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented a new policy that significantly restricts interactions between Department of Defense officials and the U.S. Congress. According to a memo, nearly all departmental offices, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and military department secretaries, must now receive formal approval from the assistant secretary for legislative affairs before any engagement. The memo states this measure is necessary to prevent "unauthorized engagements" that could undermine the department's legislative objectives. The move centralizes control over the flow of information from the Pentagon to Capitol Hill.</p>

          <p>Despite a slight decrease from recent peaks, high-yield savings accounts continue to offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts, which average just 0.40% interest. With typical rates around 4.30%, savers can still earn substantial interest, with a $10,000 deposit potentially yielding over $430 in one year. The article contrasts this with variable rates and suggests that Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts may be a better option for those concerned about future rate cuts, as CDs offer fixed rates for a set term.

          <p>President Trump reportedly hosted a White House dinner for media executive Rupert Murdoch, despite currently suing him and his company for $10 billion. The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal report about a letter allegedly sent from Trump to Jeffrey Epstein. The dinner, which included other key figures from Murdoch's News Corp, highlights the complex and often close relationship between the president and the conservative media empire, even in the face of major legal disputes. The lawsuit continues, with Trump's lawyers recently filing a response to Murdoch's motion to dismiss the case.</p>

          <p>Consumers may face higher turkey prices this Thanksgiving, as wholesale costs have surged by 40% compared to last year, reaching an estimated $1.32 per pound. The price increase is primarily driven by a shrinking supply of turkeys, a result of reduced demand in previous years and recent outbreaks of avian flu that have affected over 3 million birds this year. Despite the wholesale spike, some major retailers like Walmart and Aldi are offering discounted turkeys as "loss leaders" to attract holiday shoppers into their stores, which may cushion the impact on consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Oxford Economics suggests that many American taxpayers could receive larger tax refunds in 2026 due to new tax provisions that are retroactive to the current year. The changes, part of a recent Republican tax bill, are expected to result in an additional $50 billion in taxpayer savings. Because the IRS has not yet updated its withholding tables to reflect the new breaks, many employees are likely overpaying their taxes throughout the year. The analysis notes that a disproportionate share of these benefits will likely accrue to upper-income households. (not investment advice)</p>
