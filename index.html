          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings, driven by strong performance across its divisions. The company announced it will increase its 2025 capital expenditure forecast to $85 billion, a $10 billion raise, citing robust and growing demand for its Cloud and AI services. Despite increased competition in the AI space, Google's core search and advertising segments demonstrated continued growth, with YouTube's advertising revenue also beating forecasts. However, overall operating expenses saw a significant 20% increase, partly due to a $1.4 billion charge related to a legal settlement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tesla's Q2 Sales Miss Estimates as Automotive Revenue Declines for Second Consecutive Quarter</h2>

          <p>Tesla reported a second-quarter sales miss, with automotive revenue falling 16% year-over-year for the second straight quarterly drop. The company's performance has been partly attributed to public backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities and increased competition from other automakers. Compounding these issues, an upcoming repeal of the federal EV tax credit is expected to impact future sales, prompting the company to urge US customers to place orders soon. Despite the slump, Tesla is moving forward with plans for a more affordable model and continues to focus on its future in robotaxis and robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IBM's shares fell in extended trading even as the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's projections. The company saw its revenue increase by nearly 8% year-over-year, a significant acceleration from the previous quarter, driven by strong performance in its infrastructure division. However, software revenue fell slightly short of consensus, and executives noted that some clients are acting cautiously due to geopolitical tensions and delayed decision-making on discretionary projects. IBM affirmed its full-year guidance and highlighted that its generative AI book of business has grown to $7.5 billion since inception. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is planning a mega dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, which is projected to be the world's largest, potentially producing three times the electricity of the Three Gorges Dam. While state media indicates the power is primarily for external consumption, the project is causing concern for neighboring countries like India. Chinese observers suggest the dam could significantly boost Beijing's geopolitical influence over power-starved South Asian nations, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal. The project is seen as a potential major power hub that could solidify China's strategic position in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and the European Union are urgently negotiating a trade deal to avert a potential trade war before a self-imposed August 1 deadline. In the absence of an agreement, President Trump has threatened a 30% tariff on EU imports, which economists warn could significantly raise costs for businesses and consumers. Recent trade pacts with other nations, including a deal with Japan featuring a 15% tariff and investment commitments, are viewed as a potential framework for an EU agreement. Still, experts caution that even a 15% tariff would represent a substantial increase and could lead to inflation and reduced economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News discusses the decision by New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani to take a ten-day trip to his birth country of Uganda in the middle of his general election campaign. The author posits that the trip is a political strategy to shield Mamdani from scrutiny over his past communist affiliations and to avoid difficult questions from the media and political opponents. The article suggests that this 'hiding' strategy is viable because the opposition, including Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo, is currently divided. The author argues that Mamdani's campaign will likely maintain a low profile unless a single, serious challenger emerges.</p>

          <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report, President Trump was informed by Attorney General Pam Bondi in May that his name appears multiple times in the government's investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. The report states that officials advised against releasing additional documents due to the presence of child pornography and sensitive victim information. President Trump reportedly deferred to the Justice Department's decision, which later angered some of his supporters who had been promised full disclosure. The White House has dismissed the story, while the Justice Department stated that its review found no evidence warranting further prosecution from the files.</p>

This decision came shortly before a report emerged that President Trump had been informed his name was in the Epstein files.

          <p>The word 'OK' is one of the most universally understood terms, yet its origin is distinctly American, tracing back to a journalistic joke in 1839. Scholars now widely accept that 'OK' began as a playful abbreviation for 'oll korrect,' a deliberate misspelling of 'all correct,' part of a linguistic fad at the time. Its popularity was cemented during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, where his nickname 'Old Kinderhook' conveniently aligned with the abbreviation, leading to the formation of 'O.K. Clubs.' The word's simplicity and versatility allowed it to spread globally, particularly through its use in telegraphy and by American soldiers during the World Wars.</p>

          <p>This article explores how the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has transformed into a powerful, multifaceted conspiracy theory that captivates various political subcultures. The author argues that the scandal's known facts—a wealthy financier with elite connections accused of sex crimes who died mysteriously in jail—provide fertile ground for speculation. For the MAGA right, it became a story of Democratic elite corruption, a narrative that President Trump struggled to control due to his own well-documented ties to Epstein. The administration's recent attempts to shift focus away from the topic have only fueled more suspicion and interest, turning the scandal into a political liability for Trump and his allies.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified a 2020 report from House Intelligence Committee Republicans that challenges the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia sought to help Donald Trump win the 2016 election. Gabbard claimed the document reveals 'egregious weaponization and politicization of intelligence' by the Obama administration, alleging they directed the creation of a false assessment. Democrats have dismissed the move as a distraction from the controversy over the administration's refusal to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. A bipartisan Senate report from 2020 had previously supported the intelligence community's findings regarding Russian interference.</p>

          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a single year since the Obama administration. Internal data shows nearly 150,000 deportations in the first half of the year, projecting an annual total over 300,000. This figure, while a significant increase, still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations. The surge in enforcement follows a sweeping mandate that includes reversing previous limits on arrests, enlisting military help, and expanding the categories of those eligible for removal, alongside an unprecedented increase in funding for the agency.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a temporary ruling allowing President Trump to terminate, without cause, three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) who were appointed by President Biden. This action challenges a 90-year-old precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protects the independence of certain regulatory agencies by restricting the president's power to remove officials except for cause. The fired commissioners had sued, arguing their removal was unlawful, and a lower court had initially blocked the terminations. The Supreme Court's decision allows the firings to proceed while the case continues, signaling a potential shift in the balance of power between the executive branch and independent agencies.</p>

The piece raises concerns about the erosion of privacy in a digital age where surveillance is normalized and personal information is easily accessible.

This trend of overconsumption, which began in the 1970s, is visible in deforestation, biodiversity loss, and atmospheric carbon accumulation. Experts emphasize the need to transition from an extractive to a regenerative economy, highlighting solutions like carbon pricing, renewable energy, and reducing food waste to push back the date and live within the Earth's means.</p>

Legal experts and some internal sources suggest the office's priorities may be misaligned with the community's, and questions have been raised about the strength of the cases and the reliability of information provided by federal agents.

          <p>The term 'corn sweat' refers to the process of evapotranspiration, where vast fields of corn release significant amounts of moisture into the air, particularly during hot and sunny weather. This phenomenon can dramatically increase humidity, making heat waves in the Midwest feel more oppressive and dangerous, with heat indexes soaring. While evapotranspiration from any dense vegetation cools the immediate air, the sheer scale of corn monoculture in states like Iowa can offset this effect by adding so much moisture. This agricultural practice, largely driven by demand for livestock feed and ethanol, contributes to more intense heat waves and can exacerbate other climate extremes like drought.</p>

While a high-yield savings account offers flexibility with withdrawals, its variable interest rate is likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later in the year. In contrast, a CD offers a fixed, guaranteed rate of return, but requires the money to remain untouched for the term. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn slightly more guaranteed interest than a high-yield savings account at 4.30% over the same period. (not investment advice)</p>
