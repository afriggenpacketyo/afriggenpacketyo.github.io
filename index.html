Parubiy was shot in Lviv, with the suspect currently in custody and providing initial statements, though no motive has been released. Parubiy, aged 54, was a key figure in Ukraine's Orange Revolution and the Maidan protests, having served as parliament speaker from 2016 to 2019. The president has instructed officials to make available information public as the investigation continues into this horrific murder, and the deployment of all available resources is being utilized to solve the case. The investigation is still ongoing, with authorities working to gather additional information and clarify the circumstances surrounding the incident, and the nation is now in a state of reflection and mourning. The current situation is one of high alert, and the government is committed to ensuring justice for the victim and maintaining stability. </p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister announced the death of Abu Obeida, a Hamas spokesperson, in an airstrike during a military operation in Gaza City. Prime Minister Netanyahu had previously stated Israel's intent to target Obeida, but confirmation of his death was pending. The Israeli military has launched an offensive in Gaza City, urging Palestinian residents to evacuate south, resulting in numerous casualties and a dire humanitarian situation. International organizations, including the UN, are reporting famine conditions and struggling to deliver aid due to ongoing combat. The conflict continues to escalate, with both sides trading accusations and civilian populations facing severe consequences, resulting in global condemnation of the actions from both sides. </p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticized the Trump administration's rumored plan to send military troops to Chicago, calling it an "invasion" and suggesting ulterior motives beyond crime reduction. Pritzker argued that such a deployment could be a pretext for influencing or disrupting the 2026 elections. The White House has dismissed these accusations, citing Chicago's high crime rate as justification for potential federal intervention. Pritzker has referenced historical examples of authoritarian regimes to express his concerns about the president's actions. The situation is escalating, with potential legal challenges looming and increasing tensions between state and federal authorities. </p>

Thunberg condemned the deliberate deprivation of basic necessities for the people of Palestine. This is not the first time Thunberg has attempted to reach Gaza, and the previous attempt was stopped by Israeli forces.

The rover will land in the Moon's south polar region, which presents significant engineering challenges due to extreme temperatures and the presence of lunar regolith. The mission builds on Canada's history in space exploration and aims to demonstrate Canadian technology. The rover's findings could have huge implications for more sustainable exploration and potentially turning the Moon into a sort of petrol station for spacecrafts. The rover is a starting point to designing something that can survive on the lunar surface long-term, and it's pretty bulletproof anywhere else in the solar system. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has reportedly suspended visa approvals for nearly all Palestinian passport holders, according to a report by the New York Times. This measure expands previous restrictions on visitors from Gaza and impacts Palestinians seeking medical treatment, education, or business travel in the U.S. The State Department stated it was halting visitor visas for individuals from Gaza while conducting a review, a move condemned by pro-Palestinian groups. The action aligns the Trump administration with Israel's right-wing government, which rejects a Palestinian state, further complicating diplomatic relations in the region. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from expelling hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children from the U.S. The order came after lawyers argued that the government was attempting to remove the children without proper legal proceedings, potentially putting them at risk. The Justice Department claimed the children's parents requested their return, but lawyers for the children contested this claim. The judge's decision allows lawyers additional time to discuss the case, preventing removals for the next two weeks, and attornies for the children say that the U.S. government could be putting the children at risk of abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture. </p>

Some parents are strategically timing births to meet funding eligibility, and research suggests workforce issues could hinder the scheme's delivery.

          <p>Global demand for matcha has surged, leading to shortages and price increases in Japan, where it has been consumed for centuries.

The government is considering subsidizing farmers to increase tencha production, but labor-intensive harvesting remains a challenge. Retailers are rationing supplies, and companies are struggling to secure enough matcha to meet the growing demand, as some worry that this summer's record heatwave could lower next year's tea harvest and push prices even higher. </p>

          <p>A Chinese mountain snake, rarely seen in over a century, has been rediscovered in China's Wuyishan Mountains. The snake, known for its secretive habits, was first discovered in 1899 but has been rarely documented since. Researchers identified the snake during a reptile biodiversity survey, and it serves multiple vital ecosystem roles, especially controlling rodent populations. The discovery and study of elusive animal species can help build a wider appreciation for the ecosystem services they provide. </p>

          <p>Oval Invincibles have secured their third consecutive title in The Hundred, showcasing their dominance in the competition. The team's success is attributed to a strong core of players, strategic selections, and a varied bowling attack. The arrival of new investment into The Hundred brings new owners and new ideas, with shareholders taking operational control from 1 October. With talk of a new auction system to replace the draft and teams only being able to retain a certain number of players, this could be the end for this Invincibles side. </p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its navy in recent decades, becoming the world's largest in terms of warships, fueled by its economic growth and global ambitions. The country's shipbuilding capacity far exceeds that of the United States, raising concerns about the shifting balance of power at sea. While the US Navy still maintains advantages in overall tonnage and aircraft carriers, China is rapidly catching up, modernizing its fleet and expanding its naval bases. The buildup is driven by a desire to safeguard national security and project power in the South China Sea and beyond, challenging the US's maritime dominance. </p>
