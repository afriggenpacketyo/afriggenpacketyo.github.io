          <p>U.S. crude oil prices plummeted below $60 a barrel, hitting their lowest level since 2021, as fears of a recession triggered by President Trump's global tariffs intensified. OPEC+ producers' decision to increase production also contributed to the downward pressure. Trump touted the falling oil prices, but concerns are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher business prices, slowing economic activity and ultimately hurting oil demand. JPMorgan has raised its recession odds for this year to 60% following the tariff rollout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concerns that President Trump's sweeping tariffs will trigger a recession, with the majority expecting it to hit this year. CEOs anticipate increased prices and potential job losses due to the tariffs, echoing concerns from Wall Street figures. Many are 'war-rooming' inflation scenarios, anticipating price hikes and potential boycotts of American brands. The uncertainty surrounding trade policy is leading to downsizing of building plans and hesitation to invest in new domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>President Trump responded to market jitters caused by his new tariffs by stating that China, the 'biggest abuser', retaliated with tariffs on US products. Despite market sell-offs, Trump stood firm on his 'reciprocal' tariffs and voiced confidence in the US economy. He dismissed concerns about an imminent recession, stating that the country has become stronger and will eventually be economically dominant. The president also said that sometimes 'you have to take medicine to fix something'.</p>

          <p>A coalition of business groups and conservative lawyers is preparing a legal challenge to President Trump's tariffs, arguing that he lacks the legal authority to impose them. The challenge will cite the Constitution, which grants Congress the power to impose taxes and regulate trade. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is being questioned, as it doesn't explicitly mention tariffs and lacks a clear 'national emergency' justification. A conservative lawyer predicts the Supreme Court would unanimously rule against the administration.</p>

          <p>Exchanges implement trading halts, known as 'circuit breakers,' to prevent market crashes during rapid stock price declines. These pauses allow investors to reassess and avoid panic selling, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, surging global trade tensions due to high tariffs are putting pressure on equities, prompting the need for these measures. Circuit breakers are triggered when the S&P 500 falls by 7%, 13%, or 20% intraday, leading to temporary trading suspensions or a full-day halt.</p>
