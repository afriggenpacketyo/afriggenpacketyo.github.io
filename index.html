          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has ignited controversy. While Trump administration officials claim the move is necessary to address lawlessness and protect immigration agents, critics argue it infringes on states' rights and escalates tensions. California Governor Gavin Newsom denounced the deployment as a political spectacle, while Vice President JD Vance defended the action as a response to what he called an 'insurrection.' The situation underscores the deep divisions over immigration policy and the role of federal intervention in local affairs. </p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most frequent causes of arguments in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The psychologist emphasizes that tone of voice can signal contempt, a key predictor of divorce, and suggests naming the effect to de-escalate conflict. Arguments about family often stem from unmet needs and value clashes, while chore-related disputes are typically about the uneven distribution of labor. The article suggests that fairness in chore division won't be a 50/50 split, but a feeling that both partners have a hand in the tasks. Communication styles are tricky and require time-outs and eye-to-eye discussion. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that cuddling before sleep can foster secure attachment and reduce stress levels in couples. Researchers analyzed data from heterosexual couples, finding that physical closeness at sleep onset is associated with lower attachment insecurity and stress. Sleep expert Wendy Troxel notes that cuddling triggers psychological and physiological responses, such as increased emotional security and the release of oxytocin. The study suggests that pre-sleep cuddling is a meaningful ritual for emotional health, regardless of whether couples sleep together throughout the night. The findings underscore the importance of non-sexual physical affection in maintaining and repairing relationships.</p>

          <p>England secured a series victory against the West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, successfully chasing down a target of 197 runs. Jos Buttler and Harry Brook contributed significantly with the bat, but it was Jacob Bethell's explosive cameo and Tom Banton's unbeaten innings that propelled England to victory. Despite a strong start by West Indies, England's bowlers managed to restrict them initially, before a late surge in scoring boosted the visitors' total. Adil Rashid's expensive spell proved costly, but England's batting depth ultimately secured the win with nine balls to spare. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles to address protests against ICE reflects his increasingly assertive use of executive power. The move, made without local officials' request, has sparked outrage among Democrats who view it as an infringement on states' rights. Vice President JD Vance defended the action, framing the protesters as 'insurrectionists.' The rapid escalation and disregard for local law enforcement raise questions about the administration's intentions and potential for escalating tensions. This event serves as a political lesson, highlighting the president's willingness to assert federal authority in a Democratic city and state.</p>

          <p>President Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles amidst protests against ICE raids, a move seen by critics as an authoritarian flex and a distraction from policy failures. The White House claimed the deployment aimed to address lawlessness, but Governor Newsom criticized it as inflammatory. The action echoes Trump's use of national guard troops during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. With the deployment, critics argue that Trump seeks to redirect anger towards an 'enemy within,' diverting attention from his administration's shortcomings.

          <p>Senator Cory Booker stated he would not accept campaign donations from Elon Musk, following Musk's public dispute with Donald Trump. Despite rejecting financial support, Booker welcomed Musk's involvement in advocating against the proposed budget bill. The senator agreed with Musk's assessment of the bill as economically unsound. This comes as Democrats grapple with how to capitalize on the rift between Musk and Trump, while some left-wing politicians criticize Musk's influence in politics. </p>
