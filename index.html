        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A power outage that shut down Heathrow Airport was caused by a fire at an electrical substation, stemming from a moisture issue first identified seven years ago but never rectified. A report by the National Energy System Operator (NESO) found that necessary maintenance and mitigating actions were not implemented, leading to the catastrophic failure. The incident, which affected nearly 67,000 customers and disrupted 270,000 journeys, has prompted an official investigation by the energy regulator, Ofgem. The failure highlights significant concerns about the UK's energy infrastructure resilience and National Grid's maintenance protocols for critical national assets.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has officially announced that the centuries-old institution will continue after his death, confirming he will be reincarnated and have a successor. This declaration ends years of speculation that he might be the final person to hold the title. In his statement, the 90-year-old spiritual leader emphasized that the process of identifying his reincarnation must follow traditional Buddhist practices and be handled exclusively by his Gaden Phodrang Trust. This move is seen as a direct challenge to Beijing, which has repeatedly asserted its authority to approve the next Dalai Lama.</p>

          <p>Canada's national soccer team suffered a disappointing quarter-final exit from the Gold Cup, losing to 106th-ranked Guatemala and raising significant concerns just a year before co-hosting the World Cup. The article analyzes the team's "implosion," which robs them of crucial high-stakes matches and leaves coach Jesse Marsch with more questions than answers. Key issues identified include a failure to deliver under pressure, a lack of on-field discipline and maturity, and questionable team selections and in-game substitutions. The premature exit marks a low point for the team under Marsch's tenure.</p>

          <p>MethaneSAT, an $88 million satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gas emissions with high precision, has been lost in space after ceasing communication with its ground controllers. The project, backed by Jeff Bezos's Earth Fund, the New Zealand government, and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), was a key tool for holding countries and companies accountable for methane emissions pledges. Officials described the event as a disappointing setback but emphasized that valuable lessons were learned from the ambitious mission. The satellite's failure underscores the inherent challenges of space-based climate monitoring, though its backers remain committed to the overall goal of tracking methane.</p>

Despite the disappointing results, Hamilton expresses that progress is being made behind the scenes as he works with engineers to refine the car.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced a government initiative to regulate "disorderly low-price competition" across various industries, a phenomenon that has been fueling intense price wars. The move aims to steer companies away from suppressing prices to gain market share and instead focus on improving product quality and innovation. This policy is seen as crucial for China's long-term economic health, as the current "involutionary competition" is believed to hinder industrial upgrading and efficiency. The directive signals a more direct government intervention to manage market behavior and promote the exit of outdated production capacity from the economy.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over the editing of a '60 Minutes' interview. The lawsuit alleged election interference, a claim many legal experts considered weak, raising questions about the motive for the settlement. The deal, which includes no apology but requires future transcript releases, is seen by some observers as "protection money" paid by a corporation seeking to avoid conflict with a powerful political figure, especially as it awaits FCC approval for a major sale. The settlement follows similar deals made by other major media companies with Trump.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Oliver "Ollie" Tarvet, ranked 733rd in the world, has captured the imagination of Wimbledon fans after qualifying for his first Grand Slam. The 21-year-old US college student is now set for a second-round showdown against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court. Despite the monumental challenge, Tarvet remains unfazed, expressing a quiet confidence and a mindset focused on playing the ball, not the opponent. His journey from a London tennis academy to the American college system and now to one of tennis's biggest stages highlights a popular alternative path for developing players.</p>

          <p>At least 180 current and former UK armed forces aircrew are taking legal action against the Ministry of Defence, claiming their cancer diagnoses were caused by exposure to toxic fumes in military helicopters. The claims relate to aircraft such as the Sea King, Puma, and Chinook. The MoD has already settled at least six cases out of court without admitting liability, including one for an RAF flight sergeant who died at age 47. Veterans' groups are now urging the MoD to implement a cancer screening program and raise awareness among service members about the potential health risks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the G7 has caved to US pressure by agreeing to a deal that effectively exempts American multinational corporations from the landmark Pillar Two global minimum tax agreement. This move is criticized for putting corporate interests ahead of global tax fairness, potentially reigniting a "race to the bottom" as other countries may be incentivized to offer similar preferential treatment. The authors, including Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz, contend that this decision undermines multilateralism and weakens a crucial first step toward ensuring large corporations pay their fair share of taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs as high as 30% or 35% on Japanese imports if a trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This would be a significant increase from the current 10% levy that was temporarily put in place to allow for negotiations. Trump expressed doubt that a deal with Tokyo would be finalized, while Japanese officials stated they would not make concessions that could harm the country's agricultural sector. The escalating rhetoric raises tensions between the two allies and casts uncertainty over the future of their trade relationship.</p>

The judge stated that the administration does not have the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation and that migrants have built lives in reliance on the existing deadline.

The decision was based on concerns within the Department of Defense that U.S. military readiness could be compromised by the current rate of aid.
