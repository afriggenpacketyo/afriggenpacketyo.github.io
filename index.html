          <p>Belinda Taylor, a 48-year-old woman from Totnes, died in a skydiving accident at Dunkeswell Aerodrome in Devon, along with skydiving instructor Adam Harrison. Taylor's partner, Scott Armstrong, described her as a caring and adventurous person who loved life, and her son expressed the family's desire for answers about the cause of the accident. Taylor, a mother of four, worked as a massage therapist and volunteered at a food bank, always putting others' needs before her own. Investigations are ongoing by police, British Skydiving, and local authorities to determine the cause of the tragic incident, which occurred at a former RAF site now used for various aviation activities. The community remembers Taylor as someone who will be deeply missed. </p>

          <p>Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, introduced a resolution requiring Congressional debate and a vote before any U.S. military force is used against Iran, echoing sentiments previously expressed by President Donald Trump. Kaine voiced concerns that escalating tensions between Israel and Iran could draw the United States into another prolonged conflict in the Middle East. Trump has consistently advocated for ending "endless wars," preferring diplomatic solutions, and urging Iranian leaders to negotiate a nuclear deal. Kaine's resolution underscores Congress's constitutional power to declare war, emphasizing that any action against Iran requires explicit authorization, reflecting a rare point of agreement between political adversaries on foreign policy. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, financial markets have remained relatively stable, with U.S. stock benchmarks opening higher and oil prices falling. Traders and investors are betting that the attacks will not escalate into a broader regional conflict that significantly disrupts the global economy. Analysts suggest that the price of oil is the most critical factor for the global economy, with potential disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz posing the greatest risk. While a geopolitical risk premium is already factored into the market, increased oil production by OPEC provides a counterbalance, suggesting a cautious but not panicked market response.

It also recommends tightening laws to ensure adults who have sexual relations with children under 16 are always charged with sexual assault and closing loopholes in taxi licensing that can put children at risk.

The article also suggests considering alternative assistance, such as credit counseling, if consistently short on cash, as cash advance apps are not a long-term solution.

          <p>A juror in the Sean "Diddy" Combs sexual assault and racketeering trial was dismissed due to inconsistent statements about his residence and replaced with an alternate. The dismissed juror was a 41-year-old Black man who initially claimed to live in the Bronx, but questions arose about whether he resided in New Jersey. He was replaced by a 57-year-old white man from Westchester, leaving five alternate jurors.

          <p>French authorities sealed off Israeli weapons industry booths at the Paris Air Show, citing a ban on "offensive weapons" displays amid the conflicts in Iran and Gaza, a move condemned by Israel. Black walls were installed around the stands of five Israeli defense firms, including Israel Aerospace Industries and Elbit, which produce drones and guided bombs. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision, stating that "no offensive weapons" were allowed due to concerns about the conflict in Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed shock at the closure, calling it "outrageous," while the Israeli defense ministry criticized the decision as politically and commercially motivated. </p>

The mission, consisting of the Occulter and Coronagraph spacecraft, blocks out the sun's light to reveal the surrounding corona, which is much hotter than the sun's surface and remains a scientific mystery. This technology allows astronomers to study the solar corona close to the solar rim, improving understanding of solar weather and its potential impact on Earth's telecommunications and power grids.
