          <p>A German court has sentenced Jian Guo, a former assistant to a far-right Member of the European Parliament, to four years and nine months in prison for espionage. Guo was found guilty of passing sensitive information about parliamentary activities to Chinese intelligence services over a period of nearly five years. In addition to his work in the European Parliament, he was also convicted of spying on Chinese dissidents residing in Germany and providing information on key members of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of high-ranking U.S. military commanders were called to a last-minute meeting in Quantico, Virginia, to be addressed by President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The gathering, occurring amidst a potential government shutdown, was framed by Hegseth as a speech on maintaining the "warrior ethos" and military readiness. Despite initial speculation about major policy changes or budget cuts, the event appeared to be more of a morale-boosting rally, though its significant last-minute cost and timing have drawn scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a Category 2 storm, is weakening over the Atlantic but is still expected to generate dangerous conditions along the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center has warned that the storm will likely cause hazardous surf and life-threatening rip currents for several days, affecting beaches from the northern Caribbean to Bermuda. While the storm's center is projected to pass west of Bermuda and is not expected to make landfall, coastal communities are advised to remain cautious.</p>

          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning toward accepting a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Gaza, with a formal response expected soon. The comprehensive proposal, presented by President Trump, calls for a ceasefire, the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and an increase in humanitarian aid. The plan also outlines a post-war governance structure for Gaza managed by an international board, which has garnered support from several key Middle Eastern nations and the Palestinian Authority.</p>

          <p>A second man, Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, has died from injuries sustained during a sniper-style shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas on September 24. The 32-year-old father of four was shot multiple times and was removed from life support after being in critical condition. The attack, which injured a third person who has since been released from the hospital, has been condemned as a senseless tragedy by his family and community advocates.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi in London's Tavistock Square has been defaced with spray-painted graffiti, prompting India's High Commission to demand immediate action. The words "Terrorists" and "Gandhi, Modi and Hindustani" were painted on the plinth of the statue, which was erected in 1968. The act of vandalism, which the High Commission called a "violent attack on the idea of non-violence," occurred just days before the 156th anniversary of Gandhi's birth, an event typically commemorated at the site.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author describes a journey from identifying as a "cultural Jew" with little knowledge of the tradition to discovering its rich intellectual and spiritual depth. The author argues that a superficial understanding of Judaism is often shaped by centuries of anti-Semitism and assimilationist pressures, leading to an identity stripped of its core tenets. By studying Jewish texts and history, the author found a more empowering and resilient identity, which is crucial for navigating and responding to the current rise in anti-Semitism.</p>

          <p>An interview with Forbes senior writer Emily Baker-White explores why TikTok has become such a powerful and addictive information platform. Its algorithm, which learns user preferences with frictionless interaction, has shifted social media towards content from professional creators rather than personal acquaintances. The discussion also covers the "heating button," an internal tool that allows staff to manually boost videos, and the national security concerns stemming from the app's Chinese ownership by ByteDance, which gives Beijing potential leverage over the platform.</p>
