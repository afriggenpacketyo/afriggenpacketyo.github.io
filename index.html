          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe approaches, the article examines the evolving transatlantic relationship and the potential shift in US foreign policy towards Europe. With the rise of geopolitical tensions, particularly the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and former President Trump questioning NATO's security arrangements, the future of European security is uncertain. Some German leaders are advocating for Europe to develop its own independent security policy, while others caution against abandoning close cooperation with the US. The article highlights the need for Germany and the EU to adapt to a changing world order and consider the possibility of a future where the US is less reliable as a security partner.</p>

          <p>Reports have surfaced regarding a potential plan by the White House to deport migrants to Libya using a U.S. military plane. When questioned about this, former President Trump stated that the Department of Homeland Security should be consulted. The Government of National Unity in Libya has denied any involvement or knowledge of such plans, asserting that they reject the use of Libyan territory for migrant deportations without their consent. Attorneys representing migrants have filed an emergency motion in federal court to prevent potential removals to Libya.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has outlined several steps the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should take to address ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Kirby suggests limiting flights per hour during construction, returning to a slot-controlled airport system, modernizing air traffic control, and fully staffing air traffic control. The FAA says it is taking steps to improve the situation, including installing new high-bandwidth communications, replacing copper wires with fiber optics, creating a backup system, adding a radar data center, and boosting controller staffing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to announce a plan to revamp the air traffic control system nationwide.</p>

The data shows that over a period of nearly two years, migrants living in shelters were arrested thousands of times, with the top offenses being thefts, assaults, and drug crimes. The report also highlights an incident where NYPD officers were assaulted by teen members of the Tren de Aragua gang, sparking further concerns about illegal alien gang crime in the city. The article also notes that many of the suspects had been jailed before but released because of lax juvenile crime policies in the city, according to NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, citing increased uncertainty in the economic outlook and potential risks from the Trump administration's trade policies. The decision reflects concerns about both rising unemployment and inflation, with tariffs posing a threat to both economic growth and price stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is currently in solid shape, allowing the central bank to remain patient while monitoring developments. The Fed's deliberations occur amidst ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and its major trading partners, with potential implications for economic growth, inflation, and market sentiment.</p>

          <p>Pandora CEO Alexander Lacik has cautioned that U.S. tariffs could lead to significant price increases in the affordable jewelry industry. While current tariffs are manageable, reverting to previously announced reciprocal rates would be a "game changer" for jewelry manufacturers who heavily rely on manufacturing in Asia. The company had previously warned of a potential hit to group revenues due to tariffs, but the final impact on consumer pricing remains uncertain and will likely be industry-led. The article explains that most jewelers in the price segment where Pandora operates import from Asia, so tariffs would impact everyone.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through DOGE, is planning to eliminate dozens of National Park Service grants, including those related to climate change and diversity, equity, and inclusion. The cuts could save $26 million by canceling grants to universities, state historic preservation offices, tribes, and youth corps. Programs targeted include Scientists in Parks, climate resiliency studies, watershed protection efforts, and projects to protect Native American structures. Critics argue that these cuts will result in a loss of valuable knowledge and expertise while saving very little money, and that the research that goes on in national parks is essential for how we’re assessing the conditions of our land, air and water in the country.</p>

While rate cuts appear imminent, the article argues that renewing CD accounts can still be a smart move. The rate cut trajectory could change, and rate cuts are likely to be small, so savers shouldn't let that deter them. The alternatives to CDs are not as beneficial, and savers shouldn't lose the interest-earning opportunity in the interim.</p>

Scott then pulled down his shorts, exposed his erect penis, and tried to force [her] to perform oral sex on him.

          <p>After weeks of tensions from a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India conducted strikes against Pakistan. India struck deeper into Pakistan than it had at any point through decades of enmity between the two nuclear-armed rivals, though the damage was extensive, with more than 20 people killed in dozens of strikes across six to nine locations. The question now is whether Pakistan will decide that it must answer India’s strikes on the Pakistani heartland with an attack of its own on Indian soil. The two sides are considering the events and assessing the damage done.</p>

          <p>An alligator killed a Florida woman after the canoe she and her husband were paddling tipped over near Lake Kissimmee. Investigators believe the encounter was accidental, with the startled alligator thrashing and causing the canoe to capsize. The husband tried to fight off the animal but was unsuccessful. Officials have captured a large alligator suspected to be responsible. This incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of wildlife encounters in natural spaces, with officials urging caution and awareness of surroundings.</p>

          <p>Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student from Turkey, has been denied bond by an immigration judge, following her detention last month after her visa was revoked. Her lawyers allege the detention violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, stemming from an op-ed she co-wrote in the campus newspaper. The Department of Homeland Security presented a State Department memo stating her visa was revoked due to associations that may undermine U.S. foreign policy. Öztürk's lawyers are challenging the legal authority for ICE's detention and have requested a judge in Vermont to take jurisdiction and release her.</p>

Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that tariffs are likely to increase prices, slow economic growth, and raise unemployment. The Fed's concerns come as the US economy experienced a contraction in gross domestic product during the first quarter, raising fears of a recession. Trump has pressured the Fed to cut rates, but the central bank has emphasized its independence and commitment to data-driven decisions.</p>
