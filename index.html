          <p>A 54-year-old man in Polk County, Tennessee, was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill public officials and law enforcement. During the arrest, deputies discovered what appeared to be an improvised explosive device, prompting an investigation by the ATF and a bomb squad. A subsequent search of his home uncovered 14 explosive devices, and authorities believe he attempted to detonate them as officers arrived, leading to nine counts of attempted first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>The UK government has approved a 4.2% pay increase for police officers in England and Wales, an amount slightly above the current inflation rate. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described it as a signal of gratitude, noting it raises a starting constable's salary to over £31,000. However, the Police Federation, representing front-line officers, criticized the raise as insufficient, stating it "barely treads water" after years of real-terms pay cuts and won't solve issues of resignation and poor mental health.</p>

          <p>The independent U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has opened an investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere with the 2024 election. The OSC, which handles federal employee conduct and is separate from the DOJ, will examine the claims, though its potential actions are unclear since Smith is no longer a government employee.</p>

          <p>In the fifth Test at The Oval, England ended day three at 50-1, requiring another 324 runs to defeat India and win the series.

Despite improved batting conditions, England suffered a late setback when opener Zak Crawley was dismissed by Mohammed Siraj on the day's penultimate ball, leaving the match tensely poised.</p>

          <p>The UK's parliamentary standards commissioner is investigating Stourbridge MP Cat Eccles for potentially breaching rules by failing to declare a sponsored trip on time. The investigation concerns a visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, funded by Labour Friends of Israel at a value of £2,600, which took place in May. While the trip was registered in July, it was outside the mandatory 28-day declaration period, an issue a spokesperson for the MP attributed to an administrative error.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, surpassing California in new utility-scale solar capacity added last year, primarily driven by utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is fueled by favorable economics and streamlined regulations for projects, making solar a cheaper alternative to natural gas, even as the state government removes climate change from official policy. However, the future of this boom faces challenges, including the federal rollback of solar tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German government is increasing its pressure on Israel to address the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul making an urgent appeal for full UN access to distribute aid. This marks a tougher diplomatic stance from Germany, which has historically maintained a more cautious approach due to its responsibility following the Holocaust. While rejecting extremist Israeli criticism, German officials emphasized that the "unimaginable" suffering in Gaza must end, signaling a potential shift in its relationship with the Netanyahu government.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a 2-1 series victory over Australia but were denied a historic 3-0 whitewash after a 22-12 defeat in a dramatic final Test in Sydney. Despite winning the trophy, the Lions were outplayed in the final match by a resilient Australian side, leading to a "bittersweet" feeling for the players who had aimed for a more dominant legacy. The analysis reflects on a tour where the Lions ultimately triumphed but were frustrated, never quite reaching the peak performance they felt they were capable of.</p>

For decades, women often suffered through symptoms like hot flashes and anxiety in silence, partly due to a lack of medical training and social stigma. Now, community-focused initiatives and telehealth platforms are empowering women to take control of their health, challenging the notion that they must endure this life stage without relief or open conversation.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in second-quarter profit, largely due to a $3.76 billion writedown on its investment in Kraft Heinz. The food company has struggled with changing consumer tastes, and Berkshire recently resigned its board seats as Kraft Heinz explores a potential spinoff of major brands. Despite the writedown, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly, with most of its diverse portfolio of companies performing well, and the conglomerate is still holding a massive cash pile of $344.1 billion.

          <p>As the international community debates Palestinian statehood, residents of Gaza report a spiraling hunger crisis where the search for food has become a "death journey." Palestinians describe aid efforts, including airdrops and deliveries from the US-backed GHF, as symbolic and insufficient, changing nothing on the ground as they subsist on canned goods. Reports from the UN indicate over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed trying to access aid since May, deepening a sense of hopelessness and despair among a starving population.</p>

Researchers found that different personality traits from the "Big Five" model correlate with preferences for certain activities.

          <p>This article analyzes the character of Theo Huxtable from "The Cosby Show," played by the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who passed away at 54. It explores how Warner skillfully portrayed Theo not just as a "slacker" punch line, but as a complex character whose journey from an unmotivated teen to a purposeful young adult was central to the series. The analysis highlights Theo's dyslexia diagnosis as a key turning point, reframing his academic struggles and allowing him to find his purpose in mentoring others.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of a July jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected hiring and a large downward revision for previous months.

The firing has stoked fears about the integrity of U.S. economic data, with critics calling it an unprecedented attack on a key government agency.</p>
