          <p>A shooting at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, has resulted in multiple victims. Authorities reported that the suspected shooter is "down" and there is no longer an active threat to the public. In addition to the shooting, the church building was also set on fire, though the flames have since been contained by emergency crews. State and federal officials are monitoring the situation, which Governor Gretchen Whitmer described as heartbreaking and unacceptable violence in a place of worship.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown deadline approaching, Republican congressional leaders have stated that the debate over extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies should wait until after government funding is secured. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune argued that while they are open to discussing the ACA tax credits, the immediate priority must be to keep the government open. Democrats have insisted on tying the subsidy extension to any funding agreement, creating a significant point of contention in the negotiations.</p>

          <p>A wellness trend encouraging people to jump 50 times immediately after getting out of bed is gaining viral traction on TikTok. Popularized by creator Kathryn Smith, the practice is promoted as a simple, accessible way to increase blood flow, raise body temperature, and boost energy and mood to start the day. A wellness expert noted that the trend's appeal lies in its low-effort nature compared to more traditional workouts, making it an easy way to incorporate morning movement, though caution is advised for those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>

The meeting comes after Trump previously canceled a similar discussion, and both parties remain at odds over a key Democratic demand: extending expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. Republicans argue the healthcare issue can be addressed later, while Democrats insist it must be part of the funding deal to prevent premium increases for millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>The direction of the stock market in the coming week is expected to be heavily dictated by two major factors: a series of key jobs data releases and the looming threat of a U.S. government shutdown. Investors will be closely watching employment reports to gauge the likelihood of future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which has emphasized its data-dependent approach. The political uncertainty surrounding government funding adds another layer of volatility for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has condemned a policy proposed by Reform UK to eliminate indefinite leave to remain as both "racist" and "immoral." He argued that such a move would involve removing people who are legally part of British society and would "rip this country apart." While criticizing the policy, Starmer distinguished that he does not believe all Reform supporters are racist, but rather are frustrated after years of what he termed "Tory failure."</p>

Decades later, the surviving members have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, finally receiving widespread recognition for their influential music.</p>

          <p>This article examines various alternative data sources that can provide a different perspective on inflation compared to official government statistics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI). While some alternative indexes, such as those from Truflation and Adobe, suggest inflation is lower than reported, others from the Institute for Supply Management indicate rising price pressures in the supply chain. Taken together, these alternative metrics suggest a complex and uneven inflation landscape that may point to rising consumer prices in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A communications coach advises professionals to avoid certain "minimizing" phrases that can undermine their authority and the importance of their message in the workplace. Phrases such as "It'll just take a second," "No worries if not," and "I'm not an expert, but..." can inadvertently signal a lack of confidence or priority. The expert suggests replacing them with more direct, specific, and confident language to communicate more effectively and ensure one's contributions are valued.</p>
