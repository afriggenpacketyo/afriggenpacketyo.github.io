          <p>President Donald Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Freedom Caucus met to discuss Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act" after negotiations with hard-liners stalled. The White House described the meeting as productive, though sticking points remain regarding Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Johnson aims to hold a vote on the bill, but hard-liners are critical, citing concerns about the national deficit. Trump faces the challenge of convincing holdouts to support the legislation, with the White House calling failure to pass it "the ultimate betrayal."</p>

          <p>The Army is preparing to ship Abrams tanks and other military vehicles to Washington, D.C., for a parade marking its 250th anniversary, which coincides with President Donald Trump's birthday. The celebration has sparked speculation that Trump is seeking a grand military parade similar to one he desired in his first term. The event is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, with heavy equipment being staged at West Potomac Park and the parade proceeding along Constitution Avenue, concluding near the White House with a parachutist delivering a flag to Trump.</p>

          <p>A Texas doctor, Jorge Zamora-Quezada, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for a healthcare fraud scheme where he misdiagnosed thousands of patients with degenerative diseases and profited from their treatments. The treatments included unnecessary chemotherapy and intravenous infusions, causing significant harm to patients, including teenagers, elderly, and disabled individuals. Prosecutors highlighted Zamora-Quezada's extravagant lifestyle funded by the fraud, contrasting it with the deteriorating health of his victims. The Justice Department sees the case as emblematic of efforts to vindicate victims and counter wasteful government spending.</p>

          <p>The FDA is considering a new framework for COVID-19 vaccines, potentially limiting access to initial vaccinations for healthy children. The agency will require new clinical trial data for approving new formulations of COVID shots for healthy individuals under 65. Experts are concerned that this policy could prevent most American children from receiving their first series of COVID vaccines. While children are less likely to experience severe COVID, they are still vulnerable to its effects, and a safe vaccine can lower that risk.</p>

The judge stated that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations.

          <p>President Donald Trump appears to be stepping back from personally brokering a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, signaling a change in strategy. After calls with Putin and Zelensky, Trump suggested the conflict is a European situation and indicated he will no longer work to broker a deal. Trump has been deferential to Putin, often affirming Russia's narrative about the war and demanding Ukrainian concessions. The US may be reducing its involvement in peace talks, leaving Europe to bear more responsibility.</p>
