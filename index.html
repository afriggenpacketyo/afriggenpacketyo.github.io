          <p>Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey have filed motions to dismiss his federal indictment, alleging it stems from President Trump's personal animus and constitutes vindictive prosecution. They also challenge the lawful appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who signed the indictment. Comey's legal team argues there are constitutional violations and an abuse of power, requesting thorough discovery into the prosecutorial decision-making process. Prosecutors, in turn, are questioning the eligibility of Comey's lead defense counsel duey to alleged prior classified information disclosure.</p>

          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a critical minerals deal, aiming to bolster rare earths supplies and reduce reliance on China, which currently controls most of the market. The agreement includes a $1 billion joint investment over six months to expand Australia's mining and processing capabilities, supporting $8.5 billion in "ready-to-go" projects. This partnership, evolving since Trump's first term, also addresses issues like pricing and permitting. The US specifically committed to investing in an advanced gallium refinery in Western Australia and providing $2.2 billion in financing for critical minerals projects.</p>

          <p>St. Johns, Michigan, a city of approximately 8,000 residents, has begun regulating golf cart use on public roads due to safety concerns. With an estimated 2,000 golf carts primarily used for transportation, the city now restricts them to streets with speed limits of 25 mph or lower and requires drivers to be at least 18 with a valid license. Inspections for working turn signals and horns are also mandatory. This trend reflects a broader national shift, as golf carts are increasingly adopted for lifestyle rather than just golf, prompting over two dozen Michigan communities to enact similar ordinances.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, "Nobody's Girl," co-written by Amy Wallace, details her alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and her claims of three encounters with Prince Andrew. Andrew, who settled with Giuffre in 2022 and denies the allegations, recently announced he is voluntarily ceasing use of his royal titles, including Duke of York. Wallace views this as a "victory" for Giuffre, calling it a symbolic step toward accountability for the men involved in the alleged trafficking. Calls persist for his titles to be formally removed.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Pediatrics reveals that landmark 2015 medical advice to introduce peanut products to infants as early as four months has significantly reduced peanut allergies. Approximately 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies, with rates in children aged 0-3 declining over 27% after initial guidance and over 40% after expanded recommendations in 2017. This real-world data reinforces the effectiveness of early allergen introduction, despite initial slow adoption by pediatricians. Advocates emphasize continued education and policy changes, such as including peanut products in infant food packages, to further combat rising food allergy prevalence.</p>

          <p>Thieves executed a brazen daytime heist at the Louvre Museum, making off with eight priceless pieces from the Apollon Gallery, home to the French crown jewels. Among the stolen items were Empress Eugénie's Pearl and Diamond Tiara, a Grand Corsage Bow brooch, a sapphire set from Queen Marie-Amélie, and an emerald set from Empress Marie-Louise. The robbers gained entry using a crane-type lift to an upper window, smashed display cases, and escaped on motorcycles, dropping Empress Eugenie's crown outside.

Despite Republican attempts to dismiss them as "antifa" gatherings, the demonstrations have largely remained peaceful.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has completed a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, marking an encouraging step in his treatment. His spokeswoman confirmed he "rang the bell" at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology, a common practice for patients finishing cancer treatment. Biden, who turns 83 next month, was diagnosed in May with advanced prostate cancer, characterized by a high Gleason score and metastasis to the bone. While this signals progress, further assessment of his condition will be necessary, as doctors typically evaluate patient response in the weeks following therapy.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court panel has overturned a lower court's restraining order, ruling that President Trump has the authority to federalize 200 Oregon National Guard troops. However, a separate order still prohibits the actual deployment of any National Guard members to Portland for now. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals majority sided with the administration, stating the president can determine when to dispatch soldiers domestically. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield plans to seek a broader panel review, arguing the ruling grants the president unilateral power without sufficient justification, while a dissenting judge criticized the decision for eroding constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>The internet is entering a "golden age of slop," where AI-generated content, from videos to text, is becoming ubiquitous and indistinguishable from human-created material. New social networks like Vibes showcase endless AI-generated videos, while politicians, including President Trump, use AI for propaganda. This proliferation of synthetic content, which recently surpassed human-written articles in volume, is seen as an invasive species polluting search results and academic archives. Experts warn of a "collective delusion" around AI, where hype overshadows the dull reality of its output, leading to a pervasive disorientation and potential "model collapse" as AI feeds off its own generated errors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two abuse survivors, Fiona Goddard and Ellie-Ann Reynolds, have resigned from the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, raising serious concerns about its integrity. Goddard cited "condescending and controlling language" towards survivors and a lack of transparency, particularly regarding the shortlisted chairs, who reportedly have backgrounds in policing and social work—the very services accused of past cover-ups. The Home Office denied claims of "watering down" the inquiry and committed to collecting ethnicity data on perpetrators. Critics, including shadow home secretary Chris Philp, are demanding a senior judge lead the inquiry to ensure impartiality and restore trust among survivors.</p>

          <p>A significant Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage caused widespread disruption to numerous major websites and online services, including Snapchat, Reddit, and various banking platforms. The issues, which began around 7:00 BST, highlighted the global internet's reliance on a few dominant cloud providers. Although Amazon reported fixing the underlying problem, identified as a DNS resolution issue with DynamoDB in its US-East-1 region, some services experienced lingering problems. Experts warn that such outages underscore the fragility of concentrated infrastructure and the need for companies to implement robust backup systems to mitigate widespread impact.</p>

          <p>China's "AI+" initiative, initially seen as an economic stimulus, is revealed as a comprehensive plan for multidimensional societal transformation by 2035. Official analyses forecast China becoming a "land of infinite hope," envisioning widespread robot companions and even AI-assisted child-rearing. However, the government and its advisors are actively planning to mitigate significant risks, including mass unemployment, erosion of family structures, human-machine conflicts, ethical upheavals, and increased social inequality. This ambitious strategy aims to reshape politics, economy, society, science, technology, and China's global standing.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey announced that European troops are "ready to deploy" to Ukraine within weeks if a ceasefire is agreed upon by President Trump and Vladimir Putin. This potential deployment, involving a "coalition of the willing" from 26 European nations, would aim to secure Ukraine's border. The announcement follows reports of a tense meeting where Trump allegedly pressed Ukrainian President Zelensky to cede territory to Russia. Healey emphasized that Ukrainians must decide negotiation terms and warned of a "new era of threat" in Europe, also granting British soldiers new powers to shoot down threatening drones at military bases.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report has concluded that a substandard cable was the cause of the deadly Lisbon funicular crash in September, which killed 16 people and injured 21. The investigation by the Office for Air and Rail Accident Prevention and Investigation (GPIAAF) found that the underground steel haulage cable, in use for less than a year, did not meet the city's transport operator's specifications. The cable snapped, sending the top carriage hurtling down the hill. All other funiculars in the city remain suspended, as inspectors verify braking systems capable of immobilizing cabins in the event of cable breaks.</p>

          <p>Demolition has commenced on a portion of the White House East Wing to make way for President Trump's planned $250 million ballroom, sparking widespread criticism. The project, described by Trump as "fully modernised" and privately funded by "generous Patriots," has been called an "utter desecration" by a former lawmaker. Photos show construction crews tearing down parts of a covered entryway and windows. This marks one of the largest White House projects in over a century, aiming to create a 90,000 sq ft venue capable of hosting large events, despite ongoing government shutdown and public outcry over the cost and impact on the historic building.</p>
