        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Timothy Johnson, a longtime medical reporter and founding editor of the Harvard Medical School Health Letter, has voiced strong opposition to the Trump administration's recent budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). According to Johnson, the administration's decision to halt payments on grants totaling over $1.8 billion for nearly 700 medical research projects will cause terrible damage to outstanding research programs and will destroy the careers of many young medical scientists. Johnson believes that many of these defunded researchers will seek positions in other countries, resulting in a "brain drain" that will affect the nation's health for generations to come.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has continued releasing people charged with being in the country illegally to non-governmental shelters along the US-Mexico border, even after suggesting that providing aid to immigrants may be illegal. A letter from FEMA raised concerns about shelters potentially committing felony offenses related to bringing people across the border illegally. Despite this, ICE continued to request shelters to house people, creating a contradiction and forcing shelters to choose between providing humanitarian aid and potentially violating federal law. Shelters have maintained close relations with federal immigration authorities at the ground level, even amid public criticism from senior officials.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the limitations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and proposes a shift toward protecting entire ecosystems rather than focusing solely on individual species. The author suggests that the current approach, which requires specific plans for each endangered species, is inefficient and can be undermined if a single species goes extinct. Instead, the article advocates for a "native ecosystem-protection act" to supplement the ESA, ensuring that each type of American ecosystem has sufficient protected area. This approach recognizes the dynamic nature of ecosystems and could provide broader protection for biodiversity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decisions, including one concerning the removal of officials from the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards, have been criticized for expanding presidential authority. The author argues that the court's actions effectively overruled a long-standing precedent without full briefing or argument, consolidating more power in the presidency. These decisions, coupled with others involving presidential immunity, have enabled the president to act as if he is above the law. The author expresses concern that the court's actions undermine lower courts seeking to protect the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following a house fire in Brent, north-west London, that resulted in the deaths of a 43-year-old woman and her three children. Emergency services responded to the blaze in Tillett Close, Stonebridge, where they found the victims, including a 15-year-old girl and two boys aged eight and four. Two terraced three-storey homes were severely damaged in the fire, and another woman in her 70s and a teenage girl were taken to hospital. Police and the fire service are investigating the cause of the blaze.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish was left out of Manchester City's squad for their final Premier League game against Fulham, leading to increased uncertainty regarding his future with the club. The 29-year-old midfielder has only made seven Premier League starts this season, scoring once in each of the Premier League, Champions League, and FA Cup. Former City goalkeeper Shay Given suggested that Grealish may need to explore other career options. The team has failed to win a trophy this season, but a point at Craven Cottage should secure a Champions League place for next season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to defund Voice of America (VOA) has particularly affected countries like Turkey, where press freedom is already under threat. VOA, often a rare source of uncensored news, was banned in Turkey in 2022. The shutdown has silenced a critical voice in a media environment increasingly under pressure from the government. The move has been criticized as part of Trump's broader "war on the press," limiting access to balanced coverage of Turkish-US relations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of studying parent-child relationships, the author introduces "emotionally safe parenting" as a framework for raising successful children. This approach emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, view misbehavior as a signal for support, and take responsibility after conflicts. The author provides practical steps for parents to create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves and embrace their authentic selves.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming toward Syria has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. After a series of Israeli airstrikes on Syria, Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara and announced plans to lift sanctions, leading to a near cessation of Israeli strikes. This shift in US policy has undermined Israel's efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor. Some experts suggest that Israel is now seeking ways to de-escalate and open dialogue with the Syrian regime.</p>

          <p>Starr County, Texas, once a Democratic stronghold, voted Republican for the first time in 132 years, reflecting a broader political realignment. The shift is attributed to a decline in traditional machine politics and the rise of ideological voting, with working-class Hispanics moving towards the Republican Party. The county's preoccupation with local elections and a tradition of machine politics made it ripe for a sudden shift. As old partisan ties weaken, the shift shows the tension between new and old-school politics.</p>
