          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from cutting $11 billion in COVID-19 related public health funding.  This follows a lawsuit filed by 23 states and the District of Columbia, alleging that the cuts would severely harm public health programs. The temporary order will last for two weeks, with a longer-term injunction to be considered later. Democratic officials celebrated the ruling, highlighting the potential negative impact on disease tracking and vital public health services.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies applied for a patent on ternary logic for integrated circuits, aiming to improve AI chip design and reduce energy consumption.  Ternary logic, an alternative to binary computing, could potentially reduce the number of transistors needed, mitigating the power demands of AI data centers.  The patent application, made public recently, comes amidst ongoing US sanctions and technological competition.  It remains uncertain whether this technology can be commercially viable on a large scale.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have created winners and losers across Europe. Luxury goods, food and beverage manufacturers, and automakers are among the hardest hit sectors. Germany, as the EU's largest exporter to the US, faces significant economic consequences.  Retailers with Asian supply chains are also negatively impacted by high tariffs on Asian imports.  Conversely, some European currencies like the Euro and British Pound briefly strengthened, and the pharmaceutical sector shows mixed results. The overall impact is expected to be negative for the European economy.</p>
