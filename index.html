          <p>South Korea's LG Energy Solution has secured a major $4.3 billion contract to supply batteries to an undisclosed major corporation, with the deal concluding in July 2030. While the company has not named its partner due to business confidentiality, reports suggest the counterparty is Tesla, which recently confirmed a separate chip deal with Samsung. The significant contract value surpasses LG Energy's entire revenue for the second quarter of this year. The company is expanding its manufacturing presence in the U.S. with new plants in Michigan and Arizona. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom is set to issue an executive order that will allow local governments in the Los Angeles area to limit new housing development in neighborhoods with very high fire risk. This move exempts these areas from SB 9, a 2021 state law designed to increase housing density by allowing up to four units on single-family lots. The decision follows pressure from Los Angeles officials who raised concerns that increased density in fire-prone zones like Pacific Palisades could dangerously strain evacuation routes during future wildfires.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel agrees to end the ongoing crisis in Gaza, a significant shift in its foreign policy. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the move is intended to "affect the situation on the ground" and create a pathway to peace amid the suffering in the region. The decision has drawn criticism from opposition parties, with some arguing recognition should be immediate and unconditional, while others believe the timing is inappropriate. The policy also includes conditions for Hamas, such as releasing all hostages and disarming.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced its intention to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," a key scientific determination that classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health under the Clean Air Act. This finding has served as the legal basis for regulating emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources for over a decade. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action intended to save billions, while critics and environmental groups have called it "criminal negligence" that ignores overwhelming scientific evidence and will be challenged in court.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials are drafting an ordinance to prohibit law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from concealing their identities while on duty. The proposal requires officers to visibly display identification and bans the use of masks, with exceptions for specific situations like undercover work. This move was prompted by recent federal immigration raids where some agents wore masks and did not identify themselves, causing fear and eroding public trust. While officials defend masking for officer safety, the county aims to enforce transparency, though its authority over federal agencies may face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% year-over-year in the second quarter, its lowest point since March 2021 and below economists' expectations. This figure brings inflation to the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2-3% target range, strengthening the argument for a potential interest rate cut. While the RBA has held its policy rate steady to confirm the downward trend, analysts suggest this weaker inflation data, combined with a softer global growth outlook, provides sufficient evidence for the bank to consider easing its policy.

Rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns are diminishing the high-altitude pastures that the yaks depend on for grazing, leading to a decline in the yak population. This environmental pressure, combined with younger generations seeking less arduous work in other sectors like tourism, is causing the ancient practice of herding to fade.
