          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Donald Trump to discuss economic developments, including growth, employment, and inflation. Powell emphasized that monetary policy decisions would be based on objective, non-political analysis, assuring that the Fed remains committed to its mandate of full employment and stable prices. This meeting occurred amid Trump's repeated calls for lower interest rates, which he believes would give the U.S. an economic advantage. Powell stated he would not initiate meetings with the president, but accepted Trump's invitation to discuss the economy, with markets expecting the Fed to maintain current rates until greater clarity emerges.

          <p>Industry tracker IWSR projects that non-alcoholic beer will overtake ale as the second-largest beer category worldwide by volume this year. While overall beer volume declined in 2024, non-alcoholic beer experienced a 9% increase globally, fueled by health-conscious consumers and improved taste. Lager remains the dominant beer category, holding 92% of the market share, though non-alcoholic beer's growth is driven by younger generations adopting "sober curious" lifestyles. Major beer brands are investing in zero-proof alternatives, with non-alcoholic beer retail sales surpassing $17 billion in 2023, and Athletic Brewing leading the U.S. market.</p>

The decision to reopen West Maui to tourists shortly after the fire also worsened the situation, contributing to a sense of powerlessness and increased violence.
