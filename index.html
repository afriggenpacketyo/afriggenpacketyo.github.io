          <h2>Texas Law Mandates Ten Commandments Display in Classrooms, Faces Legal Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law in Texas will require public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, making it the largest state to attempt such a mandate. The law, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, is expected to face legal challenges based on the separation of church and state, similar to a blocked law in Louisiana. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents, including some faith leaders, argue it infringes on religious freedom, considering the diverse religious backgrounds of Texas students. In 2005, Abbott successfully argued for a Ten Commandments monument on the state capitol grounds.</p>

The State Department has also issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel, urging Americans not to travel there due to armed conflict and civil unrest. As tensions between Israel and Iran escalate, both countries have experienced missile strikes resulting in numerous casualties, including several lightly wounded U.S. citizens.</p>

          <p>A BBC report provides a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges faced by a GP practice in Nottingham, England, during the daily 8 AM rush for appointments. Receptionists at Tudor House Medical Practice describe the high demand and frustration from patients trying to secure same-day appointments, leading to verbal abuse. The practice has implemented measures to improve access, such as online booking and a call-back system, but increasing demand and a shortage of GPs continue to create pressure. A new government deal aims to alleviate the early morning phone scramble by providing additional funding and promoting online appointments.</p>

          <p>The BBC explores the growing trend of Y2K core, which reflects nostalgia for the late 1990s and early 2000s culture. The pop-punk band South Arcade exemplifies this trend with their music, drawing inspiration from artists like Rihanna, Korn, and Justice. While some fans are original listeners revisiting the era, many younger fans find escapism in the maximalist aesthetic of the time, contrasting it with the minimalism of modern phone culture. Despite the cost-of-living crisis impacting musicians, South Arcade utilizes TikTok to connect with audiences and bring the Y2K aesthetic to a new generation.</p>
