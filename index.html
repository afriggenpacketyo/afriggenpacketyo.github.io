These tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, will affect cars made in the United States, as they often contain components produced abroad. While the tariffs will not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico, they are expected to increase costs for consumers and create uncertainty for automakers, who may struggle to relocate assembly lines and commit to domestic manufacturing due to trade policy instability.</p>

          <p>Olympic track medalist Fred Kerley is charged with misdemeanor battery in Florida for allegedly hitting Alaysha Johnson, a hurdler who also competed in the Olympics, with a closed fist. The Broward County Sheriff's Office arrest report indicates that Johnson sustained a bloody nose in the incident. Kerley's attorney claims he is the target of unfounded allegations due to jealousy from competitors and asks the public not to rush to judgment. This is not Kerley's first legal issue, as he has been previously arrested for allegedly punching a Miami Beach police officer and for domestic battery against his wife.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term as Australia's Prime Minister, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian leader has achieved this feat. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's failure to perform well during the campaign. The election was heavily influenced by energy policy, inflation, and cost-of-living concerns, with Albanese accusing Dutton's party of mimicking U.S. President Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Albanese on his re-election, emphasizing the enduring alliance and deep ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are calling up South Korean utilityman Hyeseong Kim, a highly touted defensive and base-stealing weapon, for his major league debut. Kim, who signed a three-year contract this winter, struggled in spring training but has shown improvement in Triple-A Oklahoma City, batting .252 with five home runs and 13 stolen bases. The move comes as utilityman Tommy Edman is battling an ankle injury, potentially opening the door for Kim to receive consistent playing time.</p>

          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP) has secured another sweeping victory in the general elections, winning 87 out of 97 seats in parliament. This win bolsters the mandate of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who was facing his first test at the ballot box since taking office last year. The PAP has governed the wealthy city-state since before its independence in 1965, and the strong showing in this election strengthens Wong's position as he navigates Singapore through economic uncertainty and rising living costs.</p>

Laid-off employees expressed concern that the safety of millions of workers is compromised without these approvals.</p>

The acquisition, set to close next month, will make Capital One both a credit card issuer and a payment network operator, a structure that could deliver billions of dollars in benefits. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized that global expansion of Discover's network would create a "flywheel effect" for the combined business, but it could take at least three to five years to build Discover's international presence in a materially larger way.
