          <p>China's Defence Ministry has cautioned the Philippines against what it calls "self-inflicted destruction" for agreeing to host U.S. missile systems. Beijing views the move as binding Manila to the "US war machine," arguing it undermines regional stability and the common interests of neighboring nations. The warning came after the Philippines utilized U.S. anti-ship missiles in a joint military exercise and announced plans to keep them as a deterrent. This exchange highlights the escalating geopolitical tensions in the disputed South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump recently advocated for a major tax-and-spending bill, emphasizing its benefits for working families and increased funding for immigration enforcement. However, he notably omitted a previous July 4 deadline, signaling potential difficulties with its passage in the Senate. The proposed legislation is highly controversial, featuring extensions of previous tax cuts alongside significant funding reductions for programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Democrats have strongly criticized the bill, warning it could cause millions to lose insurance and food assistance.</p>

          <p>A classified intelligence briefing for U.S. senators regarding recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities has resulted in starkly partisan interpretations of the mission's success. Republican senators, like Lindsey Graham, supported the administration's claim that the sites were "obliterated," setting back Iran's program by years. Conversely, Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Chris Murphy, expressed skepticism, stating the briefing provided no coherent long-term strategy and that the "obliterated" claim is misleading. The division underscores the ongoing political conflict over the administration's military actions and transparency with Congress.</p>

The project aims to combat extreme temperatures by implementing solutions like planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. This urban laboratory provides a potential template for other cities as climate change intensifies heat waves. Researchers are studying the project's effectiveness, noting that green spaces can significantly reduce peak urban temperatures.</p>

A spokeswoman stated the deadline is not critical and could be moved, depending on the president's decision. This development comes as Japan's top negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks aimed at securing concessions on the proposed higher duties. The pause applies to country-specific tariffs for about 60 trading partners, with Japan facing a potential additional tariff of 14 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

These claims starkly contrast with U.S. and Israeli assessments that Iran's nuclear program was set back by years.

          <p>Russia's ambassador to Japan, Nikolay Nozdrev, is expected to attend the annual peace ceremony in Nagasaki this August, commemorating the 1945 U.S. atomic bombing. This will mark the first time a Russian envoy has attended since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. The decision follows the Nagasaki city government's move to adopt a more inclusive invitation policy. Last year, the city controversially chose not to invite Israel due to its conflict with Palestinian militants, prompting a reevaluation of its approach.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is facing criticism domestically for his decision to skip a recent NATO summit in the Netherlands at the last minute. The move has been questioned by members of his own party, who view fostering ties with the military alliance as vital for countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. Speculation suggests Ishiba may have sought to avoid pressure from U.S. President Trump to increase Japan's defense spending. NATO leaders at the summit discussed substantial increases in their own defense budgets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's goal to deport one million people this year appears increasingly unrealistic, according to recent analysis and ICE statistics. With half the year gone, the agency has carried out only about 125,000 deportations. A whistleblower complaint from a former DOJ lawyer alleges that top officials, frustrated by legal roadblocks, considered defying court orders to accelerate removals. This suggests the administration is struggling with the legal and logistical complexities of its signature policy, leading to conflicts with the judiciary rather than admitting the plan's practical shortcomings.</p>

          <p>Brendan Foley, the CEO of spice maker McCormick, stated that the company is focused on the agricultural impact of new tariffs and has been working to mitigate their effects. While 90% of McCormick's products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, many key ingredients like black pepper are sourced from abroad and cannot be grown in the U.S. Foley noted that the company's ability to source from multiple international markets helps manage risk. His comments came after McCormick reported better-than-expected earnings, with shares rising over 5 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against the notion that the stock market rally is too narrow, pointing to a diverse group of top-performing S&P 500 stocks as evidence of broad success. He highlighted gains in varied sectors, including a solar energy company (Enphase), a copper miner (Freeport-McMoRan), a crypto platform (Coinbase), and a biotech outfit (Incyte). Cramer suggested that this breadth, which also included data center, utility, and energy stocks, indicates a genuinely bullish and robust market rally, contradicting warnings from those who feared a lack of diverse leadership.

          <p>Nike announced that new tariffs are expected to cost the company approximately $1 billion in the current fiscal year, calling the duties a "new and meaningful" challenge. The sneaker giant plans to mitigate this cost through supply chain adjustments, price increases, and reducing its manufacturing presence in China. This news came as Nike reported a staggering 86% drop in quarterly profit due to its ongoing turnaround plan, which involves clearing old inventory and resetting its business strategy. Despite the poor results, the company signaled that the worst financial impacts are likely behind them. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida is moving forward with plans to build a tent-based immigrant detention facility, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," in the Big Cypress National Preserve. The project, championed by Governor Ron DeSantis, is part of a broader Trump administration push against undocumented immigration and is being built with federal emergency funds. The plan has drawn fierce opposition from activists, environmentalists, and Native American tribes, for whom the land is sacred and historically significant. Critics have blasted the project as a cruel political stunt that wastes hurricane relief funds and threatens a fragile ecosystem.</p>
