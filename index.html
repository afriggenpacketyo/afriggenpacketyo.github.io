          <p>Major European private equity firms, including ICG and CVC Capital Partners, saw their stock values fall significantly as concerns over risky lending practices in the U.S. private credit market spread across the Atlantic. The sell-off follows recent high-profile collapses of U.S. companies, which has intensified scrutiny of credit quality and underwriting standards. Top financial leaders, including J.P. Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon and officials from the ECB and IMF, have issued warnings about potential hidden stresses and spillover effects from the less-regulated private credit sector. This has prompted calls for closer regulatory oversight of the rapidly growing market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report details the significant financial pressure U.S. trade tariffs are placing on small businesses, forcing many to take on high-interest loans, raise prices, and halt hiring. Unlike larger corporations that can absorb costs or shift supply chains, smaller companies face slimmer margins and less negotiating power, making them particularly vulnerable. Several business owners shared their experiences of declining sales and mounting debt, with some fearing they could lose their businesses entirely. Economists suggest these struggles could be an early warning sign of broader economic challenges, acting as a "canary in the coal mine" for larger companies.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as national security adviser under Donald Trump, has pleaded not guilty to 18 federal charges related to the mishandling of classified materials. Prosecutors allege that Bolton illegally shared sensitive, diary-like entries with relatives via personal email and retained top-secret documents at his home. Bolton and his legal team maintain his innocence, arguing that his actions were lawful and that he is the latest political opponent to be targeted by a weaponized Justice Department. The case adds to the ongoing legal scrutiny Bolton has faced since his contentious departure from the White House and the publication of his memoir.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is entering its third week with no resolution in sight, as Democratic lawmakers express a fundamental lack of trust in President Trump, hindering negotiations. Bipartisan "gangs" that have historically broken such legislative stalemates have not formed, with Democrats wary that the president could renege on any potential agreement. Republican leaders insist that the government must reopen before any negotiations can occur, while Democrats demand an "ironclad path forward" on key issues like healthcare subsidies. Polling data suggests that a majority of Americans currently blame the president and congressional Republicans for the shutdown.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled proposals aimed at making in vitro fertilization (IVF) more affordable, falling far short of the president's campaign pledge to make the procedure free. The plan offers federal guidance for employers to provide optional fertility coverage and secured discounts on some IVF medications, but includes no new subsidies or mandates. Fertility advocacy groups offered cautious praise for the attention on the issue, while Democrats dismissed the plan as an empty gesture. The proposal also failed to appease some religious conservatives who oppose IVF, ultimately creating a policy that satisfied almost no one.</p>

In response, Leavitt labeled Jeffries an "America Last, stone-cold loser," accusing Democrats of prioritizing radical interests over the American people.

It also suggests splitting investment funds between both metals and adhering to the conventional wisdom of limiting total precious metal holdings to no more than 10% of an overall portfolio to maintain diversification.

President Trump had labeled the plan a "green scam" and his administration reportedly threatened tariffs against countries that voted in favor of the deal. The agreement, which would have been the first to set internationally mandated emission reduction targets for an entire industry, was scuttled by a narrow vote to delay proceedings for a year.

The choice of Hungary as a venue is notable, as Orbán's government has frequently opposed E.U. financial and military support for Ukraine and has blocked its bid to join the European Union, creating tension with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

Lowe, who was expelled from Reform UK after a dispute with its leadership, expressed his delight with the appointment and promised to ask tough questions about how taxpayer money is spent.

The survey reveals particularly low approval for his handling of the cost of living and tariff policies.

          <p>Beijing has issued a stern warning to the United Kingdom, threatening "consequences" over repeated delays in the approval process for its proposed new mega-embassy in London. The UK government has pushed back its decision on the controversial project for a second time, citing the need for more information and ongoing discussions with the Foreign and Home Offices. China's foreign ministry accused the UK of politicizing the matter and going against its commitments to improve relations. The proposed complex, located near the Tower of London, has faced opposition from the local council and raised national security concerns among some observers.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, was indicted Thursday on 18 criminal counts for allegedly mishandling classified information. The indictment accuses Bolton of sharing top-secret material from his personal diaries with family members via non-governmental email accounts and storing classified documents at his home. Bolton has vehemently denied the charges, calling them a politically motivated abuse of power and part of an effort to intimidate the president's opponents. This makes him the third prominent Trump critic to be indicted in recent weeks, following charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor investigating the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski discovered a surprising personal link to the case. The victim's ex-wife, Heather Snyder, who was a central figure in the investigation, was a high school classmate of the reporter from her small Pennsylvania hometown. Snyder's boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was convicted of the murder, and during his trial, the defense raised questions about Snyder's potential involvement. In an exclusive interview, Snyder addressed these suspicions, maintained her innocence, and explained her decision to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during the trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with delinquent credit card debt, wage garnishment is a serious potential consequence that allows creditors to take a portion of earnings directly from a paycheck. Federal law limits this amount to the lesser of 25% of disposable income or the amount by which weekly earnings exceed 30 times the federal minimum wage. However, many states have enacted stricter rules that offer greater protection for debtors, with some even prohibiting wage garnishment for unsecured debts entirely. The article advises that addressing delinquent debt through negotiation, debt management plans, or, as a last resort, bankruptcy is crucial to avoid this outcome.</p>

The report also pointed to overstretched valuations for tech stocks and volatility in government bond markets as significant threats.

          <p>While national overdose fatalities have been declining, Alaska is experiencing a resurgence, with the Matanuska-Susitna borough seeing one of the highest increases in the country. In a state where remoteness and a culture of independence can foster isolation, many fentanyl users rely on close-knit communities as a lifeline, administering the overdose-reversal drug naloxone to one another. Harm reduction organizations and community members are working to distribute supplies and provide support, but their efforts are often complicated by official "clean-up" initiatives that disperse these vital support networks. Indigenous Alaskans are disproportionately affected by the crisis.</p>

The White House is using an onerous regulatory review process, imposing new diversity mandate rules retroactively on contracts that were already signed and underway. This move, which appears designed to exert political pressure on New York's Democratic leaders, sets a troubling precedent that could allow the administration to shut down federally subsidized projects nationwide.
