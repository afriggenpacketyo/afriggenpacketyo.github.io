          <p>CrowdStrike's shares experienced a dip in extended trading after the cybersecurity firm released a revenue outlook that fell short of expectations. While the company's first-quarter earnings per share exceeded estimates, revenue matched expectations with a nearly 20% increase compared to the previous year. Despite increased costs in sales, marketing, research, and development due to a software outage last summer, CrowdStrike anticipates adjusted earnings per share between 82 and 84 cents for the current quarter, while analysts were expecting 81 cents. CrowdStrike has also earmarked $1 billion for share buybacks and aims for a free cash flow margin above 30% for the 2027 fiscal year.

          <p>Sources indicate that former President Trump has privately voiced his dissatisfaction with some of his Supreme Court appointments, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett being a primary target of his frustration. Trump reportedly believes these justices should be more supportive of his agenda. Allies of Trump have also criticized Barrett, with some publicly questioning her conservative credentials. Despite these private complaints, Trump has not publicly attacked Barrett, and his administration maintains that he respects the Supreme Court's role.

          <p>California officials are condemning reports that the Trump administration may remove Harvey Milk's name from a naval ship, the USNS Harvey Milk, which was named in honor of the slain gay rights leader and Navy veteran. The potential renaming is seen as a slap in the face to the LGBTQ+ community, especially during Pride month. Milk, one of the first openly gay elected officials in the U.S., served in the Navy before becoming an activist. Supporters argue that removing his name would erase his legacy and send a negative message to young queer people. The controversy underscores the ongoing debate over LGBTQ+ rights and representation in public life.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, have filed a motion requesting that he appear in court without handcuffs or a bulletproof vest. The defense argues that these visible restraints are unnecessary and reinforce a damaging public perception of Mangione as dangerous, undermining his presumption of innocence. They point to a photograph of Mangione in shackles that garnered significant attention online, arguing that it impedes his right to a fair trial. Mangione's legal team emphasizes his cooperation with law enforcement and lack of disruptive behavior since his arrest, contrasting his treatment in state court with that in federal court, where he faces the possibility of the death penalty.</p>

          <p>As Russia-Ukraine peace talks resume, the former US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, has cautioned against overestimating Beijing's potential role. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, Burns suggested that China's growing interest in Ukraine's reconstruction may be more of a strategic move than a gesture of goodwill, given Beijing's support for Moscow throughout the war. Burns' comments reflect Washington's concerns that China could leverage its aid to gain influence in Ukraine while avoiding accountability for supporting Russia's actions. The situation underscores the complex dynamics of international diplomacy and the challenges of navigating geopolitical interests.</p>

          <p>Major tech companies, including Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, are vying to create "everything apps" powered by artificial intelligence. These apps aim to consolidate various online functions, such as search, social media, shopping, and work software, into a single, personalized interface. This push is driven by the industry's pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the desire to entrench their products in people's daily lives. However, concerns remain about the reliability of AI models, the potential for misuse, and the concentration of data and power in the hands of a few tech giants. The race to create everything apps reflects the tech industry's ongoing quest for dominance and control over the digital landscape.</p>

The Fed stated that the removal reflects the substantial progress the bank has made in addressing its deficiencies and fulfilling the required conditions. The removal of the cap will allow Wells Fargo to increase deposits, expand loan activity, and grow its dealmaking division, presenting new growth opportunities for the company.
