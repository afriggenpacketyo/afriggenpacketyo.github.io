          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators participated in a pro-Palestine march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza despite heavy rain. The event, which caused major traffic disruptions, proceeded after the NSW Supreme Court authorized it, overturning an initial rejection by police who had cited safety concerns. The march drew notable figures like Julian Assange and highlighted public pressure on the Australian government regarding its stance on Palestinian statehood, a topic of ongoing debate as other Western nations consider recognition.</p>

While acknowledging some minor progress, officials expressed deep concern over the humanitarian situation and reports that significant quantities of aid are being diverted by Hamas and other criminal groups. Germany has also been contributing directly to relief efforts by air-dropping food and medical supplies into the territory.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense to combat the rising number of illegal Channel crossings, specifically targeting those who advertise such journeys online. The proposed legislation could result in prison sentences of up to five years for individuals creating and sharing material that facilitates breaches of UK immigration law. This move aims to disrupt the business model of people-smuggling gangs, though the opposition has criticized the plan as being insufficient to solve the crisis.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is widely anticipated to cut its main interest rate to 4% in an effort to stimulate the UK's stagnating economy. The decision is driven by concerns over rising unemployment, recent economic contraction, and the potential impact of new US import tariffs on global trade. While the rate cut aims to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, it also underscores the growing risk of stagflation, where high inflation persists alongside weak economic growth.

          <p>A new scientific study suggests that successful efforts to clean up air pollution in East Asia over the past decade may have unintentionally accelerated the rate of global warming. The significant reduction in pollutants, especially in China, removed light-reflecting aerosols from the atmosphere that previously had a cooling effect on the planet. Researchers theorize that this has unmasked the full impact of greenhouse gases, potentially contributing a measurable amount to the global temperature increase observed since 2010.</p>

          <p>According to a report in The Sunday Mirror, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has been questioned by U.S. lawyers about her knowledge of three British individuals linked to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The focus of the questioning is reportedly on associates other than Prince Andrew, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing. This development suggests that legal inquiries into Epstein's extensive network of contacts and enablers are continuing, even after Maxwell's conviction and imprisonment.</p>

          <p>Over three decades later, the brutal murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop remain unsolved, with focus returning to an early, unresolved lead.

Investigators and defense attorneys are now revisiting the mystery of two unidentified male customers who were seen in the shop just before the crime and who, unlike dozens of other patrons, never came forward or were identified.</p>
