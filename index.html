          <p>The U.S. Senate has rejected two separate short-term funding proposals, one from the House and a counter-offer from Democrats, significantly increasing the likelihood of a government shutdown. With the October 1 deadline looming, partisan gridlock continues as leaders from both parties blame each other for the impasse. The House-passed bill would have funded the government through November 21, but failed to secure enough votes to advance in the Senate. Congress now has limited time to find a compromise before federal agencies are forced to close.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint was improperly written and violated court rules. Judge Steven Merryday described the 85-page lawsuit as "repetitive," "superfluous," and akin to a "political document rather than a serious legal filing." He stated that a legal complaint is not a platform to "rage against an adversary." The judge has given Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended complaint that adheres to the requirement for a "short and plain statement."</p>

          <p>NATO has intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets that violated the airspace of Estonia, a member of the alliance. The incident, which Estonia's foreign ministry called "unprecedentedly brazen," prompted the nation to request Article 4 consultations, which trigger urgent discussions among NATO members. This event follows recent incursions of Russian drones into Polish and Romanian airspace, further escalating tensions between Russia and the West. Top EU and NATO officials condemned the act as a dangerous provocation, vowing to strengthen defenses on the alliance's eastern flank.</p>

Companies such as Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir are among the contributors to the project, which is being spearheaded by a top political fundraiser for the president. In exchange for their contributions, donors may receive recognition, with one option being their names etched into the ballroom itself. The White House has stated that nearly $200 million has been pledged for the addition.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has sharply criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr for his comments threatening ABC's broadcast license over remarks made by host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared Carr's warning—stating "we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way"—to a mafia-style threat, calling the rhetoric "dangerous as hell." While stating he was glad Kimmel was suspended, Cruz warned against the government censoring media based on content, arguing it would ultimately harm conservatives. This places Cruz at odds with the administration, which has praised Carr's actions.</p>

          <p>Sable Offshore Corp., a Texas oil company seeking to restart production off the Santa Barbara coast, is facing multiple criminal charges for alleged environmental law violations.

The company denies the allegations, calling them "politically motivated." This legal challenge complicates Sable's efforts to reactivate three offshore platforms and a pipeline network that was previously responsible for a major oil spill in 2015.</p>

          <p>Experts identify three primary factors behind the recent surge in U.S. grocery bills: administration tariffs, the effects of climate change, and a shortage of agricultural labor. Food prices saw their fastest monthly increase since 2022, with significant hikes on imported goods like coffee, which is subject to high levies. Climate change is shifting growing regions for fruits and vegetables, while new immigration policies have contributed to a labor deficit in the agricultural sector. Consumers are responding by seeking deals, buying store brands, and reducing food waste to manage their expenses.</p>

The rise in long-term yields suggests that the market anticipates continued economic growth and potential inflation, despite the central bank's efforts to manage risks.

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Walmart's Lax Vetting Enabled Counterfeit and Fraudulent Sellers on its Marketplace</h2>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its online marketplace was fueled by lax seller vetting processes, leading to a surge in counterfeit products and fraudulent vendors. To compete with Amazon, Walmart reportedly streamlined its approval process, sometimes pressuring staff to approve sellers despite red flags. This resulted in shoppers receiving fake goods, and at least 43 instances where sellers used the stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create accounts. In response to the findings, Walmart has recently tightened its vetting requirements for sellers in the health and beauty categories.</p>

          <p>A political analysis article argues that the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, prompted by threats from the Federal Communications Commission, exemplifies a strategy that could erode American democracy. The author suggests this is part of a broader pattern of weaponizing executive powers to silence critics and reward allies, similar to authoritarian tactics seen in other countries. The article outlines a potential pathway to consolidating power by purging civil servants, targeting dissent, and pressuring corporations. It concludes by warning that these actions pose a real and growing risk to the fairness of future elections.</p>

The club, which serves as a unifying force for Russian-speaking immigrants from various post-Soviet nations, achieved promotion after just three seasons.

The new capital will likely be used to build out the significant computing infrastructure required for developing advanced AI models, including a large cluster of AI computers in Memphis, Tennessee.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to around 6.13%, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $750,000 mortgage, the new rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,560, which is over $450 less per month compared to the 7.04% rates seen at the start of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs enhances affordability for new buyers and presents a compelling refinancing opportunity for existing homeowners. Over the life of the loan, the savings could exceed $160,000. (not investment advice)</p>

Kashkari stated that he believes the inflationary impact of the administration's tariffs will be a temporary, "one-time effect," leaving room for further monetary easing. His more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite current inflation running above the Fed's 2% target. Kashkari, who does not have a vote on the policy-setting committee this year, emphasized that the central bank is not comfortable with 3% inflation.</p>
