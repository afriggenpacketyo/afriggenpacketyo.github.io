          <p>During a speech at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, President Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, signaling support for the Japanese company's $14 billion investment. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain controlled by the USA, a condition for his approval of the deal, and promised to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent. Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, a plan that faced scrutiny during the 2024 election due to concerns over national security. Trump highlighted the investment as the largest in Pennsylvania's history and assured that all U.S. Steel workers would keep their jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump terminated Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery, citing her as a "highly partisan person" and a supporter of DEI initiatives. Sajet, appointed by former President Obama in 2013, faced criticism from Trump, who has repeatedly accused the Smithsonian of being leftist and anti-American. In March, Trump signed an executive order targeting funding for programs at the Smithsonian that promote what he considers "divisive, race-centered ideology." This move follows Trump's earlier ousting of the leadership at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, also part of the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

The Independent focused on a UN report describing Israel's aid blockade as putting "100% of the population at risk of famine." The Daily Mail reported on pressure to sack the attorney general for comparing right-wing politicians to Nazis, while The Sun reported Taylor Swift bought back her life's work.

          <p>China is transforming its traditional mining industry by introducing driverless electric vehicles, exemplified by a fleet of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks at the Yimin open-pit coal mine in Inner Mongolia. This represents the world's largest deployment of autonomous electric mining trucks, addressing a shortage of drivers and improving safety. The move aligns with China's push to digitally transform its coal industry, making it more efficient and sustainable. The initiative stems from government guidance issued in 2020, which outlined the construction of intelligent mines and identified autonomous driving as a strategic goal.</p>

Ukraine had sent its proposals to Russia, reaffirming its "readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire." As the talks approached, both Russia and Ukraine reported explosions, raising concerns about the stability of the situation.</p>
