          <p>China has stated that there are no ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., dismissing claims of progress and calling for the complete removal of unilateral tariffs imposed by the U.S. The Ministry of Commerce emphasized that resolving the trade issue requires equal dialogue and treatment, echoing sentiments from the Foreign Ministry. Several Wall Street banks have recently lowered their China GDP forecasts due to escalating trade tensions and tariffs. China is focused on helping domestic companies sell goods meant for export within the Chinese market, while Southeast Asia has surpassed the EU as China's largest trading partner on a regional basis.</p>

          <p>Two U.S. Marines stationed in Okinawa are under investigation for separate alleged sexual assault incidents, prompting condemnation from local authorities and expressions of concern from the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. One marine is suspected of sexual assaulting a Japanese woman at a U.S. military base bathroom, while another is accused of a similar sexual assault at a base in January. The incidents have sparked anger among Okinawans, who host a significant portion of U.S. troops in Japan, and are likely to fuel anti-base sentiment, recalling past high-profile crimes involving U.S. service members.</p>

This indictment continues a trend in South Korea where former leaders often face criminal investigations after leaving office.

          <p>Japan will implement a revised road traffic law starting in April 2026, imposing fines for minor traffic violations by cyclists, such as using a mobile phone or ignoring traffic lights. Police will issue "blue tickets" to offenders aged 16 and older for over 100 violations, allowing them to avoid indictment by paying a fine. The move aims to crack down on rule-breaking cyclists and reduce accidents, following a rise in bicycle commuting during the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised law also mandates cyclists to keep to the left and vehicles to pass bicycles at a safe speed.</p>

          <p>China has updated its market access negative list, reducing the number of sectors that restrict or prohibit investment or operation by private firms. The latest list, released by the National Development and Reform Commission, features 106 restricted areas, down from 117 in the previous version. This move signals a further liberalization of the business environment for private enterprises, with a number of national-level restrictions eliminated and entry procedures streamlined in several sectors.

          <p>European officials are expressing optimism about reaching a trade deal with the U.S., but warn of significant economic harm to both Europe and the U.S. if an agreement is not reached and tariffs are implemented. The EU and U.S. are engaged in negotiations to avoid U.S. tariffs on EU goods and EU countermeasures. The IMF has warned that trade tariffs announced by President Donald Trump pose major headwinds for the U.S. and global economy in 2025. A failure to reach a deal could jeopardize billions of euros in daily trade between the two regions.</p>

          <p>A top Russian official, Sergei Shoigu, has stated that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons if faced with aggression from Western countries. This statement comes amid warnings from U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance that Washington could withdraw from peace negotiations in Ukraine. Shoigu cited amendments to Moscow's nuclear doctrine, which allow for a nuclear strike in response to a conventional attack that threatens Russia's sovereignty or territorial integrity. The statement underscores the heightened tensions and potential for escalation in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade war is severely impacting China's tilapia industry, particularly in the city of Maoming, a major production hub. Tariffs of 170% on Chinese tilapia exports to the U.S. have priced them out of their largest export market. Processing plants are operating at near standstill, and fish farmers are facing scarce orders and low prices. The local market cannot fully replace U.S. demand, leaving many in the industry contemplating whether to continue farming tilapia. The situation highlights the far-reaching consequences of trade disputes on specific industries and local economies.</p>
