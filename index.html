          <p>IBM has pledged to invest $150 billion in the United States over the next five years, with over $30 billion earmarked for advancing American manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers. CEO Arvind Krishna emphasized the company's long-standing commitment to American jobs and manufacturing, aiming to keep IBM at the forefront of advanced computing and AI. This announcement follows President Trump's "reciprocal" tariff policy designed to boost U.S. manufacturing, with chips and tech devices currently exempted from these tariffs. IBM's investment seeks to accelerate America's global leadership in computing and stimulate economic growth.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Investing Club is considering purchasing GE Vernova due to the increasing global demand for power, partly driven by artificial intelligence. The company manufactures wind and gas turbines and has a nuclear business, potentially benefiting from efforts to reduce trade deficits. Meanwhile, HSBC downgraded Eli Lilly, citing over-optimism in the stock and potential economic impacts on GLP-1 adoption, but Cramer noted positive trial data for Lilly's oral GLP-1.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's initial 100 days in office have seen the stock market's worst performance for a new presidency since the 1970s, with the S&P 500 dropping 7.9%. This contrasts sharply with the post-election rally fueled by hopes of tax cuts and deregulation. However, the market stumbled as Trump prioritized aggressive trade policies, causing investor concerns about inflation and a potential recession. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory after a "reciprocal" tariff announcement, though a subsequent pause soothed some worries, but uncertainty remains about the market's future stability.

          <p>Investors have continued to withdraw funds from ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) funds in early 2025, driven by an intensifying backlash linked to President Trump's "anti-climate agenda" and policies targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. ESG funds, which allow investors to align their investments with values like climate change or corporate diversity, experienced $6.1 billion in outflows during the first quarter of 2025. This marks the tenth consecutive quarter of outflows, indicating a sustained decline in investor appetite for sustainable funds amid the current political climate.</p>

Despite the hype, there's no guarantee Manning will declare for the draft after the 2025 season, as he could opt to play another year at Texas. He is expected to be the Longhorns' starting quarterback in the upcoming season, after limited playing time behind Quinn Ewers last year.
