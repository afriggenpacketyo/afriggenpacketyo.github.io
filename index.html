          <h2>Major UK Airports Increase Passenger Drop-Off Fees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 12:19:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research from the RAC reveals that over half of the UK's busiest airports have increased their "kiss-and-fly" fees for drivers dropping off passengers. Airports like Gatwick and Stansted now charge up to £7 for brief stops, a stark contrast to most major EU airports which offer free drop-offs. Airport authorities defend the fees as necessary for managing congestion and funding sustainable transport initiatives and airport improvements. Critics, however, argue that these rising costs are a source of frustration for drivers who are a captive audience, with London City being the only major UK airport listed that does not charge a fee.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 12:17:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the National Association of Home Builders, weakening buyer demand has prompted US homebuilders to cut prices at the highest rate since 2022. In July, 38% of builders reported reducing prices, with an average reduction of 5%, as builder confidence remains in negative territory for the 15th consecutive month. While a recent budget act provided some economic relief, elevated interest rates continue to challenge housing affordability. This trend of price cuts and mortgage rate buydowns is expected to negatively impact builders' profit margins as buyer traffic hits a two-year low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Puerto Rico's governor has signed a law prohibiting hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries for anyone under the age of 21, joining a wave of similar legislation in the U.S. The law imposes severe penalties, including 15 years in prison and a $50,000 fine for medical staff who violate the ban, and also prohibits the use of public funds for such procedures. Citing the state's duty to protect minors from what it terms irreversible decisions, the law has drawn sharp criticism from LGBTQ+ activists and professional associations, who have vowed to challenge its constitutionality in court.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, after internal Republican disagreements temporarily halted its progress. A faction of conservative members initially blocked the bill, demanding it be packaged with other measures, including a ban on a central bank digital currency. A compromise was eventually reached to advance the bill, which has already passed the Senate. Proponents argue that regulations for the digital asset market are long overdue, while critics express concerns about potential corruption and insufficient consumer protections.

          <p>The chair of the Los Angeles County Republican Party, Roxanne Hoge, has commented on the political effects of the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement actions in the city. Hoge suggested a "political irony" in that the federal crackdown could improve living conditions in Los Angeles, which she attributes to failures of Democratic leadership. She argued that the GOP's message should focus on public safety, an issue that she believes led to the ousting of the progressive District Attorney. Hoge noted that while the left often appeals to emotion, the tangible problems stemming from sanctuary city policies are becoming more apparent to voters.</p>

          <p>Charisma, a quality that makes individuals magnetic and influential, is often perceived as a divine gift but can be understood through science. Psychologists define it as a combination of influence (leadership ability) and affability (making others feel at ease). While charisma is linked to higher income and managerial success, its effectiveness appears to diminish at very high levels, possibly due to an association with narcissism or a focus on vision over execution. Although some aspects of charisma are innate, the article suggests it can be cultivated through practicing specific nonverbal communication techniques, such as studying the gestures of great orators.</p>

Trade data from 2024 shows the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of U.S. agricultural goods, purchasing a record $12.8 billion worth, including soybeans and nuts. Similarly, while the U.S. imports more European cars, the EU still bought approximately 165,000 American vehicles in 2024. The analysis highlights that while trade imbalances and differing tariff structures exist, the assertion that Europe sells to the U.S. while buying virtually nothing in return is inaccurate.

          <p>A recent uptick in inflation, with the Consumer Price Index climbing 2.7% annually in June, is likely to influence the Federal Reserve to maintain its current high interest rates. This cautious stance means homeowners with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) should not expect their rates to drop soon. Since HELOC rates are tied to the prime rate, which follows the Fed's lead, borrowing costs are expected to remain elevated.

          <p>Maine State Police have arrested a 17-year-old male in connection with the murder of Sunshine Stewart, a 48-year-old paddleboarder who was found dead earlier this month. Stewart's body was discovered at Crawford Pond in Union, near a campground where she was staying, and her death was ruled a homicide caused by strangulation and blunt force trauma. The suspect, who was vacationing in the area with his family, was arrested without incident and transported to a youth development center. The case had instilled fear in the small, tight-knit community.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for President Trump, to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The vote occurred amid chaotic scenes as Democratic members walked out in protest, accusing Republicans of rushing the nomination and refusing to hear testimony from a Justice Department whistleblower who has alleged unethical conduct by Bove. Despite staunch opposition and the controversy surrounding his record, Bove's nomination now moves to the full Senate, where his confirmation remains uncertain due to the narrow Republican majority.</p>

          <p>An official analysis of NHS England waiting lists has revealed significant inequalities, with working-age individuals, women, and those in the poorest communities disproportionately affected. The data shows that people aged 19 to 64 make up more than half of the list, with gynaecology having the largest backlog. Women constitute 57% of those waiting, and patients from deprived areas and Asian backgrounds are more likely to wait longer than 18 weeks for treatment. NHS England is urging hospitals to use this data to address these "unfair waits" and tackle the systemic health inequalities highlighted in the report.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a "major disaster" under the Stafford Act, which would allow federal FEMA funds to be directed to affected communities. The proposal comes after a June heat dome broke temperature records across the country but was not eligible for a disaster declaration. Proponents argue this change is necessary to provide funding for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. However, some, including a former FEMA administrator, argue that extreme heat is already eligible and that the focus should be on better utilizing existing hazard mitigation grants.</p>

The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reduce federal spending.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature reveals that migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than their native-born counterparts. The research indicates that this wage gap is not primarily due to unequal pay for the same job, but rather from structural barriers that shut foreign-born workers out of higher-paying industries and roles. The study also found that this disparity persists into the second generation, with a 7.7% wage gap, which is higher than the international average. The authors recommend improved language support and better recognition of foreign qualifications to address these structural barriers.</p>

Critics, including three former NRC chairs, argue that the administration is wrongly blaming the regulator for industry delays that are actually caused by high costs.

The dog, named Susan after Clapper's late wife, was trained to detect explosives. According to the report, CIA officials interpreted a presidential executive order stripping Clapper of his security clearance as a directive to also bar him from agency property, even for an unclassified event.
