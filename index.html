        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal, stating that only Congress has the authority to implement such broad levies. This decision has raised the prospect of the government needing to refund billions of dollars, creating fiscal uncertainty and causing a significant jump in U.S. Treasury yields. The market reaction saw the 10-year and 30-year bond yields climb to their highest levels in weeks, contributing to a downturn in the stock market as investors weigh the implications for the national deficit.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of federal troops for law enforcement operations in Los Angeles was unlawful. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer issued an order prohibiting the troops from engaging in activities such as crowd control, arrests, and security patrols. The judge determined that the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act and effectively created a "national police force." The order is delayed until September 12 to allow the administration time to appeal the decision.</p>

The MSP, who has since been suspended by the Labour Party, is also facing a separate allegation of hiding a camera in a parliament toilet. Girlguiding stated that its safeguarding policies were followed and no girls were affected during the visit. The revelations have caused shock and distress among Scottish political leaders and the public.</p>

          <p>Violent protests have spread across Indonesia, resulting in at least eight deaths and over a thousand arrests in the capital, Jakarta. The unrest was ignited by a viral video showing paramilitary police running over a 21-year-old delivery driver, which became a symbol of widespread public anger over economic inequality and an out-of-touch political elite. Demonstrators have issued a list of demands, including police reform and the cancellation of lavish allowances for lawmakers, while the government has responded by deploying the military to quell the demonstrations.</p>

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a historic law that restricts the use of the military for civilian policing. While the immediate impact is limited as most troops have since been demobilized, the ruling sets a significant precedent regarding presidential authority and is likely to be appealed by the administration.</p>

However, those with more flexibility or who are actively working to improve their credit score might benefit from waiting, as a potential Federal Reserve rate cut could lead to lower borrowing costs later in the year.

          <p>China is holding a massive military parade in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in attendance. The event showcases China's most advanced military hardware and serves as a powerful display of the deepening alliance between the three nations, which is widely seen as an anti-U.S. coalition. The joint appearance of the three leaders is highly symbolic, challenging the current U.S.-led global order and highlighting a growing geopolitical alignment.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical developers are increasingly using artificial intelligence to accelerate drug discovery and safety testing, a shift supported by the FDA's push to reduce reliance on animal models. Companies are employing AI to predict a drug's effects and potential toxicity, which experts estimate could cut development timelines and costs by at least half within five years. This transition towards computational models and human-cell-based systems, known as "new approach methodologies," promises to make the drug development process faster, cheaper, and more ethically sound.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has launched a campaign directly contacting tens of thousands of international students, warning them they face removal if they overstay their visas. This move responds to what the government calls an "alarming" increase in students who legally enter the country and then claim asylum once their visas expire. The messages explicitly state that meritless asylum claims will be swiftly refused and that individuals without a legal right to remain in the UK must leave, reflecting a tougher government stance on immigration enforcement.</p>

His victory signals a leftward shift for the party as it aims to attract voters feeling politically homeless and disillusioned with the current government and opposition.</p>
