          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and injuries to over 30 others. Firefighters arrived to a chaotic scene with heavy smoke and people trapped, requiring numerous ladder rescues. While the building had sprinklers, officials are investigating the cause of the fire and whether the alarm system was functional at the time. Authorities have called the event an "unfathomable tragedy" and are providing support for survivors and the families of the victims.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and over 70 other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire, fueled by strong winds, grew rapidly, leading to evacuations and significant property loss, including park facilities and a water treatment plant. Officials are facing questions over their initial "confine and contain" strategy as the blaze expanded. The loss of the iconic lodge, a central feature for visitors since the 1930s, has been described as a devastating blow to Arizona's state history.</p>

          <p>Rescue and recovery operations are ongoing in Kerr County, Texas, following catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe River that has left at least 106 people dead. The search for missing individuals has been hampered by persistent heavy rain, which forced operations to pause. Local officials are contending with the immense scale of the disaster, with one commissioner highlighting the need for improved infrastructure like sirens and diversion dams. A flood watch remains in effect for the Texas Hill Country, with more rainfall expected before drier conditions arrive later in the week.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired another 15 immigration judges, bringing the total to over 65 in the last six months as part of an effort to speed up deportations. The judges, who were at the end of their two-year probationary period, were terminated without cause via email. This move comes despite Congress allocating funds to hire more judges to address a backlog of nearly 4 million cases. Critics argue the firings are politically motivated and undermine the judicial process, potentially targeting judges not aligned with the administration's immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>As the new academic year approaches, students face the critical decision between federal and private student loans to cover college costs. Federal loans are generally recommended as the first option due to their fixed interest rates, borrower protections, and potential for forgiveness programs. However, their strict borrowing limits often create a funding gap. Private loans can cover the remaining costs and may offer lower rates for those with good credit, but they lack the flexibility and safety nets of federal options. This article advises students to exhaust grants and scholarships first before cautiously considering private loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Richmond Road Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, left two women dead and two other people wounded. The incident began when the suspect, Guy House, shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop before fleeing to the church. Family members stated House was looking for his ex-partner and, upon not finding her, opened fire, killing her mother, Beverly Gumm, and another woman, Christina Combs.

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has suspended his police minister, Senzo Mchunu, and announced an independent commission of inquiry to investigate explosive allegations of police links to organized crime. The move follows a senior police commissioner publicly accusing the minister of receiving payments from a corruption suspect and disbanding a task force investigating political killings. The allegations are a significant blow to Ramaphosa's government, which came to power promising to end endemic corruption. Critics, however, argue the president is again delaying decisive action by outsourcing the issue to a commission.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley has downgraded its rating for cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike from overweight to equal weight, suggesting it is "time to take a breather" after the stock's 50% rise since April. Analysts argue that the company's high valuation already reflects lofty expectations for its future performance, leaving little room for near-term growth. Despite the downgrade, CNBC's Jim Cramer disagreed, viewing the subsequent dip as a buying opportunity. The analysis comes as investors weigh the company's strong long-term potential against concerns about its premium stock price and federal cybersecurity budget cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) being in effect for 35 years, prospective parents with disabilities continue to face significant discrimination from adoption agencies. This article highlights the story of a couple with spina bifida who were initially rejected by an agency that explicitly refused to work with parents with their condition. They eventually adopted a girl who also has spina bifida, believing their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified to care for her. The story underscores how, in practice, equal access to services like adoption is not always guaranteed for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>An analysis from Deutsche Welle examines the potential effectiveness of President Trump's threat to impose secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian exports. While such sanctions could severely impact Russia's economy by targeting key trade partners like China and India, their success is not guaranteed. Russia has reportedly established alternative payment systems with China to reduce visibility to Western regulators and mitigate the risk of such penalties. The article notes that Russia's economy, while strained, has shown resilience, and it remains uncertain whether this new threat will be enough to force a peace deal.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has threatened to sue the North Carolina state board of elections over a new plan that could purge nearly 100,000 voters from the rolls. The Republican-led board voted to require voters to cast provisional ballots if they haven't provided specific identification numbers, a move Democrats argue is an unconstitutional attempt at voter suppression. The DNC contends the plan violates the National Voter Registration Act by effectively removing eligible voters without proper procedure. This legal battle unfolds in a key battleground state known for its extremely close election contests.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett suggested that President Trump's tariffs have not caused widespread price inflation because of a surge in "patriotism" among American consumers. He theorized that the president's leadership has convinced people to buy American products, reducing demand for imports so significantly that it has offset any price increases from the tariffs. This claim was met with skepticism from other economists, who point to factors like importers stockpiling goods and note that data shows prices on imported goods have, in fact, risen.

Commercial production of the new, more affordable battery cells is expected to begin by late 2027, potentially making EVs more accessible.</p>
