          <h2>Study Links Dog Owner's Work Stress to Anxiety in Their Pets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 22:10:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Scientific Reports reveals a correlation between dog owners who dwell on work stress and increased stress-related behaviors in their dogs. Researchers surveyed 85 working dog owners, measuring job stress and rumination, and found that dogs of more stressed owners exhibited more whining, pacing, and restlessness. The connection was attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one person to another, and emotional contagion, where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The article suggests that employed dog owners might benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect their pets' well-being.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have reportedly achieved a technological breakthrough in the development of electromagnetic coilguns, creating a weapon capable of firing 3,000 rounds per minute. This firing rate significantly surpasses that of traditional firearms and existing US commercial models. The key innovation, detailed in China’s Journal of Gun Launch & Control, involves eliminating capacitors, which have historically limited the firing rate of electromagnetic weapons due to recharging lag times. The article notes that recent footage shows the coilgun's ability to shatter car windows and demolish door panels rapidly.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto delivered a crucial two-run double in the fourth inning, leading the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. After Dodgers pitcher Tony Gonsolin struggled with command, issuing consecutive walks to load the bases, Soto capitalized with a decisive hit. Gonsolin's performance was critical for the Dodgers, whose bullpen was already strained after a lengthy extra-innings game the previous night. Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, allowing only two runs in 7 ⅔ innings, contributing to the team's win.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly's online post, calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire, resulted in a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred, igniting a debate about free speech. Connolly's appeal to reduce her sentence was rejected, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasizing the importance of free speech while condemning incitement to violence. Supporters argue the sentence is excessive, while critics maintain it's a necessary consequence for inciting hatred. The case has raised concerns about police overreach in monitoring online activity, with some fearing limitations on free expression.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if elected. This announcement comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces pressure from Labour MPs to address both policies. Reform UK plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net zero projects and eliminating hotel accommodations for asylum seekers. The move highlights growing policy divisions within the Labour party.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, with visitors expressing discomfort and concerns about potential health issues. The small flies have been found on walls and pillars of the Grand Ring, leading people to avoid swallowing them. While the midges don't bite, dead ones can cause asthma and allergic reactions if inhaled. The expo organizer is taking action, spraying insecticide, treating areas with a growth inhibitor, and installing insect repellent lights.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author, journalist, and activist, has died at the age of 90. Her influential book “Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual assault” reframed sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, significantly shaping modern views on the issue. The book, which provided a comprehensive history of sexual assault across centuries, contributed to legal reforms, including the abolishment of the “corroborating witness rule” and the passage of rape shield laws. Brownmiller's work also sparked controversy, particularly her assertion that sexual assault is a tool used by all men to keep all women in a state of fear.</p>
