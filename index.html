          <p>Greta Thunberg, once criticized on Chinese social media, is now receiving support in China, particularly after Israeli forces stopped her attempt to sail to Gaza. The activist, along with others, aimed to break Israel's siege of Gaza but was intercepted and deported. Chinese social media users have shifted their sentiment, praising Thunberg's consistent support for Palestine and opposition to Israel. Comments on Weibo, China's Twitter, express respect for her actions and acknowledge her commitment to her beliefs, even among those who previously dismissed her environmental activism. Thunberg's journey from departure to deportation was closely followed, marking a notable change in public opinion towards her in China. </p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has defended President Trump's Iran policy on social media after criticism from figures like Tucker Carlson and some MAGA supporters, who opposed U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. Vance emphasized Trump's consistent stance against Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and his efforts to negotiate a deal to prevent uranium enrichment, and he assured followers that Trump prioritizes American interests in foreign policy decisions. This defense comes amid a growing divide among Trump's supporters, with some warning against entanglement in the conflict, while Trump dismissed Carlson's concerns. Greene also voiced her support for Carlson's stance, reflecting a split within the MAGA movement regarding foreign policy. Optimism remains uncertain given the divided opinions and potential for escalating conflict. The current political climate could influence future foreign policy decisions. </p>

Roberts, Kavanaugh, Barrett, and Gorsuch disclosed teaching positions at various law schools, earning additional income. These disclosures have received increased scrutiny following reports of undisclosed travel and gifts received by Justice Thomas, prompting calls for a code of conduct for the Supreme Court, though enforcement mechanisms remain a point of contention. </p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making it unlikely the company will break even this year. CEO Joanna Geraghty informed staff that the airline will cut off-peak flights, trim unprofitable routes, and pause plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets. The company is also evaluating hiring plans and potentially combining leadership roles to reduce expenses. These measures come as JetBlue relies on borrowed cash to maintain operations, signaling financial challenges in the current travel market. The airline hopes demand will rebound, but acknowledges the path to profitability will take longer than anticipated. </p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a threatening message to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warning that the U.S. knows his location but will not target him "at least not for now". Trump demanded Iran's "unconditional surrender," citing concerns about missiles being fired at civilians and American soldiers. The president claimed the U.S. now has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran." These statements follow reports that Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei, indicating a potential shift in U.S. strategy toward direct military intervention. The escalating rhetoric and military actions suggest a volatile situation with uncertain consequences. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are concerned about Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site, buried deep within a mountain, as a potential location for clandestine nuclear weapons development. Despite U.S. intelligence assessments stating Iran isn't currently building a nuclear weapon, Israel claims to have evidence of a secret program focused on weaponization. Fordo's fortified location and advanced centrifuges raise concerns about Iran's ability to enrich uranium to near-weapons-grade purity. The IAEA has declared Iran non-compliant with monitoring efforts, heightening fears about the lack of transparency at Fordo. The facility's underground structure and the presence of advanced machinery suggest it may be intended for military purposes, further escalating international tensions. </p>

          <p>Republicans are proposing to eliminate economic hardship and unemployment deferments for student loan borrowers as part of their "big beautiful" bill. These deferments currently allow borrowers to pause payments during periods of joblessness or financial setbacks, often without accruing interest. Experts warn that eliminating these options could lead to more defaults on student loans, especially during economic hardship. The House has already advanced its version of the bill, and the Senate is preparing to debate the tax and spending package. The Trump administration has projected a significant increase in student loan defaults in the coming months, underscoring the potential impact of these changes. </p>

          <p>After decades of research, the Australian National Maritime Museum has confirmed that Captain Cook's HMS Endeavour rests in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island. Historians originally pinpointed the location in 1998, and subsequent research verified that the wreck is indeed the Endeavour. The ship, famous for Cook's voyages across the Pacific, was later used to transport British troops during the American Revolutionary War and deliberately sunk in 1778. The identification of the wreck is significant for Australia, New Zealand, England, the United States, and First Nations peoples throughout the Pacific Ocean, and efforts are underway to protect the site. The confirmation resolves a long-standing mystery surrounding the final resting place of the historic vessel. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Netanyahu has not ruled out assassinating Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, viewing him as a threat to Israel, and has called for a change of regime in Iran. Israel's strikes have killed several top Iranian generals and security advisors, impacting Khamenei's inner circle. Despite this, experts note that Iran's clerical regime has a process to maintain stability even if the Supreme Leader is killed. However, internal tensions within Iran could also threaten the regime, as highlighted by the 2022 "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement. While Israel's actions may not immediately topple the government, they could fuel Iranians' determination to stand up to their leaders. </p>

          <p>A witness's observation of a person in a field in Green Isle, Minnesota, led to the arrest of Vance Boelter, the suspect in the fatal shooting of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. Boelter is accused of impersonating a police officer to attack the victims in their homes. Authorities found a list of public officials with detailed notes on Hortman in Boelter's possession, indicating premeditation. The motive remains under investigation, but concerns have been raised about the nature of political rhetoric and extremism.

Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have agreed to work closely to tackle the crossings, with migration being a key focus of Macron's upcoming state visit.

This decision comes just days after the administration initially suspended the operations due to concerns about labor shortages in these industries.

The administration maintains that worksite enforcement is crucial for safeguarding public safety, national security, and economic stability.

          <p>The Spanish government has attributed a widespread energy blackout to miscalculations by the national grid operator, Red ElÃ©ctrica, and failures by private power generation companies. The government said Red ElÃ©ctrica miscalculated power capacity needs and should have switched on another thermal plant, while private generators failed to regulate the grid's voltage. Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez had previously suggested private electricity companies might have played a role. The government's report also raises questions about the role of the president of Red ElÃ©ctrica. The blackout led to criticism of the country's energy model, but the government insists renewable energy output was not the cause. </p>

          <p>Credit card debt has been increasing, driven by high interest rates and inflation, leading to more delinquent payments. Missing payments can trigger late fees and a rising balance, damaging credit scores and potentially leading to legal action. Acting early is crucial to mitigate the damage, with different strategies recommended at 30, 60, and 90 days past due. At 30 days, making the minimum payment and calling the credit card company to request a waiver of fees can help. At 60 days, consider hardship programs or consolidating debt. At 90 days, work with a debt counselor and prepare for potential collections. (not investment advice)</p>
