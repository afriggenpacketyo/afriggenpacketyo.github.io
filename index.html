          <p>Russia's foreign minister has warned the United States, South Korea, and Japan against forming a security partnership aimed at North Korea, emphasizing the growing military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. This statement was made during a visit to North Korea, where discussions focused on solidifying their booming alliance. The partnership has raised concerns among Western allies about potential Russian technology transfers that could advance North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, though Russia stated it respects Pyongyang's aspirations.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to launch its Tianzhou-9 cargo spacecraft on a resupply mission to the Tiangong space station from the Wenchang launch site. The mission will deliver essential supplies to the astronauts currently in orbit. Notably, the cargo includes two sets of advanced, domestically developed spacesuits with an extended lifespan for more spacewalks. Additionally, the delivery will feature specialized core muscle training equipment designed to help astronauts counteract the effects of muscle atrophy in microgravity.</p>

          <p>Relatives of those killed in the recent Air India crash are seeking more definitive answers after the release of a preliminary investigative report, which they described as disappointing and lacking clarity. The report indicated that fuel to the engines was cut off moments after takeoff, but the circumstances of how or why this occurred remain unclear. This lack of a conclusive explanation has left the grieving families with more questions than answers as they continue to mourn their profound loss.</p>

          <p>The leader of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, has accused the Labour Party of failing to defend working people, stating that members are turning away from the party "in droves." Following a dispute over Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's handling of bin strikes in Birmingham, the union voted to potentially rethink its relationship with Labour. This could result in the suspension of its significant annual funding, signaling a major rift between the party and its largest union backer.</p>

          <p>An initial report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) provides a comprehensive overview of the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad. The key finding is that fuel flow to both engines was cut off seconds after takeoff, leading to a total loss of power. Cockpit recordings captured confusion between the pilots regarding the fuel switches, but the reason for the malfunction remains under investigation. The crash, which killed 260 people, is a major setback for the recently privatized airline.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the delicate balancing act France's far-right National Rally party is performing in its relationship with the Trump administration. While ideologically aligned on many key issues, the party remains wary of a close public association with President Trump due to his general unpopularity with many French voters and the potential negative impact of U.S. tariffs. The party is carefully managing its ties to Washington as it seeks to normalize its image and broaden its appeal ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>A German education minister from the center-right CDU party has ignited a national debate by suggesting that a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools could be a "conceivable model." The controversial proposal, aimed at improving integration and language acquisition, has drawn sharp criticism from educators and student organizations who argue it would be discriminatory and stigmatizing. Proponents, however, believe it could help address educational disparities in schools with very high proportions of non-German-speaking children.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered an eight-year legal dispute between the owner of a luxury Park Lane penthouse and companies linked to the estate of the late Mohamed Al Fayed.
