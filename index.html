          <p>Andy Byron, the CEO of data technology company Astronomer, has resigned following a viral controversy that began at a Coldplay concert. Byron was filmed on the venue's "kiss-cam" with the company's chief people officer, and his attempt to hide from the camera led to widespread speculation of an affair. After a video of the moment went viral, the company launched a formal investigation and placed Byron on leave. In accepting his resignation, the company stated that its leaders are expected to meet a standard of conduct that was not met.</p>

          <p>During the third round of The Open, golfer Rory McIlroy experienced a bizarre moment when his swing on the 11th hole unearthed a second, hidden golf ball. After hitting his own ball from the rough, another ball, which had been buried unseen beneath his, popped into the air and landed near his feet. McIlroy, visibly surprised, picked up the unexpected ball and later described the incident as "the most weird, ridiculous thing" he had ever seen on the course. Despite the strange occurrence and a bogey on that hole, he finished the round strong.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that Ukraine's military is drafting individuals with documented, severe mental health conditions, creating risks for both the soldiers and their units. The article details the case of a man with a personality disorder found fit for service, highlighting gaps in the medical data system that allow such oversights. Human rights officials report thousands of complaints regarding mobilization violations, with some commanders receiving recruits unfit for duty, including those with serious physical ailments. This systemic issue raises concerns about the well-being of soldiers and the operational effectiveness of units on the front lines.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler established a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final round of The Open at Royal Portrush. Scheffler played a solid, bogey-free third round of 67, highlighted by an eagle, putting him in a strong position to claim his first Open Championship title. While other contenders like Rory McIlroy showed early flashes of brilliance, none could consistently keep pace with Scheffler's steady performance. A victory would mark the third leg of the career Grand Slam for the dominant American golfer.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a move to Barcelona, a transfer that raises questions given his recent struggles at his home club. After falling out of favor with manager Ruben Amorim and spending time on loan at Aston Villa, Rashford's departure from Old Trafford seems imminent. For Barcelona, the move is seen as a way to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets, with the initial deal likely being a loan with an option to buy. The Spanish club is betting that a change of scenery could help the 27-year-old English international rediscover his top form.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a 27-19 victory over Australia in their series opener, but the performance left much to be desired. After a dominant first 50 minutes where they built a commanding 24-5 lead, the Lions' intensity dropped off significantly as they brought on replacements. This allowed a lackluster Australian side to score late tries, making the final score look more competitive than the match truly was. Analysts noted that while a win is a win, the flat finish and lack of atmosphere in the second half were disappointing for a much-anticipated Lions Test match.</p>

          <p>This article marks the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, led by German army officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The "Operation Valkyrie" coup attempt ultimately failed when the bomb only minorly injured Hitler, leading to the swift execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. The piece reflects on the plot's legacy, noting that while the conspirators are now viewed as heroes in Germany, their motives were complex and aimed at saving Germany from total defeat rather than establishing a modern democracy. The event remains a powerful symbol of German resistance against the Nazi regime.</p>

          <p>A pregnant, stay-at-home mother called into "The Ramsey Show" for budgeting advice, revealing that despite her husband's $156,000 salary, they struggle to afford groceries. The core issue emerged as the husband's spending of up to $700 a month on tobacco and marijuana, which she described as an addiction. Host Dave Ramsey challenged the caller's framing, pointing out the contradiction between calling him an addict while allowing him full control of their finances. The conversation shifted from a simple budget question to a stark discussion about addiction, financial control, and the need for a more serious intervention.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a knee injury much faster than initially anticipated. Muncy, who suffered a bone bruise after a collision at third base on July 2, has already resumed running, throwing, and swinging a bat. Doctors told him he was incredibly lucky to have avoided a more severe, season-ending injury, as the timing of the impact was a millisecond away from causing major ligament damage. His quicker-than-expected return is welcome news for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly in his absence.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Great Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m world championship relay team has finally received their gold medals. The ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, where the athletes were celebrated by a large home crowd. The British team was upgraded from silver after the winning US team was disqualified due to a doping admission from team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The presentation marked the end of a long, laborious process to reallocate the medals and recognize the British athletes' rightful victory.</p>

          <p>Russia launched another widespread aerial assault across Ukraine, killing at least three people and striking targets in ten different regions. The attack utilized over 340 drones and 35 missiles, and while Ukraine's military reported intercepting most of them, more than 30 projectiles hit their targets. A residential building in Odesa caught fire, and cities like Pavlohrad and Sumy experienced significant damage to industrial and critical infrastructure, leading to power outages. President Zelenskyy reiterated the urgent need for enhanced air defense systems to protect Ukrainian cities from these escalating bombardments.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly revoked the visas of eight Brazilian Supreme Court judges, escalating a campaign in support of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who faces charges over an alleged coup attempt. The move, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, targets the judge leading the investigation and his allies on the court. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the action as "unacceptable interference" and an "affront to national sovereignty." The decision follows other pressure tactics, including threatened tariffs, which have sparked a nationalist backlash in Brazil.</p>

          <p>A combination of strong corporate earnings and moderating inflation data helped the S&P 500 achieve a positive week, despite some market jitters over potential new tariffs. Key economic reports, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), showed inflation trending in the right direction, reinforcing the market's belief that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates later this year. Early earnings reports from major companies like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, while initially met with mixed reactions, ultimately demonstrated corporate resilience, suggesting investors should not judge a quarter's performance too quickly.

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" in a federal filing with the Small Business Administration. This designation is typically for firms majority-owned by individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged, which can grant preferential access to federal contracts. The filing was made shortly before a funding round valued Neuralink at $9 billion and at a time when Musk, the world's wealthiest person, was leading a government efficiency initiative.
