          <p>Stocks experienced a significant rally on Tuesday after President Trump announced a delay in implementing steep tariffs on the European Union until July 9, providing more time for trade negotiations. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all saw substantial gains, reflecting investor relief. The administration is actively working to strike deals before the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs concludes, having recently announced trade agreements with the United Kingdom and China. Maros Sefcovic, the EU's chief trade negotiator, expressed the bloc's commitment to reaching an agreement with the U.S. by the deadline, further boosting market confidence.</p>

          <p>Witnesses in Liverpool recounted the chaotic moments when a car drove through crowds celebrating Liverpool FC's Premier League trophy win, resulting in numerous injuries. According to accounts, the driver appeared "emotional and agitated" as he navigated the dense crowds on Water Street, which was supposed to be closed for the parade. Some individuals attempted to stop the car, leading to confrontations before the vehicle accelerated into the crowd, causing widespread panic and injuries. Police have arrested a 53-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving, and driving while unfit through drugs, as the investigation continues to determine the driver's motives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to cancel federal contracts with Harvard University, citing concerns over alleged race discrimination, potential discriminatory hiring practices, and a lack of concern for the safety and well-being of Jewish students. The White House General Services Administration is expected to send a letter to federal agencies, instructing them to identify and potentially terminate contracts with Harvard. This move follows President Trump's consideration of redirecting $3 billion away from Harvard to other trade schools, escalating his ongoing battle with the Ivy League institution.

          <p>The UK government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that the policy has pushed people into poverty but warned that removing it would "cost a lot of money". The government is expected to announce its decision on the cap in the autumn when it publishes its child poverty strategy. Phillipson emphasized that a Labour government would never have introduced the cap and that the "cost of inaction" is also incredibly high because this scars the life chances of children in this country.</p>

          <p>Higher beef and fresh produce prices have pushed UK food inflation to an annual high, with food prices rising 2.8% in the year to May, according to the British Retail Consortium. The boss of a steakhouse chain reported a 20% increase in beef costs, attributing it to high demand and low supply caused by lack of government support. Farming industry experts echoed these concerns, noting that beef prices have been rising due to high demand and limited government assistance. Tomas Maunier, co-founder of Fazenda, said his firm had passed on about 2% of increased running costs to customers.</p>

          <p>Consumer confidence experienced a greater-than-expected improvement in May, ending a five-month period of decline, following President Trump's easing of tariffs. The rebound in consumer sentiment was observed across all age and income demographics, according to the Conference Board. A trade agreement between the U.S. and China earlier in the month reduced tit-for-tat tariffs, leading to a surge in the stock market and subsequent revisions of recession forecasts by Wall Street firms. Despite these positive developments, consumers still face the highest overall average effective tariff rate since 1934, and major retailers have warned of potential price increases.</p>

          <p>Consumer optimism received a significant boost in May due to hopes for improved trade relations between the U.S. and China, according to a recent survey. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index jumped to 98.0, a 12.3-point increase from April, exceeding expectations. This positive sentiment was largely attributed to developments in the U.S.-China trade situation, particularly President Trump's decision to halt the most severe tariffs on May 12. The rebound followed five consecutive months of decline, with sentiment improving across age, income, and political affiliation.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Congress are seeking to revive the U.S. shipbuilding industry to compete with China, but face significant obstacles, including high costs and limited capacity. American-built ships cost nearly five times as much as Asian ones, and domestic shipyards are largely occupied with Navy orders. A South Korean company, Hanwha, acquired a shipyard in Philadelphia and aims to increase production, but requires government subsidies and penalties on foreign vessels. Critics argue that previous government efforts to encourage domestic shipbuilding have largely failed, and a better approach would be to partner with proven shipbuilders in allied countries.</p>

          <p>A small Vermont business, Bivo, which sells water bottles for cyclists, is facing challenges due to President Trump's tariffs on imports from China, even after a temporary reduction. The company, which was nearing profitability, now estimates sales to be 30% lower than expected due to the tariffs and retailers buying less outdoor gear. Despite the Trump administration's claim that foreign businesses pay the tariffs, importers like Bivo are responsible for paying the duties to U.S. customs.
