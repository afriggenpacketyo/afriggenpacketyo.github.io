            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has urged the U.S. to completely abolish its "reciprocal tariffs," calling them a "small step" after the U.S. exempted some tech products from duties. The ministry emphasized the need for equal dialogue based on mutual respect to resolve differences.  U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated there are no immediate plans for talks between Presidents Trump and Xi. Chinese media portrayed the exemptions as a retreat by the U.S., highlighting the difficulty in replacing Chinese supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Clinical psychologist Diana Hill and movement specialist Katy Bowman recommend strategies to retrain the brain to crave movement rather than mindless phone scrolling. Techniques include "urge surfing" to manage cravings, engaging in simple movement challenges, savoring enjoyable activities, and adding novelty to familiar routines.  Transforming worry into compassionate action and combining movement with nature are also suggested.  The goal is to build psychological flexibility and prioritize movement for stress relief and mood enhancement.</p>

While experts agree that renewable energy is essential, solar, wind, and hydrogen companies are working to adapt their business models. The Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and elimination of subsidies are creating challenges. However, some believe clean energy companies can manage either a subsidy decrease or a rise in tariffs, but not both simultaneously.</p>
