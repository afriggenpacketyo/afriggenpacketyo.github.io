        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided against dissolving the House of Representatives, preventing concurrent elections for both parliamentary chambers in July. This decision comes as opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda refrained from submitting a no-confidence motion, citing concerns about stalling progress on crucial political matters. The ruling bloc, led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party, lacks a lower house majority, meaning a successful no-confidence motion could trigger either the chamber's dissolution or the Cabinet's resignation. Seiji Maehara, an opposition leader, noted Noda's desire to avoid a political vacuum amidst U.S. tariff worries and escalating Middle East tensions.</p>

          <p>Director Danny Boyle and actress Jodie Comer discussed the making of '28 Years Later' and its connection to real-world events such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Boyle noted that the pandemic has heightened the sense of terror in audiences, as the line between movies and reality has blurred. The film explores themes of survival, adaptation, and the truths adults choose to tell children in times of crisis. Comer portrays a mother grappling with illness and the challenges of post-apocalyptic life, while Boyle sees the film as the start of a trilogy examining societal issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The possibility of the U.S. striking Iran's nuclear facilities, particularly the Fordo plant, is fraught with difficulties. The Fordo plant's construction deep within a mountain necessitates the use of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a weapon exclusive to the U.S. Military experts suggest that even with such a strike, complete destruction isn't guaranteed, potentially requiring ground personnel. A U.S. strike could provoke Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region, escalating the conflict and drawing the U.S. further into a regional war.</p>

This action follows a request from the Foreign Minister, though the government emphasizes it's in the preparatory phase. Simultaneously, Japan has initiated the evacuation of nationals and their families from Tehran and Tel Aviv via land routes to neighboring Azerbaijan and Jordan, respectively, due to airport closures.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has eliminated the VA Servicing Purchase program (VASP), which provided low-interest mortgages to veterans struggling to pay their home loans, sparking concerns from both Democrats and Republicans.

Without VASP, veterans face higher monthly payments through loan modifications or potential foreclosure, putting them in a worse position than other homeowners with government-backed mortgages.

There's even a small chance that Mars could be lost and Earth could collide with another planet or be ejected from the solar system. While the likelihood of these events is low, the study highlights the vulnerability of our planetary system to external gravitational forces.</p>
