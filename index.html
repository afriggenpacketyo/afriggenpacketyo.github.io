        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts due to strong shipments to non-U.S. markets and a temporary tariff reprieve with the United States. While exports to the U.S. declined, the rate of decrease slowed, and shipments to Southeast Asia and the European Union saw significant increases. Imports also saw their first growth of the year, rising 1.1%, though economists remain cautious about the second half of 2025, citing uncertainty over U.S. tariff policies and the potential for fading export momentum.

          <p>China's leadership is signaling a new policy direction by addressing "neijuan," a term for excessive internal competition that leads to diminishing returns. In a recent meeting, President Xi Jinping called for regulating disorderly, low-price competition and promoting the exit of outdated production capacity. Analysts note this new push differs from the 2015 supply-side reforms, as the current economic landscape involves more private firms, weaker growth, and limited government fiscal space, making the challenge more complex.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged past the $120,000 mark, setting a new record high driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally is supported by increasing institutional buying and anticipation of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for the digital asset industry, with Congress set to deliberate on several crypto-related bills. Analysts suggest that institutional confidence and long-term holders are key drivers, projecting further appreciation despite potential risks from macroeconomic factors like trade disputes and Federal Reserve policies.

          <p>London is facing questions about its global appeal following an exodus of an estimated 10,000 millionaires in 2024, driven by a new tax regime and high living costs pushing workers away. Some analysts believe the city's business "buzz" has faded due to over-regulation and political instability, with homegrown firms increasingly looking to list abroad. However, others argue that London's fundamental strengths, such as the rule of law, culture, and a strong services export sector, remain intact, suggesting the city is adapting rather than declining.</p>

          <p>Violent clashes between Bedouin Sunni tribes and fighters from the Druze religious minority in the southern Syrian city of Sweida have left at least 30 people dead and scores injured. The violence highlights the fragile security situation in Syria following the collapse of the Assad regime in December. The new Islamic-led government is struggling to establish control, and fighting between different minority groups has escalated, with authorities now sending forces to intervene and de-escalate the conflict in Sweida.</p>

Pelicot's insistence on a public trial shocked the nation, sparked a national debate on sexual violence, and was instrumental in advancing reforms to France's legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

Republican senators from rural states, such as Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, have expressed opposition, warning that eliminating this support could cause many small, vital stations to shut down.</p>
