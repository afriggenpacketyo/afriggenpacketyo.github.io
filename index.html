          <p>Target's shares dropped by 9% following the announcement that Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke will succeed Brian Cornell as CEO in February. Although the retailer surpassed Wall Street's earnings and sales forecasts for the second quarter, it continued to experience declines in both sales and customer traffic. Fiddelke plans to revitalize the company by focusing on unique merchandise, improving the customer experience, and leveraging technology more effectively. The company maintained its full-year outlook despite these challenges and the recent termination of its partnership with Ulta Beauty.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart surged by over 12% after the company announced a nearly 400% increase in net profit for the first half of 2025. The impressive growth was largely driven by the global popularity of its Labubu dolls, which have gained a celebrity following. The company's revenue more than tripled, with significant sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas. Despite the strong performance, some analysts express caution about the long-term sustainability of the brand's popularity and potential regulatory scrutiny over its "blind box" sales model.

The move has drawn widespread international condemnation, with critics like the UN and Germany warning that it violates international law and undermines the viability of a future contiguous Palestinian state. The development would expand the Maale Adumim settlement, effectively dividing the West Bank. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich celebrated the approval as a definitive action against the establishment of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>An unknown flying object crashed and exploded in a cornfield near the village of Osiny in eastern Poland early Wednesday morning, breaking windows in nearby houses but causing no injuries. Poland's Armed Forces stated that no violations of airspace from neighboring Ukraine or Belarus were detected. The Defense Minister later indicated the object was most likely a drone, though its origin and purpose, whether military or for smuggling, remain under investigation. Civilian and military investigators are currently examining the debris at the crash site to determine the object's identity.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) present a secure way to combat inflation, with many accounts offering returns that exceed the current inflation rate. While national average CD yields are relatively low, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some 1-year CDs offering yields around 4.30% APY. Currently, due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs often provide better rates than long-term ones. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs—investing in multiple CDs with varying terms—to take advantage of high short-term rates while also planning for long-term savings goals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the national average interest rate for savings accounts remains low at 0.38%, high-yield savings accounts offer a much more effective way to grow emergency funds. Top high-yield accounts, primarily offered by online banks, feature rates between 4.11% and 4.30%, allowing savings to grow significantly faster through compounding interest. Online banks can offer these superior rates due to lower overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. Financial planners emphasize the importance of having an accessible emergency fund and recommend comparing different high-yield options to maximize returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new tax law signed by President Donald Trump has broadened the scope of qualifying expenses for 529 college savings plans, yet a recent survey shows few parents are utilizing them. The law now permits 529 funds to be used for vocational programs, professional licensing, continuing education, and expanded K-12 costs like tutoring and test prep. Despite the tax-free growth and withdrawal benefits, only 10% of parents use these plans, with most opting for traditional low-yield savings accounts.

The offensive, expected to last four to six months, aims to target areas where Israel believes Hamas militants are still active and regrouping. This escalation comes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis and growing international condemnation, as well as domestic opposition from hostage families and former security chiefs who question the attainability of completely destroying Hamas.

          <p>President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency" in Washington, D.C., and subsequent federalization of the city's police and National Guard have sparked legal challenges and questions about the limits of presidential power. While the Home Rule Act allows the president to command the D.C. National Guard indefinitely, his control over the Metropolitan Police is limited to 30 days without congressional approval. A federal judge has already partially halted the plan, and legal experts suggest the broad, politically-motivated nature of the takeover could face further court intervention.
