        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia launched a significant drone and missile attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, resulting in casualties and injuries, including children. Mayor Ihor Terekhov described the assault as "open terror," reporting that residential buildings and civilian infrastructure were struck. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha urged allies to increase pressure on Moscow and strengthen Ukraine's defenses. Conflicting accounts emerged regarding a prisoner swap agreement, with Russia accusing Ukraine of postponing the exchange and Ukraine countering that Russia was not adhering to agreed-upon parameters. The barrages followed Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian air bases. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing conflict and accusations between both sides.</p>

          <p>Six Palestinians were killed and several wounded by Israeli gunfire near a Gaza aid distribution center, according to Hamas officials. Eyewitness reports suggest Israeli forces opened fire as people approached the site to collect food supplies. The Israeli military stated warning shots were fired at individuals acting in a threatening manner. The incident has led the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to pause operations to improve safety, though people continue to gather daily seeking aid. Separately, Israeli air strikes on a Gaza City residential home reportedly killed at least 15 people, with the IDF stating the strikes targeted the head of a Palestinian militant group. The situation remains tense, and international criticism of the aid distribution model is expected to intensify.</p>

          <p>A death row inmate, Julian Mendez, was killed at Kern Valley State Prison in California after being attacked by fellow inmates. The incident began when another inmate, Mario Renteria, allegedly started beating Mendez, prompting intervention from prison staff. When more than 30 additional inmates joined the assault, officers used blast grenades to quell the violence. An improvised weapon was found at the scene, and officials have limited population movement to facilitate an investigation. Renteria remains in restricted housing pending the investigation.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt secured a clean sweep over the West Indies in their first series as head coach and captain, respectively. While the victory provides a positive start, it comes with caution, as England has historically dominated home series but struggled in major tournaments. World Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley notes that England is in a "good place" due to their dominant wins, but questions whether this series indicates a change in their ability to perform under pressure. Tougher tests await, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup.</p>
