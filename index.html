          <p>Authorities in Honolulu, Hawaii, are searching for a suspect who allegedly threw sulfuric acid on a 30-year-old pedestrian, leaving the victim in critical condition. The attack, which occurred in the Chinatown area, appears to have been random, as police state the victim and suspect did not know each other. Investigators are currently canvassing the area for surveillance footage and witnesses to determine a motive for the first-degree assault. The suspect is described as a 6-foot man carrying a red bottle and wearing a camera around his neck.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a significant boom following the 2008 recession, is now facing a sharp slowdown due to a combination of economic pressures. Factors contributing to the decline include shifting consumer habits among younger generations, post-pandemic inflation, and the impact of global trade tariffs. This downturn has led to slowing sales for major brands and has caused smaller distilleries to face bankruptcy, signaling a potential end to the recent bourbon bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable patents derived from federally funded research. In a letter from the Commerce Department, the administration accused Harvard of breaching its legal obligations and initiated a "march-in" process that could allow the government to seize the patents. This action follows previous moves to freeze federal funding over the university's handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests, which critics argue is a pretext to undermine academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The market for "functional beverages" promising benefits like calm and relaxation is rapidly growing, but experts are skeptical about their effectiveness. These drinks often contain trendy supplements like Lion's Mane mushroom and L-theanine, but dietitians question whether the small quantities included can produce the advertised effects, citing a lack of robust scientific evidence. While some consumers find them a useful alternative to alcohol for unwinding, psychologists suggest the calming effect may be more psychological, stemming from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>In the Moquegua region of Peru, the village of Pampa Clemesí exists without electricity despite being located next to the country's largest solar power complex. Residents can see the glowing solar plants but lack connection to the national grid, relying on candles or small, inadequate personal solar panels. This paradox highlights a systemic issue where large-scale renewable energy projects prioritize profitability over serving local, sparsely populated communities. While the energy company and government have plans for electrification, the village remains in the dark, struggling with basic needs like refrigeration and lighting.</p>

          <p>Four months after billionaire Mark Cuban predicted that companies would increase prices and blame tariffs, his forecast appears to be materializing. Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble announced price hikes on about a quarter of its products, citing a billion-dollar annual impact from tariffs. Other major retailers like Walmart have also raised prices on goods predominantly made in China. This trend suggests consumers will face higher costs on everyday items, from household supplies to food and beverages, as companies pass on the financial pressures from trade policies.

Surveillance footage captured the suspects, wearing hoodies and face coverings, ransacking the establishment and making off with the entire inventory. The dolls, created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, have become a sought-after item among collectors over the past decade.

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are intensifying their attacks on the Republican-backed tax bill, framing it as a key issue for the upcoming midterm elections. At a town hall in Iowa, Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego criticized the legislation, claiming it would make America "poorer and sicker," to an enthusiastic crowd. This offensive marks a strategic shift for Democrats, who are now using the bill's cuts to programs like Medicaid to energize their base. The events contrast sharply with some Republican town halls where lawmakers have faced jeers for supporting the measure.</p>

          <p>The chief financial officer for Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after town officials discovered she was also employed as the full-time town administrator for Greybull, Wyoming, a town 2,000 miles away. Wilton officials claim they were unaware of the dual employment, which would have violated town policy for a full-time public office. However, the former CFO, Dawn Norton, insists she had been transparent about her remote work situation and her search for other employment. The controversy emerged amid a review of Wilton's finance department, which was already facing scrutiny over staffing and auditing issues.</p>

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals after they receive a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences would be deported right away and barred from re-entering the UK, with their home countries deciding if they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues this would save taxpayers money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Critics have raised concerns that some countries may refuse to accept the deported criminals.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under UK terrorism laws. Protesters intentionally flouted the ban by displaying signs with the message, "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," as part of an organized effort to challenge the law. The government defended the ban based on security advice, while human rights groups like Amnesty International called the mass arrests disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression.

          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly due to a clash with the White House over a request for confidential taxpayer data to locate undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security had asked the IRS to cross-reference a list of names to help with immigration enforcement, but the agency declined to provide most of the information, citing taxpayer privacy rights. This resistance appears to have led to Long's removal after just two months, highlighting ongoing pressure on federal agencies to align with the administration's policy priorities, even when it conflicts with statutory obligations.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, Jonny Bairstow played an incredible unbeaten innings of 86 runs from just 50 balls, but his efforts were not enough to secure a victory for Welsh Fire against London Spirit. Despite Bairstow's explosive hitting, which included back-to-back sixes in the final sets, Welsh Fire fell short by eight runs in their pursuit of 164. The team's top-order collapse left Bairstow with too much to do, though his stunning partnership with Chris Green brought them close. The loss leaves both the men's and women's Welsh Fire teams winless in the tournament.</p>
