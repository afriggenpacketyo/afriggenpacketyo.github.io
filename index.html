        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng experienced a significant surge in Hong Kong, driven by positive earnings reports and promising revenue forecasts for the second quarter. Analysts predict Xpeng will achieve profitability by the fourth quarter of this year, fueled by strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, with vehicle deliveries quadrupling compared to the previous year, resulting in a narrowed net loss and improved gross margin. UOB Kay Hian maintains a buy rating on the stock, projecting substantial upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Archdiocese of New Orleans has agreed to pay nearly $180 million to over 500 victims of clergy sexual assault to settle a lawsuit filed in 2020. The settlement, which requires approval from the survivors, the bankruptcy court, and other creditors, includes provisions to safeguard against future abuse and provide services to survivors. However, some survivors and their lawyers have criticized the deal, claiming it was made in secret and does not adequately compensate the victims for the abuse they suffered. The settlement comes after years of documented abuse claims and leaders transferring clergy without reporting their alleged crimes to law enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Russia's apparent reluctance to engage in meaningful peace negotiations with Ukraine, mounting economic and military pressures may eventually force Moscow to the negotiating table. Analysts predict that Russia's stockpiles of military equipment will diminish significantly by mid-fall, making it challenging to sustain offensive operations beyond 2025 without further forced mobilization. Simultaneously, Russia's war-focused economy is showing signs of slowing down, with a marked decrease in GDP growth and persistent challenges like inflation and high production costs. Tighter sanctions on Russia's oil exports and declining oil prices are exacerbating the economic strain, potentially compelling Russia to seek a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK faces increasing internal divisions, with public confidence in the government at record lows, and economic disparities threatening the stability of the union. Keir Starmer's government is attempting to address these issues through initiatives like the Council of the Nations and Regions, aiming to foster collaboration between the UK government and devolved administrations. However, challenges persist, including tensions between devolved nations, the rise of Reform UK, and differing powers among the council's attendees. Success hinges on genuine collaboration and addressing the underlying economic and aspirational discontents within the UK.</p>

          <p>A landmark review in the UK has recommended that violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving just a third of their sentence. The Independent Sentencing Review suggests managing more offenders in the community as an alternative to custodial sentences to alleviate prison overcrowding. While the government plans to build new prisons, the review warns that this alone will not solve the crisis. The proposal has raised concerns among probation officers, who fear increased pressure on an already stretched system, and victims' advocates, who worry about public safety.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the claims made by some white Afrikaners in South Africa that they are facing institutional discrimination and violence, which have been amplified by figures like Tucker Carlson and President Trump. The article argues that these claims are largely unfounded, as white South Africans still hold a disproportionate amount of wealth and land despite making up a small percentage of the population. The author suggests that these claims are part of an effort to rewrite the history of apartheid and cast former oppressors as victims. The article also highlights the complexities of South Africa's transition to democracy and the ongoing challenges of inequality and corruption.</p>

Earlier in May, Columbia University suspended more than 65 students for their role in a pro-Palestinian demonstration that forced the shutdown of the main campus library, according to a school official. The demonstration came amid negotiations between Columbia's board of trustees and the Trump administration, which announced in March it was penalizing the university over previous pro-Palestinian protests by canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are planning a vote to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers granted to California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including a mandate for all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend that such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome could significantly impact the auto industry and environmental regulations nationwide.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a magnitude 8.0 earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone could trigger a 1,000-foot-tall "mega tsunami" that could devastate parts of Alaska, Hawaii, and the mainland America's West Coast. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of such an earthquake occurring within the next 50 years. The resulting tsunami could wipe out cities like Seattle and Portland and cause significant coastal land subsidence. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this potential earthquake would happen within minutes, leaving little time for adaptation or mitigation.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled House is set to vote on President Trump's tax and spending bill, following approval by the House Rules Committee. The bill aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, create new tax breaks, end green-energy subsidies, and increase spending on the military and immigration enforcement. It also proposes tightening eligibility for food and health programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt. The bill has faced intra-party divisions, with fiscal conservatives pushing for more spending cuts.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed there is an ongoing "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa during a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, a claim that has been refuted by Ramaphosa, major political parties in South Africa, and a South African court. While murders of farmers do occur in South Africa, statistics do not indicate that these murders are race-driven. Trump's administration has issued an executive order to fast-track refugee applications for Afrikaners, the white ethnic minority in South Africa.

          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department, a decision that was met with dismay and criticism, particularly given its timing near the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death. The agreement aimed to overhaul police practices and address a pattern of unconstitutional practices. Minneapolis officials expressed their commitment to continue implementing the changes outlined in the agreement, despite the federal government's withdrawal. The decision has been criticized as insensitive and signaling a lack of concern for Black lives.</p>
