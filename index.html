          <p>Former President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, labeling him as "highly conflicted." This demand follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton raising concerns about the CEO's investments and alleged ties to Chinese businesses, including some with connections to the Chinese military. In response, Tan affirmed his commitment to Intel and the highest ethical standards, dismissing the claims as misinformation. The political pressure contributed to a noticeable slide in Intel's stock price.</p>

          <p>The Israeli Security Cabinet has approved a plan for the Israel Defense Forces to take control of Gaza City, a major escalation in the ongoing conflict. The government's strategy includes five principles for ending the war, such as disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, and establishing an alternative civilian government. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that while Israel intends to establish a security perimeter, it does not want to permanently govern the territory.

          <p>Top insurance firms like Allianz and Zurich are increasingly concerned that the climate crisis could soon make entire regions uninsurable due to the rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events. An Allianz board member warned that the world is approaching temperature levels where offering cover for mortgages and other financial services will no longer be viable, potentially destabilizing the economy. The industry points to a growing "protection gap," where the immense financial burden of natural disasters falls on individuals and governments rather than insurers.</p>

          <p>Bao Fan, the founder of investment bank China Renaissance Holdings, has been released after being detained for over two years to cooperate with an unspecified investigation by mainland authorities. His disappearance was part of a broader crackdown on China's tech and finance sectors, causing his company's stock to plummet. News of his release has provided some relief for the company and its investors, leading to a significant jump in its stock price, though he has resigned from his executive roles.</p>

          <p>A new CNBC survey reveals that former President Trump's overall approval rating remains in negative territory, with a majority of the public disapproving of his handling of key issues like inflation, taxes, and federal spending. At the same time, the poll shows that the public's view of the Democratic Party has soured significantly, reaching what appears to be a historic low in favorability.

          <p>This op-ed contends that the Republican Party has undergone a significant ideological shift regarding health care, moving from praising American medical innovation to actively undermining it. The author argues that under the influence of figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and national conservatives, the party is now cutting medical research funding and elevating anti-science views. This creates a worst-of-all-worlds scenario: a system that is both less innovative and provides even less access to basic care for its citizens.</p>

          <p>A new dating app named Tea, which allows women to anonymously post reviews and "red flags" about men, has surged in popularity but also drawn significant criticism. While designed as a safety tool, experts and users have raised serious concerns about its potential for defamation lawsuits, privacy violations, and the commodification of informal "whisper networks." The controversy, along with a recent data breach, highlights the profound challenges of creating a commercial, tech-based solution for systemic issues like gendered violence.</p>

          <p>On the front lines in Ukraine, soldiers fighting in intense battles express deep pessimism about the prospects for a diplomatic end to the war with Russia. As a deadline for Moscow set by former U.S. President Trump passes, commanders in the heavily contested Donetsk region state their belief that Russia is not serious about negotiations. Their perspective from the battlefield is that defeating the invading forces is the only viable path forward for their country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a medical journal commentary, academics have proposed the new word "healthocide" to describe the intentional and systematic destruction of health-care services and infrastructure during conflicts. The term was coined to draw urgent attention to the weaponization of health care, as seen in recent attacks in Gaza, Lebanon, and Ukraine. While the neologism has been welcomed by some for highlighting the severity of these acts, other human rights experts question its necessity, arguing that existing legal terms like "war crimes" are sufficient.</p>

          <p>The German government has announced it will suspend arms exports to Israel intended for use in the Gaza Strip "until further notice," marking a major reversal in policy for one of Israel's staunchest allies. The decision was made in response to Israel's plan to expand its military offensive into Gaza City, an action that has drawn widespread international condemnation. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that while Israel has a right to self-defense, its current military approach makes achieving its goals increasingly difficult.</p>

          <p>A new "senior deduction" included in former President Trump's recent tax bill could significantly impact when older Americans decide to claim Social Security benefits. The deduction is income-based, and since Social Security payments count towards that income, claiming benefits early could push some retirees over the threshold, reducing or eliminating the tax break. This creates a new financial calculation, where delaying benefits until age 70 might be more tax-efficient for those who would otherwise qualify for the deduction. (not investment advice)</p>

A leading hostage families' forum called the decision a "colossal catastrophe" that abandons their loved ones and endangers soldiers, arguing that a negotiated deal is the only path to their return. This sentiment is echoed in public polling, which indicates that a majority of the Israeli public is against the military escalation.</p>
