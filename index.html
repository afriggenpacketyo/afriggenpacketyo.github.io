          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), intending to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG." This move follows the collapse of a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe, which was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. The company has demonstrated strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and over 1,000 customers contributing at least $100,000 in annual revenue. The IPO is seen as a positive development for the tech industry and venture capital firms seeking returns after a prolonged market slump. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed tax would have targeted projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily China, adding a potential $7 billion burden to the industry. While its removal provided relief, industry groups like the Solar Energy Industries Association remain critical of the overall bill, which still phases out key production tax credits that have been instrumental in the growth of renewable energy in the U.S. The legislation's ultimate impact on the sector remains a concern for clean energy advocates.

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to arrest Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, if he obstructs federal immigration operations. Speaking at a new migrant detention center in Florida, Trump also repeated unsubstantiated claims that Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is a "communist" and in the country illegally. Mamdani, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Uganda, responded by calling the president's remarks an act of intimidation against New Yorkers who speak out. The exchange highlights escalating political tensions as Mamdani, who recently won the Democratic primary, prepares for the mayoral election in November.</p>

          <p>The families of the four University of Idaho students murdered in 2022 are divided over a proposed plea deal for the accused, Bryan Kohberger. The agreement would see Kohberger plead guilty to all charges in exchange for four consecutive life sentences, thereby avoiding the death penalty. Ben Mogen, father of victim Madison Mogen, expressed relief at avoiding a lengthy trial and appeals process. However, the family of Kaylee Goncalves voiced their fury, stating they were not consulted and demanding a full confession and accountability as part of any deal. A change of plea hearing is expected soon, though a judge retains the authority to reject such agreements.</p>

While described as business as usual for now, Santander has not ruled out branch closures or job cuts, particularly in duplicated back-office roles.

Critics argue that these changes, combined with the expiration of Obamacare subsidies, could lead to increased uncompensated care costs for hospitals, driving up expenses for all insured individuals.

To offset these cuts, the legislation proposes significant spending reductions for social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, overhauls student loan programs, and eliminates clean energy tax credits. The bill now returns to the House for reconciliation, where its varied provisions will face further debate before a potential final vote. (not investment advice)</p>

Riggen noted that her film, which tells the story of a young boy crossing the border to find his mother, was intended to be a heartwarming story that humanized immigrants.

          <p>Apple has filed a lawsuit against a former senior design engineer, Di Liu, accusing him of stealing thousands of confidential documents related to the Vision Pro headset before joining competitor Snap. The lawsuit alleges that Liu downloaded proprietary files containing project codenames, technology details, and supply chain information to his personal accounts during his final days at Apple. The company claims Liu concealed his new job at Snap, allowing him to retain access to sensitive systems. Apple is seeking damages and a forensic examination of Liu's devices to ensure all trade secrets are deleted, marking another instance of the company legally pursuing former employees for leaking information.</p>

          <p>R.T. Thorne's debut feature, “40 Acres,” is a post-apocalyptic thriller centered on a Black family struggling for survival in rural Canada after a pandemic wiped out animals and crops. The film stars Danielle Deadwyler as Hailey, a military veteran who leads her family with rigid discipline on their fortified farmstead, fending off hungry cannibals. The story focuses on the tension between Hailey's hardened isolationism, rooted in generational trauma, and her eldest son's desire for human connection. While the film is praised for its tense atmosphere and Deadwyler's powerful performance, some critics find its historical allusions and heavy-handed symbolism occasionally distracting from the core family drama.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has officially ended its operations, with its foreign assistance programs now being administered by the State Department. Officials state the move is intended to align foreign aid more closely with U.S. national interests and administration policies, aiming for greater efficiency. The decision has been criticized by former presidents and humanitarian organizations, who warn of devastating consequences. A new study in The Lancet projects that the cuts to USAID funding could lead to over 14 million additional deaths by 2030, particularly from HIV/AIDS and malaria, and disproportionately affecting young children in low-income countries.</p>

          <p>The Republican tax and spending package passed by the Senate includes a new temporary tax deduction for Americans aged 65 and over, referred to as a "senior bonus." The Senate version proposes a deduction of up to $6,000 per eligible taxpayer, while the House version calls for $4,000, effective from 2025 through 2028. This provision is being presented as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, a change prohibited under the reconciliation process used to pass the bill. The deduction is targeted at middle-income seniors and would phase out for individuals with incomes above $75,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following his threats to form a new political party, analysts are weighing the potential for an Elon Musk-led third party to succeed in the American two-party system. Historically, third parties have struggled due to the winner-take-all electoral system and the immense financial and organizational power of the Democratic and Republican parties. While Musk has the financial resources, experts suggest that success would require tapping into a significant grassroots movement of voter dissatisfaction. More often, third parties act as "spoilers," influencing major party platforms by drawing away votes rather than winning elections themselves, before fading away once their key issues are adopted.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that the central bank would likely have already lowered interest rates if not for President Trump's tariff policies. Speaking at a forum in Portugal, Powell explained that the Fed went into a holding pattern after the tariff announcements, as inflation forecasts for the U.S. rose materially as a direct consequence. This admission provides context for the Fed's decision to maintain its current interest rate despite public pressure from the White House to implement cuts. Powell reiterated that future decisions remain data-dependent, with no specific meeting being on or off the table for a potential rate adjustment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An intense heat wave is sweeping across Europe, breaking temperature records and prompting health warnings in multiple countries. In Portugal, temperatures reached a new June high of 46.6°C (116°F), while France and Italy have issued red alerts for numerous cities. German officials have highlighted how the extreme heat exposes social inequality, as lower-income individuals often live in less protected housing and cannot afford air conditioning. The World Meteorological Organization has stated that such extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, urging nations to implement early warning systems and action plans to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited a new, controversial migrant detention center located in the Florida Everglades, which has been dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The facility, built on an old airfield, is expected to house around 1,000 migrants deemed to be among the most "menacing." The administration suggests that the surrounding swampland, inhabited by alligators and pythons, will serve as a natural deterrent to escape. The project faces opposition from local lawmakers and environmental groups, who warn of damage to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem and criticize the move as a political stunt that bypasses proper environmental review processes.</p>
