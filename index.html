          <p>Eleven students involved in an alleged hazing incident targeting younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team turned themselves in after facing potential kidnapping charges. The incident involved older players allegedly luring younger teammates to a remote location, where masked accomplices simulated an abduction. One student was reportedly tied up and placed in a car trunk, leading the district attorney to condemn the act as "hazing on steroids." No injuries were reported, and the students who turned themselves in will likely be prosecuted in family court. Optimism is low due to the violent nature of the prank.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan has cut its growth forecast in half to 0.5 percent, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. This decision was announced alongside the central bank's decision to hold interest rates steady at 0.5 percent. President Trump's tariffs, including those on imported cars, are already affecting the Japanese economy, exacerbating existing pressures from weak consumer spending. The Bank of Japan's efforts to normalize monetary policy are further complicated by the potential for a tariff-induced economic slowdown, which could lead to a decline in prices.

          <p>This New York Times article reflects on the changing dynamics in Asia, particularly in light of the United States' perceived withdrawal from its traditional role of providing aid and promoting democratic ideals. Drawing parallels with the end of the Vietnam War, the article suggests that China is increasingly filling the void left by the U.S. through economic and military influence. While some in Asia express concerns about China's intentions, they also lament the slower and sometimes absent response of the U.S. in times of need, indicating a shift in regional power dynamics and perceptions of American influence.</p>

          <p>A recent poll by the Asian American Foundation reveals that one in four non-Asian Americans consider Chinese-Americans a potential threat, particularly in relation to national security. Additionally, four in ten respondents fear that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. These findings highlight a growing societal belief in the "perpetual foreigner" stereotype, which has consequences for the safety, sense of belonging, and opportunities for Asian-Americans. The poll underscores the disconnect between how Asian-Americans are perceived and their lived experiences.</p>

While some immigrants believe Trump is not behaving like an autocrat, others feel that his actions are creating an atmosphere of fear and self-censorship.

While China-India ties had been improving after border clashes, India's economic deal with Washington and its conflict with Pakistan could introduce new complexities. The Trump administration's tariffs on Indian imports have prompted India to pursue a trade deal with the U.S., potentially complicating China's efforts to engage with Global South economies.

          <p>A California Assembly committee has revised a controversial bill aimed at ending solar credits for rooftop solar system owners, now applying only to those who sell their homes. Originally, the bill would have reduced the benefits to 10 years, half of the promised 20-year period. The bill is supported by major utilities and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, who argue that the credits raise electric bills for non-solar owners. Opponents, including schools and environmental groups, contend that utilities' excessive spending is the cause of rising bills, not solar credits.

The central bank indicated it will continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are realized, but also highlighted the likelihood of moderate growth due to a slowdown in other economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits.

Jera aims to compensate for fluctuations in solar power generation by using the LNG-fired plant, which can easily control output. As Japan plans to rely on renewable and nuclear energy, LNG is expected to play a key role in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables.</p>
