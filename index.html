          <p>The band Oasis has commenced their first tour in 16 years, starting with a sold-out show in Cardiff, Wales. The reunion tour, titled Live '25, generated massive demand, selling around 900,000 tickets despite controversy over Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing, which prompted a regulatory investigation. The tour will span 41 shows across the globe, though the band's co-manager has stated there are no current plans for new music, describing this as their "last time around." The event has drawn international fans, celebrating the return of one of Britain's most iconic bands from the 1990s.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California, has left seven individuals unaccounted for and resulted in a large fire. The blasts, which began Tuesday evening, prompted a one-mile evacuation zone and caused grass fires spanning 80 acres. Two people were confirmed injured, and officials are still working to locate the missing individuals, including three family members. It was later revealed that the company lacked the necessary local licenses to store fireworks on the agricultural property, adding a layer of regulatory failure to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A sweeping tax and spending bill, championed by President Trump, is set to become law, fundamentally reshaping the U.S. social safety net and tax system. The legislation extends tax cuts from his first term while imposing stricter work requirements and funding cuts for major programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Nonpartisan analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates these changes could cause millions to lose their benefits, with a significant impact on low-income Americans. While proponents argue the bill will curb "waste, fraud and abuse," critics warn of a massive hit to local economies and a $3.3 trillion increase to the national deficit over the next decade.

          <p>One year after securing a significant majority, the Labour government under Sir Keir Starmer is facing scrutiny over its progress on key pledges.

On the economy, growth has been minimal, and new policies may be weighing on business hiring. In foreign affairs, the government has managed its relationship with the U.S. and supported Ukraine, but faces criticism for being too cautious on issues like China and for cutting foreign aid.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: A Simplified Payment System Could Make GLP-1 Drugs More Affordable Through Employer Insurance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This contributor article argues that anti-obesity medications like GLP-1s could become more accessible and affordable for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The author proposes eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons that inflates the list price of these drugs. Instead, manufacturers could offer a transparent, lower price directly to health plans, similar to their direct-to-consumer pricing. This would allow employers to share the cost, bringing the employee's out-of-pocket expense closer to what is paid in other countries and reducing the need for burdensome prior authorizations from doctors.

          <h2>Newly Passed Bill Creates Temporary Federal Tax Exemption on Tipped Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 17:22:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of a major legislative package, Congress has approved a provision creating a temporary tax exemption for tipped workers in the U.S. The new rule allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their federally taxable income, a policy that will expire at the end of 2028 unless extended. The exemption is limited to occupations that customarily receive tips and includes an income cap, phasing out for individuals earning over $150,000 a year to prevent misuse. This fulfills a key campaign promise from President Trump, though opponents of the broader bill criticize its cuts to social programs like Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation by the BBC has uncovered a thriving and open trade in illegal cigarettes across the UK, signaling a deeper issue of organized crime and regulatory failure. Reporters found numerous shops in Hull and other cities selling untaxed and counterfeit tobacco, often from behind hidden compartments and tunnels. Experts link these operations to international crime gangs involved in people trafficking and illegal immigration, with some shop workers being exploited asylum seekers. The problem is exacerbated by underfunded Trading Standards teams and low penalties, leading to a sense of decline and lawlessness on local high streets.</p>

          <p>Despite narrow Republican majorities and internal party fractures, President Trump's landmark tax-and-spending bill passed Congress, showcasing his significant influence. The path to victory involved intense political pressure, including direct intervention from Trump to sway holdouts and last-minute deals targeting specific states to secure crucial votes. The bill, which passed the Senate on a tie-breaking vote by the Vice President, overcame conservative concerns about its impact on the deficit and deep cuts to Medicaid. The final House vote was secured after a seven-hour delay and intense negotiations, demonstrating the party's ultimate consolidation behind the president's agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed domestic policy bill includes a historic $170 billion investment aimed at dramatically expanding federal immigration enforcement. The funding allocates $45 billion for detention centers, $30 billion for hiring more ICE personnel, and $46.5 billion to complete the border wall. The bill also makes immigration more expensive by increasing fees for processes like asylum applications and appeals. Additionally, it restricts access to safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP for many lawfully present immigrants, and it alters eligibility for the Child Tax Credit, affecting families with undocumented parents.

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton expressed frustration after his second-round Wimbledon match against Rinky Hijikata was suspended for bad light at a critical moment. The 10th-seeded Shelton was leading two sets to love and was up 5-4 in the third set, about to serve for the match. The umpire's decision, made as the time approached 9:30 PM, means Shelton must return the next day to potentially play just a single game. His annoyance was compounded by the fact that he had just missed three match points and had previously asked for play to be suspended before the third set began.</p>

The filing lists liabilities between $100 million and $500 million and follows recent layoffs at the network. The suit claims TBN's technical services were "comically dysfunctional," hampering the production of shows like "Dr. Phil Primetime."</p>
