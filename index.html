          <p>Former President Donald Trump is embarking on a five-day trip to Asia, with stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea for high-stakes summits. A primary focus is a meeting with China's Xi Jinping to negotiate an end to the ongoing trade war, with Trump threatening higher tariffs if no deal is reached. He also expressed openness to a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a possibility that has generated significant speculation despite official denials of a planned meeting. The tour also includes overseeing a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia and meeting Japan's new prime minister.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a major overnight assault on Ukraine, employing a combination of ballistic missiles and drones that resulted in at least four civilian deaths and multiple injuries in Kyiv and the Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukrainian air defenses successfully intercepted a majority of the projectiles, but several direct hits damaged residential buildings and a kindergarten. The attack occurred as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for stricter sanctions on Russia's oil industry to limit its ability to finance the war. The violence continues amid reports of ongoing back-channel talks between Moscow and Washington.</p>

          <p>San Diego-based defense technology company Shield AI has introduced a new AI-piloted fighter jet, the X-BAT, designed to counter China's strategy of targeting US airfields in a potential conflict. The aircraft features vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability, allowing it to operate from locations without traditional runways, such as ships or small islands. Its "Hivemind" autonomy system enables it to fly and execute missions without GPS or constant communication, reacting to threats in real-time. The company emphasizes that a human will always make the final decision on the use of lethal force.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's recent military actions against Venezuela, including strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats, signal a significant escalation in its policy toward the Maduro regime. This aggressive posture, which includes deploying B-52 bombers and authorizing CIA operations, is reportedly driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has framed the issue around "narco-terrorism." Analysts suggest the strategy aims to provoke an internal military coup against Nicolás Maduro rather than a full-scale invasion. The policy reflects a reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine, treating Latin America as a US sphere of influence.</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs report reveals that major Chinese companies are strategically shifting their focus away from the United States and toward less-developed markets like Southeast Asia. Since 2018, China's exports to non-US markets have grown at a compound annual rate of about 7.5%, while exports to the US have slightly declined. This diversification is coupled with a move up the value chain, with China exporting more technologically advanced and higher-margin products. This strategy allows Chinese firms to leverage their cost advantages while building new supply chains and reducing reliance on the contentious US market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing fallout from his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew has agreed to stop using most of his titles, though he remains a prince by birth. However, there are growing calls for the British Parliament to formally remove all his titles, citing a 1917 precedent, as leaked emails reveal his continued contact with Epstein even after publicly claiming to have severed ties. The emails show Andrew signing off with his full aristocratic titles in a message of solidarity to Epstein. The scandal is viewed as an existential threat to the monarchy, with reports that Prince William may ban him from a future coronation.</p>

Platner, a Marine veteran and oysterman, embodies a progressive strategy of nominating working-class-style candidates who advocate for left-wing populist economics while refusing to compromise on social issues. His continued viability is seen as a crucial test for this theory of political change within the Democratic Party.</p>

Unlike inland wave pools, this park will be near the ocean, aiming to provide a controlled and consistent surfing experience for all skill levels.

A recent College Board survey found that 84% of high school students use AI for schoolwork, raising concerns that it undermines learning, discipline, and critical thinking skills. Some educators are abandoning traditional homework, viewing it as pointless, while others are adapting by creating assignments that are more meaningful and harder to complete with AI.

          <p>October marks a peak period for tarantula mating season in Southern California, prompting male spiders to leave their burrows in search of females in a journey fraught with danger. Prompted by the first autumn rains, the males follow pheromones to locate potential mates, but the encounters can be fatal, as female tarantulas are known to cannibalize their suitors before or after mating. While their venom is not dangerous to humans and they are not typically aggressive, they can flick irritating hairs as a defense mechanism. Urbanization poses additional threats, such as roads and swimming pools, to the spiders during their annual quest.</p>

This move reflects Microsoft's broader strategy of making its games accessible on multiple platforms rather than relying on console exclusivity to drive hardware sales.

The halt in talks could prolong existing 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, key materials in many manufactured products, which would increase costs for US producers and likely be passed on to consumers.

          <p>Social media claims that Germany has canceled hundreds of its famous Christmas markets for 2025 are false, according to a fact check by DW. While a few small, local markets have been called off due to logistical or financial reasons, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 markets are scheduled to proceed as planned. The viral claims originated from an article on a low-credibility site that cited "unaffordable security costs" and misrepresented the status of markets in several towns. Although security costs have risen since past terror attacks, there is no evidence of widespread cancellations across the country.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has accepted a $130 million anonymous donation to help cover the salaries of military service members during the ongoing government shutdown. President Trump announced the gift, describing the donor as a "patriot" and a "friend" who wished to remain anonymous. The government shutdown, now approaching its fifth week, has left federal funding in limbo, and the Trump administration previously diverted $8 billion from military R&D to ensure troops were paid. While the Pentagon expressed gratitude, ethics concerns have been raised over the anonymous nature of such a large donation to fund the military.</p>

          <p>As the UK prepares for shorter days and longer nights with the clocks going back, health experts are highlighting the challenges of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a type of depression linked to reduced daylight. In Scotland's northern isles, where winter daylight can be as little as six hours, a new "Wintering Well" initiative is providing therapeutic lamps and activity guides through local libraries to help residents cope. The project aims to shift attitudes toward winter by encouraging outdoor activity and creating more welcoming indoor light environments, drawing inspiration from Scandinavian cultures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump continues to face scrutiny over his past friendship with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with growing public and political pressure to release all unredacted government files related to the case. Survivors of Epstein's abuse are demanding full transparency to hold all involved accountable. Trump, who once called Epstein a "great guy," has since tried to distance himself from the scandal, but a posthumously published memoir by survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre has renewed interest. Observers note that while the revelations could be politically damaging, many of Trump's core supporters remain loyal.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" after the Pentagon ordered the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, to be deployed to the Caribbean. The move represents a significant escalation of US military presence in the region, where the Trump administration has already conducted ten air strikes against what it calls "narco-terrorist" vessels. The US does not recognize Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. The military buildup is fueling fears in Venezuela that the US is preparing for direct action to achieve regime change.</p>

Reina specializes in pre-seed investing, focusing on technically proficient founders in nascent industries before they become popular. ElevenLabs, which specializes in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning, was recently valued at $6.6 billion in a secondary share sale.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' decisive 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series has raised questions about whether a week-long break disrupted their momentum. After sweeping the NLCS, the Dodgers had their longest break of the season, a stark contrast to the Blue Jays, who came from a seven-game series. Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan, both coming off extended rest, struggled significantly, leading to speculation that being "too fresh" may have negatively affected their performance. While the team officially dismissed the layoff as an excuse, historical data shows that teams sweeping their LCS have previously struggled in the World Series.</p>

The operation resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss medicine by a law enforcement agency globally. Authorities confiscated tens of thousands of empty pens ready for filling, raw ingredients, and over 2,000 unlicensed pens containing Retatrutide and Tirzepatide. The MHRA warned the public about the dangers of buying unauthorized medicines online, stating that such products are untested and potentially deadly.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei's radical austerity policies are facing growing criticism as the country heads into key parliamentary elections. While his "shock therapy" has curbed hyperinflation and achieved a budget surplus, it has come at a high cost for the population, with falling wages, rising unemployment, and the closure of thousands of small businesses. Recent corruption scandals involving his sister and a party colleague have further eroded his popularity, which has fallen to 40%. With polls showing a tight race between his party and the resurgent Peronists, the election is seen as a crucial test of public support for his libertarian agenda.</p>

          <p>Herbie Farnworth, who plays for the Dolphins in Australia's NRL, is being highlighted as a key player for England in the upcoming Rugby League Ashes series against Australia. Considered one of the best centres in the world, Farnworth's journey from Lancashire to NRL stardom makes him a unique asset for an England team seeking its first Ashes victory since 1970. Teammates and coaches describe him as a "cheat code" due to his ability to create scoring opportunities from nothing. As England prepares for the first test at Wembley, his performance against the Australian players he competes with weekly will be critical.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that thousands of patients in Gaza, including many children, are in urgent need of medical evacuation as the healthcare system has been devastated by two years of war. Despite a fragile ceasefire, access to specialized treatment abroad remains severely limited, with Israel keeping the Rafah border crossing with Egypt closed. The WHO has coordinated one convoy but says numbers must be increased rapidly, and has called for Israel to allow patients to be treated in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Hamas-run health ministry reports that hundreds have died while on waiting lists.</p>
