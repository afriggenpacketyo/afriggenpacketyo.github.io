          <h2>Lab-Grown Meat Faces Scrutiny Amid Environmental and Ethical Debates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 19:02:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The development of lab-grown meat, or cultivated meat, is being debated as a possible solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with traditional meat production. While advocates claim it can meet growing meat demand with less environmental impact, critics argue that the environmental benefits are overstated and that reducing meat consumption should be prioritized. The process involves growing animal cells in vats, but questions remain about the energy intensity and overall climate cost compared to traditional farming. Despite regulatory approvals in some countries, mass production and affordability remain challenges, and some worry about the ultra-processed nature of cultivated food, as well as the environmental impact of the CO2 production in comparison to the methane gas produced by cows. Optimism surrounding the technology is tempered by the need for more comprehensive climate assessment studies and considerations of taste and affordability, which will ultimately decide its future.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer reports that AI stocks are recovering as investors are no longer as concerned about the potential of Chinese startup DeepSeek to surpass current tech leaders. The market's initial panic in January, triggered by DeepSeek's release of an advanced AI model, led to a significant drop in AI stock values. Cramer argues that the recovery is a "refutation" of the idea that China had beaten the U.S. in the AI arms race. He also said that the recovery of many AI stocks shows that fears about DeepSeek's dominance are short-lived (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the evolving impact of scandals on politicians, noting a shift from disqualifying events to factors in a cost-benefit analysis for voters. The rise of President Donald Trump and the comeback attempts of figures like Andrew Cuomo have prompted questions about whether scandals still matter. The #MeToo movement initially complicated matters, but a fatigue with "cancellation" has emerged, and hyper-polarization has led partisans to prioritize electability over moral purity. The article suggests that while scandals can still hurt, they are now weighed against other factors, such as electability and partisan alignment, in voters' decisions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. intelligence agency assessed that Iran could potentially produce a nuclear weapon within three to eight months, but had not yet decided to do so, according to CBS News.

The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site. Iran has long denied intentions to build nuclear weapons, insisting its uranium enrichment program is for peaceful purposes.</p>

          <p>A former Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that senior officials discussed defying federal court orders to advance the Trump administration's immigration priorities. Reuveni claims he was fired after pushing back against attempts to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in immigration cases. He alleges that Emil Bove, a nominee for the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, suggested the department should tell courts "f*** you" and ignore court orders. The Justice Department has defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases, but the allegations have raised concerns about the department's commitment to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, achieving its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aiming for another $1 billion in savings. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year over year, with a 10% rise in U.S. ground home delivery volume. While the company's stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance coming in slightly below Wall Street's expectations, the company reported a net income for the quarter ended May 31 of $1.65 billion. The company forecasts revenue will be flat to up 2% year over year for its fiscal first quarter of 2026 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump is claiming a foreign policy victory after a ceasefire was established between Israel and Iran, with NATO boss Mark Rutte praising Trump's decisive action. However, intelligence officials have suggested that the U.S. bombing raid did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear research facilities, potentially setting the program back only by months. Questions remain about the extent of the damage to Iranian facilities, and the fragile nature of Middle East truces. Despite these uncertainties, Trump's critics have been proven unfounded, giving him political space to tout his administration's efforts as an unqualified success.</p>

          <p>This satirical article presents a humorous take on the concept of God's involvement in current events, particularly the Trump administration's actions in Iran. The piece mocks the idea of divine endorsement of military actions and questions the priorities of a deity who seems more concerned with awards shows and personal vanity projects than global justice. The author uses irony to critique the intersection of politics and religion, suggesting that God has become more involved in trivial matters while neglecting significant issues. It is a humorous commentary on the state of affairs, and the tone is one of sarcasm and disbelief.</p>
