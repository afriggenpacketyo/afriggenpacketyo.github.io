          <p>Tesla stock experienced a rebound, climbing over 3% following a significant drop triggered by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest that the investor base of Tesla remains largely unfazed by external controversies, with Wedbush Securities noting that the shares were oversold due to the news. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures. Despite a Politico report suggesting a potential truce brokered by Trump, a White House official stated that Trump is not interested in a call with Musk. This article reflects the market's reaction to the high-profile disagreement and its potential impact on Tesla's valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been indicted on federal charges including conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. The indictment alleges Abrego Garcia conspired to bring migrants from Latin America to the U.S. between 2016 and 2025. Abrego Garcia was deported in March and held in a high-security prison in El Salvador, despite having legal status in the U.S. that forbade his removal. This case has sparked legal battles and accusations against the Trump administration for defying court orders to facilitate his return, which has now occurred for prosecution.</p>

The indictment includes two felony counts, and evidence includes bodycam footage from a 2022 traffic stop where Garcia was found with eight other men in his vehicle.

This move is expected to reduce delivery times and labor costs, potentially leading to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030.

This decision involves getting rid of employees and defunding the agency, with the department working with Congress to repeal the bureau's statutes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite their recent public feud, Donald Trump and Elon Musk remain intertwined due to their political and business interests. Musk's significant donations to Trump and the Republican party, totaling $290 million, are a substantial loss for the party. Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have extensive contracts with the U.S. government, giving Trump leverage. The complex legal processes involved in canceling or withdrawing from these contracts mean that the U.S. government is likely to continue doing business with Musk's companies for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ability to cut ties with Elon Musk is limited by the U.S.'s reliance on SpaceX for its space program. Despite concerns raised about Musk's political activities and access to classified information, SpaceX's capabilities in launching objects into space are unmatched. Canceling Musk's contracts would hinder ambitious plans like the Golden Dome missile defense project and NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon and establish a permanent lunar space station.

          <p>An economist warns that despite a stable U.S. job market, there are "cracks in the foundation" that could spell trouble for workers. While the U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, the economy has averaged only 144,000 new jobs per month in the last year, the lowest since 2011 excluding the pandemic. The majority of available positions are in sectors like health care, leisure, and hospitality, which could be limited by tariffs and health-care policies. Federal funding cuts to health care, which has been a major driver of job growth, could jeopardize this sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses the underlying political philosophy driving the Trump administration's efforts to transform America's institutional landscape. It argues that the administration's actions are rooted in anti-managerialism, a belief that a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats has usurped democracy. This idea, once marginalized, has become a central principle of the new right, influencing the administration's approach to government, universities, and major corporations. The article suggests that understanding this anti-managerialism is essential to comprehending the Trump administration's agenda.</p>
