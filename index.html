          <p>USC defeated Michigan State 45-31, advancing to a 4-0 record. Receiver Makai Lemon was a standout performer, scoring two touchdowns and accumulating 127 receiving yards, stepping up in the absence of injured wideout Ja’Kobi Lane. Despite the offense gaining over 500 yards, the Trojans' defense struggled with discipline, allowing Michigan State to stay competitive into the fourth quarter. The victory comes ahead of a challenging stretch of games against ranked opponents, where USC's penalty issues and secondary will be heavily tested.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, has been arrested after allegedly firing at least three rounds into the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento. While no injuries were reported, the incident is being investigated as a drive-by shooting. The suspect was initially arrested by local police, released on bail, and then re-arrested by the FBI on a federal charge. Officials, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, condemned the act as an attack on democracy and journalism.</p>

          <p>In China, stalled and unfinished real estate projects are being repurposed as lavish film sets for the country's rapidly growing micro-drama industry. These short, online dramas, often featuring romantic storylines in luxurious settings, have become immensely popular, with viewership surpassing 660 million people in 2024. This trend provides a new, albeit unusual, revenue stream for developers facing cash shortages and project delays. The on-screen opulence of these productions creates a stark contrast with the reality of the idle construction sites.</p>

The event featured speeches from prominent figures including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who honored Kirk's influence and legacy. Security was extremely high, with the event designated a Level 1 Special Event, and authorities detained an armed man at the site ahead of the service. The memorial also prompted widespread discussion on political rhetoric, with various commentators and politicians weighing in on the circumstances surrounding his death.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce the United Kingdom's formal recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a significant shift in British foreign policy. The decision follows a deadline set for Israel to agree to a ceasefire and commit to a two-state solution, conditions which have not been met. The move has drawn strong criticism from the Israeli government and some UK conservatives, who argue it rewards terrorism. This policy change reflects growing international pressure on Israel amid the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Top Premier League clubs Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly incorporating long-ball tactics, a style traditionally associated with lower-league football. This strategic shift is a response to the effectiveness of high-pressing defenses, which make building up play with short passes from the back riskier. By utilizing goalkeepers with strong distribution and tall forwards, these teams can bypass the opposition's press, gain territory, and create different types of attacking opportunities. This evolution demonstrates how top managers are adapting their philosophies to gain a competitive edge.</p>

          <p>As several Western countries move to recognize a Palestinian state, analysts are questioning what this diplomatic gesture will practically achieve. Supporters argue that recognition elevates Palestine's standing in future negotiations and reaffirms its right to self-determination, creating pressure on Israel. However, critics suggest the move is largely symbolic, potentially doing little to stop the ongoing war in Gaza or change the reality of the occupation. Some experts warn that without concrete actions like sanctions, recognition alone may not lead to meaningful progress toward a two-state solution.</p>
