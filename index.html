          <p>Tens of thousands protested in Ankara against a judicial crackdown on Turkey's main opposition, the Republican People's Party (CHP). CHP leader Ozgur Ozel denounced Monday's court hearing, which could oust him, as a politically motivated attempt to undermine the party after its recent electoral successes. Protesters chanted for President Erdogan's resignation, claiming the government seeks to govern through oppression rather than democracy. This event highlights escalating political tensions and challenges to democratic processes within Turkey.</p>

          <p>The number of drivers 'underwater' on their auto loans, owing more than their car's value, has hit a four-year high at 26.6% of trade-ins in Q2 2025. The average negative equity stands at $6,754, forcing consumers to pay the balance or roll it into a new loan. This trend is exacerbated by longer loan terms and smaller down payments, posing risks if a vehicle is totaled. Experts advise keeping current vehicles or researching thoroughly and considering gap insurance for new purchases (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Australia has approved a single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a leading cause of death and infertility among the marsupials. Developed over a decade by UniSC researchers, the vaccine has shown promise in reducing infection, preventing disease progression, and even reversing existing symptoms. Chlamydia can cause blindness and starvation in koalas, and current antibiotic treatments are often ineffective or have side effects. This approval marks a significant step in conservation efforts for the endangered species.</p>

          <p>Fitness experts are highlighting "Zone Zero" workouts, a low-intensity activity where heart rate stays below 50% of maximum, encompassing gentle movements like walking or stretching. While not an official medical category, this approach promotes active rest, blood sugar regulation, improved circulation, and stress reduction. It serves as a foundation for daily movement, encouraging those not ready for intense exercise to remain active. However, experts note it alone won't build significant strength or endurance.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are entering the final two weeks of the regular season with crucial games ahead, particularly against the Philadelphia Phillies. Their primary goal is to secure a top-two record among division champions to earn a bye into the division series, avoiding the first round of playoffs. Despite past playoff struggles with byes, team president Andrew Friedman believes it's better for World Series odds. The article also touches on the possibility of the Padres winning the NL West and its implications for home-field advantage.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the prime suspect in Madeleine McCann's 2007 disappearance, has refused an interview request from the Metropolitan Police. Brückner, currently serving a sentence in Germany for the sexual assault of an elderly woman, denies involvement in the McCann case. Despite almost two decades, the high-profile missing persons case remains unsolved, with British and German authorities treating it differently. Investigators continue to pursue leads, including previous searches near locations linked to Brückner, but no charges have been brought in Madeleine's disappearance.</p>

          <p>Utah's recently passed HB 128, allowing open carry of firearms on college campuses for permit holders, is facing renewed scrutiny following the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk. While it's unclear if the suspect legally possessed the weapon, the law adds to Utah's permissive gun landscape, which lacks red-flag laws. University staff previously raised safety concerns about armed individuals in classrooms and labs. Experts debate the deterrence effect of open carry versus the need for screening at public events, highlighting a complex issue of campus safety and gun control.</p>
