          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston granted a restraining order, stating the job cuts appeared politically motivated and were causing an intolerable human cost. The ruling came after federal unions filed a lawsuit arguing the layoffs, which could affect over 10,000 employees, were an illegal abuse of power intended to pressure Democratic lawmakers. The shutdown, now in its third week, continues as Congress remains deadlocked over health care subsidies and other funding issues.</p>

          <p>Multiple small business owners are facing significant financial hardship due to the Trump administration's tariffs, forcing them to take on high-interest loans, raise prices, and consider layoffs. The article highlights several case studies, including a footwear company and a lighting business, whose owners describe the duties as an existential threat that stifles growth and innovation. Economists warn that the struggles of these smaller companies, which lack the resources of larger corporations to absorb costs, could be a leading indicator of broader economic trouble. The uncertainty is compounded by a pending Supreme Court review of the tariffs' legality. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several U.S. airports, including those in Denver and Newark, are experiencing significant flight delays due to a shortage of air traffic controllers, a problem exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Federal data shows that some air traffic control facilities are facing their lowest staffing levels since the travel boom of 2022. Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers and must work without pay during the shutdown, leading to a slight increase in sick calls. The FAA is reducing the number of takeoffs and landings to maintain safety, which directly results in delays and cancellations for travelers.</p>

          <p>North Korea is actively cultivating relationships with Southeast Asian nations, highlighted by recent high-level visits from Vietnamese and Laotian leaders to Pyongyang. The visit by Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam was the first by a Vietnamese leader in 18 years, resulting in agreements to boost defense and health care cooperation. Analysts suggest these partnerships provide North Korea with diplomatic legitimacy and potential avenues to bypass international sanctions, while offering its partners limited economic opportunities. These moves illustrate Pyongyang's strategy to diversify its alliances beyond its heavy reliance on China for trade and support.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown means that all active-duty U.S. military service members must continue to perform their duties without receiving their pay until a funding deal is reached. While a 2019 law ensures all government employees receive back pay after a shutdown, military pay requires a separate act of Congress, which has not yet passed. Essential civilian defense personnel will also continue to work without pay, while others are furloughed. Financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering no-interest loans to affected service members to help them manage their finances during this period.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass annual funding legislation, forcing federal agencies to cease all non-essential operations. Due to the Antideficiency Act, agencies cannot spend money without congressional approval, leading to the furlough of non-essential employees. Essential services, such as national security, law enforcement, and air traffic control, continue to operate, but employees in these roles work without immediate pay. While programs like Social Security and Medicare have permanent funding, customer service and administrative functions can be severely delayed, impacting the public more directly the longer the shutdown lasts.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized a recent Time magazine cover photo, which was part of a feature on his efforts to broker peace in Gaza. In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed the magazine “disappeared” his hair and shot him from an unflattering underneath angle, creating a strange, small floating crown effect above his head. The author of the article uses the incident to humorously reflect on the universal anxieties of aging and hair loss. The commentary suggests that Trump's outrage is a manifestation of his broader battle against the perception of his own aging and appearance.</p>

          <p>The interim government of Bangladesh is facing criticism over its plan to lease three key port terminals, including the strategic New Mooring Container Terminal (NCT) in Chattogram, to foreign companies. Officials argue the move will increase efficiency, but critics, including military leaders and economists, express alarm over the lack of transparency and potential national security risks. The decision was made by an unelected administration without public consultation or competitive bidding.

During his tenure, he became the first sitting Japanese prime minister to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site where Japan's full-scale invasion of China began in 1937. A Chinese spokesman praised Murayama as a politician with a strong sense of justice who made significant contributions to China-Japan relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior analyst at Moody's Ratings has stated there is little evidence of a systemic problem in the U.S. banking system, despite recent market anxiety over bad loans held by some midsize banks. The concerns were triggered after two regional banks disclosed losses related to bankrupt auto lenders, causing a sector-wide stock sell-off. However, the analyst noted that default rates on high-yield debt remain relatively low and are expected to decline further. The report suggests the U.S. economy has shown resilience, and overall credit quality is in a good position, countering fears of widespread financial contagion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent tech investor Ron Conway has resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, citing that his values no longer align with those of CEO Marc Benioff. The departure follows Benioff's recent comments suggesting he would welcome federal troops in San Francisco to address policing shortages, which drew both support from right-wing figures and criticism from local leaders. Conway, a longtime Democratic donor, reportedly expressed his disagreement with Benioff's stance in an email. The incident highlights a growing rift in the tech community over how to address civic issues and the role of federal intervention in local affairs.</p>

Leaders of these non-profits view the move as a politically motivated attack on civil society designed to intimidate and silence dissent.

          <p>Talcum powder has been linked to cancer concerns for decades, primarily due to its potential contamination with asbestos, a known carcinogen. Talc and asbestos are minerals that form near each other and can become mixed during the mining process, making separation difficult. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies asbestos-contaminated talc as carcinogenic to humans, linked to mesothelioma, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. Following numerous lawsuits and multi-billion-dollar payouts, major producer Johnson & Johnson has transitioned from using talc to cornstarch in its baby powder, though the direct causal link between pure talc and cancer remains debated by some.</p>

          <p>As energy demand from AI data centers and electrification grows, experts are promoting "demand flexibility" as a key solution to stabilize the U.S. power grid and lower costs. This policy involves rewarding consumers and businesses for reducing electricity use during peak hours or for selling stored energy back to the grid. A recent Duke University study found that such policies could add over 100GW of capacity, equivalent to the expected new demand from data centers by 2035. Proponents argue this approach is a cheaper and faster alternative to building new fossil fuel infrastructure, helping to prevent blackouts and reduce household energy bills.</p>

          <p>An estimated one billion birds die each year in the United States from colliding with glass windows, a threat second only to cats and habitat loss. During migration, birds can mistake reflective or transparent glass for open sky or trees, leading to fatal impacts. Conservation groups and volunteers in cities like Washington D.C. and Chicago are collecting data to identify the deadliest buildings and advocate for solutions. While bird-friendly building codes are emerging in some cities, advocates stress that simple, affordable treatments like window films with dot patterns can reduce collisions by over 90%, offering a scalable way to address this widespread problem.</p>

Major UK banks like Barclays saw their shares drop, and similar downturns were observed in European and Asian markets.

          <p>As exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow in popularity, financial advisors are cautioning investors against common mistakes that can negatively impact long-term financial growth. Key errors include "chasing performance" by buying into funds only after they have peaked and "trend hopping" into volatile thematic ETFs without a clear strategy. Another significant oversight is ignoring expense ratios, as even small differences in fees can compound over time, leading to substantial losses in potential returns. Experts recommend focusing on diversified, low-cost funds that align with individual long-term goals rather than short-term market hype. (not investment advice)</p>
