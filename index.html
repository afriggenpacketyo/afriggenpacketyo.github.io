          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay $511 million to settle a criminal case with the U.S. Department of Justice for conspiring to help American taxpayers hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The conspiracy, which occurred from 2010 through 2021, allowed wealthy clients to evade U.S. tax obligations. The DOJ stated that Credit Suisse committed new crimes and breached its May 2014 plea agreement with the United States. The company pleaded guilty to conspiracy to aid in the preparation of false income tax returns and entered into a non-prosecution agreement related to U.S. accounts booked at Credit Suisse AG Singapore, which held over $2 billion in undeclared assets for U.S. persons.</p>

          <p>Farmers in western Iowa are facing a challenging planting season due to high costs, low crop prices, and the impact of tariffs, echoing concerns from the 1980s farm crisis. A 145 percent tariff imposed by President Trump on Chinese imports has led to a retaliatory 125 percent tax on U.S. goods, significantly affecting Midwestern crops like soybeans, of which China is a major importer. Farmers are also grappling with high seed and fertilizer costs, as well as rising interest rates on loans, with some lenders becoming more cautious and restructuring loans. Despite the difficulties, many farmers express a belief that President Trump will provide financial support if needed, although uncertainty remains about government assistance.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs is on trial in New York City, accused of sexual assault, trafficking, and exploitation of women over several decades. Combs faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, and has pleaded not guilty. The indictment alleges Combs ran a criminal enterprise since at least 2004, engaging in sexual assault, forced labor, and other offenses. A key piece of evidence is a 2016 security video showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in a Los Angeles hotel. If found guilty on all counts, Combs could face up to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is facing significant flight delays and cancellations due to an equipment failure at an air traffic control center and ongoing staffing shortages. Air traffic controllers temporarily lost communication with planes on April 28, leading to hundreds of delays and cancellations. One of Newark's three runways is closed for construction, exacerbating the issues, and some controllers have taken time off to recover from the stress of recent outages. Senator Chuck Schumer has called for an investigation into the problems, citing safety issues and outdated technology, while United Airlines has cut 35 round-trip flights per day to mitigate the impact on customers.</p>

Commercial revenues grew 71% year-over-year to $255 million, while government segment sales jumped 45% to $373 million, with U.S. commercial revenues projected to exceed $1.178 billion this year.

Legal experts emphasized that the Fifth Amendment applies to both citizens and noncitizens, with the Supreme Court affirming that illegal immigrants are afforded due process rights.

The change comes after the agency started recovering erroneous overpayments by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check. The agency's inspector general found that many overpayments are due to problems with Social Security's own calculations. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI.</p>

          <p>Investors in Hollywood's top studios and streaming services reacted to President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on movies made overseas. Shares of Netflix, Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery briefly fell before rebounding. Trump claims tax incentives offered by foreign countries are a national security threat and intends to impose a levy on all films produced abroad that are sent to the United States. Questions remain about the implementation of these duties, the targeted productions, and the potential impact on relationships with other countries, as Hollywood relies on international box office sales.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced it is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing its nonprofit to retain control, bowing to pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees. The company, backed by Microsoft and valued at $300 billion, made the decision after discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware. The restructuring comes amid a legal battle with Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI and is trying to prevent it from becoming a for-profit company. The nonprofit will remain the majority shareholder and will pick the board members of the new entity.</p>

          <p>The race to become Donald Trump's next national security advisor is underway, with loyalty to the president being a key factor. Trump suggested Marco Rubio could continue in an interim role while also praising Stephen Miller, whom he said was effectively already doing the job. The two men represent distinct wings of Trump's Republican support, with Miller being a rightwing ideologue and Trump enforcer. Experts express doubts that Rubio can sustainably manage both the secretary of state and national security advisor roles.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor beat Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs. The company expects to offset $1 billion of those costs through remediation actions, resulting in a net impact of $1.5 billion. Ford cited near-term risks, including potential industrywide supply chain disruption and future tariffs, as reasons for pulling its guidance. Despite the tariff impact, Ford said it was "tracking" toward its initial guidance that included adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $7 billion to $8.5 billion.</p>

Several controllers went on medical leave following the outage, calling it a traumatic event.

Several senators have also pointed to other issues, arguing that the legislation lacks sufficient protections against money laundering. At the meeting on Thursday, Democrats raised a series of objections to the bill, pointing to Mr. Trump’s conflicts of interest, as well as language that would help overseas stablecoin firms evade some of the new rules.</p>
