          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the case of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, an effort to establish the nation's first religious charter school in Oklahoma. The justices appeared divided, with concerns raised about the separation of church and state and the potential impact on public education funding. Justices Alito and Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to the school's argument against religious discrimination, while liberal justices expressed worries about weakening the separation between church and state. The outcome could hinge on Chief Justice Roberts, with a decision expected by the end of June or early July. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board is considering rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords.
