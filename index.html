          <p>The UK's official Covid-19 inquiry has begun its examination of the pandemic's devastating effects on the social care sector. Bereaved families and care staff are seeking answers regarding critical decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes without testing, which is blamed for seeding the virus. The inquiry will also investigate issues like the use of blanket "do not resuscitate" orders and restrictive visiting policies that isolated residents. This phase aims to hold decision-makers accountable and learn lessons from what many consider one of the pandemic's most significant failures.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced significant concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could potentially "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season. He highlighted the relentless schedule and minimal rest periods for players as major issues that could lead to exhaustion and a disastrous campaign. While acknowledging the financial incentives and prestige of the tournament, Guardiola admitted he is trying not to dwell on the potential negative impact to avoid anxiety.

          <p>In Istanbul, Turkish police detained over 50 people and deployed a heavy presence to block the city's annual LGBTQ+ Pride parade, which authorities have banned since 2015. The governor justified the ban by claiming the event undermines social peace and family values, reflecting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's increasingly hostile stance toward the LGBTQ+ community. Despite the official prohibition and police actions, activists attempted to march with rainbow flags, asserting their right to exist and protest. Human rights groups warn that the government's rhetoric is fostering a climate of discrimination and violence.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, a decision that followed hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him.

In his announcement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanships and independent thinking in Washington, stating he was not excited about navigating another six years of political gridlock.

The obsession is also being pursued in the lab, where a $15 million de-extinction project aims to resurrect the thylacine by editing the DNA of its closest living relative.

          <p>The U.S. military is grappling with a significant security vulnerability posed by mysterious drone swarms repeatedly flying over sensitive installations, including Langley Air Force Base. These incursions, involving drones ranging from commercial quadcopters to car-sized objects, have exposed gaps in NORAD's detection capabilities, which are designed for high-altitude threats. The incidents have forced the relocation of advanced fighter jets and sparked a debate over whether the drones are operated by hobbyists or represent a sophisticated intelligence-gathering effort by a foreign adversary. Officials are now rushing to develop new counter-drone technologies and policies.</p>

          <p>Renowned German filmmaker Werner Herzog, now 82, continues to create distinctive films that explore the edges of human sanity and the indifference of nature. A recent profile examines his six-decade career, marked by a relentless and often extreme pursuit of his artistic vision, such as physically hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo." Herzog, who describes his approach as requiring "good criminal energy," believes his prose will outlive his films and continues to teach his unconventional methods to aspiring filmmakers, emphasizing grit and real-life experience over formal training.</p>

MPs also criticized the product as overly complex due to its dual purpose and noted that its rules unfairly penalize individuals who may be eligible for state benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his intention to impose heavy tariffs, potentially 25%, on automobiles imported from Japan, showing no willingness to compromise despite ongoing negotiations. In a recent interview, Trump stated that the current trade relationship is unfair because Japan does not accept enough U.S. cars while exporting millions to the American market. This hardline stance comes as a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs nears its expiration, signaling potential new friction in trade relations between the two key allies.

          <p>Following a fatal crash, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's reputation for safety is under scrutiny, with renewed attention on persistent whistleblower allegations about its manufacturing. For years, current and former employees have raised concerns about quality control at Boeing's South Carolina plant, claiming that pressure to speed up production led to the use of substandard parts and improper assembly. While Boeing insists the aircraft is safe and has a strong service history, critics argue that these unresolved production issues could pose hidden risks to the more than 1,100 Dreamliners currently in service worldwide.</p>
