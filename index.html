          <p>President Trump announced his intention to reopen and significantly expand Alcatraz prison to house "America's most ruthless and violent offenders." He stated that this move would symbolize law, order, and justice, citing frustrations with judges who insist on due process for those being deported. Alcatraz, a former maximum-security prison, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs and became a popular national park. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioned the practicality of reopening the prison, given its current status as a tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, claiming that the American movie industry is dying due to incentives offered by other nations.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has implemented tariffs on various countries, aiming to boost U.S. manufacturers and protect jobs, though these actions have caused global economic instability.

          <h2>Experts Caution Women About Over-Reliance on Egg Freezing</h2>

          <p>As egg freezing gains popularity, some experts caution women against relying on it as a guaranteed solution for delaying motherhood. Vardit Ravitsky emphasizes that egg freezing is costly, lacks guarantees, and sends the wrong message about reproductive certainty. Stories like Evelyn Gosnell's, where multiple cycles yielded no viable embryos, highlight the risks. Fertility specialists stress that egg freezing is a gamble with financial and medical costs, and that society should instead support policies like paid parental leave to enable women to have children at younger ages.</p>

Despite a slight decrease from the previous year's proportion, family assistance remains higher than most years since 2013. First-time buyers are leveraging family support to secure better mortgage deals amid challenging lending conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed executive orders targeting several law firms, potentially destroying them due to their opposition to him. These lawsuits have served as a check on the president's power. The orders threaten to bar attorneys from courthouses and federal agencies, and cancel contracts of law firm clients. Nine major firms made a deal with the White House, agreeing to provide nearly $1 billion in legal services to causes supported by the firms and Trump. Critics argue Trump's actions violate constitutional rights to free speech, due process, and the right to counsel.</p>

          <p>A recent 60 Minutes segment highlighted the increasing popularity of egg freezing, while also exploring its high costs. Correspondent Lesley Stahl visited a fertility clinic to witness the egg retrieval process and interviewed women about their experiences. Experts emphasized that egg freezing does not guarantee success, and the procedure can be financially burdensome, especially for those without insurance coverage. The average cost for a single cycle ranges from $12,000 to $13,000, and additional cycles may be recommended to increase the chances of success.
