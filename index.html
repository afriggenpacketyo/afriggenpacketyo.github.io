          <p>Germany has allowed two Taliban envoys into the country to handle consular tasks, primarily to facilitate the deportation of Afghan migrants with criminal records or failed asylum claims. This move occurs despite Germany, like most of the international community, not formally recognizing the Taliban government due to its human rights record. Chancellor Friedrich Merz stressed that this does not constitute diplomatic recognition, but is a "technical contact" to manage deportations, a contentious issue amid the rise of far-right politics in the country. The United Nations has criticized the deportations, citing ongoing human rights violations in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group announced it has accumulated approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and related digital assets, which now constitute about two-thirds of the company's liquid assets. This move reflects President Trump's increasing embrace of cryptocurrency, a pivot that has significantly grown his personal net worth while in office. The company's stock, trading as DJT, saw a rise following the news. Critics and ethics experts raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as the president could profit from policies he is actively promoting to make the U.S. a global crypto hub.

          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller claimed that former President Biden's use of an autopen for official documents enabled policies that allowed a "sadistic criminal underclass" to enter the U.S. This statement connects the controversy over Biden's alleged autopen use to the Trump administration's hardline immigration stance, citing a recent case of an illegal immigrant suspect in a crime. The comments are part of a broader Republican narrative questioning the legitimacy of Biden's executive actions and his mental fitness during his presidency.

          <p>This article provides guidance for individuals considering investing $20,000 in short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) this month. It notes that current market conditions have inverted the typical rate structure, with short-term CDs often offering higher interest rates than long-term ones. Savers should consider that CDs can offer protection against market volatility and that the highest rates are often found at online banks rather than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. However, it also points out that despite lower rates, long-term CDs may yield more interest over their full term. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece traces the racist origins of the 1929 law that first criminalized unauthorized entry, linking it to eugenics and white supremacist ideology.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's trade war and the uncertainty surrounding tariffs are disproportionately harming smaller and secondary U.S. ports from California to the Gulf Coast. Shippers are rerouting cargo to larger ports like Los Angeles to ensure goods arrive before potential tariff deadlines, causing a significant drop in container volume at ports such as Oakland, Jacksonville, and New Orleans. This "market recalibration" is leading to concerns about job losses and economic instability in the regions served by these smaller ports. The trend is expected to continue as long as trade policy remains unpredictable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with high credit card debt, a debt management program can be a viable solution, but enrollment is not automatic. This article details three primary requirements potential candidates must meet. First, an individual must have a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and the new consolidated monthly payment. Second, the debt must be primarily unsecured (like credit cards or personal loans) and fall within the program's minimum and maximum limits. Finally, the person must be willing to commit to the program's rules, which often includes closing credit accounts and participating in financial counseling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has overturned the conviction of Pedro Hernandez for the 1979 murder of six-year-old Etan Patz, ordering a new trial or his release. The disappearance of Patz became one of America's most infamous missing child cases. Hernandez was convicted in 2017 based largely on confessions he made to police, but the appeals court ruled that the trial judge gave the jury improper instructions regarding the voluntariness of those confessions. The court found this error violated established federal law and was not harmless, giving Hernandez a chance to challenge the charges again.</p>

          <p>This analytical article argues that President Trump, in his second term, has moved beyond rhetoric to wage a comprehensive war against the free press using all available government tools. The author details a strategy that includes defunding public broadcasting, filing multi-billion dollar lawsuits against news organizations, and appointing a loyalist to head the FCC. These actions, combined with pressure on journalists and rescinding protections for reporters, are described as a "slow-motion demolition of the Fourth Estate." The piece expresses concern over the lack of significant pushback and the potential for long-term damage to media freedom.</p>

Second, he recommends maintaining eye contact and standing your ground, as sharks prefer to ambush unsuspecting prey. As a final resort, de Gelder advises pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose to drive it away, rather than punching it.</p>
