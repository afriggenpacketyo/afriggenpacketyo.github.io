          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced plans to shift its primary listing to the U.S., a move that will establish a dual listing with a secondary presence in London. This decision presents a setback for the London Stock Exchange, as Wise will move its main listing hub to the U.S. The company stated that this change would allow its shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, potentially increasing its access to capital and investors. Shares of Wise experienced an increase of almost 11% following the announcement, reflecting positive market sentiment. </p>

This action is part of Beijing's broader effort to crack down on entities it views as supporting Taiwanese independence. Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for the mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), identified Shen Tu-cheng, Puma Shen's father, as the leader of Sicuens International Co Ltd. The TAO alleges that the company engaged in trade relations with mainland Chinese enterprises to seek economic benefits, which Beijing will not permit for supporters of Taiwan independence. </p>

Yuan, who founded a real estate company in Tokyo in 2021, had acquired the Fuji Sansuikan Hotel and invested in a mineral water factory in Japan.

Musk has been vocal about his concerns regarding America's national debt, which exceeds $36 trillion, warning that the country is heading towards "debt slavery."

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation blocking foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University, citing concerns that the institution is "no longer a trustworthy steward" of international students. Trump invoked the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit the entry of noncitizens for at least six months, arguing that Harvard has refused to provide information about international students and has "extensive entanglements with foreign countries." The proclamation also directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. studying at Harvard, which justified the move by claiming that crime rates have "drastically risen" at the school. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is launching an unprecedented crusade against legal immigrants, implementing tactics that are lawless and cruel. Actions include banning refugee resettlement, revoking temporary protected status, and eliminating the legal status of international students. The author argues that Trump consistently works to block as many pathways to legal migration as possible, retroactively canceling the CBP One app program, which had allowed vulnerable people to apply for asylum legally. The author contends that cruelty itself is a tactic to scare immigrants away, as the administration invents new horrors and centrist Democrats tacitly approve the human rights violations. </p>

The author ultimately concludes that Twain's impact on the American view of France remains significant, even if the modern traveler's experience differs from Twain's. </p>

The study undermines claims that children are virtually impervious to COVID and cannot transmit the infection to adults.

          <p>Caroline Fraser's "Murderland" chronicles the serial-killer epidemic in the U.S. during the 1970s and '80s, focusing on Seattle and Tacoma, where Ted Bundy was raised. The book structures its narrative chronologically, evoking the Pacific Northwest’s woodsy tang and bland suburbia. Fraser depicts Bundy and his bloody brotherhood with similar flair, but she reveals an uncanny pattern of polluting smelters and the men brought up in their shadows, prone to mood swings and erratic tantrums. Fraser's writing is vivid and dynamic, making it difficult to look away from the disturbing narrative. </p>

          <p>One of Southern California's largest harmful algae blooms has ended, providing respite for marine mammals, but scientists warn the coastal ecosystem isn't entirely clear. This year's bloom, fueled by nutrient-rich waters, was the worst since 2015-16, killing hundreds of dolphins and sea lions. Researchers are investigating whether runoff from January's firestorms contributed to the bloom's intensity. The outbreak was particularly deadly for breeding females, with domoic acid crossing the placenta, and experts are concerned about the long-term environmental impact. </p>

The Times confirmed at least two individuals were placed there by immigration officials recently. Glendale City Council members defended the detentions, citing an 18-year-old contract to temporarily house noncriminal detainees, which they claim complies with state Senate Bill 54. Advocates fear this arrangement exploits a loophole in state sanctuary laws and are urging the city to abandon the contract, which was signed in 2007 and promises Glendale $85 a day for each detainee. </p>

Local real estate agents suggest the slow process of navigating insurance claims is the only thing keeping more lots from selling.

          <p>A contributor challenges the narrative of the "China shock," arguing that trade with China did not wreck the U.S. economy. The author cites a comprehensive review by an American Enterprise Institute scholar, Scott Winship, who contends that the negative effects of trade with China have been significantly exaggerated. Winship's analysis suggests that even if the original estimates are accepted, the employment effects were relatively modest and do not convincingly explain community decline. The author concludes that the real "shock" America faces in 2025 is from a resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem. </p>

This includes checking policy limits, deductibles, and assessing the need for flood insurance, as homeowners policies typically do not cover flood damage. It's important to review policy limits, which represent the highest amount the insurance company will pay for a covered loss or damage, to ensure they would cover the cost of rebuilding the home.
