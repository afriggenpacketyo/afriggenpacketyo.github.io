          <p>British newspapers highlight the UK's acquisition of new fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons, seen as a significant expansion of the country's deterrent capabilities amidst global tensions. The papers also cover Donald Trump's strong language regarding the Israel-Iran conflict and domestic political strife, including Labour MPs' opposition to welfare reforms. Other stories include the Bezos wedding and concerns over illegal food delivery riders, reflecting a mix of international and domestic issues shaping the news cycle. Some editorials stress the increasing precariousness of global peace and the need for serious diplomatic efforts in the Middle East.

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded the New York City Democratic mayoral primary to state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani after early results showed Mamdani with a significant lead. Cuomo, who resigned from the governorship in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations, acknowledged Mamdani's successful campaign and appeal to younger voters. Despite conceding, Cuomo indicated he might consider an independent run in the November general election on a "Fight and Deliver" ballot line. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, campaigned on a progressive platform focused on economic issues like rent freezes and fare-free buses.</p>

          <p>A BBC report reveals that some sexcam studios in Colombia are targeting underage girls, recruiting them with promises of easy money. Models described being pressured to perform sexual acts, given fake IDs, and exploited by unscrupulous studio owners.

The industry's growth is fueled by poverty, with many models supporting their families, but some face long hours, low pay, and degrading conditions, prompting calls for stricter regulations and better protection for performers.</p>

          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after Apricity Fertility, a popular online firm, went bust, leaving many without treatment or refunds. These clinics act as middlemen between patients, donors, and doctors, but are not regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The HFEA is calling for stronger laws to protect patients, as these clinics do not provide IVF treatment directly. Patients like Syreeta Sandhu and Beth Rodgers lost thousands of pounds and valuable time when Apricity ceased operations, highlighting the risks of using unregulated services.</p>

          <p>Australian journalist Antoinette Lattouf won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf claimed the ABC cut short her stint as a fill-in radio presenter due to her political views and race after lobbying from pro-Israel groups. The ABC initially argued her post breached its editorial policy, but the court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. The ABC has since apologized to Lattouf and was ordered to pay damages.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers reached a tentative agreement on a $321.1-billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal reflects resistance to the governor's proposed cuts to reduce a $12-billion budget deficit, with lawmakers relying on borrowing, reserves, and shifting funds. Key elements include a housing caveat requiring CEQA exemptions and changes to Medi-Cal funding, such as premiums for undocumented immigrants and asset limits for beneficiaries. The agreement is expected to lead to more challenging financial discussions in the months ahead, with potential federal funding losses and future deficits anticipated.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts noted that Conforto's struggles have stemmed from difficulty hitting fastballs, which he addressed in this game.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a self-described socialist, won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, defeating former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's campaign focused on the high cost of living, advocating for free buses, free childcare, and a higher minimum wage, funded by taxes on the wealthy. The primary result is a blow for Cuomo, who was attempting a political comeback from a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani's victory indicates the type of leader Democrats are seeking during Donald Trump's second term, attracting endorsements from prominent progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders.</p>
