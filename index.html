          <p>A nine-year BBC investigation, which included secret filming, played a crucial role in exposing a £28 million timeshare fraud that victimized over 3,500 people, primarily the elderly. The company, Sell My Timeshare (SMT), used high-pressure tactics to sell worthless "credits" while its owners funded a lavish lifestyle. The extensive investigation culminated in the conviction of 14 individuals, including the company's head, Mark Rowe, bringing a measure of justice to the numerous victims who lost significant sums of money. The journalistic evidence was instrumental for the police and prosecutors in securing the convictions.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, the co-founder of the betting company Betfred, has warned that a potential increase in gambling taxes by UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves could force the closure of all 1,287 of its high street shops. Such a move would jeopardize approximately 7,500 jobs and represents the "biggest threat" to the industry in his 57-year career. The warning comes as the government considers raising taxes on the sector to fund public services, a proposal that the industry argues would push customers towards unregulated offshore betting markets.

          <p>North Korea is actively strengthening its relationships with Southeast Asian nations, particularly Vietnam and Laos, in a strategic effort to find new allies and circumvent international sanctions. High-level visits, including the first by a Vietnamese leader in 18 years, signal a diplomatic victory for Pyongyang, which seeks to boost cooperation in defense and other sectors. While these countries share some political ideologies, analysts note that their economic systems differ significantly. The deepening ties provide North Korea with potential corridors for illicit trade and revenue, though partners risk international scrutiny for aiding in sanctions evasion.</p>

          <p>Over the past four decades, China has made remarkable progress in combating the expansion of the Mu Us Desert in the Ningxia region. Through extensive sand control and afforestation efforts at the Baijitan National Nature Reserve, the desert has been pushed back by more than 20 kilometers, safeguarding the provincial capital of Yinchuan. The project has stabilized vast areas of drifting sands and reclaimed thousands of hectares of land that were once threatened by desertification. This long-term environmental initiative highlights a major success in ecological restoration and land management.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of committing "murder" and violating his country's sovereignty following a US military strike on a boat in Colombian waters. Petro stated the victim was a fisherman named Alejandro Carranza, whose vessel was adrift with a distress signal. The accusation came after former President Donald Trump confirmed a strike on what he called a "drug-carrying submarine," an action part of a broader, controversial US clampdown on alleged "narcoterrorists" in the region. The incident has escalated diplomatic tensions, with Colombia demanding an explanation from the US government.</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on civilians within Gaza, which it states would be a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement. Washington has informed other mediators and cautioned that measures would be taken to protect Gazans if the attack proceeds, a claim Hamas denies. The situation remains tense as the ceasefire's first phase continues, which has included the release of living hostages and the return of deceased ones.

Harris argues that excluding the nation's leading EV manufacturer, likely due to Musk's anti-union stance, was a political error that alienated a key innovator in the field. The snub was widely seen as a gesture of support for the United Auto Workers union, and Harris suggests in her book that Musk "never forgave" the administration for it.</p>

The article details how his absence has negatively affected the team's ability to build up play from the back and bypass high-pressing opponents. Specifically, the team misses his exceptional long-passing range and ambidextrous skill, which were crucial for switching the point of attack. New signings are still integrating, but the loss of Alexander-Arnold's unique tactical contributions appears to be a significant factor in their current form.</p>

          <p>The 20th-ranked USC Trojans suffered a significant setback to their College Football Playoff hopes with a 34-24 loss to the 13th-ranked Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The game, played in heavy rain, was marked by costly mistakes for USC, including critical turnovers and questionable play-calling from coach Lincoln Riley. Notre Dame's dominant rushing attack, which amassed 306 yards, exploited USC's defensive weaknesses. The loss was particularly poignant as it may have been the final meeting in the century-long rivalry between the two historic programs.</p>

          <h2>Major Southern California Freeway Temporarily Closed for Military Live-Fire Demonstration</h2>

          <p>A section of the heavily trafficked I-5 Freeway in Southern California was closed for several hours on Saturday for a live-fire military exercise at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance. The event, an "Amphibious Capabilities Demonstration" marking the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, prompted the closure due to what state officials called an "extreme life safety risk." The decision created a political dispute, with California's governor criticizing the Trump administration for what he termed an "absurd show of force" that disregarded public safety and caused major travel disruptions.</p>
