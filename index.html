          <p>Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that did not meet analyst expectations. The shortfall was primarily attributed to declining same-store sales for both its major chains within the United States. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.44 per share on revenue of $1.93 billion, slightly underperforming against forecasts. These results highlight the competitive challenges and shifting consumer preferences facing the fast-food giant in its domestic market, leading to a period of financial underperformance.

          <p>The recent primary victory of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has sparked a significant increase in interest among young progressives to run for political office. Run for Something, an organization that supports younger candidates, reported its largest-ever organic surge in sign-ups following Mamdani's win. Aspiring candidates cite his campaign's focus on issues like cost of living and housing, as well as his authentic, voter-first approach, as a source of inspiration. This phenomenon, dubbed the "Mamdani effect," suggests a growing desire for a different style of politics centered on community needs rather than traditional party structures.</p>

It contrasts Kohberger's case with that of Charles Whitman, the 1966 Texas tower sniper, whose autopsy revealed a brain tumor, complicating moral judgment. The author argues that while not excusing the crime, understanding the biological and environmental factors behind violent behavior is crucial for prevention, rather than simply resorting to the label of evil.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released over $5 billion in federal education funds after a four-week freeze sparked significant backlash from educators and lawmakers across the political spectrum. The funding, which supports programs for teacher training, after-school activities, and English-learners, was initially withheld for a review into alleged misuse for a "radical left-wing agenda." However, pressure from both rural and urban school districts, along with Republican and Democratic officials, led to the reversal. The episode highlights the political challenges of cutting popular education programs, even in areas that strongly support the president.</p>

          <p>Despite successful high-speed rail networks in Europe and Asia, the United States continues to lag significantly in developing this mode of transportation. The article attributes this failure to a historical shift towards automobiles, compounded by complex regulations that make large-scale infrastructure projects difficult to execute. California's ambitious project to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, for instance, has been plagued by soaring costs and delays. However, some hope exists with private ventures like Brightline, which is operating in Florida and planning a line from California to Las Vegas, suggesting a potential path forward for high-speed rail in the country.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Israel's policy of restricting humanitarian aid to Gaza, while morally questionable, has also proven to be a significant strategic misstep. The policy, intended to pressure Hamas, has instead strengthened the group's negotiating position and alienated key international allies like the U.S., U.K., and France. The resulting hunger crisis has generated global outrage, forcing Israel to unilaterally ease restrictions without gaining concessions from Hamas. The article posits that Prime Minister Netanyahu's dependence on far-right coalition partners, who advocate for harsh policies, has led him to pursue a strategy detrimental to Israel's long-term security and diplomatic standing.</p>

          <p>Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich argues that President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner has destroyed the credibility of a vital government agency. Reich explains that the BLS's independence is crucial for providing trusted, non-politicized data about the U.S. economy. Trump's action, prompted by a jobs report he disliked, sets a dangerous precedent where data must please the president to be considered valid. Reich views this as part of a broader pattern of attacking fact-based institutions, from the EPA to the CDC, in an effort to control information and obscure the truth.</p>

          <p>A recent episode of a documentary series from China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) showcased a simulated, full-scale amphibious assault on Taiwan. The footage depicted a complex military operation involving paratroopers, infiltrating frogmen, and unmanned units breaching beach defenses, all tactics relevant to a potential invasion of the island. The episode appears to incorporate footage from previous live-fire exercises conducted around Taiwan. This public display of military capability comes as Beijing continues to assert its claim over the self-governing island, which it vows to unify with the mainland, by force if necessary.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands has announced it will be the first NATO ally to purchase U.S. weapons for Ukraine under a new cost-sharing mechanism. The Dutch government is contributing €500 million for the acquisition of Patriot missile parts and other defense systems to support Ukraine's frontline efforts. This new scheme, called the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), was announced last month by President Trump and NATO's Secretary-General. It allows NATO allies to fund the procurement of U.S. defense equipment, which is then transferred to Ukraine, ensuring continued military support while distributing the financial burden among partners.</p>

          <p>South Korea has started removing the loudspeakers used to broadcast anti-Pyongyang propaganda across the demilitarized zone, a significant step in the new liberal government's efforts to ease tensions. The broadcasts, which include everything from K-pop music to weather reports, have been a source of friction for decades and were suspended in June. President Lee Jae Myung's administration has framed reconciliation as an economic benefit, aiming to reduce the geopolitical risk associated with the Korean peninsula. However, with relations at a low point, it is uncertain if this gesture alone will lead to a diplomatic breakthrough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's proposal to rescind the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding" is a radical assault on all federal climate policy. This finding, which concludes that greenhouse gases harm human health, is the legal foundation for regulations on vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas facilities. The author contends the administration is using strained legal and scientific arguments to dismantle this cornerstone, effectively repudiating the federal government's authority to limit emissions. This move is seen as an attempt to paralyze climate action for years, even if it is eventually defeated in court.</p>

Ramsey, who is Emmy-nominated for the role, describes how stepping into the lead required extensive stunt training and a deeper exploration of their character, Ellie. A key part of Ellie's evolution was her burgeoning relationship with Dina and the protective instincts it fostered. As the first out nonbinary actor to receive multiple Emmy nominations, Ramsey hopes their visibility helps other gender-nonconforming people feel seen.</p>

          <p>California has filed 37 lawsuits against the Trump administration in the first seven months of the president's second term, spending approximately $5 million on litigation. Attorney General Rob Bonta stated that for every dollar spent, the state has protected $33,600 in federal funding that the administration attempted to block. These funds are designated for essential services like education, healthcare, and disaster recovery. Bonta and Governor Gavin Newsom framed the lawsuits as a necessary defense of both California's funding and its core values of inclusivity and equity against ideological attacks from the federal government.</p>

          <p>An economic analysis from the Los Angeles Times suggests that recent positive GDP figures may be misleading, with underlying data pointing towards a potential recession. The article argues that after factoring out the short-term distortions from President Trump's tariff policies, economic growth is significantly weaker than headline numbers suggest. The weak July jobs report and downward revisions for previous months are cited as clear signs of a rapidly deteriorating labor market. The piece concludes that the combination of slowing growth and rising inflation presents a difficult challenge for the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) plans to enter negotiations with federal agencies after the Trump administration froze approximately $339 million in research grants. The freeze, affecting research in fields like neuroscience and cancer, was linked to a Justice Department finding that UCLA acted with "deliberate indifference" to antisemitism on campus. While UCLA leaders have expressed hope for a solution through dialogue, they have not ruled out a potential lawsuit. Hundreds of faculty members are urging the university to take a more aggressive stance and challenge what they call the administration's illegitimate demands.</p>
