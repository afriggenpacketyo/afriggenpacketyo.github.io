          <p>China is actively promoting the yuan for international use as confidence in the U.S. dollar wanes, aiming to challenge the dollar's dominance despite its current global predominance. Recent initiatives include establishing a digital yuan internationalization center in Shanghai and encouraging yuan-denominated futures trading. While Beijing has relaxed some restrictions for foreign investors, concerns about capital controls and geopolitical risks persist, potentially hindering widespread adoption of the yuan. These efforts reflect a broader trend of de-dollarization, particularly in trade settlements and lending to emerging markets, though the yuan's global usage still lags significantly behind the U.S. dollar.

Lattouf had shared a post from Human Rights Watch critical of Israel, which the ABC claimed breached its editorial policy. The ABC has apologized for its handling of the matter and the court awarded Lattouf damages.</p>

However, some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. Officials caution that this is an early assessment and could change as more information becomes available, although the White House has disputed these findings.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle (EV) charger infrastructure. Judge Tana Lin granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states' lawsuit against the Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding.</p>

          <p>Three men drowned after diving into Rattlesnake Falls in Soda Springs, California, and their bodies have been recovered. The victims were identified as Matthew Schoenecker, Valentino Creus, and Matthew Anthony. Creus hesitated before jumping, and Schoenecker and Anthony attempted to rescue him, resulting in all three drowning. The recovery efforts were hampered by poor underwater visibility and strong winds, and a non-profit dive team discovered the bodies.</p>

          <p>The FBI is increasing its focus on counter-terrorism efforts following recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Immigration officials have arrested several Iranian citizens in the U.S., some with alleged ties to Iran's military and paramilitary groups. The FBI is reassigning agents from immigration-related cases to counter-terrorism efforts, and the Department of Homeland Security has communicated with state and local law enforcement agencies regarding the heightened threat environment. While there is no specific threat, officials are on heightened alert and monitoring potential risks.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have found that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing clues about star formation. By studying thousands of stars, researchers discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides direct evidence that the Milky Way's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>
