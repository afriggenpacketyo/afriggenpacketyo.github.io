          <p>Former President Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, labeling him as "highly conflicted." This call follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton to Intel's chairman, which raised concerns about Tan's investment ties to Chinese businesses, including some allegedly connected to the Chinese military. The senator's letter also highlighted that a company previously led by Tan had pleaded guilty to illegally exporting technology to a Chinese military university. Intel's stock experienced a decline in pre-market trading following the president's statement.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will allow alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies, to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The order directs the Department of Labor to review its guidance on these investments under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). This move is seen as a significant win for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for inclusion in defined-contribution plans. While proponents argue this could offer diversification, these assets are often considered riskier due to higher fees and less transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists in Pompeii have uncovered new evidence indicating that survivors of the 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to the devastated city. Contrary to the belief that the area was completely abandoned, it appears some residents established an informal settlement amid the ruins. These individuals lived in "precarious conditions," converting the ground floors of old houses into workshops with ovens and mills. This discovery challenges the long-held narrative that focused solely on the city's destruction, revealing a more complex story of survival and adaptation after the cataclysmic event.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced its key interest rate to 4%, a move that will have varied effects on household finances. Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages may see their monthly payments decrease, offering some financial relief. Conversely, savers will likely face lower returns on their deposits, as banks are expected to reduce the interest paid on savings accounts. The central bank's decision aims to stimulate spending and manage the economy, even as it forecasts a temporary rise in inflation later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The leaders pledged to double their bilateral trade turnover, which has already surged to $11.5 billion since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This growing relationship tests the UAE's long-standing alliance with the United States, as Abu Dhabi continues to serve as a key economic hub for Russia, helping it circumvent Western sanctions. The U.S. has expressed frustration but has so far refrained from imposing punitive measures on the UAE for its actions.</p>

The lawmakers fled to prevent a quorum and block a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan that could significantly favor the GOP in upcoming elections. Governor Greg Abbott had already ordered state law enforcement to find and arrest the legislators to compel their return to the state capitol. The involvement of federal law enforcement escalates the political standoff over the controversial redistricting efforts.</p>

          <p>Rushanara Ali, the UK's homelessness minister, is under pressure to resign following allegations of "staggering hypocrisy" related to a rental property she owns. Reports claim that shortly after tenants were given notice that their lease would not be renewed, the property was re-listed with a rent increase of £700 per month. Critics, including the Conservative Party chairman and housing charities, argue her actions contradict her public stance on protecting tenants from exploitation. A spokesperson for Ali stated that she complied with all legal requirements during the process.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the ideological force behind the Trump administration's broad tariff strategy, arguing it is driven by nostalgia for the manufacturing-heavy economy of the 1950s and '60s. Rather than strategically protecting specific high-value industries, the policies aim to reshore all types of manufacturing, which could paradoxically make the U.S. less competitive in advanced sectors. The right-wing nationalist movement associates the post-war era with social stability and high wage growth, viewing deindustrialization as a source of national decline. However, the article contends that trying to resurrect this economic past is an unrealistic fantasy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the function of tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, in the context of the Trump administration's recent trade policies. Tariffs typically increase the prices of both foreign and domestic products for consumers, as seen with previous duties on washing machines. While governments can use tariffs to generate revenue or protect nascent domestic industries, the administration's broad and high tariffs are likely to have a wider economic impact. Economists estimate the policies could significantly reduce the disposable income of an average U.S. household. (not investment advice)</p>

The Trump administration included the value of gold passing through Switzerland in its trade deficit calculations, which significantly inflated the imbalance. Swiss officials and economists argue this is misleading, as refiners only earn a small processing fee, while the vast majority of the value belongs to the gold itself.

          <p>Following a presidential executive order to allow alternative investments in 401(k)s, financial advisors are raising concerns about the potential risks for average investors. While proponents argue that private assets like equity and cryptocurrency could offer diversification and higher returns, experts warn they are complex, less transparent, and carry higher fees than traditional investments. Some advisors worry that unsophisticated investors may not understand the risks involved. The move is expected to be a slow process, likely starting with small allocations within professionally managed target-date funds. (not investment advice)</p>
