        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, amounting to $26 billion, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and reduced production, despite slightly surpassing analyst expectations. The company's free cash flow also experienced a downturn, falling from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion compared to the same period last year. While the base dividend increased by 4.2% to $21.1 billion, the performance-linked dividend payout was significantly reduced to $200 million. These figures indicate ongoing financial pressures for the Saudi state oil giant amidst sluggish crude prices and slowing global demand.</p>

          <p>The newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has appointed several individuals directly from the business world to top cabinet positions, sparking concerns about potential lobbying influences. Critics point to the new minister of economic affairs and energy, Katherina Reiche, who previously worked for energy companies, and the new minister for digitalization and state modernization, Karsten Wildberger, formerly CEO of an electronics retail group. While lobbying is regulated in Germany through the Lobby Register, experts argue that existing rules may not effectively curtail conflicts of interest, particularly for cabinet members who are not elected members of parliament.</p>

This announcement came shortly after leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland jointly visited Ukraine to declare that Russia would face severe sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if Putin did not agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. Putin proposed a meeting between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without specifying who would participate, though there was no immediate response from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Significant cuts to USAID funding by the Trump administration are severely impacting healthcare programs across Africa, leading to a loss of access to medication for HIV patients and the halting of vital healthcare services. These cuts have resulted in a substantial reduction in budgets for organizations like Amref Health Africa, which has been forced to cancel educational programs and reduce tuberculosis screenings. Experts fear that millions more could die from treatable diseases due to the funding shortfall, with the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis particularly affected.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting for a second day of negotiations in Geneva, aiming to ease tensions stemming from President Trump's trade war. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. Despite Trump's optimistic statements about progress, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal, noting that even with reduced tariffs, the overall effective tariff rate would still be significantly higher than before.</p>

          <h2>Embracing Imperfection: A Psychiatrist's Message to Mothers This Mother's Day</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 01:00:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior staff psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, Mathilde Ross, argues that the pressure on mothers to be perfect is harmful and unrealistic, and that being flawed is an essential part of motherhood. She notes that psychiatry has historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, overlooking their crucial contributions. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack, reassuring them that they are good enough and highlighting the importance of imperfection in teaching children to accept their own flaws. The article serves as a reminder that mothers do not need to be perfect to be good parents.</p>
