          <p>Civilians in northern Gaza are struggling with severe food shortages as aid is not reaching the area, with families subsisting on a single meal per day and lacking essential resources like clean water and cooking gas. Residents report that while some food has begun to trickle into Gaza after an 11-week blockade, it is not reaching the northern part of the region. The UN has criticized the new food distribution system, stating it enables Israel to control the population through food scarcity, while residents also face the danger of being killed while trying to reach food distribution sites in southern Gaza. With limited access to resources, families are resorting to desperate measures like grinding pasta and lentils to make bread, highlighting the dire conditions in the area.</p>

          <p>The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is holding a confirmation hearing for Michael Boren, President Trump's nominee to lead the U.S. Forest Service, despite his history of conflicts with the agency. Boren, an investment consultant and ranch owner, has faced disputes with the Forest Service over building a cabin, clearing land, diverting a stream, and managing land within the Sawtooth National Forest. His nomination comes at a time of turmoil within the agency, including the removal of environmental protections and staff reductions. If confirmed, Boren would be responsible for day-to-day operations at the U.S. Forest Service, managing over 200 million acres of public land.</p>

          <p>Five aid workers were killed in an attack on a convoy in Sudan's Darfur region, preventing food deliveries to families facing starvation, according to UN agencies. The 15-truck convoy was attacked near the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)-controlled town of Koma, resulting in multiple trucks being burned and critical humanitarian supplies damaged. UNICEF and the World Food Programme condemned the attack, calling for an investigation and emphasizing that it violates international humanitarian law. The aid agencies said the convoy was trying to access el-Fasher city, one of the last strongholds of the Sudanese military in Darfur, amid ongoing conflict between the RSF and the Sudanese military-controlled government.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after Geert Wilders withdrew his far-right party from the governing coalition due to disagreements over migration policies. Wilders pushed for additional asylum measures, including freezing applications and limiting family reunification, which led to the coalition's dissolution. Former coalition partners have accused Wilders of engineering the crisis for political gain, while Wilders aims to become prime minister and increase his party's influence in future elections. The collapse has had minimal immediate economic impact, and the government will remain in a caretaker capacity until new elections are held, likely in the autumn.</p>

          <p>The CDC is urging the tracking of a new norovirus strain, GII.17, after its emergence disrupted the typical seasonal pattern of outbreaks. Last year's norovirus season started in October due to GII.17, which now dominates over 75% of U.S. outbreaks. Researchers are uncertain if GII.17 will continue to cause earlier onsets of the norovirus season. Several other countries have also seen unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus, raising concerns about potential future outbreaks.</p>

The think tank noted that while UK economic growth strengthened between January and March, "momentum is weakening" due to "deteriorating" business sentiment.
