          <p>On Memorial Day, former President Donald Trump released a message targeting his political adversaries, whom he accused of trying to undermine the country. Trump asserted that progress has been made in the last four months of his term and expressed hope that the Supreme Court would intervene against judges he described as dangerous. He also criticized the previous administration's border policies and judicial appointments. Trump's message reflects his ongoing frustration with legal challenges and his commitment to restoring America to its former greatness.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the development of sexual orientation, explaining that it is diverse and not a choice but rather a matter of fate influenced by biological and psychosocial factors during puberty. Experts emphasize that sexual preference remains stable after adolescence, despite social pressures. The article highlights that same-sex orientation accounts for about 3-5% of the population across cultures and condemns discrimination based on sexual orientation. It also touches on the interplay of genetic makeup, hormones, and social influences in shaping sexuality, underscoring that no single factor determines a person's sexual orientation.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's recent comments on the Gaza conflict signal increasing impatience from even Israel's closest allies. Britain, Canada, and France have also criticized Israel's actions, with Britain suspending trade negotiations. Trump's shift contrasts with his earlier support for Netanyahu. Despite continued military and economic aid, these countries are showing signs of losing patience, while Netanyahu remains defiant, accusing them of emboldening Hamas.

          <p>French journalist associations are urging the French government to assist in evacuating Palestinian journalists, fixers, and drivers who have been aiding news coverage in Gaza for the past 18 months.

The associations emphasize the mortal danger these individuals and their families face, particularly with potential Israeli control over Gaza.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on China and potential cuts to federal subsidies are posing a threat to the burgeoning U.S. battery industry. Domestic factories rely on Chinese components, and tariffs have already increased battery costs. Proposed budget cuts could restrict access to subsidies for rechargeable batteries, potentially hindering the industry's growth. The article highlights concerns from companies like LG Energy Solution and Tesla, which depend on Chinese batteries and components. The situation raises questions about the future of U.S. energy independence and the ability to meet rising power demand.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's strategy of "legalistic noncompliance," where it uses legal arguments to appear compliant with court orders while actually defying them. Examples include the Alien Enemies Act litigation and cases involving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This approach lowers the public salience of noncompliance and may lead to "legalized noncompliance," where courts issue rulings that allow the administration to appear compliant without meaningfully carrying out court orders. The author warns that this strategy undermines judicial oversight and poses a threat to the rule of law.</p>

Some US-headquartered firms have scaled back commitments and are less keen to publicly celebrate inclusion work. Despite these changes, experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act and legal risks associated with discrimination cases.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric are being used in Islamic State (IS) recruitment propaganda. IS is capitalizing on Trump's dismantling of the international order, his association with Benjamin Netanyahu, and the appointment of Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense. Hegseth's tattoos, which reference the Crusades, have been highlighted in IS propaganda as evidence of a "crusader" state. The group is also using the war in Gaza and international tariffs as recruitment tools, portraying the West as unraveling.</p>

          <p>Five years after anti-police protests, initiatives for officer mental health are gaining traction. Law enforcement agencies are creating wellness units and providing services to help officers cope with job-related stressors. The killing of George Floyd served as a catalyst, bringing the issue of police mental health to the forefront. There is an increased focus on education, peer support, and specialized treatment facilities to address the high rates of depression, burnout, and PTSD among officers. These efforts aim to reduce stigma and promote a culture of wellness within law enforcement.</p>
