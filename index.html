          <h2>Gazan Contributor Describes Systemic Dehumanization by Israeli Forces</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 15:01:00 EDT</div>

          <p>A contributor from Gaza's Al-Shati refugee camp recounts a personal history of systemic humiliation and dehumanization by the Israeli military, arguing it's a long-standing strategy. The article connects this historical context to the current conflict, citing starvation and violence as a culmination of policies that strip Palestinians of their humanity. Through personal anecdotes from family and friends still in Gaza, it portrays a society grappling with despair, the loss of dignity, and the struggle to maintain a sense of self amid widespread destruction and famine.</p>

          <p>During a joint press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump used the opportunity to extensively promote his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland, much to the apparent discomfort of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump praised the resort's opulent renovations while discussing unrelated matters, continuing a pattern of mixing business interests with international diplomacy. The event drew criticism, particularly as it followed revelations that the Scottish government was in talks to provide public funding for another of Trump's resorts, and that UK officials had inquired about hosting the Open championship at Turnberry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CVS Caremark has removed the popular weight-loss drug Zepbound from its preferred list as of July 1, requiring many patients to switch to Wegovy in a move driven by rising costs. This change has caused significant concern among patients who have had success with Zepbound and fear potential side effects or reduced efficacy from the alternative medication. While Zepbound is considered slightly more effective in clinical trials, the forced switch disrupts care continuity and highlights the powerful influence of pharmacy benefit managers on patient treatment options.</p>

          <p>China has offered to strengthen its economic partnership with Brazil, positioning itself as a defender of fair global trade just days before new U.S. tariffs on Brazilian exports are scheduled to take effect. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated Beijing's readiness to work with Brazil and other nations to uphold the multilateral trading system centered on the World Trade Organization. The statement specifically noted an interest in expanding aviation cooperation with Brazil, whose leading aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is heavily reliant on the U.S. market and faces potential instability from the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles luxury real estate market is showing significant strength, with five of the ten most expensive U.S. home sales in June located in California. The top sale was a Beverly Hills mansion flipped for $63 million to Paris Hilton and her husband, Carter Reum, which was previously owned by Mark Wahlberg. Real estate agents attribute the market's vitality to demand from buyers displaced by wildfires and increasing interest from foreign investors, particularly from China. This activity suggests a continuing robust trend in the high-end property sector of Beverly Hills and Bel Air.</p>

The resolution has drawn criticism for its leniency, especially as hundreds of protesters were arrested during the campus demonstrations with very few facing charges.

          <p>A comprehensive two-year study of over 2,100 older Americans has provided strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can significantly improve cognitive abilities. The POINTER study found that participants in an intensive program involving aerobic exercise, a Mediterranean diet, and cognitive training showed mental function scores comparable to people one to two years younger. These results suggest that structured lifestyle interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline, offering a clear path for improving brain health in aging populations and potentially delaying the onset of dementia.</p>

This structure grants enhanced voting rights to key insiders, including co-founder and CEO Kristo Käärmann. Despite disagreement from another co-founder over combining the two issues into a single vote, the proposal passed with a strong majority, and the US listing is expected in 2026.
