          <p>Gold prices have surged nearly 80% since early 2024, now approaching $3,700 per ounce, with predictions of reaching $4,000 this September. This article highlights three key factors driving this potential increase: anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, rising inflation currently at 2.9%, and general market uncertainty pushing investors towards safe-haven assets. These dynamics make gold an attractive investment for both current holders and new entrants seeking portfolio protection against economic fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly's experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, demonstrated superior efficacy in lowering blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide in a head-to-head Type 2 diabetes trial. Orforglipron achieved a 2.2% reduction in hemoglobin A1c and 9.2% average weight loss, surpassing the competitor's 1.4% and 5.3% respectively. While the results are promising for a needle-free GLP-1 alternative, experts note the comparison was against a lower dose of Novo Nordisk's drug, suggesting more data is needed for a definitive market leader. Eli Lilly plans to seek approval for orforglipron for Type 2 diabetes in 2026.</p>

          <p>The BBC documentary "Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home," which chronicles the rock legend's final years, has been rescheduled to air on October 2. Originally postponed shortly after his death at 76, the one-hour film covers Osbourne's return to the UK from Los Angeles with wife Sharon and his "heroic" effort to perform a farewell concert in Birmingham. The intimate portrait delves into the couple's five-decade relationship and their battle against his health problems, showcasing his determination and humor. The family requested the initial delay out of respect for their difficult time.</p>

          <p>Former Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno has labeled bribery charges, linking him to $76 million in payments from a Chinese state builder for a Belt and Road dam project, as a "farce." Moreno asserts the accusations are a political vendetta orchestrated by his predecessor, Rafael Correa, under whose government the Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric plant was contracted. The rivalry between the two has dominated Ecuadorian politics for nearly a decade. Moreno, now living in Paraguay, maintains the accusations rely on "old family acquaintances" with contractors and lack proof of wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is expanding the civics test for citizenship applicants, reinstating a 2020 version that the Biden administration had previously rescinded. This change, part of the Trump administration's effort to tighten legal immigration, requires applicants to study 128 questions and correctly answer 12 out of 20, up from 100 questions and 6 out of 10. This article notes other measures, like expanded "good moral character" scrutiny and "neighborhood checks," are also being reinstated to ensure applicants "fully embrace our values and principles as a nation."</p>

          <p>Workers across Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain are being advised to apply for universal credit due to layoffs and reduced pay following a cyber attack that halted the carmaker's production. The Unite union is calling for a government furlough scheme, similar to one in Scotland, to protect jobs. JLR has not commented on the union's claims, but production is not expected to resume before September 24, with some sources suggesting disruption could last until November. The cyber attack, which occurred over two weeks ago, is estimated to cost JLR at least £50 million weekly, raising concerns for its many dependent small and medium-sized suppliers.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters predict it will remain over open waters for several days, intensifying into a low-grade hurricane by the weekend, potentially reaching Bermuda next week.

Despite initial predictions for a busier-than-usual season, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated so far this year.

He warned against deepening divisions by identifying a singular "enemy" and using such tragedies to silence debate. Obama stressed the importance of discussing ideas honestly while respecting others' rights to differing viewpoints, despite personally disagreeing with Kirk's views.</p>

          <p>The IRS is anticipated to announce inflation adjustments for its 2026 federal income tax brackets, potentially offering financial relief to millions of American households. Experts project a 2.7% inflation rate will be applied, with the bottom two tax brackets seeing a larger, roughly 4% increase in their income thresholds due to recent tax legislation. These annual adjustments aim to prevent "bracket creep," ensuring that cost-of-living pay increases don't inadvertently push workers into higher tax brackets. This article explains that individual tax rates will remain the same, but higher income thresholds mean more earnings will fall into lower tax bands. (not investment advice)</p>

While supporters argued the verdict reduced wrongful convictions, critics found it confusing and denied closure to victims.

          <p>Experts are sounding the alarm over the Trump administration's "war on science," warning of a significant loss of scientific expertise across U.S. government sectors including public health, climate, and environmental protection. Thousands of government scientists have been fired, and billions slashed from research programs, leading to comparisons with authoritarian regimes. This article highlights the firing of CDC director Susan Monarez and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine stance as examples of an administration attempting to control scientific determinations. Critics argue this approach undermines the scientific method and could take decades to repair, with lasting damage to national scientific capacity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has increasingly engaged in prisoner swaps with Russia, marking a significant shift in foreign policy as traditional diplomatic norms erode. This article, based on the book "Swap," reveals how both Trump and Biden administrations have accepted trading convicted Russians for unjustly detained Americans, including journalist Evan Gershkovich. This strategy, while bringing Americans home, emboldens Russia to abduct more Westerners, weakening the U.S.'s legal power to enforce laws against Russian criminals.

Johnson stated Democrats are inserting "partisan political preferences" into a clean funding extension, warning they will be blamed if a shutdown occurs. The proposed Republican stopgap bill funds the government through November 21 and includes security enhancements, but omits the ACA tax credits, which are set to expire and could cause average premiums to surge by 75%.
