            <p>Shares of Danish shipping giant Maersk experienced a significant surge after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for some countries, excluding China. This news provided relief to the maritime and transport sector, which has been concerned about the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. Maersk had previously cautioned that Trump's tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China would likely cause inflation in the short term. The company's stock rose by 10% following the announcement, reflecting optimism about potential de-escalation of trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Labour Party is set to announce a plan to increase police patrols in town centers during peak times in England and Wales, aiming to address rising concerns about shoplifting and anti-social behavior. The initiative includes dedicated teams of officers focused on neighborhood policing and a goal to boost police ranks by 13,000 by 2029. Sir Keir Starmer argues that visible policing has declined, leading to a significant number of unsolved crimes. While police forces face financial challenges, the government defends its investment in policing, stating an overall increase in funding compared to the previous year.</p>

            <p>President Trump's social media post urging investors to "BUY!!! DJT" preceded his announcement of a 90-day tariff pause, leading to speculation about potential insider trading. Stocks soared following the announcement, and Trump Media's stock, using the same initials, jumped significantly. Ethics experts have raised concerns about whether Trump was already aware of the impending tariff pause when he made the post, potentially giving an unfair advantage to those who followed his advice. The White House defended the post as part of the President's responsibility to reassure markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A 20-year-old student, Bethany Gamble, says she would "do anything" to have her childhood eczema back after suffering from suspected topical steroid withdrawal (TSW), which made her skin so painful she had to drop out of university. Bethany had used topical corticosteroid creams to treat eczema since she was two years old, but as she got older, they became less effective, and she began experiencing extreme flare-ups. Despite finding others with similar experiences on TikTok, doctors have refused to officially diagnose her with TSW, stating that it is just extreme eczema. Bethany has joined a group of TSW sufferers to deliver a petition to Downing Street, calling on the medical community to acknowledge the condition.</p>

            <p>England's Children's Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, believes that banning phones in schools should be a decision for head teachers, not a government mandate. A survey commissioned by Dame Rachel revealed that 90% of secondary schools already restrict smartphone use. Dame Rachel suggests that parents play a crucial role in setting boundaries around children's screen time at home, as children spend hours on devices outside of school. Her report recommends further research into the potential benefits of broader restrictions on children's phone usage, particularly social media.</p>

Panama's government clarified that it could not accept military bases or defense sites. The US has long participated in military exercises in Panama, but a longer-term rotational force is politically sensitive for Panama.</p>

He also cited the increasing number of cryptocurrency users and the shift from a rules-based international order to great power conflicts as factors driving Bitcoin's potential growth.

The Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust admitted that mistakes had caused the delay and confessed that if surgery had taken place earlier, her leg may have been saved.

            <p>Eni Aluko, a former England striker and broadcaster, hopes that a judgement finding Joey Barton's social media posts defamatory will encourage people to think twice about what they say online. Aluko said she should not have to be anxious that her race and gender would be attacked every time she is on TV. Barton had made comments suggesting Aluko's late father had been financially corrupt and that her private education made her a "hypocrite." Aluko hopes the judge's finding will lead to more people speaking out about bad behavior and online abuse.</p>

The EU and UK are hesitant to respond in kind, fearing surging consumer costs. US inflation could peak at 4.5% next year if tariffs remain, increasing recession risks. Central banks are expected to cut rates to protect economies. The tariffs are causing delays in stock market listings and impacting debt refinancing, including Thames Water.

            <p>Analysts caution that President Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most nations is merely a "tactical retreat" and does not signal a shift in his overall objectives. Tariffs on imports from China were raised to 125%, intensifying the trade war between the world's two largest economies. Experts express concern over the impact on global supply chains, predicting significant disruption and economic pain for various countries. A report suggests that the current tariffs could generate substantial tax revenue, but that figure would drop to zero if China simply stops exporting.</p>
