          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has introduced a competitive proposal for Heathrow Airport's expansion, directly challenging the plan from the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan centers on a shorter third runway, which it argues would be billions cheaper and avoid the costly, disruptive rerouting of the M25 motorway. This marks the first time competing bids will be considered for the project, with the government now tasked with evaluating both submissions. The development adds a new layer of complexity to the long-debated expansion, focusing on cost-efficiency and project delivery.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive trade deal with South Korea, establishing a blanket 15% tariff on most Korean exports to the United States. The agreement also stipulates that South Korea will facilitate $350 billion in investments within the U.S. and purchase $100 billion in American energy products. However, there appear to be differing interpretations between Washington and Seoul regarding the control and allocation of the investment funds. The deal aims to reduce the U.S. trade deficit but has prompted discussions about the distribution of profits from the proposed investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company's revenue increased by 45% year-over-year to $989 million, driven by a significant rise in funded customers, assets under management, and net interest revenue. The platform's growth was bolstered by the success of its Gold subscription service and expansion into retirement accounts. Despite the positive results, the company's stock dipped slightly after it projected higher operating costs for 2025, partly due to its acquisition of the crypto exchange Bitstamp.

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than half compared to the previous year and missed analyst expectations. The decline was primarily caused by a 94% profit plunge in its Device Solutions division, which includes its crucial memory chip business, attributed to inventory adjustments and U.S. export restrictions on AI chips to China. In contrast, the company's mobile division performed well, with robust sales of its Galaxy S25 and A-series smartphones. The results highlight a major downturn in the global semiconductor market impacting the tech giant's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

Victims and officials expressed outrage that he was able to obtain their personal addresses and make direct contact. The incident has sparked a debate about legal protections for victims and whether authorities can prevent such contact in the future.</p>

          <p>Twelve employees of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) are facing termination or suspension after allegedly holding a retirement party that involved heavy drinking and a stripper during work hours. An anonymous tip detailed the party, which took place at a Caltrans yard in Monterey, and also alleged that supervisors drove state vehicles while intoxicated. Caltrans has launched a full investigation, stating the behavior has no place in the department and is in direct opposition to its values.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's aggressive tariff policies reveals significant impacts on the U.S. and global economies. While the tariffs have tripled monthly revenue for the U.S. government, they have also contributed to a widening of the national trade deficit, as companies stockpiled imports to avoid the taxes. The measures have notably reduced Chinese exports to the U.S., but China has increased trade with other nations like India and the EU. Economists are now seeing early signs that the tariffs are beginning to increase U.S. consumer prices on certain imported goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut.

In an unusual move, two board members dissented, voting for a rate cut, which indicates broadening support for lower rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the full impact of the administration's tariffs remains unclear, justifying a cautious approach for now. (not investment advice)</p>

These ecosystems are fueled not by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor.

          <p>Despite being one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 quake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula resulted in a surprisingly minor tsunami with limited damage. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in this best-case scenario outcome. The main energy from the undersea rupture was directed into a vast, open stretch of the Pacific Ocean, roughly between Alaska and Hawaii. This allowed the tsunami's power to dissipate significantly over a long distance before it could reach the U.S. West Coast or other populated areas.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Analyzes Federal Reserve's Reluctance to Cut Interest Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer provided his analysis on the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, attributing the central bank's caution to a highly mixed economic environment. Cramer explained that while some indicators, like disappointing earnings from certain retailers, suggest a weakening consumer, other data points like a strong labor market and healthy GDP growth argue against a rate cut. He noted that the uncertain impact of tariffs on inflation makes the Fed reluctant to act prematurely, as it does not want to risk a resurgence of inflation by cutting rates too soon.

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial outlook, which now includes an estimated $2 billion net negative impact from U.S. tariffs. The automaker, which beat second-quarter revenue expectations, had previously suspended its guidance due to uncertainty over the tariffs. The new forecast reflects a total tariff hit of $3 billion, of which the company believes it can offset $1 billion through mitigation efforts. The guidance also accounts for a $570 million charge from a recent recall of over 694,000 SUVs, highlighting multiple financial pressures on the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ordered the Trump administration to explain its failure to comply with a previous court order to restore operations at Voice of America (VOA), the government-funded international news outlet. Judge Royce Lamberth accused the administration of providing "cagey answers" and suggested it was attempting to "run out the clock" on the fiscal year to waste the $260 million Congress had appropriated for VOA. The agency has been largely non-operational since March, following the appointment of a new adviser who oversaw mass job losses, calling it an effort to dismantle a bloated bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>William "Bill" Elwell, the founder and iconic operator of Bill's Burgers in Van Nuys, has passed away at the age of 98. Elwell opened the beloved burger shack in 1965 and worked there for nearly 60 years, becoming as famous for his gruff, humorous personality as for his classic griddled burgers. He ran the cash-only stand with strict rules, famously telling customers, "You can’t have it your way, this is not Burger King." His death has prompted an outpouring of memories from customers and fellow restaurateurs who viewed him as an L.A. institution.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against state prosecutors and law enforcement officials involved in the "Rust" film set shooting case. Baldwin had alleged malicious prosecution after the involuntary manslaughter charge against him was dropped last year due to prosecutors withholding potential evidence. The judge dismissed the civil suit, which targeted the special prosecutor and others, citing a lack of significant action in the case for six months. The ruling marks another development in the legal fallout from the tragic on-set death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.</p>

          <h2>Cultural Critics Analyze the Rise of 'Stressful TV' and Its Appeal to Modern Audiences</h2>

          <p>A cultural analysis explores the growing popularity of television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," which are defined by their anxiety-inducing, high-stress narratives. These programs immerse viewers in the visceral, minute-to-minute pressures of chaotic workplaces, moving away from the escapist "comfort TV" that gained prominence during the pandemic. Experts suggest these shows resonate because they reflect the real-world anxieties of modern audiences, particularly younger viewers who have grown up with economic and professional uncertainty. The realism and catharsis of seeing sincere characters navigate recognizable stress appears to be a satisfying experience for many.</p>
