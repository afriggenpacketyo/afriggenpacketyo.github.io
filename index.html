          <h2>Analysis of Scottie Scheffler's Golf Dominance Draws Comparisons to Tiger Woods</h2>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, golfer Scottie Scheffler is being hailed as the most dominant force in the sport since Tiger Woods. This article examines the parallels in their careers, noting that both players took an identical number of days to win their first four majors. While Scheffler himself dismisses the comparisons as "silly," his peers and commentators point to his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to win. The analysis also explores how improvements in his putting, including a switch to a claw grip, have been instrumental in his recent success.</p>

          <p>A 9-year-old girl from Canada, initially reported as kidnapped in upstate New York, was found deceased, leading to an investigation into her father. The father, Luciano Frattolin, had claimed his daughter was abducted at a rest stop, which prompted an Amber Alert. However, police identified inconsistencies in his story and now state there is no indication an abduction occurred. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities have not yet confirmed if the father has been arrested in connection with her death.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is set to shut down its primary scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), as part of a broader downsizing effort by the Trump administration. The office is responsible for analyzing environmental hazards and providing the scientific basis for regulations. The administration claims the move will save money and streamline operations by embedding scientific functions within other EPA offices. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, arguing it will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. This skill fosters emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, acting as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. The article suggests parents can cultivate this by validating their child's feelings rather than dismissing them, welcoming all emotions, and modeling their own emotional awareness. These small shifts help children build a strong inner voice and protect their long-term mental health.</p>

In an interview, he expresses concern that discussions between the two nations have focused almost exclusively on tariffs, overlooking broader business issues. While a recent framework deal has paused further tariff escalations, uncertainty remains high. Stein suggests that a US move to lower tariffs in response to China's actions on fentanyl could pave a path toward a more normal trade relationship, but so far, reciprocity has been lacking.

          <p>Parts of Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, experienced flash flooding on Sunday ahead of an amber weather warning for heavy rain across eastern Northern Ireland. Eyewitnesses described roads being submerged and manhole covers being lifted by the force of the water. The Met Office has issued the amber alert, its second-highest level, for counties Antrim, Down, and Armagh overnight into Monday. Forecasters warn that some areas could receive 50-75 mm of rain in a short period, creating a risk of further flash floods, dangerous driving conditions, and potential power outages.</p>

          <p>Intense rainfall led to severe flash flooding in Montgomery County, Maryland, prompting over 100 rescue calls within a two-hour period on Saturday—a volume typically seen over 24 hours.

Dozens of water rescues were performed, including for 20 people trapped in a building and a family whose SUV was caught in the rapidly rising water. No injuries were immediately reported, but the event left residents shocked by its speed and severity.</p>

Bedouin fighters have withdrawn from the city but told the BBC they have not ruled out a return to hostilities if their injured members are not released. The violence, which erupted after a Druze merchant was abducted, has killed over 1,120 people and displaced more than 128,000. A government-brokered ceasefire is in place, with security forces now controlling access to the city amidst a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>President Trump has demanded that the Washington Commanders NFL team revert to its former name, the Redskins, and threatened to block a deal for a new stadium in Washington, D.C., if they refuse.

The Commanders are negotiating a complex deal to build a new stadium on federal land, which could be complicated by presidential opposition.</p>
