          <p>China showcased advanced AI-powered body cameras and an intelligent command center system at the Global Public Security Cooperation Forum. These body cameras can link to facial data of high-risk individuals, using AI algorithms for identification and sending real-time alerts to a command center. This technology aims to enhance police patrols and suspect apprehension, with the system's terminal designed for military-grade drop resistance. The exhibition highlights China's focus on criminal technology, counterterrorism, and communication for developing nations.</p>

          <p>ABC has indefinitely pulled 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' after its host linked the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to Donald Trump's MAGA movement. The decision followed FCC Chair Brendan Carr's suggestion that ABC's license was at risk and Nexstar Media Group's announcement to pre-empt the show. Trump praised the move, while FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez and Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer condemned it as an act of censorship and a threat to free speech. Writers and musicians unions also criticized the network's corporate cowardice.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student and pro-Palestinian activist, to be deported to Algeria or Syria. Khalil, a green card holder, alleges the Trump administration is retaliating against him for his free speech, a claim his legal team supports. The judge denied his waiver motion, citing alleged misrepresentations on his green card paperwork, including affiliations with a UN agency and the British Embassy. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal the ruling, calling the claims baseless.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate it will remain over open waters, possibly strengthening into a low-grade hurricane by the weekend. Its current track suggests it will stay north of the Caribbean, though it could reach Bermuda next week. The storm's path remains uncertain, but it marks an increase in activity after a quieter-than-expected season, despite initial predictions for a busier year.</p>

Designers collaborated with composers and DJs to create immersive soundscapes, ranging from a repeating poem by Nezahualcóyotl for Campillo to a 'New York, '70s, '80s, Nuyorican vibe' for Eckhaus Latta. Soundtracks evoked nostalgia, disorientation, or subtle tension, with some artists using music to explore deeper concepts like the Jungian shadow self or to comment on societal issues. The careful curation of music served as a vital, often subconscious, informational layer to the fashion presentations.</p>

          <p>Germany's Central Council of Jews called on Chancellor Friedrich Merz to maintain unconditional support for Israel, commemorating 75 years since its foundation. Council president Josef Schuster urged Merz not to be swayed by other European countries or individual lawmakers. Merz, while acknowledging criticism of the Israeli government is permissible, rejected it when used as a pretext for antisemitism. He emphasized that Germany harms its own soul by turning away from Israel and stressed the importance of Jewish life and culture for the Federal Republic's future.</p>

          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine issued a strong rebuke to the Trump administration's dismissal of climate change dangers, asserting that evidence is 'beyond scientific dispute.' Their report directly opposes the EPA's move to revoke its 2009 'endangerment finding,' which regulates greenhouse gases. The Academies stated that long-term observations confirm greenhouse gas emissions are warming Earth's surface and changing its climate, warning of worsening climate-induced harm. This report reinforces the scientific consensus and challenges the administration's policy decisions.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, '107 Days,' Kamala Harris revealed that Pete Buttigieg was her 'first choice' for running mate in the 2024 election, but she deemed the pairing 'too big of a risk.' Harris wrote that while Buttigieg would have been an ideal partner if she were a 'straight white man,' the ticket already asked a lot of America by featuring a Black woman married to a Jewish man. She ultimately chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and the pair lost to Donald Trump. This candid reflection highlights the challenges Democrats face in balancing diversity with electability.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume naturally fermented fruit with an average alcohol content of 0.3% by weight. When chimps eat up to 10 pounds of this fruit daily, it equates to approximately 14 grams of ethanol, or two alcoholic beverages for a human. Researchers clarify that chimps don't get drunk but are exposed to a steady low dose, supporting the 'drunken monkey' hypothesis. This research provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits routinely eaten by wild chimps, suggesting a possible ancestral link to humans' attraction to alcohol.</p>
