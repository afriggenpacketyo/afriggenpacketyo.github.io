          <p>A New York Times article reports that new clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated Covid and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. Federal officials are questioning the necessity of Covid vaccines for children under 12, and some experts fear these changes could undermine the use of all vaccines. Some public health experts agree that annual booster shots might offer only marginal benefits to younger, healthy Americans, while others emphasize the importance of vaccines for high-risk groups. The article highlights the ongoing debate about vaccine recommendations and the potential impact on public health. </p>

          <p>According to a CBS News report based on an internal review, FEMA is "not ready" for the upcoming hurricane season due to staff cuts and a refocusing of its core mission. The review, ordered by FEMA's new acting leader, David Richardson, identified issues such as staffing shortages, culture problems, and challenges in coordinating with other federal agencies. The agency's readiness process has been derailed by activities like staffing changes and contract modifications. Richardson has expressed support for shrinking FEMA and shifting more emergency response duties to the states, aligning with President Trump's views.</p>

This marks the first quarterly contraction in a year for the country. The Bank of Japan had previously warned that the economy was likely to moderate due to global trade policies. Despite these concerns, the central bank is expected to continue raising its policy rate, although some board members cautioned about uncertainties in the economic outlook. </p>

Ryder Cup captains Luke Donald and Keegan Bradley performed well, while McIlroy, playing alongside Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele, had difficulty finding fairways and making putts.

Alameda, a former assistant city manager for La Cañada Flintridge, has been charged with embezzlement and insurance fraud for allegedly stealing nearly $200,000 in insurance claim proceeds paid to the city. Prosecutors allege that Alameda falsified invoices and directed payments to his personal bank account between 2016 and 2022. La Cañada Flintridge officials discovered the alleged crimes through a Sheriff's Department investigation and have since modified internal controls. Alameda, who had subsequently taken a job as assistant city manager in Ojai, has been placed on paid administrative leave from that city as well.</p>

The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee warns that the reforms threaten the most vulnerable farmers and recommends delaying implementation until April 2027.

The visit aims to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries.

Simon suggests that Walmart may be overstating the challenges tied to tariffs, citing the company's gross profit margin growth and price deflation in general merchandise categories. He is optimistic that consumers can handle price increases due to a steady jobs market and cheaper fuel prices, but warns that negative commentary from corporate executives could erode consumer confidence. </p>
