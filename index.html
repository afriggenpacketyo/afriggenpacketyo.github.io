          <p>Two Israeli Embassy employees, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended after chanting "Free, free Palestine" while in custody, according to Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela A. Smith. The victims were a young couple on the verge of getting engaged, according to Israeli Ambassador Yechiel Leiter. The shooting is being investigated as a possible targeted attack motivated by antisemitism, with President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu condemning the violence. The FBI is working with local police to investigate the shooting and determine the motive behind the attack.</p>

          <p>A last-minute injunction by a High Court judge has temporarily paused the UK government's negotiations to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The legal action was brought by two Chagossian women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, who claim a lack of formal consultation with the Chagossian people. The deal would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, while Mauritius seeks sovereignty. The Chagos Archipelago was separated from Mauritius in 1965, and the UK government is yet to set out the estimated payments the British taxpayer would make to Mauritius as part of the deal, but it is expected to run into the billions.</p>

          <p>A wildlife refuge in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico, was forced to evacuate hundreds of animals, including tigers, lions, and elephants, due to escalating cartel violence and threats. The Ostok Sanctuary, which housed over 700 animals, faced intimidation and gunfire from rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, leading to a breakdown of law and order. The sanctuary director, Ernesto Zazueta, reported that some animals went days without food, and two big cats died due to stress. With no government assistance, the sanctuary staff made the difficult decision to relocate the animals to Mazatlán, fearing the violence would follow them.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reveals a fierce debate among officials in the State, Justice, and Homeland Security Departments following the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Despite a judge's ruling prohibiting his deportation to El Salvador, Mr. Abrego Garcia was deported due to an administrative error. D.H.S. officials considered portraying Mr. Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader without evidence and sought to nullify the order barring his deportation. A Justice Department lawyer, Erez Reuveni, was fired for advocating for Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, highlighting the administration's efforts to keep him out of the American judicial system.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other experts are raising concerns that U.S. semiconductor export controls on China have backfired, harming American businesses more than China. Huang noted that Nvidia's GPU market share in China has significantly decreased due to the restrictions. Analysts argue that the curbs have incentivized China to develop its own semiconductor industry, potentially closing the gap in AI capabilities. The restrictions, intended to curb China's military advancement and maintain U.S. leadership in AI, have instead led to a "moving of the goalposts" and collateral damage for American companies.</p>

          <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that UK government borrowing for April was £20.2 billion, higher than expected and up £1 billion from the previous year. This has put pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with experts suggesting that taxes will likely need to rise in the autumn to meet economic rules. Tax receipts increased due to higher National Insurance contributions, but government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pensions and benefits. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is now estimated at £148.3 billion, still above the government's forecast.</p>

          <p>Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish language hip-hop group Kneecap, has been charged with a terror offense after allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed organisation Hezbollah at a London gig. The Metropolitan Police charged Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara, after an incident on 21 November 2024 at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, London. Kneecap denies the offense and claims it is political policing. Several gigs featuring the band have been called off since videos emerged allegedly showing the group calling for the death of British MPs and shouting support for Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

          <p>The House is expected to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill after unveiling an updated version aimed at satisfying Republican holdouts. The legislation addresses tax, defense, and energy priorities, but has faced opposition over Medicaid, the state and local tax deduction, and other provisions. House GOP leaders released a 42-page amendment with changes to win over both budget hardliners and blue-state Republicans. The bill is expected to face resistance in the Senate, where numerous Republicans have said they will seek changes.</p>

          <p>The New York Times examines how a South African lobbyist for white rights, Ernst Roets, has gained influence in American politics, particularly within the MAGA movement. The article argues that Roets and others are exploiting the narrative of "white genocide" in South Africa to garner support and sympathy. President Trump's administration has even offered refugee status to "ethnic minority Afrikaners." The author contends that this narrative is a distortion of reality and a way to undermine South Africa's democratic transition.</p>

          <p>Despite a lack of interest in peace negotiations with Ukraine, Russia's war-focused economy is facing increasing pressures that could eventually drive Moscow to the negotiating table. Economic and military challenges, including depleted military equipment stockpiles, recruitment difficulties, and tighter sanctions, are beginning to take a toll. A slowdown in the Russian economy, driven by factors such as high inflation and declining oil prices, is also adding to the pressure. Tighter sanctions on Russia's "shadow fleet" and Trump's global tariffs policy are expected to hurt Russia's economy.</p>
