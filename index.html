          <h2>Novel Montmartre Finish at Tour de France Draws Mixed Reactions from Riders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 15:54:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Tadej Pogačar celebrated his overall Tour de France victory, the final stage's new route through Montmartre has sparked controversy within the peloton. Tour director Christian Prudhomme added the steep, cobbled streets to replicate the spectacle of the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, several top riders, including Jonas Vingegaard, expressed safety concerns, worrying about 150 cyclists fighting for position on a narrow climb. The change from the traditional flat sprint on the Champs-Elysées was lamented by former sprinters, highlighting a tension between creating a dramatic finish and maintaining rider safety.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Decision to Cut Department of Education Workforce is a Necessary Reform</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article by Riley Gaines argues that the Supreme Court's decision allowing the Trump administration to cut the Department of Education's workforce is a crucial step in returning control to parents and local communities. The author contends that the department has become a bloated bureaucracy pushing a radical social agenda, citing examples from the Obama and Biden administrations regarding Title IX and discipline policies. The piece calls for the complete abolition of the department, framing the current layoffs as the first move toward dismantling an agency that has prioritized politics over education.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a regular commercial air link between Moscow and Pyongyang, signaling the increasingly close relationship between the two nations. The first flight, operated by Russian carrier Nordwind, carried over 400 passengers. This development follows a visit by Russia's foreign minister to a new North Korean beach resort, where he promised to encourage Russian tourism to the complex. The move is part of North Korea's broader effort to boost its struggling economy by gradually reopening its borders to international visitors after pandemic-era restrictions.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Michigan are seeking to file terrorism charges against a 42-year-old man accused of stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect allegedly used a folding knife in what appeared to be a random attack near the store's checkout area. The attack was halted when multiple citizens, including one armed with a pistol, confronted the suspect in the parking lot until law enforcement arrived. Most of the victims are now in fair condition, with two remaining in serious condition as the investigation, assisted by the FBI, continues.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have announced a significant trade deal, averting a potential trade war. The agreement establishes a 15% baseline tariff for most EU exports to the US, though a higher 50% tariff on steel remains. As part of the deal, the EU will purchase $750 billion in US energy and invest $600 billion in the US. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the deal brings "stability and predictability," while President Trump hailed it as a "powerful deal" that resolves long-standing trade friction.</p>

          <h2>IDF Reservist Describes Gaza Aid Distribution as Violent Chaos, Refutes Starvation Claims</h2>

          <p>An active-duty IDF reservist provided a first-hand account of guarding a humanitarian aid corridor in Gaza, describing the scene as a chaotic "stampede" rather than an orderly distribution. He claims that thousands of men, not starving civilians, would violently rush the site in what he believes were coordinated efforts by Hamas to loot supplies and provoke a tragedy for media purposes. The soldier directly refutes claims of intentional starvation by Israel, arguing that any malnutrition is a result of Hamas controlling and weaponizing the food supply. He asserts that troops only fired after being surrounded.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's long history of promoting conspiracy theories has created a political dilemma for him regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Having fueled public distrust of the "deep state," he now presides over it and is being pressured by his own base to release files and reveal secrets. His attempts to deflect and distract are seen as deepening suspicion, particularly given his past relationship with Epstein. The article suggests that Trump is now caught in a trap of his own making, as any action or inaction only reinforces the conspiratorial worldview he helped cultivate.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old Wyandotte County Sheriff's Deputy, Elijah Ming, was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call in Kansas City, Kansas. Deputy Ming was accompanying a woman to a residence to help her move out when a man inside opened fire without warning. The suspect, who had earlier threatened the woman, then barricaded himself in the home and exchanged fire with other responding officers before surrendering. Ming was a nine-year veteran of the sheriff's office, and his death is being investigated by the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent law gutting anti-corruption agencies demonstrates the consequences of the Trump administration's foreign policy. The author contends that by dismantling programs that promoted good governance and tolerating global kleptocracy, the U.S. has signaled that pressure for democratic reform is off. The article suggests that leaders worldwide, including Zelensky, have absorbed this message, leading to a retreat from transparency. It frames this as a new "Trump Doctrine" that shields autocrats and allows corruption to flourish, creating a new global order of impunity.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is urging the Trump administration to stop funding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private organization delivering aid in Gaza. In a letter to the Secretary of State, they expressed "grave" concerns, citing reports of hundreds of deaths at GHF distribution sites and calling the operation a "death trap." The senators argue that using armed contractors blurs the line between aid and military operations, and they are calling for the US to resume support for UN-led distribution mechanisms with enhanced oversight.</p>

          <p>The pioneering work of sculptor Louise Nevelson (1899-1988) is being highlighted in recent exhibitions, bringing renewed attention to her monumental art. Although the art world was slow to recognize her, Nevelson became famous for her massive, monochromatic sculptures created from found objects and wood scraps. Her distinctive style created immersive environments rather than standalone pieces. A "Sunday Morning" feature explores her legacy, visiting exhibitions of her work in New York City and Columbus, Ohio, and speaking with her granddaughter about the artist's influence.</p>

          <p>Megan Horneman, CIO of Verdence Capital Advisors, has expressed concern that the stock market is "pricing in perfection" and ignoring potential risks. She warns that there is too much complacency surrounding the upcoming August 1 trade deadline, Federal Reserve policy uncertainty, and technically overbought conditions, especially in growth stocks. While remaining bullish in the long term, she suggests that a "valuation correction" could occur in the near future if rate cuts are taken off the table. She advises investors to ensure their portfolios are allocated appropriately. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel has initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in parts of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to enter, with Jordan and the UAE conducting airdrops. However, the effectiveness of the pause has been questioned after medics reported nine people were killed by Israeli fire near an aid convoy route. Furthermore, BBC Verify geolocated an airstrike in a Gaza City district just an hour after it was designated as an area where military operations would cease. The moves come amid intense international pressure over mass starvation, with the UN warning of famine-like conditions.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia for peace talks aimed at ending deadly border clashes that have killed dozens and displaced over 168,000 people. The negotiations, mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, follow pressure from US President Donald Trump, who threatened to withhold trade deals if hostilities continued. Despite the planned talks, fighting reportedly continued along the contested border on Sunday, with both nations accusing the other of initiating new attacks and escalating the conflict with shelling and troop movements.</p>
