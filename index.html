          <p>Amid rising tensions following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear enrichment sites, several tankers have altered their courses away from the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade chokepoint, due to concerns about potential disruptions and electronic interference. While some vessels initially diverted, some have resumed their course towards the strait, indicating a fluid situation; increased insurance costs and the risk of attacks are prompting some companies to avoid the area altogether. Iran's parliament has voted to block the Strait of Hormuz, though the final decision rests with the country's national security council, and British maritime security firm Ambrey has issued alerts about potential Iranian military responses targeting U.S.-affiliated shipping. Experts warn of broader geopolitical instability, with concerns about potential attacks on commercial ships and the possibility of wider disruptions. Optimism is tempered by the potential for escalating conflict and economic repercussions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for oil producers to maintain lower oil prices, warning that high prices would benefit adversaries following U.S. airstrikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities. This message, posted on his social media platform, comes amid heightened concerns that Iran might retaliate by targeting energy supplies in the Middle East, and Trump followed up by urging the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling. The oil market initially reacted to the U.S. attacks with a price jump, but futures trading largely stabilized, and while oil production decisions in the U.S. are made by private companies, Trump's statements reflect a desire to control energy costs amid geopolitical tensions. His remarks underscore the administration's focus on energy independence and its potential impact on foreign policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, the White House has expressed confidence that the strikes successfully hit enriched uranium stores, and President Donald Trump has publicly demanded that oil prices remain steady. Trump also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling in response to rising oil prices, and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright responded affirmatively on social media. This directive follows concerns that the conflict could disrupt global oil supplies, and the administration is seeking to mitigate any potential economic fallout by increasing domestic production.

          <p>In the trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs, the prosecution expects to rest its case, with the defense indicating it will not call any witnesses, suggesting Combs himself will not testify. The jury is currently viewing sexually explicit videos depicting Combs, his former girlfriend, and a male escort, and federal prosecutors are presenting evidence of arranged sexual encounters between 2021 and 2024. Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Joseph Cerciello testified about reviewing multiple hours of explicit videos, and prosecutors aim to prove that the depicted sexual acts were the result of coordinated criminal activity. Combs maintains that all encounters were consensual, and the trial continues to unfold with significant implications for the defendant.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terror law, effectively branding the group a terrorist organization. This decision follows the group's recent vandalism at RAF Brize Norton and a history of causing over Â£1 million in damage since its creation in 2020, and the ban would make membership or support of the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The announcement coincided with a Palestine Action protest in central London, resulting in several arrests, and Cooper emphasized that the ban is specific to Palestine Action and does not affect lawful protest groups campaigning on issues around Palestine. The government aims to balance national security with the right to peaceful protest.</p>

The shop's appearance in 'Wayne's World' drew visitors from around the globe, and Intagliata recalls the store being a creative hub for the community.

          <p>A new poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, is drawing level with Andrew Cuomo in the cityâ€™s primary, and the survey suggests Mamdani may even be leading after a simulation of the ranked-choice voting system. While Cuomo initially led with first-choice votes, Mamdani came out on top when calculated by voters' final round choices, and the race has been colored by international politics, with Mamdani facing accusations of antisemitism. After the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Mamdani criticized the military action, while Cuomo emphasized the need to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear capabilities, and the primary's outcome could signal the direction of travel for the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna, have voluntarily agreed to streamline the prior authorization process, aiming to reduce delays and administrative burdens for patients and providers.

Insurers claim the process ensures medically necessary care and cost control, while critics argue it leads to care delays and physician burnout, and the new measures are expected to take effect across commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plans.

She believes President Trump's tariffs will likely have a temporary and muted impact on prices, paving the way for lower rates, and Bowman's comments indicate a willingness to adjust policy to sustain a healthy labor market.

          <p>Experts are cautioning homeowners to carefully assess their debt situation before taking out home equity loans, as attractive rates can lead to excessive borrowing. There is no single formula for determining how much debt is too much, but a high debt-to-income ratio, low credit score, low home equity, unstable income, and lack of an emergency fund are all indicators that a home equity loan may be too risky. Experts recommend keeping the debt-to-income ratio below 36% and having at least 20% equity in the home, and potential borrowers should also have an emergency fund to cushion against unexpected financial difficulties. Taking out a home equity loan requires honest self-assessment and a backup plan in case circumstances change. (not investment advice)</p>

Iran's legislature has approved plans to close the Strait of Hormuz, which could send shock waves through global energy markets, and the situation remains tense as the international community monitors potential escalations.

          <p>A Tennessee judge ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a focal point in immigration debates, while he awaits a federal trial on human smuggling charges. However, he is not expected to be allowed to go free, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is likely to detain him, and the U.S. government has already filed a motion to appeal the judge's release order. The judge acknowledged that determining whether Abrego Garcia should be released is "little more than an academic exercise" because ICE will likely detain him, and the case has raised questions about due process and immigration enforcement priorities. The government could deport him to a third country, but immigration officials would first be required to show that third country was willing to keep him and not simply deport him back to El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has terminated its collaboration with Hims & Hers due to concerns about the telehealth company's sales and promotion of cheaper, unapproved versions of the weight loss drug Wegovy, leading to a significant drop in Hims & Hers' stock. Novo Nordisk accused Hims & Hers of failing to adhere to laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization and of deceptive marketing that is putting patient safety at risk. The drugmaker said it will continue offering the branded version of Wegovy through telehealth organizations that share its commitment to safe and effective medical treatment, and the end of the collaboration increases Hims & Hers' legal risk substantially. Novo Nordisk also cited concerns about the use of active ingredients from foreign suppliers in China.</p>

Many social media users in Iran are concerned that if the Islamic Republic remains in power, the regime could take revenge on the Iranian people for its political and military humiliations. There are reports of growing arrests inside Iran under accusations of "supporting Israel," and executions related to alleged ties with Israel have also increased. Many Iranians living abroad have expressed deep concern for their families in Iran, with some considering leaving the country or sending their children to neighboring countries.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the strategy intended to "stabilise" and help "mitigate" challenges to the UK from abroad, and the measures aim to boost growth by improving UK workers' skills, attracting global talent, and streamlining planning processes. The government will focus on eight specific sectors where the UK is already strong, including advanced manufacturing, clean energy industries, and digital technologies, and the strategy has received mixed reactions from businesses and trade unions.

          <p>Experts are weighing in on the question of whether credit card debt can be inherited, with the consensus being that individuals are not typically responsible for the debt of a deceased loved one unless they were a co-signer or joint account holder. The deceased person's estate is responsible for settling debts, and if the estate lacks sufficient funds, the remaining balance may go unpaid. Spouses in community property states may be responsible for debt taken out during the marriage, and it is important to notify credit card companies and credit bureaus upon a death. Consulting an estate attorney can help clarify legal responsibilities and prevent future financial issues. (not investment advice)</p>
