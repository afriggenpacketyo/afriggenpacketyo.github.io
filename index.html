          <p>India has called on BRICS nations to tackle trade imbalances during a virtual summit amidst concerns over U.S. tariffs. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighted India's significant trade deficits with BRICS partners, noting the need for expeditious solutions. China's President Xi Jinping cautioned against protectionism and unilateralism, urging BRICS members to unite against higher tariffs. India views BRICS primarily as an economic initiative, while China and Russia see it as a geopolitical grouping, reflecting differing perspectives on the bloc's role. (not investment advice) The current trade dynamics show that India has a strong deficit with both China and Russia.</p>

          <p>A letter allegedly written by Lord Mandelson to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday has been released by U.S. lawmakers. In the letter, Mandelson refers to Epstein as his "best pal" and recalls their time together. Mandelson's spokesperson has stated that he regrets ever being introduced to Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell. The release of the letter is part of a larger release of documents related to Epstein, including his address book and will, and the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the documents.</p>

          <p>Thailand's top court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve one year in jail, reversing his earlier hospital stay. The court deemed his previous hospital stay unlawful, stating that his illness was not an urgent matter. Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and lived in exile, returned to Thailand in 2023 and was convicted of corruption and abuse of power. His daughter, Paetongtarn, expressed worry but affirmed the family's good spirits, while vowing to continue their party's opposition work.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its aerial strikes on Ukraine, launching the largest attack of the war so far and killing civilians. The attacks have notably increased since the Istanbul talks in May 2025, targeting critical infrastructure and military enlistment offices. Analysts suggest that Russia is trying to instill fear among the Ukrainian population to diminish their ability to recruit soldiers. The shift in tactics indicates that Russia is not interested in a ceasefire under current conditions, as the conflict has entered its third year.</p>

The release has sparked debate and denials, with the White House asserting that the signature is not Trump's.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson stated that the city was not notified about the Department of Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz," which aims to ramp up immigration enforcement. DHS stated the operation will target criminal illegal aliens drawn to Chicago due to sanctuary policies. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accused the Trump administration of failing to coordinate the effort with state and local leaders. Johnson expressed opposition to militarized immigration enforcement, citing past human rights abuses by ICE, and urged concerned individuals to visit the city's "know your rights" resource hub.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed immigration raids targeting people who look Latino, speak Spanish, and work low-wage jobs to resume in Los Angeles. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, warning against a country where the government can seize anyone based on appearance and language. The ruling permits federal agents to conduct raids without warrants or particularized cause for suspicion. Critics argue that the decision undermines constitutional protections and normalizes suspicion based on race and language.</p>

          <p>Syria has accused Israel of carrying out air strikes in the central and western parts of the country, condemning them as a violation of its sovereignty. Israel has not commented on the reported strikes, which follow dozens of similar attacks since the fall of ex-President Bashar al-Assad. The attacks were reported near Homs, Palmyra, and Latakia, and one war monitor reported that the Israeli strike near Homs targeted a military unit south of the city. Israel has conducted numerous attacks this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals the steepest decline in 40 years in the number of mothers of young children participating in the U.S. workforce. The analysis, conducted by the University of Kansas, found that over 400,000 women left the workforce in the first half of 2025. Economist Misty Heggeness attributes the decline primarily to the high cost of child care, which often outweighs the income earned by working mothers. The lack of support and policies for caregivers is forcing many women to choose between their jobs and their children.</p>

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older has increased by 46% between 2021 and 2023, driven by its perceived medicinal benefits and decreasing stigma. Seniors are using cannabis for pain relief, relaxation, and other health issues, with many preferring edibles over smoking. However, some medical professionals warn about the potential health risks associated with THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. A recent study linked cannabis use to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
