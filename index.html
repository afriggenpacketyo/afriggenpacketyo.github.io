          <p>Bitcoin has surged past $100,000 for the first time in three months, buoyed by President Trump's announcement of a new trade deal framework between the U.S. and the UK. This development has boosted investor confidence in risk assets and reaffirmed Bitcoin's status as a resilient asset. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo, suggests that Bitcoin's strength will be tested further amid global macro and geopolitical uncertainties, including tensions between India and Pakistan. The article notes that Bitcoin is supported by a pro-crypto Trump administration and growing investment from spot-ETF investors.</p>

The company acknowledged the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, which affect many of its small- to medium-sized business merchants. Shopify is actively monitoring the situation and adapting to changes, including the addition of a "buy local" tool to support merchants.</p>

          <p>This article explores bankruptcy options for those struggling with debt, highlighting that no bankruptcy type eliminates all debts. Chapter 7 bankruptcy offers a near-full financial reset by eliminating many unsecured debts, but it is income-based and does not discharge obligations like child support or student loans. Chapter 13 bankruptcy provides a structured repayment plan, suitable for those with higher incomes or wanting to protect more assets, but requires consistent income and budgeting. Alternatives to bankruptcy, such as debt consolidation, debt management, and debt settlement, are also discussed as options to ease debt burdens without court filings.</p>

          <p>The European Union announced plans to increase pressure on the United States in an effort to prompt serious trade negotiations with the Trump administration. The European Commission laid out $107 billion worth of goods that could be targeted with higher tariffs in retaliation to U.S. duties. The EU also initiated a World Trade Organization dispute against the U.S. over tariffs on cars and car parts. The proposed list includes agricultural products, manufactured goods, and key chemicals, potentially impacting companies like Boeing and American food producers.</p>
