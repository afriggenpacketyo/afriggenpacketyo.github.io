          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests following ICE operations. President Trump cited the inability of California's Governor and Los Angeles' Mayor to manage the situation, while Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating local authorities can handle the situation. Defense Secretary Hegseth indicated potential mobilization of active-duty Marines if violence continues, leading to further criticism from Newsom. The deployment comes after ICE conducted raids in Los Angeles, resulting in multiple arrests and protests, with clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. The situation underscores the tension between state and federal authorities regarding immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>Two sisters from Pontardawe, Wales, recount the emotional and financial devastation caused by their mother's fraud, who, along with their grandfather, was convicted of stealing their £50,000 inheritance. Katherine Hill and her father Gerald Hill were found guilty of abusing their power, with Katherine sentenced to 30 months in prison and Gerald receiving a suspended sentence. The sisters, Gemma and Jessica Thomas, explain how their mother's actions shattered their trust and familial bonds, leaving them with anxiety and a sense of betrayal. The stolen money, left to them by their grandmother, was intended to be accessed when they turned 25, but was instead used by their mother for personal expenses, including home improvements and vacations. The sisters express the profound impact of the betrayal on their lives and their struggle to rebuild trust. </p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on whether to halve the time required to apply for citizenship, a move that has polarized the country. The referendum proposes reducing the wait time from 10 years to five, aligning Italy with most other European nations. While civil society groups support the referendum, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes it, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and "very open." The vote aims to integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to the country, but faces challenges due to political opposition and low voter turnout expectations. </p>

Critics argue that this policy is redundant, inhuman, immoral, and unaffordable for Britain, perpetuating illusions about its global power status.

This fusion of political and personal interests is compared to similar patterns in countries like Russia and Hungary, where leaders have used their power to enrich themselves and their associates.

          <p>Israel is facing accusations of committing war crimes in Gaza, raising concerns about the erosion of international laws protecting civilians during conflict. Despite the brutal attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, Israel is not exempt from adhering to the Geneva Conventions, which mandate the protection of civilians. The difficulty in obtaining information from Gaza, due to restrictions on international media access, has led to an examination of the conflict through the lens of international law. There is a growing belief that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the war to preserve his political position, potentially hindering investigations into security failures and corruption charges. </p>

          <p>Subsidizing men’s participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, particularly in countries like China, according to a new study. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong argue that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. The study suggests that traditional expectations placing the burden on women clash with rapid economic changes, impacting fertility rates. The innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce. </p>

While intermittent fasting is often marketed as a tool for weight loss and improving metabolic health, it can become problematic, especially for those with a history of eating disorders. The potential benefits of intermittent fasting do not outweigh the risks of developing or worsening an eating disorder.
