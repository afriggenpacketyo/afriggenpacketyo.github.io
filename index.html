          <p>Meta experienced a share price increase of up to 5% after reporting first-quarter revenue that exceeded expectations and providing second-quarter guidance aligning with Wall Street forecasts. The company's first-quarter sales saw a 16% year-over-year rise, with net income jumping 35% to $16.64 billion. Meta anticipates second-quarter sales between $42.5 billion and $45.5 billion, although reduced ad spending from Asian e-commerce exporters is expected. CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed confidence in navigating macroeconomic uncertainty, and the company is investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Relevant context: Meta's performance is being closely watched as other tech companies warn of potential advertising headwinds.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have officially signed an agreement to establish the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, which grants the U.S. rights to Ukrainian rare earth minerals. The agreement aims to signal Russia about the commitment to a peace process and will be funded by contributions from both the U.S. and Ukraine, with profits reinvested in Ukraine. Initially planned for late February, the signing was delayed due to disagreements over finalizing the investment fund agreement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the U.S. was always ready to sign, but Ukraine proposed last-minute changes. Relevant context: this agreement comes amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and is intended to support Ukraine's economic recovery.</p>

          <p>A Chinese academic cautioned that potential interactions between the Philippines and Taiwan could be viewed by Beijing as support for Taiwanese independence, potentially triggering economic retaliation. This warning follows China's foreign ministry summoning the Philippine envoy to Beijing to express concerns over recent Philippine actions regarding Taiwan and security matters. A Philippine Navy Rear Admiral acknowledged potential military cooperation with Taiwan, marking the first time a senior Philippine military official has publicly recognized such possibilities.

          <p>Eleven high school athletes in New York surrendered to authorities after being accused of a hazing incident involving younger lacrosse teammates. The incident involved driving younger players to a wooded area where they were terrorized, including one student who had a pillowcase placed over his head and was put in the trunk of a car. District Attorney Bill Fitzpatrick condemned the actions as beyond hazing, emphasizing the lack of judgment and potential for long-term trauma. The students face misdemeanor charges of unlawful imprisonment, and the school district has cancelled the lacrosse season.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a cabinet meeting to commemorate his first 100 days of his second term, which was marked by lavish praise from cabinet members and the promotion of conspiracy theories. The meeting included the distribution of hats emblazoned with "Gulf of America," Trump's preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. repeated a debunked claim about migrant children, and Pam Bondi lauded Trump's achievements. The president also addressed the trade war with China, suggesting Americans might have to accept fewer goods, and downplayed bleak economic data.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asserted that egg prices are falling, attributing blame for previous high prices to his predecessor, but experts say this claim is misleading. Retail egg prices have increased during the early months of Trump's term, while wholesale egg prices have declined. Food economists emphasize that consumers are affected by retail prices, which have risen significantly, and that a president has minimal influence over egg costs. While the decline in wholesale prices may eventually translate to lower retail prices, the timing and extent of this relief remain unclear.</p>

          <p>President Trump has enacted numerous executive actions in his first 100 days, outpacing his predecessor, with Congress largely acquiescing due to party control. Lawmakers have enacted few laws, allowing Trump to legislate through executive orders on issues ranging from immigration to the economy. Some members of Congress have expressed concern about the erosion of congressional authority, particularly regarding fiscal matters and spending. Congressional scholars warn that this trend poses a constitutional crisis, as it undermines the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.</p>

He argued that the trade war would be more detrimental to China, which relies on the U.S. market, and insisted that Americans do not need many of the imported goods. Trump also reiterated his claim that the U.S. has been exploited by other countries.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that semaglutide, the compound found in the weight-loss drug Wegovy, may be effective in treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a common liver disease.

Novo Nordisk, the drug's manufacturer, has sought FDA approval for Wegovy as a MASH treatment.
