          <p>Former President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have strongly condemned Democrats for their continued support of Virginia Attorney General candidate Jay Jones. Jones faces scrutiny over leaked texts where he fantasized about murdering a former Republican lawmaker and his children. This controversy unfolds as Jones prepares for a debate against incumbent Jason Miyares, with Vance highlighting Democratic silence on Jones's remarks in contrast to their demands for Republicans to condemn other group chats. Trump emphasized the need to stop political violence and violent rhetoric, especially following a recent assassination.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, experts anticipate further reductions this year, likely leading to lower home equity loan rates. These rates typically mirror the Fed's benchmark rate, with predictions suggesting two more cuts by year-end. This could bring average home equity loan rates below 8%, potentially reaching 7% in some markets, making borrowing more affordable for homeowners. Borrowers are advised to compare options from multiple lenders to secure the most competitive rates as these changes materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the Trump administration intends to implement price floors across various industries to combat China's market manipulation. This strategy, termed "industrial policy," aims to prevent scenarios where China undercuts foreign competitors, as seen in the rare earths sector. The US also plans to establish a strategic mineral reserve, with potential equity stakes in companies, to ensure self-sufficiency in critical materials. These measures come amid new Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports, highlighting escalating trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new package of 90 sanctions targeting Russia's largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, and its "shadow fleet" of oil tankers. These measures, which also include an Indian oil refinery and four Chinese oil terminals, aim to disrupt Russia's ability to finance the war in Ukraine. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the goal is to send a clear signal that Russian oil is off the market, significantly increasing pressure on Moscow's war efforts. This action aligns with broader G7 discussions on seizing frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is beginning to severely impact the economy as millions of federal workers face missed paychecks, leading to curtailed spending. Analysts project a temporary hit to quarterly growth, but this year's shutdown carries unusual risks due to threats of denying backpay and a slowing economy. While the Trump administration has taken steps to mitigate some pain, these measures have also reduced pressure for a quick resolution. The article highlights the growing uncertainty and potential for a significant rise in the unemployment rate if the shutdown persists.</p>

          <p>Jewish mourning rituals primarily focus on eternal memory among the living, with less emphasis on the afterlife. Traditional Jewish law mandates quick, simple burials, often in plain wooden caskets or shrouds, without embalming or public viewing. Key rituals include K'riah, where close family members tear clothing as an expression of grief, and the recitation of the Mourner's Kaddish, a communal prayer affirming faith in God. Following burial, a seven-day period of intense mourning called shiva is observed, characterized by refraining from work and grooming, and receiving visits from friends and family.</p>

          <p>A financial expert, after studying over 60 couples, identifies five common money mistakes that can strain relationships, emphasizing that love alone isn't enough. Successful couples avoid staying locked in old financial patterns, getting stuck in shame about past financial stories, holding setbacks over their partner's head, constantly fixating on what they don't have, and lying about money usage. The article suggests open communication, mutual support, and realistic goal-setting as crucial for financial harmony. Addressing these deeper issues, rather than just surface-level conflicts, can strengthen a couple's bond.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy is advocating for a shift in the Ryder Cup narrative, urging people to remember Europe's "incredible" performance rather than the unruly spectator conduct. The Masters champion expressed disappointment that fan behavior, including an incident where his wife was hit by a thrown beer, overshadowed the team's dominant victory. McIlroy emphasized the need for a balance between engaging newcomers and preserving golf's centuries-old traditions and values. He believes that encouraging more people to play the game will naturally foster respect for its etiquette, rather than transforming golf into other sports.</p>

          <p>A recent Deloitte survey reveals a notably downbeat economic outlook among most U.S. consumers as the holiday shopping season approaches. Fifty-seven percent expect the economy to weaken, marking the most negative sentiment since 1997, and 77% anticipate higher holiday prices. This pessimism is translating into a planned 10% reduction in average holiday spending, particularly among Gen Z and Millennials. Retailers face a cautious consumer base prioritizing value, with significant cutbacks expected in non-gift holiday expenses.

          <p>US officials have conducted strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea, claiming to target Venezuelan drug traffickers, but the legality of these actions is being questioned by international law experts. President Donald Trump stated the strikes were in self-defense against the Tren de Aragua cartel, which the State Department designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization. However, experts argue that such actions may be unlawful under the law of the sea and the UN charter, as the US is not in an armed conflict with Venezuela or the cartel. Concerns also exist regarding compliance with US constitutional law, as Congress typically holds the power to declare war.</p>

This comes after gloomy economic forecasts and previous welfare cut U-turns have complicated efforts to meet fiscal rules. Analysts estimate a need for around £20 billion in tax rises or spending cuts.
