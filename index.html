          <p>New home prices in China's 70 major cities fell by 0.3% in July, marking a continued slide that government stimulus measures have failed to reverse. This decline matches the sharpest drop in eight months, recorded in June, signaling persistent weak sentiment among potential buyers. While Shanghai saw a slight price increase, most major cities, including Guangzhou and Shenzhen, experienced steady declines, highlighting the ongoing challenges facing the nation's vast property sector.

This follows the club's rejection of a £110 million offer from Liverpool, with the 25-year-old player reportedly still determined to make the move. Rooney noted that while it's a significant loss for Newcastle, financial regulations might make selling Isak beneficial for strengthening the overall squad.</p>

          <p>A recent advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) established that nations have a legal duty to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling, described as the most significant climate development since the 2015 Paris Agreement, suggests that fossil fuel production and subsidies could be considered internationally wrongful acts. Financial experts argue this could force a revaluation of assets tied to fossil fuels, as investors must now account for increased legal and regulatory risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives in Washington, D.C., that limited cooperation between the city's police and federal immigration agents. This action effectively reverses the capital's "sanctuary" policies, allowing the Metropolitan Police Department to fully assist agencies like ICE with immigration enforcement. The move is part of a broader federal crackdown on crime in the city, though D.C. officials have quickly challenged the legality of Bondi's order, creating a potential legal conflict.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling flights as a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants looms, threatening to ground the country's largest airline. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations reached an impasse over issues of pay and working conditions. If a deal is not reached, a full strike could begin Saturday, impacting an estimated 130,000 travelers per day and stranding thousands of Canadians abroad.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan for the state's Democratic lawmakers to redraw congressional district maps, a direct response to a Republican effort in Texas to create more GOP-friendly districts. The move, which would override California's independent redistricting commission, is intended to "neuter and neutralize" the Texas plan and would only take effect if another state advances a partisan mid-cycle gerrymander. Newsom has called for a special election to approve the new map, escalating a national political battle over redistricting.</p>

          <h2>'And Just Like That' Finale Gives Carrie Bradshaw a Fitting, Non-Fairytale Ending</h2>

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending the article describes as more true to the character than a traditional fairytale romance. After the death of her husband Mr. Big and a failed rekindling with an old flame, Carrie accepts a future that may not include another great love. The review argues that this conclusion better honors the original "Sex and the City" theme that friendships, not romantic partners, are one's true soulmates.</p>

Many users who have lost access to personal photos and business accounts believe the platform's AI moderation system is unfairly flagging their content with no effective human appeal process. Meta has not acknowledged a widespread issue, but has often reinstated accounts after being contacted by media outlets about specific cases.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities. The uncrewed aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of standard warships, even in rough seas, without needing a runway, before transitioning to fast, long-range flight. This technological advancement could effectively turn any vessel in the Chinese navy, such as destroyers or frigates, into a small aircraft carrier, significantly expanding its aerial operational range and flexibility.</p>
