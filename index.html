          <p>Voters in North Rhine-Westphalia are participating in local elections, which are seen as an early indicator of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition government's performance since taking office in May. The Christian Democrats (CDU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD), the coalition partners, hope the weather won't impact voter turnout. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) aims to strengthen its position in the region following recent gains in polls, despite being classified as "right-wing extremist" by the domestic intelligence agency. This election's outcome will be closely monitored to assess the political climate in Germany and the strength of various parties.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, the President of the UN General Assembly, suggested the possibility of deploying UN peacekeeping forces to Ukraine to ensure a ceasefire and post-war peace, provided it has the support of most UN member states. Baerbock emphasized the growing need for such peace missions globally. However, any UN peacekeeping mission would require Moscow's approval, given Russia's veto power in the UN Security Council. Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia have stalled, with Russia insisting on addressing what it calls the conflict's "root causes," including Ukraine's NATO and EU aspirations.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, numerous individuals have lost their jobs or faced disciplinary action for their reactions to the event. Those affected include teachers, firefighters, journalists, politicians, a Secret Service employee, and employees of Nasdaq and an NFL team. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, has directed staff to identify military members or Pentagon-affiliated individuals who mocked or condoned Kirk's murder. This crackdown contrasts with past instances where some of these same figures, including Kirk, mocked victims of political violence.</p>

          <p>USC overcame a weather delay and past road struggles to defeat Purdue 33-17 in their first Big Ten road game, marking their first win outside the West since 2012. Quarterback Jayden Maiava led the Trojans' offense with 282 passing yards and a rushing touchdown, supported by Waymond Jordan and Eli Sanders, who combined for 152 rushing yards. Despite a missed field goal and Purdue's attempts to rally, a late interception by safety Bishop Fitzgerald sealed the victory for USC. The Trojans had lost 14 straight games in the Eastern and Central time zones prior to this win, making it a significant milestone for the team.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has requested the arrest and removal of Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, a Cuban national, after he allegedly beheaded a merchant in Texas. Cobos-Martinez, who had a prior removal order to Cuba, was released on supervision in January 2025 during the Biden administration after Cuba declined to accept his return due to his criminal record. ICE criticizes the release and argues the incident could have been prevented if Cobos-Martinez had not been released into the country. The Department of Homeland Security has stated that it is working to remove criminal illegal aliens to third countries.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's reliance on imported energy is considered a critical vulnerability in the event of a conflict with Beijing, with experts warning that a prolonged blockade could quickly paralyze the island. The Foundation for Defence of Democracies (FDD) highlighted this risk in a recent report, noting that Taiwan's limited storage capacity exacerbates the issue. The report suggests that Beijing could use cyber warfare, maritime quarantines, and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan's energy providers to undermine the island's societal resilience and economy.</p>

          <p>Following a historic drought that disrupted vessel transits, the Panama Canal Authority is investing in new infrastructure to mitigate future water shortages. The Authority is considering a land bridge project, including a natural gas pipeline, to move natural gas liquids without relying on the canal. Additionally, they are planning to build the Rio Indo dam to add supplemental water for Lake Gatun, which is crucial for canal operations. These projects aim to ensure the canal's reliability amid climate change impacts, but they face challenges such as community relocation and construction timelines.</p>

          <p>Sikh truck drivers in the U.S. are experiencing increased fear and harassment following a fatal crash in Florida involving a Sikh driver who entered the U.S. illegally. Secretary of State Marco Rubio paused the issuing of work visas for foreign commercial truck drivers after the crash. The Sikh community, which makes up a significant portion of the trucking industry, faces stricter language requirements and increased scrutiny. Community leaders are concerned that these factors, along with rising harassment, will lead to a driver shortage in the industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Academics suggest that increasing or removing the limit on contactless cards could lead to more spontaneous spending, as the PIN prompt serves as a reminder of the amount being spent. The UK's financial regulator has proposed allowing banks and card providers to set their own limits or remove them entirely. While some argue that consumers should be able to set their own contactless limits, others worry about the potential for increased debt and economic abuse. Banks agree with the regulator's proposal, but emphasize that any changes will prioritize security.</p>

Brentford has scored seven goals from long throws since the start of last season, more than any other Premier League team. Brentford's coach, Keith Andrews, suggests there is snobbery around this tactic, but the team continues to utilize it to create scoring opportunities.</p>
