          <p>President Trump participated in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO leaders to coordinate ahead of a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. European allies expressed concern about being excluded from direct peace talks, fearing concessions could be made to Russia without their input. Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine will not cede territory and warned that any negotiations conducted without Ukrainian participation would be ineffective. The discussions highlight the ongoing tensions and strategic alignments as the U.S. pursues diplomatic engagement with Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump has activated National Guard troops, who began arriving near the Washington Monument as part of his announced mission to combat what he terms "out of control" crime in the nation's capital. The troops are tasked with providing logistics, transportation, and administrative support to local law enforcement, as well as maintaining a visible presence. This move follows the president's decision to temporarily take control of the D.C. police department. While the troops will have access to weapons, they are reportedly not going to be carrying them during this deployment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of U.S. adults who drink alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, driven by growing awareness of its health risks. A majority of Americans, particularly younger adults, now believe that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. This shift in public perception aligns with recent scientific consensus that has increasingly linked alcohol consumption to negative outcomes, including cancer. The trend marks a significant change from previous decades when moderate drinking was often considered harmless or even beneficial for heart health.</p>

          <p>Shares of the Mediterranean fast-casual chain Cava plummeted after the company reduced its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth from a range of 6-8% down to 4-6%. The revision came after second-quarter same-store sales rose only 2.1%, significantly missing Wall Street's expectation of 6.1% growth. The company attributed the slowdown to the difficult comparison with the previous year's successful launch of its grilled steak option. This news follows a trend of disappointing results from other fast-casual competitors like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, signaling broader challenges in the sector.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic, is on a path to intensify and likely become the season's first hurricane by late this week. The storm is currently moving westward from the Cabo Verde islands and is projected to approach the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term trajectory remains uncertain. Forecasters predict gradual strengthening, with Erin potentially developing into a major hurricane as it nears the Caribbean, prompting vigilance in the region.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged 13 individuals in connection with a sophisticated scam that defrauded hundreds of elderly Americans, with an average age of 84, out of over $5 million. The scheme, allegedly run from call centers in the Dominican Republic, involved tricking grandparents into believing their grandchildren needed cash for emergencies like bail. The investigation was initiated after Uber's security team flagged suspicious activity, as unknowing drivers were used to transport cash from victims. This case highlights the cruelty of such scams and the role technology companies can play in helping law enforcement.</p>

This move comes amid a diplomatic stalemate following a military conflict with Israel in June and Iran's subsequent suspension of ties with the UN's nuclear watchdog.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated a shift in ceasefire negotiations, now focusing on a comprehensive deal to release all remaining hostages at once, rather than a phased approach. This development comes as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for preliminary talks with Egyptian officials. Meanwhile, the Israeli military has approved the operational plan for a wider offensive in the Gaza Strip, though it is not expected to begin until October. Intense Israeli strikes have continued across Gaza, with dozens of Palestinian casualties reported in the last day.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police's investigation into the late Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed has now received crime reports from 146 individuals, more than double the previous number. The probe is examining historical allegations of sexual assault by Al Fayed and whether others enabled his behavior. In a video update, the Met said it is working with international agencies and that the investigation's timeline is uncertain due to the high number of survivors coming forward. Harrods has also established a compensation scheme, which has received over 100 claims from victims of Al Fayed's abuse.</p>

          <p>Residents in Juneau, Alaska, are evacuating as meltwater from a lake dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier began to escape, threatening record-breaking floods. The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning for the Mendenhall River area after water levels surged, with officials confirming the crest will set a new record. This annual phenomenon, known as a glacial lake outburst flood, has become a growing concern as rising global temperatures shrink glaciers. Governor Mike Dunleavy has declared a state of disaster due to the imminent threat of catastrophic flooding.</p>

          <p>The inspiration for the world-famous Barbie doll was a German character named Lilli, who first appeared in the Bild tabloid in 1952 as a comic strip character designed to appeal to male readers. Often depicted in sensual situations, Lilli was interpreted as a high-class call girl and was not originally intended as a children's toy. In 1955, she was turned into a plastic doll that became a popular gag gift for men. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered the doll, adapted its design, and launched Barbie in 1959, eventually acquiring the rights to Lilli and halting her production.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry announced it had warned and driven away the USS Higgins, a U.S. destroyer, for allegedly entering its territorial waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Beijing accused the U.S. of seriously infringing on its sovereignty and undermining regional stability. In response, the U.S. Seventh Fleet called China's statement false, clarifying that the warship was conducting a routine freedom of navigation operation in accordance with international law. The incident escalates tensions in the strategically vital and contested maritime region, where China and the Philippines also have overlapping claims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage refinancing applications saw a significant 23% increase last week, reaching the highest level since April, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This surge was driven by a slight dip in the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and a notable rise in demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer more attractive rates. While homeowners are actively seeking savings, applications for home purchases remained relatively flat, indicating ongoing affordability challenges in the housing market. The data suggests borrowers with larger loans are particularly sensitive to small changes in interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Latino and international festivals in several small towns across the United States are being canceled this summer due to community fears of immigration raids by ICE. Organizers in towns from Virginia to Washington state have cited a pervasive "climate of fear" that undermines the celebratory purpose of these events. The cancellations have a significant economic impact, affecting small immigrant-owned businesses, vendors, and local authorities who lose permit fees and sponsorship revenue. This trend highlights the disruptive effect of current immigration enforcement policies on the daily lives and cultural fabric of communities.</p>

Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their China revenues in exchange for permission to sell advanced chips there. Concurrently, Apple announced a substantial increase in its U.S. investment commitment, a move seen as a successful bid to gain exemptions from proposed tariffs on semiconductors.

This achievement overcomes a major obstacle in building large-scale, stable quantum computers using neutral atoms.
