          <p>NBA star Luka Dončić has secured his future with the Los Angeles Lakers by signing a three-year, $165 million maximum contract extension. This new agreement, which includes a player option for the 2028-29 season, prevents him from entering free agency next summer and solidifies his role as a cornerstone of the franchise. The deal reflects the team's commitment to building around the 26-year-old guard, who has already influenced offseason recruiting. Team leadership praised Dončić as a transcendent player capable of bringing a championship back to Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>A report from Gothamist alleges that over 50 signatures on New York Mayor Eric Adams' petition for his independent re-election campaign are fraudulent, including those of three deceased individuals. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings add another layer of complexity to the mayoral race. The campaign stated it expects contractors to follow the law and will conduct its own review. An election law attorney noted that it is not uncommon for invalid signatures to be collected during petitioning processes.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a turbulent week, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high before a four-day losing streak, heavily influenced by major economic and political news. A surprisingly weak July jobs report, showing only 73,000 new positions, triggered market anxiety and led President Trump to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner. This, combined with the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, new international tariffs, and mixed earnings reports from tech giants like Amazon and Apple, created significant uncertainty for investors. The week's events underscore the market's sensitivity to both economic data and administration policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has announced successful attacks on key infrastructure inside Russia, including a major oil refinery in Ryazan and an oil storage facility in the Voronezh region. The strikes, conducted by Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, also targeted a military airfield used for launching drones and an electronics factory supplying the Russian military. These operations represent a significant strategic effort by Kyiv to disrupt Russia's war-making capabilities. Meanwhile, reports indicate that India plans to continue purchasing Russian oil despite threats of U.S. penalties, citing long-term contracts.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to counteract a long history of aquatic segregation that has led to significant racial disparities in swimming ability and drowning rates in the U.S. Due to historical exclusion from pools, Black children are far more likely to have little to no swimming ability compared to their white peers. The programs provide accessible lessons and aim to create a ripple effect of more Black swim instructors and lifeguards, which research shows correlates with lower drowning rates. Participants and organizers emphasize that learning to swim is a critical life skill and a public health necessity.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man was arrested at Buffalo Niagara International Airport after allegedly commandeering a transport cart and causing extensive damage to the facility's moving walkways. The suspect, Kevin J Sinning, was reported to be visibly intoxicated during the incident. Video footage circulating on social media shows the cart being driven down hallways and crushing the metal and glass structures of the walkways. Sinning now faces multiple charges, including criminal mischief, grand larceny, and criminal possession of stolen property, for the destructive joyride at the New York airport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has unexpectedly emerged as a national leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year. This growth is primarily driven by major utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on the economic benefits of solar over natural gas. A state rule that fast-tracks approval for smaller solar projects has also accelerated development, alongside community-led initiatives like the solar-powered town of Babcock Ranch. However, the industry faces future challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits, which could slow rooftop solar installations and test the state's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new memoir by Stephen Starring Grant, a former corporate marketer who became a rural mail carrier, sheds light on the crucial and often overlooked work of postal workers. The book, reviewed in The Atlantic, details the challenges and importance of daily mail delivery, particularly in remote Appalachian communities. It argues that postal workers provide a sense of order, predictability, and connection in a country that can often feel divided or chaotic. The review highlights how the memoir portrays mail delivery as a form of quiet heroism, essential for maintaining a sense of normalcy, especially during crises.</p>

          <h2>Trump Suggests Pardoning Sean 'Diddy' Combs is Complicated by Past Criticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated that a potential pardon for music mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs is "more difficult" due to Combs's past hostile statements against him. In a Newsmax interview, Trump remarked that he considers Combs "sort of half-innocent" following his conviction for transportation to engage in prostitution, though he was acquitted of more serious charges. However, Trump cited Combs's past comments, such as calling for him to be "banished," as a complicating factor. This situation reflects Trump's history of using pardon power, often for political supporters, while also being sensitive to personal criticism.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe reveals a stark contrast in how much apartment space a $1,500 monthly rent can secure in different U.S. cities. In Manhattan, that budget gets a renter an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, the same amount affords a spacious 1,329 square feet. The data highlights the extreme housing affordability challenges in major coastal markets like Boston and San Francisco, where supply is limited. In contrast, cities in the Midwest and South offer significantly more space for the money, reflecting lower housing costs and greater land availability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his new HBO Max special, "Panicked," comedian Marc Maron continues to explore themes of anxiety, mortality, and societal decay with his signature cantankerous yet ruminative style. The article reviews the special as the third in a loose trilogy, where Maron confronts both personal issues, like his father's dementia, and catastrophic current events. He uses long-form narratives and dark humor to tackle subjects ranging from his own potential childhood trauma to the decline of American democracy. The review notes that while Maron's temperament has softened over the years, his comedy remains a consistent and powerful vehicle for self-reflection and emotional vulnerability.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has ordered Tesla to pay over $240 million in damages, finding the company partially responsible for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot technology. The jury determined that despite the driver's admitted distraction, Tesla's technology failed, contributing to the death of a 22-year-old woman and severe injuries to her boyfriend. The case was notable for reaching a trial, as many similar suits are settled, and included claims that Tesla initially withheld key data from the vehicle's recorder. Tesla has stated it will appeal the verdict, calling it wrong.</p>

          <p>The monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has surged to an average of €3,248, a sum that is crippling for many retirees. This sharp increase is attributed to rising wages for nursing staff and a higher number of caregivers, but it has placed the country's long-term care insurance system under immense strain. With nearly one in three residents relying on welfare to cover costs, the German Health Minister has called for urgent reform. Experts suggest solutions like introducing federal tax subsidies or requiring higher earners to contribute more to the system to prevent its collapse.</p>

This finding is a setback for National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, who has been seeking evidence of a "deep state" plot against Trump.

Experts suggest that while social connection is vital for well-being, it's important to align spending with personal values and incorporate social costs into a formal budget.
