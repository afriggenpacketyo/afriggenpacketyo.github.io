          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul is spearheading a statewide initiative to restrict cellphone use in K-12 schools throughout the school day, citing concerns over student mental health and academic focus. Hochul, drawing from conversations with parents, teachers, and students, emphasizes the detrimental effects of constant notifications and social media pressures on children's well-being and classroom engagement. The new policy aims to foster a learning environment where students can concentrate, interact face-to-face, and experience a more carefree childhood. Hochul asserts that this measure is essential to combat the addictive nature of social media and restore a sense of normalcy and joy in schools.</p>

          <p>Keen, a U.S.-based footwear company, is committed to maintaining steady prices for its customers this year despite the impact of new U.S. tariffs on imports. The company has proactively diversified its supply chain over the past decade to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China, where many footwear companies manufacture their products. Keen operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and partners with manufacturers in other countries, enabling them to distribute costs and avoid significant price increases. This strategy allows Keen to remain competitive and shield consumers from tariff-related price hikes, unlike some competitors who are already warning of potential price increases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration faces a critical decision regarding whether to defend Biden-era regulations enforcing mental health parity, which mandates that insurers cover mental health and addiction treatment comparably to physical health care. A trade association representing large employers has sued the federal government, arguing that the regulations are overreaching and would increase costs, potentially reducing the quality of care. Mental health advocates urge the administration to uphold the regulations, emphasizing the importance of making mental health care accessible and affordable, as cost remains a significant barrier to treatment for many Americans. The debate centers on whether access issues stem from insurance policies or a shortage of mental health care providers, with differing viewpoints on how to best address the nation's mental health crisis.</p>

Merz, a critic of his predecessor Olaf Scholz, intends to end Germany's perceived "speechlessness" on key European issues and strengthen the country's contribution to the European project. He plans to collaborate closely with France and Poland to bolster European sovereignty, particularly in response to shifts in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump.

          <p>President Vladimir Putin presided over a large Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, with leaders from over 20 countries in attendance. The event, held on Red Square, showcased Russia's military strength and historical significance, amid ongoing tensions and faltering attempts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. While Putin used the parade to highlight national pride and justify the war, Ukrainian President Zelensky dismissed Russia's proposed ceasefire as a "theatrical show." The parade has become a point of division, particularly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Western countries held their own Victory Day celebrations on May 8, symbolizing a rupture with Russia's Soviet past.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security service (SBU) claims to have uncovered a Hungarian-operated spy network seeking intelligence on Ukraine's defenses, detaining two alleged Hungarian spies. The SBU accuses the individuals of gathering information on Ukraine's air defense systems, marking what they claim is the first time they have exposed a Hungarian military intelligence network engaged in espionage activities against Ukraine. These allegations come amid strained relations between Ukraine and Hungary, as Hungarian President Viktor Orban has repeatedly sided with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, despite Hungary being a member of the EU and NATO.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is collaborating with the Israeli government on a new plan to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, following a two-month blockade on food and fuel deliveries. The proposed mechanism involves establishing distribution zones managed by aid workers, with the Israeli military stationed outside the perimeters, aimed at preventing Hamas from controlling aid supplies. However, the United Nations has expressed reservations, citing concerns that the plan reduces the number of distribution points and could leave many civilians without essential supplies, potentially leading to forced displacement. Aid agencies worry about the safety of civilians interacting with Israeli soldiers and the vulnerability of those traveling long distances to reach the distribution hubs.</p>

While he welcomed the UK-US trade agreement, Bailey emphasized the need for more trade agreements to materialize to mitigate the effects of higher overall tariff levels. He hopes this deal will be the first of many, but the overall impact on the UK economy remains uncertain.</p>

The show's producer, Ian McCue, noted the pilot reveals teething problems the team addressed before the official series launch in 1984. Despite these challenges, the pilot retains the charm and timeless storytelling that has contributed to the show's enduring popularity, which is based on themes of friendship, teamwork, and communication.</p>

          <p>The recent trade deal between the UK and the U.S. indicates that a 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners, with limited exceptions, under President Trump's trade policies. While the UK secured tariff reductions for its auto, steel, and aluminum sectors, all other goods imported to the U.S. from the UK will still be subject to a 10% tariff. Analysts suggest that this deal sets a precedent for future trade agreements, with Trump indicating that higher tariffs may be imposed on countries with larger trade surpluses. Some analysts also point out that the deal could negatively impact U.S. economic growth due to the high average tariff rate.</p>

As the U.S. imposes high tariffs on Chinese imports, China is positioning itself as a counterweight to the U.S.'s protectionist policies, with its alliance with Russia serving as a foundation for global stability.

          <p>Recent Chinese government data indicates a significant shift in trade patterns, with exports to Southeast Asian countries surging as shipments to the United States plummet due to increased tariffs. Overall shipments from China jumped by 8.1 percent in April compared to the previous year, driven by increased trade with countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This redirection of trade suggests that Chinese factories are taking advantage of tariff pauses in the region to complete orders destined for the U.S., while domestic producers halt production targeting the U.S. market. Chinese financial regulators are prepared to boost domestic demand to mitigate the trade war's impact, and U.S. and Chinese officials are set to meet in Geneva to discuss trade issues.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, with rising global temperatures and extreme weather events impacting their journeys and ecosystems. Migratory birds, essential for pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control, are facing challenges due to habitat loss, reduced food sources, and increased frequency of storms. Warmer temperatures can lead to shortened migration routes or abandonment of original habitats, causing conflicts with resident animals. Conservation efforts, including expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly environments, are crucial to mitigating these impacts and preserving the vital role migratory birds play in maintaining ecological balance, as their disappearance could significantly affect agriculture and the food chain.</p>

Car tariffs are cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, while a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports has been scrapped, though quotas will be imposed. What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is still unknown with the UK saying work would continue on this and the remaining reciprocal tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin celebrated Russia's Victory Day with a military parade in Moscow, joined by China's Xi Jinping, to project an alliance of anti-Western states. The event included dignitaries from over 20 countries, viewed by some as a sign of Russia's global influence despite Western efforts to isolate Putin after the invasion of Ukraine. In a speech, Putin linked past victories with current conflicts, while the military display did not reflect Russia's battlefield record in Ukraine. The event, historically a unifying moment, has become a point of division, with heavy security measures introduced across Moscow amid fears of Ukrainian attacks.</p>

          <p>Germany's socialist Left Party is experiencing unexpected success, nearly doubling its representation in the Bundestag after winning 8.8% in the federal election. The party's leadership aims to capitalize on this momentum by developing a strategic plan for the next few years, focusing on affordable housing and diplomatic solutions to international conflicts, particularly Russia's war against Ukraine. With a pacifist stance, the Left Party advocates for negotiations and a ceasefire, accusing Western countries of "military tunnel vision." The party has also seen a significant increase in membership, and its influence is growing, as demonstrated by its role in the election of the new Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between India and Pakistan could provide a real-world assessment of advanced Chinese military technology against Western hardware, with Chinese defense stocks already surging. Pakistan claims it used Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets to shoot down Indian combat aircraft, including French-made Rafales, during an aerial battle. As Pakistan's primary arms supplier, China is likely monitoring the performance of its weapon systems closely. This conflict underscores a broader geopolitical realignment, where China has emerged as a major challenge to American influence, and any conflict could effectively be a showdown between Chinese and Western military technologies.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir has brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war, with both countries exchanging missile and drone attacks. The rivalry between the two nations stems from the disputed Kashmir region, which has been a source of conflict since the partition of India in 1947. Both countries claim all of Kashmir, but each controls only part of it, leading to three wars and numerous clashes. The current escalation follows India's revocation of Kashmir's special status in 2019 and a recent terrorist attack, raising concerns of another major conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbors.</p>

Experts suggest that while a deal would boost trade and foreign investment, India must carefully balance the benefits with the need to protect domestic manufacturing.

China's shipments to the U.S. plunged over 21% in April year on year, while exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations surged 20.8%.
