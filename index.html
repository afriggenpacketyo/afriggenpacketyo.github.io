          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs chose not to testify in his ongoing sexual assault trial, which is expected to conclude this week in New York City. Prosecutors have rested their case after calling 34 witnesses over 28 days, attempting to prove that Combs used his business empire to coerce women into sex. The defense presented a brief case, aiming to cast doubt on witness testimonies by suggesting the alleged victims consented to the sexual activities. Closing statements are scheduled for Thursday, with deliberations potentially beginning on Friday, and the judge has reserved a decision on Combs' request for an immediate acquittal.</p>

          <p>Some senators reviewed the initial classified assessment of the U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, leading to questions about the extent of the damage. Democratic senators expressed frustration over the postponement of a formal briefing from the Trump administration, which they deemed "outrageous" and "evasive." The delay occurred as early intelligence suggested the attack only set back Iran's nuclear program by months, a claim disputed by the White House. Lawmakers are seeking answers about the rationale for the strikes and the long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, particularly given the risks to American service members.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Commission approved an updated policy allowing the LAPD to use drones as "first responders" in emergency situations. The drones will provide real-time information to officers and supervisors, enhancing their situational awareness. The policy includes guidelines for drone use during high-risk incidents, investigations, and large-scale events. Critics expressed concerns about potential misuse and disproportionate deployment in communities of color, though officials claim the policy is not intended to track demonstrators engaged in lawful activities.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are proposing a bill that would force the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to sell its new electric vehicle (EV) mail trucks. The bill aims to cut costs and prioritize mail delivery over environmental initiatives. However, the proposal faces opposition, as it would cost more to replace the EVs and the potential for raising money at auction is limited. The move would also hinder the USPS's efforts to modernize its aging fleet and reduce fuel and maintenance costs.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which lived approximately 150 million years ago. The dinosaur, about the size of a labrador, was previously misclassified as a Nanosaurus. Scientists identified unique features in its leg bones, leading to its reclassification. The discovery provides insights into the evolution of early small dinosaurs into larger and more specialized species. The dinosaur's fossilized remains are the most complete of any early small dinosaurs.</p>

Critics also raise concerns about the ultra-processed nature of lab-grown meat and the potential for production to be dominated by multinational companies. While lab-grown meat has been approved for sale in some countries, challenges remain in scaling up production and reducing costs.</p>
