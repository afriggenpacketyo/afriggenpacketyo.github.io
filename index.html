          <p>A German court in Dresden has convicted Jian G., a former parliamentary aide for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, on charges of espionage for China. The judges ruled it a "particularly serious case," finding that he transferred confidential documents from the European Parliament and monitored Chinese dissidents in Europe between 2019 and 2024. This occurred while he was employed by Maximilian Krah, a prominent AfD politician who is himself under a separate investigation related to Chinese payments. The conviction underscores growing concerns about foreign espionage and influence operations targeting political institutions across Europe, particularly those involving far-right parties.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are recommending a prison sentence of more than 11 years for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs following his conviction on prostitution-related charges. In their submission to a New York judge, they cited the serious nature of his crimes and included impactful letters from accusers, such as singer Cassie Ventura, who described living in fear and experiencing extensive abuse. Prosecutors labeled Combs as "unrepentant," directly contrasting with the defense's request for a sentence of no more than 14 months, which argued he has become a changed man while incarcerated. The final sentencing is scheduled to take place on Friday.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 04:18:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States government is on the brink of a shutdown as a critical funding deadline approaches without a legislative agreement between Republicans and Democrats. The central conflict revolves around Democratic demands to extend healthcare tax credits and reverse budget cuts to health agencies, which Republicans have so far been unwilling to concede. If no deal is reached, many non-essential government services will be temporarily halted, which could impact national parks, food assistance programs, and federal workers. This budget confrontation is particularly tense given the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to significantly reduce the size and scope of the federal government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A last-ditch meeting between President Donald Trump and congressional leaders has failed to produce a deal, making a US government shutdown increasingly likely. Both Republicans and Democrats appear to be digging in on their positions, with Vice President JD Vance stating a shutdown seems probable due to Democratic intransigence. Democrats are demanding the renewal of health-insurance subsidies in exchange for their votes, while many Republicans seem comfortable with a closure, with some administration officials suggesting it could be used to permanently eliminate "nonessential" government programs. The political stalemate suggests both parties believe they have more to gain by holding their ground than by compromising.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for governing religious affairs strictly in accordance with the law, describing it as the fundamental method for managing issues in the religious sphere. During a Politburo study session, he stressed the need to enhance relevant laws, conduct legal education, and ensure strict enforcement to resolve contradictions. Xi asserted that promoting the "sinicisation" of religions—adapting them to Chinese political and cultural norms—is what he considers the "only way" to achieve religious, ethnic, and social harmony.

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has definitively ruled out applying a Value Added Tax (VAT) to private healthcare services in the upcoming autumn Budget. Responding to speculation about potential tax increases, Streeting stated unequivocally that the policy "is not happening." The statement comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces pressure to find ways to fund public services without breaking Labour's manifesto pledge against raising income tax, National Insurance, or the standard VAT rate. Despite calls from some within the party to remove the VAT exemption for private healthcare to raise funds for the NHS, the government appears committed to its existing tax promises.</p>

The proposal includes a pathway to a Palestinian state, the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and the disarmament of Hamas. Under the plan, Gaza would be governed by a transitional authority, receive a significant economic development package, and be secured by an international force. Netanyahu expressed support for the plan, stating it achieves Israel's war aims, and warned that Israel would "finish the job" alone if Hamas rejects the deal.</p>

The family was a key player in Laukkaing, a border town transformed into a hub for illegal gambling, drug trafficking, and large-scale telecommunications fraud that victimized many Chinese citizens. After an offensive by insurgent groups dismantled the town's criminal infrastructure, Myanmar authorities arrested and extradited dozens of Ming family members to China.

The judge accused the Trump administration of misleading the court and showing a "brazen disinterest" in its statutory duties, warning that their conduct could have supported civil contempt proceedings.

Critics argue the issue is not the placement of newcomers but the overall lack of available housing, with nearly 50,000 households on the social housing waiting list.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered agents from the FBI, DEA, and other Justice Department agencies to help protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. The directive follows a recent fatal shooting at an ICE office in Dallas, which Bondi characterized as an act of "extreme political violence." A temporary "ICE Protection Task Force" will be formed, and federal prosecutors have been instructed to pursue serious charges against anyone threatening or assaulting law enforcement. This move comes amid a spike in reported attacks on ICE agents and facilities as the Trump administration continues its aggressive immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition government is holding a cabinet retreat in Berlin to address a series of contentious policy issues and rebuild unity amid historically low public approval ratings. Just months into its term, the coalition of the center-right CDU/CSU and the center-left SPD is deeply divided over the national budget, tax policy, welfare reforms, and immigration. Key disagreements include whether to pursue austerity or raise taxes, how to reform the "citizen's income" welfare program, and the potential reintroduction of military conscription. The retreat aims to find common ground and project a more cohesive image to the public.</p>

          <p>A woman who was knocked unconscious during a violent arrest by two Solano County sheriff's deputies in 2020 has secured a $17 million settlement. Nakia Porter, a Black woman, had pulled over with her family to switch drivers when the deputies approached, drew their guns, and slammed her to the pavement while handcuffing her. Body camera footage captured the incident, where Porter can be heard stating she was not resisting before losing consciousness. Porter was jailed overnight but never charged, and her subsequent federal lawsuit accused the deputies of excessive force and lying on their arrest reports.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's 20-point peace plan for Gaza proposes an immediate end to hostilities contingent on Hamas returning all Israeli hostages within 72 hours. In exchange, Israel would release a significant number of Palestinian prisoners and begin a phased withdrawal from parts of the territory. The plan envisions Gaza being governed by a temporary "technocratic" Palestinian committee, overseen by an international "Board of Peace" chaired by Donald Trump, and secured by an international stabilization force. While the proposal acknowledges Palestinian aspirations for statehood as a long-term possibility, it requires the complete disarmament and removal of Hamas from power.</p>

          <p>Moroccan police have detained dozens of people, including rights activists, as they moved to suppress a third day of youth-led protests calling for reforms in education and healthcare. Authorities deployed a heavy security presence in major cities like Rabat and Casablanca to prevent gatherings organized by anonymous online youth networks. Protesters have voiced frustration that the government is investing in stadiums for the 2030 World Cup while neglecting essential public services. The demonstrations reflect broader discontent over high youth unemployment and social inequality in the North African nation, with activists condemning the arrests as a crackdown on free expression.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Germany's Anti-Diversity Backlash is a Strategic Move, Not Fatigue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 00:00:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent decline in support for diversity initiatives within Germany's cultural institutions is not a sign of fatigue but a deliberate political strategy. The author, Fatma Aydemir, contends that a push for a supposed "neutrality" is a reactionary move that masks a defense of existing privileges and the status quo. This backlash is fueled by the far-right AfD party, which frames diversity as "ideological indoctrination," but also comes from within progressive circles that resist change. The article warns that when institutions abandon diversity missions, they lose not only representation but also complexity and truth in art.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are adopting strategies from European discounters like Aldi to win back price-sensitive consumers. Amid a slowing economy, these chains are streamlining their stores and heavily promoting their own private-label brands, which offer quality comparable to name brands at lower prices. This shift towards a value-focused model aims to reverse a slump in the sector, which saw flat sales and a nearly 10% decline in store counts among top operators last year. The trend reflects a broader change in Chinese consumer behavior, with shoppers becoming more rational and prioritizing value for money.</p>

This key personnel change places the 60-year-old in charge of a provincial economy larger than that of many countries. Meng's promotion follows his tenure in Shenzhen, where he navigated economic challenges posed by the pandemic, a property downturn, and US-China trade tensions. The move is part of a broader reshuffle of provincial leadership, with the incumbent governor, Wang Weizhong, being transferred to lead Inner Mongolia.</p>

The FBI is investigating the incident as an "act of targeted violence." According to police, the 40-year-old suspect, an Iraq war veteran, drove his vehicle through the church doors during Sunday services and opened fire with an assault rifle. Officials stated the attack may have been motivated by hatred against people of the Mormon faith. The incident has prompted increased police patrols around places of worship in the area.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major Category 3 storm, is expected to generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast this week. While the storm's center is forecast to pass to the west of Bermuda, its powerful swells will impact a wide area of the western Atlantic. The National Hurricane Center has warned that these conditions will affect coastlines from the northern Leeward Islands up to the Carolinas. Meanwhile, forecasters are also monitoring Tropical Storm Imelda, which is expected to become a hurricane but is projected to move away from the southeastern United States.</p>
