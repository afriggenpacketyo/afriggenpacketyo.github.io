          <p>The Israeli army announced the recovery of the body of Nattapong Pinta, a Thai national who was taken hostage during the Hamas-led attack in October 2023, from the Rafah area of southern Gaza. Pinta, who worked as an agricultural laborer in southern Israel, was likely killed in the early months of his captivity by the Mujahideen Brigades. The recovery mission followed information obtained from the interrogation of a captured terrorist, bringing a close to 20 months of uncertainty for Pinta's family. This retrieval occurred after the bodies of an elderly Israeli couple were also found in Gaza, and amid ongoing incidents near aid distribution centers where several Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Spending Review is expected to show a significant increase in overall government spending in the UK, with projections reaching over Â£650 billion by 2029-30, approximately Â£100 billion more than when Labour took office. Despite the overall rise, internal government disputes persist, particularly regarding departmental allocations, as the Home Office argues for more funding to meet policing promises. While the review highlights substantial investments in long-term projects and favored departments like the NHS, concerns remain about the potential for austerity-like conditions in other areas. The Chancellor aims to present a compelling narrative of rebuilding Britain through security, health, and investment, while also facing pressure from both political opponents and financial institutions.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Operation Spider's Web, which involved smuggling drones into Russia to attack airbases, holds important lessons for China regarding modern warfare and asymmetric tactics. The operation demonstrated how seemingly secure locations can be vulnerable to drone technology and infiltration, even without long-range missiles or bombers. Military analysts suggest that China should learn from this and enhance its defenses against similar infiltration tactics targeting military bases. The success of the operation served as a wake-up call for militaries globally, highlighting the evolving nature of drone warfare.</p>

          <p>A decade-long study interviewing parents of highly successful children revealed five key strategies: fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to individual children, recognizing learning opportunities in everyday tasks, cultivating a love for knowledge, and motivating with love rather than coaching. Parents who encouraged a sense of possibility and tailored their approach based on their child's interests saw greater academic success. The study also emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and everyday learning, moving away from a focus on hard work towards fostering curiosity and a genuine love of learning. Ultimately, the most effective parents supported their children with love and joy, acting as supporters rather than critics.</p>

He notes the feud between Trump and Elon Musk as an example of two unstable characters interacting, raising concerns about how the wider world perceives this instability.

          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges following a public falling out between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The feud, sparked by a policy disagreement over Trump's spending bill, escalated into a social media battle, causing Tesla's shares to plummet and wiping out billions in value. The strained relationship could impact Tesla's regulatory landscape, government support, and tariff exemptions. Additionally, Tesla faces increased competition from Chinese EV makers and consumer backlash due to Musk's political activities, contributing to a decline in revenue and prompting concerns from investors and public officials about the company's future.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared that young people often make the mistake of feeling pressured to know their life's purpose early in their careers, advocating instead for exploration and learning from diverse experiences. Drawing from his own career path, which included roles in sportscasting, investment banking, and retail, Jassy emphasized the importance of discovering what one doesn't want to do as much as what one does. He credited his success to his willingness to find out what he was good at and what he liked, rather than doggedly following a strong vision of what he wanted to do. Jassy also highlighted the significance of reliability, trustworthiness, and a strong work ethic in achieving success.</p>

          <p>The NHS app in England is set to become the primary method of communication for millions more patients, with a Â£50 million investment aimed at sending test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly to smartphones. This shift away from traditional letters is projected to save the health service Â£200 million over the next three years, as at least 50 million letters are sent to patients annually. While those without app access will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, the goal is to improve patient access to healthcare management and free up NHS phone lines.
