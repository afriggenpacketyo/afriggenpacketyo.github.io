          <p>Donald Trump and his family are facing scrutiny for allegedly profiting from his presidency through various ventures, surpassing previous administrations in scale and scope. The family has reportedly collected millions in fees from a new cryptocurrency, brokered overseas real estate deals, and opened an exclusive club in Washington with exorbitant membership fees. Critics argue that Trump has dismantled ethical boundaries and accountability measures, leading to a normalization of moneymaking schemes that would have previously sparked outrage and investigations. Despite these concerns, the White House defends Trump's actions, stating he abides by applicable conflict of interest laws, though these laws do not apply to the president.

Iran cited France's failure to support Palestinians in Gaza and demanded an official explanation.

          <p>Allies of President Trump are beginning to request that elite law firms fulfill their commitments to provide free legal work for causes supported by him. This follows agreements between the Trump administration and several large law firms, in exchange for sparing them from executive orders, to provide nearly $1 billion in pro bono legal work. Veterans and conservative groups have been among those reaching out to firms like Skadden, Kirkland & Ellis, and Paul Weiss for assistance. However, the firms are navigating how to satisfy these commitments without compromising their autonomy or alienating their staff.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) following a controversial refereeing decision during their 2-0 loss to Manchester United. The club argues that a "big mistake" by referee Thomas Bramall denied them a crucial goal when Morgan Rogers dispossessed the United goalkeeper and scored, but the play was prematurely halted. Villa's director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, expressed dissatisfaction with the selection of an inexperienced referee for such a significant match, especially when more seasoned international referees were available.</p>

This contradicts Japan's launch of the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), aimed at promoting net-zero emissions in Asia.
