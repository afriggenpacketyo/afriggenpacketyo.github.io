            <p>A U.S. missionary pastor, Josh Sullivan, was abducted at gunpoint from his church in South Africa while delivering a sermon. Four armed and masked individuals entered the Fellowship Baptist Church in Motherwell, robbed cell phones, and then kidnapped the 45-year-old pastor, who arrived in South Africa from Tennessee in 2018 to plant a church. Police are investigating the incident as a potential kidnapping for ransom, a crime that has been increasing in South Africa. Supporters are praying for Sullivan's safe return, as police work to locate him.</p>

            <p>The UK government is recalling Parliament for a rare Saturday session to pass emergency legislation aimed at preventing the imminent closure of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. The legislation would allow ministers to take control of the site, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, and ensure continued operation. The move opens the door to potential nationalization of the company, with the government stating that "all options" remain on the table to safeguard the UK's steel industry.</p>

He had previously stated that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, weaker economic growth, and potentially even a recession. (not investment advice)</p>
