          <p>Former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams is suing the BBC for damages over a Spotlight program and online article alleging he sanctioned the murder of Denis Donaldson in 2006, an allegation Adams denies.

          <p>Starbucks is adjusting its strategy by reducing automation and increasing barista staffing to improve customer experience. The company will halt the rollout of its Siren system and invest in hiring more baristas, expanding its 'Green Apron service model.' This decision follows slower sales growth and aims to win back customers through personal touches and improved service. While Starbucks is scaling back on automation, it continues to test algorithms to reduce wait times. Optimism Score: 70</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas, appointed by President Trump, has blocked the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport Venezuelan immigrants in South Texas. Judge Fernando Rodriguez, Jr., ruled that the act's use was unlawful and exceeded the statute's scope. The decision affects the Southern District of Texas and is based on the judge's interpretation that the act requires a military incursion, which the activities of the Tren de Aragua gang do not constitute.

So, for example, if you owe $10,000 on a credit card, you might reasonably offer $5,000 to $7,000 as a lump-sum settlement.

The Trump administration defended Hegseth’s ink: In an email, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson said that Hegseth’s tattoos “depict Christian symbols and mottos used by Believers for centuries,” and that “anyone attempting to paint these symbols and mottos as ‘extreme’ is engaging in anti-Christian bigotry.” Optimism Score: 20</p>
