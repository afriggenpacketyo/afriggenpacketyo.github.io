          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing Senate Bill 17, designed to prevent entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing land in Texas, particularly near critical infrastructure. Representative Cole Hefner emphasizes that the bill targets actions and affiliations, not ethnicity, focusing on protecting Texans from foreign espionage and influence. The law empowers the state's attorney general to investigate and block land deals posing risks to public health or safety, with exemptions for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. SB17 is set to take effect Sept. 1, and Hefner hopes it will inspire a nationwide effort to secure the homeland.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan escalated their armed confrontation, initiating air strikes and drone attacks after weeks of tensions stemming from a terrorist attack in Kashmir. Pakistan accused India of targeting its air bases with missiles, prompting retaliatory actions targeting Indian air bases and a missile storage site. The conflict marks the first use of drones by both countries, potentially reshaping their hostilities. The international community urges restraint as the situation threatens regional stability; however, the two countries appear to be ignoring statements from the United States and Europe calling for calm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK, attracted by generous tax incentives and lower labor costs. In 2024, 65% of UK production spending came from major US film studios and streaming giants, amounting to Â£1.37bn, nearly a 50% increase from the previous year. The UK's Film Tax Relief offers a 25% tax rebate, making it cheaper to produce films compared to the US, where incentives operate on a state level. Films like Jurassic World: Dominion saved millions by shooting in the UK, highlighting the financial benefits driving this trend.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will not run in next year's Georgia Senate race against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, citing her unwillingness to fight for a team that refuses to win. Greene's decision follows Governor Brian Kemp's choice not to seek the Republican nomination, leaving the primary field open. Recent elections in Georgia have been closely contested, highlighting the importance of the seat to both parties' Senate ambitions. Greene's polling numbers against Ossoff lagged behind Kemp's, influencing her decision to remain in the House.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for undocumented migrants. Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller argued that the Constitution allows for suspension during an invasion, claiming undocumented migrants pose a national security threat. Legal experts contend that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and unilateral suspensions by the President are unconstitutional. This consideration follows similar attempts to invoke the Alien Enemies Act for expedited deportations, which were previously blocked by federal judges.</p>

          <p>Financial decoupling between China and the US is increasing as mutual trust erodes amid ongoing trade tensions.

Experts note that the loss of trust is particularly damaging to financial relations, which heavily rely on long-term commitments.

Google states the agreement settles old claims, some of which relate to product policies the company has already changed, and that no new product changes are required.

          <p>President Trump hinted at potentially lowering tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff "seems right" before upcoming trade talks in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators, marking the first publicly announced meeting since the trade war began. Analysts suggest the move is part of the negotiation process, with expectations of further reductions. A deal would be a welcome sign for businesses and consumers affected by the trade war.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have issued an annual statewide quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating mussels harvested along the West Coast due to potential paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. Biotoxins occur when algae bloom, causing shellfish to accumulate toxins in their tissue. Commercially grown mussels are exempt from the quarantine as they are regularly tested for toxins.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, has been released from ICE custody after a federal judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration, allegedly due to her political speech. Judge William Sessions criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, noting the case rested solely on an op-ed she co-wrote. Ozturk's legal team argued she was targeted for criticizing the university's response to resolutions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miller, White House Deputy Chief of Staff, announced that the Trump administration is considering suspending habeas corpus for migrants, citing the Constitution's allowance during times of invasion. This would curtail the right to challenge detention in court.

Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, raising questions about the legality of such a move.</p>
