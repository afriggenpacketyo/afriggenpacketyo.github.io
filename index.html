          <p>President Donald Trump joined world leaders in Egypt to sign a Gaza peace deal following Hamas's release of all living hostages. The "Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity" outlines commitments to protect human rights, guarantee security, and resolve disputes through diplomacy. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was absent due to a Jewish holiday, though he and Trump praised each other beforehand. Trump declared a "new dawn in the Middle East," emphasizing the rebuilding of Gaza and urging Iran to work towards a peace deal. The agreement marks a turning point for the region, but the path to lasting peace remains uncertain.</p>

The two people on the helicopter were safely pulled from the wreckage, while three pedestrians were also injured. Video footage shows the helicopter spinning before crashing into palm trees and a pedestrian bridge, with an object falling from it moments before the crash. The FAA and NTSB have been notified, and an investigation report is expected within 30 days, with the event organizers proceeding with the Cars 'N Copters event. The incident is under investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new review by the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office has reaffirmed that Ellen Greenberg’s death was a suicide, despite her sustaining 20 stab wounds. The 27-year-old schoolteacher was found dead in her locked apartment in 2011 after returning home early from work. Her fiancé discovered her body after forcing open the door when she didn’t respond, and he was never a suspect. The family's attorney says that the review was "a deeply flawed attempt to justify a predetermined conclusion", with the family vowing to continue seeking justice for her murder through other avenues. The circumstances of her death continue to be debated.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for the 11th time, marking another test flight in the development of the Mars-bound spacecraft. The booster made a controlled entry into the Gulf, and the spacecraft descended into the Indian Ocean, with no recovery planned. This test flight included more maneuvering for the spacecraft, with a series of tests planned during its entry over the Indian Ocean. NASA needs the Starship to land astronauts on the moon by the end of the decade, and SpaceX is modifying its Cape Canaveral launch sites to accommodate Starships.</p>

          <p>Missouri has implemented a new hands-free law targeting distracted drivers, with a first offense costing $150. The law was prompted by the death of Randall Siddens, who was killed by a distracted driver in 2019. The Missouri Department of Transportation aims to identify distracted driving hot spots using telematics data gathered anonymously from smartphones and vehicles. This data reveals that distracted driving may be more prevalent than indicated by police crash reports, with authorities hoping to increase educational programs and law enforcement visibility in high-risk areas. The goal is to reduce the number of deaths and injuries caused by distracted driving.</p>

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder-for-hire of her former son-in-law, Daniel Markel. Markel was killed in 2014 amid a custody battle with Adelson's daughter, with Adelson found guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation. Adelson maintained her innocence during the sentencing, but the judge cited her lack of remorse. The case has captivated Florida for over a decade, with Adelson being the fifth person sentenced for the crime.</p>

          <p>Under a new California law, fire victims can receive up to $350,000 for personal property losses without submitting an itemized list. The bill, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to provide quicker financial support to those who have lost their homes in wildfires. The law also extends the time for filing itemized claims to at least 100 days. Newsom also signed Senate Bill 429, funding the nation’s first public wildfire catastrophe model, which will be a benchmark for proprietary computer models insurance companies are now using.</p>

The CPS dropped charges due to a lack of evidence that China was officially considered a national security threat at the time of the alleged offences. Jarvis dismissed claims that the government deliberately collapsed the case and blamed the previous Tory government for being too slow to update national security laws.
