          <p>Home Depot's stock increased by 3% after the company reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, signaling confidence despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. This marks the first time since 2014 that the retailer fell short on both metrics, attributing the performance to a "deferral mindset" among homeowners due to economic uncertainty. However, the company noted positive momentum with a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions over $1,000 and improved sales trends each month throughout the quarter, suggesting underlying resilience in its business.

          <p>President Trump convened a meeting at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and seven European leaders to advance discussions on ending the war with Russia. The talks, which followed a recent summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, focused on potential peace proposals and the reactions from each side. This diplomatic effort aims to find a viable framework for peace, though significant challenges remain in bridging the gap between Ukrainian and Russian demands. The international gathering signals a concerted push to resolve the long-standing conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite two recent high-profile summits, President Trump's efforts to broker peace in Ukraine face considerable hurdles, with few tangible breakthroughs achieved. While Trump has appeared open to providing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a key demand from Kyiv, the specifics of such a commitment remain vague. A major challenge is the uncertainty surrounding Russian President Vladimir Putin's genuine interest in ending the conflict while his forces are making battlefield gains. The diplomatic process is further complicated by Trump's own mercurial foreign policy approach and potential opposition from his non-interventionist base.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative David Schweikert is contemplating a run for governor of Arizona, a move that could significantly alter the GOP primary field. He joins a race that already includes Rep. Andy Biggs and businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robson, both of whom have been endorsed by former President Donald Trump. Schweikert's potential candidacy is reportedly driven by concerns from some Arizona conservatives that the current candidates may not be able to defeat incumbent Democrat Governor Katie Hobbs. His entry would create another competitive primary in a state with several closely watched toss-up races.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has officially registered a local unit as a car manufacturer in Argentina, signaling a potential move to begin vehicle production in the country. The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina S.A.U. to manufacture, import, and sell vehicles, batteries, and auto parts, covering the entire EV supply chain. This development is part of BYD's broader expansion strategy in Latin America, which also includes Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. If production plans are confirmed, this would mark the company's second vehicle factory in the region, further solidifying its global manufacturing footprint.</p>

This follows a White House directive for a comprehensive review of eight Smithsonian museums to ensure they align with the administration's view of the American story. The move suggests that federal funding could be used as leverage, mirroring tactics that have targeted universities' research funding and tax-exempt status.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Metro Ridership Continues to Decline, with ICE Raids Cited as a Potential Factor</h2>

          <p>Ridership on Los Angeles Metro's bus system continued to decline in July, following a sharp drop in June that coincided with federal immigration raids across the county. While bus ridership often sees a seasonal dip in summer, the significant plunge in June has raised concerns that fear within the large Latino rider base is contributing to the trend. More than 60% of Metro's bus riders are Latino, and a viral video of an arrest at a Pasadena bus stop amplified anxieties about being targeted on public transit. The decline presents another challenge for the agency, which is already facing financial deficits and had only recently seen ridership recover to 90% of pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>Following a series of meetings with European leaders, President Trump is now working to arrange the first face-to-face summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the war began. Trump stated he has spoken with Putin, who was receptive to the idea, and that a location for the meeting, possibly Budapest, could be decided this week. The plan is for the two leaders to meet bilaterally first, after which Trump might join for a trilateral session to finalize a peace agreement. This diplomatic push follows discussions about providing U.S.-coordinated security guarantees for Ukraine, though Trump has specified this would not involve U.S. ground troops.</p>

          <p>French authorities have opened an investigation into the death of Raphaël Graven, a 46-year-old streamer known as Jeanpormanove, who died during a live broadcast. Graven was known for participating in extreme challenges that reportedly involved violence and sleep deprivation, and he was found dead at a residence in Contes, near Nice. A French government minister described the circumstances as an "absolute horror," highlighting the months of humiliation Graven endured. The streaming platform Kick stated it is urgently reviewing the situation, while fellow streamers have asked the public not to share clips showing the final moments of his life.</p>

          <p>Hopes for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza are in doubt after an Israeli official stated that the government is demanding the release of all 50 remaining hostages, not just a portion. This position casts a shadow on a new proposal from Qatar and Egypt, which Hamas had agreed to and which reportedly involves the release of about half the hostages in stages. The official clarified that Israel is not interested in "partial deals" and that Prime Minister Netanyahu has laid out a new plan for Gaza's future. With the Israeli cabinet expected to approve a military plan to occupy Gaza City, the prospects for a diplomatic resolution appear increasingly slim.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>S&P Global has maintained its AA+ credit rating for long-term U.S. sovereign debt, citing an expectation that revenue from President Trump's tariffs will largely offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The ratings agency projects that "meaningful" tariff revenue will counteract the weaker fiscal outcomes associated with the bill, which the CBO estimated would increase the deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. However, S&P warned it could lower the rating in the future if deficits continue to rise due to political inability to control spending or if political instability threatens U.S. institutions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The senior living real estate market is facing a significant supply shortage as demand rapidly increases with the aging baby boomer population. Over the next five years, more than 4 million boomers will turn 80, yet annual inventory growth for senior housing has fallen below 1% for the first time since 2006. High interest rates are a primary barrier to new development, creating what experts call a "catastrophic problem" for the industry. This supply-demand imbalance is creating a strong investment opportunity, with real estate investment trusts like Ventas and private firms aggressively acquiring existing properties below replacement cost.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the season, is forcing evacuations on North Carolina's Outer Banks and causing beach closures along the East Coast due to dangerous surf conditions. Although the storm is expected to remain offshore, authorities have issued tropical storm watches and warned of significant coastal flooding and powerful rip currents from Florida to New England. The evacuations on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke come during peak tourist season for the vulnerable barrier islands. Officials are concerned that several days of high winds and heavy surf could wash out portions of the main highway, potentially leaving some areas inaccessible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The last remaining sugar beet processing factory in California, located in Brawley, is set to shut down after 78 years of operation, effectively ending the state's sugar beet farming industry. The Southern Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative, which owns the plant, cited escalating operational costs and challenging economic conditions in the U.S. sugar market as reasons for the closure. The decision will eliminate approximately 700 local jobs and a $243-million industry in the Imperial Valley, a region already facing high unemployment. Due to federal regulations, local farmers will be unable to process their beets at facilities in other states.</p>
