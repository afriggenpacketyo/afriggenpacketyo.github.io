            <p>The author reflects on the southern live oak tree, particularly its unique ability to send branches down to the ground and create new trunks, as a symbol of renewal and hope following a personal loss. Native to the Southeastern United States, these trees are known for their longevity, often living over a thousand years, and their sturdy nature. The author connects the tree's resilience and life-giving properties to the themes of Easter, Earth Day, and Arbor Day, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the beauty and potential for renewal in the natural world. The essay encourages readers to find hope and inspiration in the everyday biological world, seeing trees as more than just resources but as essential parts of our lives.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is grappling with a nearly $1 billion budget shortfall, potentially leading to significant cuts and layoffs of city workers. The city faces challenges including slowing home construction, a declining entertainment industry, and economic threats from trade wars and immigration policies. Bass is seeking financial relief from the state and negotiating with employee unions for concessions to avoid layoffs, while also trying to maintain key services and address homelessness. The situation has raised concerns about the city's future and the potential impact on Bass's reelection prospects.</p>

The system, a 3D grid filled with products, coordinates fleets of robots moving at high speeds. Robotic arms use computer vision and deep learning to pack groceries efficiently, while digital twin technology simulates and optimizes warehouse operations. This technology is also being explored for applications beyond groceries, such as vertical farming and airport baggage handling.

            <p>As President Trump's tariffs disrupt global trade, humor has emerged as an unexpected response, with countries and organizations using memes and satire to critique the policies. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., has actively created memes mocking the tariffs, while other nations have employed humor to express their discontent. Political scientists suggest that humor serves as a coping mechanism and a form of political expression in response to the stressful and often absurd nature of the trade war. This trend highlights the use of internet culture and satire as tools in international relations.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A Los Angeles Times analysis reveals that California paid departing state workers $413 million last year for unused time off, contributing to a $5.6 billion unfunded liability for vacation and leave benefits. Generous time-off provisions and a failure to enforce vacation balance caps have led to employees accumulating significant amounts of unused leave. The state's unfunded liability has increased nearly 45% since 2019, raising concerns among government watchdog groups about the financial implications for the state, especially during a recession. Experts suggest that the current system is fiscally irresponsible but politically difficult to change due to the power of public-sector unions.</p>

            <p>This article examines the anti-Trump protests in the US and draws parallels with the Czech Republic's successful movement against its then-Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, who had been labeled "the Czech Trump". It suggests that mass protests, while not guaranteed to immediately topple a government, can weaken it, shape public opinion, and embolden opposition politicians, ultimately contributing to electoral change. The article emphasizes the importance of unity among diverse political forces and the need for a clear message to pressure political leaders to take action. The Czech example offers a glimmer of hope for US protesters seeking to challenge authoritarian tendencies.</p>

            <p>China has taken a more direct approach in the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, urging Kigali to end its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw troops from the DRC. This marks a shift from China's usual non-interference policy in African conflicts. Beijing's involvement is driven by its need to protect its mining interests and maintain relationships with both countries. This move indicates China's growing willingness to assert its influence in Africa to safeguard its economic interests.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to the US worth more than $800 due to increased customs red tape following the introduction of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The delivery giant cited a "significant increase" in formal customs clearances, causing delays. The White House is also set to clamp down on low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, impacting fast-fashion firms and low-cost retailers. These measures are aimed at addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain and preventing illicit substances from entering the US, but Beijing has criticized them as unreasonable and bullying.</p>

            <p>The author reflects on the changing nature of America, contrasting past experiences of openness and opportunity with the current climate of travel advisories, arbitrary detentions, and a sense of impunity. The essay mourns the loss of the "America I loved," characterized by a sense of carelessness, openness, and the promise of upward social mobility. It contrasts this with the current political climate dominated by Donald Trump and a sense of disillusionment among both elites and ordinary people. The author concludes by preserving memories of a better America in a metaphorical genizah, hoping for a future return to its ideals.</p>
