            <p>Mikal Mahdi, convicted of two separate 2004 murders, was executed by firing squad in South Carolina after his appeals were denied by state and U.S. Supreme Courts. Mahdi chose the firing squad over lethal injection and the electric chair, declining a final statement before the execution. He was sentenced to death for the murder of an off-duty police officer and life in prison for the murder of a convenience store clerk. This marks the second firing squad execution in South Carolina in five weeks and the fifth execution overall in the state in the past eight months, leaving 26 inmates on death row in the state.</p>

            <p>Alaska lawmakers face budget uncertainty due to President Trump's fluctuating tariffs and oil price drops, impacting the state's reliance on oil revenue. The volatility has intensified debates over allocating funds between the oil-wealth fund dividend for residents and essential services like education. Governor Dunleavy supports increased oil and gas drilling, hoping for economic benefits, while some leaders see potential in Trump's tariffs to attract investment in Alaska's LNG project. Lawmakers are struggling to balance the dividend payments with funding for critical public services amidst these economic challenges.</p>

            <p>Millions of Beijing residents were advised to stay indoors as the city experienced its strongest winds in decades, resulting in suspended flights and public transportation. The winds, originating from a cold vortex in Mongolia, triggered an orange-level warning for strong winds and raised concerns about sandstorms reaching Shanghai. The extreme weather led to darkened skies, thunderstorms, and reports of fallen trees across the capital, with some residents sealing their windows for safety. Weather stations recorded winds of Force 7 or higher, with gusts reaching Force 14 in some areas.</p>

            <p>Residents in Wales are increasingly worried about the growing threat of wildfires due to climate change, as a recent blaze came dangerously close to homes in Treorchy. Milder winters and spring droughts are contributing to increased foliage growth, making conditions ripe for more frequent and longer-lasting fires, according to wildfire researchers. Firefighters are stretched thin, and residents are concerned about the impact on wildlife and the ability to respond to other emergencies. Some suggest controlled burns to manage gorse, while others focus on risk management plans for high-risk areas.</p>

            <p>President Trump's reversal on tariffs has sparked confusion and uncertainty among economists and businesses, raising concerns about his dealmaking credibility. While officials tout the move as a strategic masterstroke, critics compare it to 'the boy who cried wolf,' eroding confidence in trade agreements. The inconsistent implementation of tariffs has led to market volatility, consumer uncertainty, and delayed business investments. Economists warn of potential stagflation due to increased costs and supply chain disruptions, exacerbated by tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

            <p>A popular Swedish eco-retreat, Stedsans, has been embroiled in scandal after investigations revealed the owners fled to Guatemala to evade tax authorities, leaving behind environmental damage and unpaid debts. The retreat, once celebrated as a model of sustainable living, allegedly pumped wastewater into the forest and abandoned animals. This incident raises questions about the authenticity of sustainable tourism in Scandinavia and the challenges of running eco-friendly businesses. The story serves as a reminder to critically assess claims of sustainability and not to take social media portrayals at face value.</p>

            <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown argues that the existing global order is crumbling due to factors like economic power shifts, the rejection of globalization, and the rise of populist leaders. He calls for a new global charter based on principles of international cooperation, fair burden-sharing, and addressing the failures of hyper-globalization. Brown suggests practical cooperation on global security, climate, health, and trade, along with modernizing international institutions. He emphasizes the need for a values-based order built on principle rather than expediency, drawing inspiration from the Atlantic Charter of 1941.</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering nationalizing British Steel to prevent its collapse after its Chinese owners requested a large bailout. Parliament is being recalled to grant the business secretary the power to intervene, potentially buying coal to keep the furnaces running. While the Chinese owners remain shareholders for now, the government's actions suggest a move towards public ownership is likely. The decision is driven by the need to preserve domestic steel production for infrastructure and defense, aligning with a broader shift towards greater government intervention in strategic industries.</p>
