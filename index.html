          <p>Approximately 700 U.S. Marines were mobilized to support the California National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal personnel and property, according to NBC News. President Trump stated he would support arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions. Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced they would sue Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for deploying the National Guard to deal with protests, arguing the federalization was unlawful and exceeded Trump's authority. The lawsuit claims Trump's action violates the U.S. Constitution and federal law, marking the first time a president has activated a state's National Guard without a governor's request since 1965. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York dismissed Justin Baldoni's lawsuit against Blake Lively, which stemmed from a legal feud that began in December 2024. Judge Lewis J.

Lively's lawyers called the dismissal a "total victory" and plan to seek attorneys' fees and damages against Baldoni. The case originated from Lively's complaint accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of "It Ends With Us," which he denied.</p>

          <p>Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees responded to Boston Red Sox rookie Hunter Dobbins' pre-game statement that he would rather retire than sign with the Yankees by hitting a 436-foot home run. Despite Judge's initial success, Dobbins pitched solidly for the rest of the game, and the Red Sox ultimately won 11-7. Judge hit another home run in the ninth inning, finishing the game with three hits, three runs scored, and four RBIs. The Red Sox took the series two games to one, marking their first series win of the year.</p>

This decision comes amid increasing global threats and concerns about Canada's military preparedness, with plans to invest in new submarines, aircraft, ships, and other equipment.
