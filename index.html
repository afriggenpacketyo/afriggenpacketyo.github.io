          <p>Fans gathered in Birmingham, England, to honor legendary Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, who passed away at 76. A funeral procession traveled through the city center, passing a canal bridge named for the band, where fans have left flowers and messages. The event, held before a private family funeral, was organized by the city to provide a public, dignified tribute to the musician known as the Prince of Darkness. Following his death, his iconic song "Crazy Train" entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of high-income American households, those earning over $150,000 annually, are falling behind on credit card and car payments, with delinquencies more than doubling since 2023. Economists attribute this trend to a weaker job market for white-collar workers and rising housing costs, which have eroded the financial cushion these households previously enjoyed. This development raises concerns for the broader U.S. economy, as wealthier consumers now account for about half of all consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Figures associated with the 'Make America Healthy Again' movement, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are facing criticism for attributing chronic conditions like autism, ADHD, and diabetes to individual lifestyle choices. This rhetoric has led some patients and medical groups to feel unfairly blamed for their illnesses, arguing it ignores systemic factors and promotes misinformation. These attitudes are reportedly influencing policy decisions, such as cutting Medicaid and resisting coverage for anti-obesity drugs, which critics say harms public health by fostering distrust in modern medicine.</p>

          <p>Colombian winger Luis Diaz has officially transferred from Liverpool to the German champions, Bayern Munich, in a deal valued at £65.5 million. The 28-year-old signed a four-year contract, ending his successful tenure at Anfield where he won four major trophies, including the Premier League. In a farewell message, Diaz stated he was leaving with a sense of "duty fulfilled" and that his departure would have been a "perfect goodbye" if not for the recent tragic death of a teammate. During his time at Liverpool, he was a key offensive player, scoring 41 goals in 148 appearances.</p>

          <p>German sportswear company Adidas announced it will raise prices for American consumers to offset an additional €200 million in costs resulting from new U.S. tariffs. The tariffs affect goods from Vietnam and Indonesia, where nearly half of Adidas's products are manufactured. The company's CEO, Bjorn Gulden, stated the tariffs will directly increase product costs and acknowledged uncertainty about the impact on consumer demand. This move reflects a broader trend, with other major companies like Mercedes-Benz and Porsche also adjusting prices or warning of profit impacts due to the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The initial truce had been tested by accusations of new attacks, but both nations reiterated their dedication to de-escalating the situation. The conflict, which has killed at least 41 people and displaced over 260,000, prompted diplomatic intervention from China, the U.S., and Malaysia.

It argues that this ridicule is a form of public policing of Black masculinity, punishing expressions of joy and softness that don't conform to rigid, traditional expectations. The piece connects Towns's experience to a broader cultural anxiety about queerness and effeminacy in male athletes, noting that such scrutiny persists even as he delivered the best season of his career. The author reflects on how this behavior discourages authentic self-expression.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric about deporting the "worst of the worst," an analysis of federal data reveals a significant shift in immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. In June, seven out of ten immigrants arrested in the region had no criminal record, a dramatic increase from previous months. This trend suggests that raids are increasingly targeting ordinary individuals, such as textile workers and tamale vendors, rather than focusing on violent criminals. This discrepancy between public statements and on-the-ground reality is causing fear in immigrant communities and may be influencing a decline in public support for the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Residents along the California coast responded to a tsunami advisory, triggered by a massive earthquake off Russia, with a mixture of caution, curiosity, and calm. In areas like Crescent City, which has a history of tsunamis, the alert was met with a practiced and largely unfazed response from locals. In Southern California, where smaller waves were predicted, some beachgoers were surprised by the news but not overly concerned. The event prompted officials to issue warnings to stay away from beaches and harbors, but the general atmosphere remained subdued without widespread panic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed former Trump lawyer Emil Bove to a lifetime appointment on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a narrow 50-49 vote. The confirmation was highly contentious, with Democrats vehemently opposing the nomination due to Bove's role in Trump's legal defense and whistleblower complaints alleging misconduct during his time at the Justice Department. Despite these concerns and new evidence presented by a whistleblower, Republicans largely stood by the nominee, securing his position on the influential court that hears cases from Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>

The victim's brother, Alan Bennett, is now calling for the missing material to be released to the police. He hopes it might contain a detailed account of the 1964 murder and burial, similar to descriptions Brady wrote about other victims.</p>

          <p>A global alliance of civil society organizations, Civicus, has placed the United States on a watchlist due to what it calls "sustained attacks on civic freedoms." The report cites the Trump administration's militarized response to protests, growing restrictions on journalists, and the targeting of anti-war advocates as key concerns. This has led the group to downgrade the U.S.'s civic space rating to "narrowed," a category for countries where the state undermines fundamental rights. The organization warned that the U.S. appears to be sliding deeper into authoritarianism under its current leadership.</p>

          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered 436-million-year-old fossils of brachiopods, or "lamp shells," that suggest the ancient creatures practiced a form of social distancing. The fossils, found in a checkerboard-like pattern, indicate that the invertebrates used hundreds of thin, bristle-like structures called setae to maintain a regular spacing from one another on the sea floor. Researchers believe this behavior was likely a strategy to ensure each individual had adequate space for filter feeding, thereby improving the population's overall chances of survival. The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>

          <p>The UK's announcement that it will recognize Palestinian statehood is being analyzed as a significant foreign policy shift designed to act as a "diplomatic crowbar" to restart the peace process. The move, which Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered to postpone in exchange for a ceasefire and commitment to a two-state solution, was immediately rejected by Israel. This decision aligns Britain with France and signals growing diplomatic isolation for Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza. The policy is seen as an attempt to empower moderates and remedy what the UK foreign secretary called a historical injustice.</p>

          <p>An article uses the recent burning of an effigy of refugees on a boat in Northern Ireland to analyze Europe's increasingly harsh approach to migration. It argues that over the past decade, mainstream political parties have adopted far-right rhetoric, promoting a fantasy of border control that has led to militarized borders and the erosion of human rights. This dehumanizing discourse, the author contends, distracts from the real drivers of migration and fosters a dangerous environment. The incident is presented as a stark symptom of where this brutal obsession with "stopping the boats" has led.</p>
