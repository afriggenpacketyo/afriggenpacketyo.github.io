          <p>National Guard troops have arrived in Los Angeles following clashes between law enforcement and protesters over President Trump's immigration enforcement operations. Protests have erupted throughout L.A. County, leading to violence and multiple arrests, prompting Trump to deploy the guard. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, while Mayor Bass called it a chaotic escalation. An ICE spokesperson stated that the operations have resulted in the arrest of a "domestic abuser" and a "child rapist," while Rep. Maxine Waters decried the deployment as a disruption as demonstrations continue for a third straight day. The situation remains tense as authorities attempt to manage the protests. The exact charges of those arrests were not yet clear as of Sunday afternoon.</p>

          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, India considered transitioning to a presidential system, inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France. Gandhi's government explored centralizing executive power and sidelining the judiciary, but the idea never fully materialized. The Forty-second Amendment Act in 1976 expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review, reflecting the imprint of a presidential system. Although the presidential system was never adopted, the idea resurfaced in 1982 when Gandhi considered stepping down as prime minister to become president.</p>

Bessent described Newsom’s comments as “extremely reckless” and advised the governor to come up with a tax-cutting plan for California that mirrored Trump’s federal tax cutting plan, “instead of committing criminal tax evasion”.</p>
