          <h2>Supreme Court Upholds Tennessee Law on Gender-Affirming Care for Minors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 10:26:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld a Tennessee law restricting gender-affirming care for transgender minors, effectively allowing similar limitations in half the country. The challenge to the law, brought by the Biden administration, families, and a physician, argued it violated the Constitution's equal protection guarantee. Chief Justice John Roberts stated the court's role was not to judge the law's wisdom but only to ensure it didn't violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The dissenting justices argued the law should be subject to heightened scrutiny due to its discrimination based on sex and transgender status, while the state argued it aimed to protect young people from risky and unproven medical treatments. Optimism is tempered by the law's potential impact on transgender youth and the ongoing debate surrounding gender-affirming care.</p>

          <p>FreshRealm is recalling pre-made chicken fettuccine alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart due to potential listeria contamination, according to the USDA. The recall, issued voluntarily out of an abundance of caution, includes dishes produced before June 17 and affects products with specific establishment numbers printed on the packaging. The FSIS is concerned that consumers may have these products in their refrigerators or freezers and urges them to either throw them away or return them to the place of purchase. This recall is possibly linked to a listeria outbreak that has resulted in multiple illnesses and deaths, with the agency working to identify the specific ingredient that may be the source of contamination.</p>

          <p>President Trump is granting TikTok another extension to comply with a bipartisan law that requires ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business or face a nationwide ban. The White House press secretary announced that Trump will sign an executive order providing a 90-day extension to allow the administration to work towards ensuring a deal is closed. This marks the third time Trump has paused the enforcement of the law, originally passed in Congress last year, which gave ByteDance until January 19 to sell TikTok's U.S. operations or be removed from app stores nationwide. The delay follows previous extensions and curtailed deals due to tariff impositions on Chinese goods.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "stupid" and expressing doubt that the central bank would cut interest rates. Trump asserted that the Fed's key borrowing rate should be significantly lower, claiming that higher rates are costing the U.S. "hundreds of billions" in financing costs. His remarks came hours before the Federal Open Market Committee was set to release its decision on interest rates and update its economic outlook. Market expectations indicated no rate cut at the current meeting, with the next move anticipated in September, while Powell and his colleagues have expressed caution about adjusting rates amid economic uncertainties.

          <p>The Department of Defense is deploying an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to protect federal property amid ongoing protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The 49th Military Police Brigade will join existing forces under Task Force 51, bringing the total number of National Guardsmen to 4,100, along with 700 active-duty Marines. This deployment follows Governor Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the initial deployment of troops to California, which was ultimately ruled in Newsom's favor by a U.S. District Judge. The troops are reportedly trained in de-escalation and crowd control, and their mission is to support the lead federal agency without engaging in civilian law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned the U.S. of "irreparable damage" if it intervenes militarily in the conflict between Iran and Israel. This statement follows escalating tensions, including missile exchanges between the two countries and an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. President Trump cautioned that U.S. patience was "wearing thin" and demanded Iran's "unconditional surrender," but Khamenei rejected this notion. The U.S. has been attempting to broker a deal over Iran's nuclear program, and Trump's recent comments have fueled speculation about a potential direct U.S. military intervention.</p>

          <p>An article explores the stereotype that straight men are bad at gossiping, examining the reasons behind this perception and its implications for male relationships. While studies show that men gossip as much as women, they may lack the cultural opportunities and social training to do it effectively. This can be attributed to societal expectations that discourage men from being "messy" or openly engaging in gossip, which is often seen as unmanly. The article suggests that improving men's gossiping skills could help them build stronger relationships and combat the male loneliness epidemic, as sharing stories and personal information is crucial for intimacy.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas in a dispute over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to store nuclear waste in the state. The court found that Texas and a land developer were not parties to the licensing proceeding and therefore lacked standing to seek judicial review. The decision reverses a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, highlighting the ongoing political and logistical challenges of addressing nuclear waste storage.

          <p>A woman from South Yorkshire, England, died from rabies after being bitten by a stray dog while on holiday in Morocco. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) stated that the risk to the general public is minimal, as rabies is not typically transmitted between humans. Close contacts of the woman and healthcare workers are being assessed and offered vaccinations as a precaution. The UKHSA emphasizes that rabies is nearly always fatal but post-exposure treatment is highly effective if administered promptly after exposure to the virus, highlighting the importance of seeking immediate medical attention after an animal bite in countries where rabies is present.</p>

          <p>Iowa, with the second-highest cancer rate in the U.S., is the focus of a new research project investigating potential environmental causes, particularly related to agricultural practices. The project aims to explore links between cancer and the widespread use of pesticides, herbicides, and high levels of nitrates in the state's water supply. The research will also examine potential connections to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAs) and high levels of radon. This investigation is controversial due to agriculture's significant contribution to Iowa's economy, but residents and researchers are concerned about the potential health impacts of industrial farming practices.</p>

          <p>An article argues that Canada, under Prime Minister Mark Carney, is adopting authoritarian tactics similar to those employed by Donald Trump, despite initial promises to stand up to him. The author claims that Carney, in coordination with provincial premiers, is using a strategy of "flooding the zone" with massive corporate giveaways and legislation that weakens environmental regulations and refugee protections. The Building Canada Act and the Safe Borders Act are cited as examples of this trend, with the author arguing that these measures disproportionately benefit corporations and undermine Indigenous rights and environmental safeguards.</p>
