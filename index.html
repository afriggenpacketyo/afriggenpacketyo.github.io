            <p>Wildlife rehabilitation centers in Southern California are experiencing a surge in sick and starving brown pelicans, believed to be caused by a toxic algae bloom. The bloom produces domoic acid, which poisons fish consumed by the pelicans, leading to disorientation and death. Additionally, an increase in malnourished baby pelicans is being observed, potentially due to adult pelicans being unable to care for their young because of the toxin's effects, stretching resources at local wildlife centers.</p>

The White House claims the new press pool composition is more reflective of modern media consumption habits.
