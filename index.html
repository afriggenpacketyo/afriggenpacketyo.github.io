          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The plot was aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 presidential election. The court also convicted seven of his co-conspirators, including senior military officers and former ministers, in a verdict that cannot be appealed. The ruling marks a significant moment for Brazilian democracy, holding a former leader accountable for attempting to subvert the electoral process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, the new COVID-19 vaccine is not available to all Americans, creating widespread frustration and confusion. Under a new policy from the Trump administration's FDA, the shots are now restricted to those at the highest risk, such as people over 65 or with underlying health conditions. As a result, many younger, otherwise healthy individuals who wish to get vaccinated to protect themselves or vulnerable family members are being turned away at pharmacies, sparking anger over the change in public health strategy.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has delivered a landmark ruling that overturns an apartheid-era law, now allowing husbands to take their wives' last names. The court found that the previous legislation, which only permitted women to change their surname upon marriage, was discriminatory on the basis of gender and inconsistent with the country's modern constitution. The government has been given two years to formally amend the law, a move celebrated as a significant step toward greater gender equality.</p>

          <p>China's US$12 trillion stock market is experiencing a powerful bull run, creating a challenge for regulators who aim to foster stable, sustainable growth rather than a volatile boom-and-bust cycle.

The goal is to guide the market toward a 'slow bull' phase, avoiding the kind of speculative frenzy that has led to crashes in the past. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A security analysis of the event where Charlie Kirk was assassinated reveals the inherent vulnerabilities of an open-air venue on a college campus. While local police and private security were present, the shooter was able to fire from a nearby rooftop, a position that is difficult to monitor without specific countermeasures like drones. Experts note that securing such events is challenging, as protocols like bag checks are not typical for outdoor functions, and the shooter exploited a clear line of sight to the target.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump and his allies are creating a factually inaccurate narrative by solely blaming the left for political violence following Charlie Kirk's assassination. The author contends that while violence from any political faction is dangerous, data from recent decades shows that far-right extremists have been responsible for the majority of domestic terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. The piece criticizes the president for using the tragedy to advance a one-sided political agenda while ignoring violence incited by his own rhetoric.</p>

          <p>This article explores the significant impact of Charlie Kirk, who built a powerful conservative youth movement through his organization, Turning Point USA. Starting as a teenager focused on economic issues, Kirk evolved into a charismatic and influential figure in the culture wars, championing President Trump's agenda to a new generation. His ability to communicate complex and often controversial ideas in a relatable, conversational style earned him a loyal following, and his strategies for mobilizing young voters are now deeply embedded in the modern Republican Party.</p>

          <p>In an internal company meeting, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged that the company's leadership needs to do better at rebuilding trust with its employees.

Nadella accepted the feedback, stating that maintaining company culture and a sense of mentorship has been challenging in the current environment.</p>

          <p>This article examines the low returns offered by traditional savings accounts, even in a high-interest-rate environment. With the national average rate at just 0.39%, a $10,000 deposit would earn less than $40 over an entire year, failing to keep pace with the current inflation rate of nearly 3%. The article advises savers to consider alternatives such as high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs) to better protect and grow their money before expected Federal Reserve rate cuts diminish these opportunities.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has pulled a controversial state bill that sought to overhaul Measure ULA, the city's tax on high-value property sales, just hours before its first committee vote. The proposed legislation aimed to reduce the tax for certain new developments but faced strong opposition from the housing advocates who originally championed the measure. They argued the changes would slash crucial funding for homelessness prevention programs, leading the mayor to announce she will reintroduce an amended version next year.</p>
