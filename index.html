          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his commitment to protecting Social Security, vowing to prevent any cuts to the program if congressional Republicans pursue a reconciliation bill. He emphasized focusing on eliminating unnecessary expenditures while safeguarding Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This article notes Trump's consistent stance on protecting the federal program, even as projections from the 2025 Trustees Report indicate the Social Security trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2033, potentially leading to a 23% reduction in benefits. The administration's efforts also include a temporary tax deduction for seniors and a push for Social Security to become a 'digital-first agency.' (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A devastating shooting unfolded at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a mass marking the start of the school year, resulting in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old. The assailant, 23-year-old Robin Westman, fired a rifle through church windows, injuring seventeen other individuals, including fourteen children, before dying by suicide at the scene. This article details the immediate aftermath, including the swift response by law enforcement and medical personnel who rushed the injured to area hospitals. Officials, including President Trump and Governor Tim Walz, condemned the horrific violence, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey emphasizing the need for action beyond thoughts and prayers in the wake of such a deliberate attack on innocent lives.</p>

          <p>British number one Jack Draper has withdrawn from the US Open ahead of his second-round match, citing an arm injury that has become too severe to continue playing. The 23-year-old, a semi-finalist last year and considered a title contender, had been struggling with a bruised humerus since April, which worsened during the grass-court season. Despite winning his first-round match, the discomfort persisted, leading to his difficult decision to prioritize his health. This withdrawal is expected to impact his ranking and may hinder his chances of qualifying for the season-ending ATP Finals, potentially requiring another extended break for full recovery.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the upcoming fall/winter season, but with the narrowest restrictions since their initial availability, limiting them primarily to adults aged 65 and older and those with high-risk underlying conditions. This article highlights that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, oversaw these changes, which also included replacing the CDC's vaccine advisory committee with his own selections. The new framework could lead to increased out-of-pocket costs for some Americans, as insurers often rely on CDC recommendations for coverage, diverging from previous universal recommendations.</p>

          <p>This article explains the factors determining the maximum Social Security payment seniors can receive in 2025, noting that the highest possible monthly benefit is $5,108 for those retiring at age 70. Achieving this maximum requires exceptional lifetime earnings, consistently meeting or exceeding the taxable maximum for at least 35 years, and claiming benefits at the optimal age of 70. For the majority of retirees who will receive significantly less, the article explores additional income strategies like reverse mortgages, annuities, part-time work, and investment portfolios. It emphasizes the importance of early financial planning beyond Social Security for retirement security. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the goal of scaling without relying solely on increased headcount, following earlier workforce reductions and buyout offers across various divisions. Executives noted the voluntary exit program's success, with employees often seeking career breaks, as the company aims for a smaller percentage of its workforce to be in leadership positions over time.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, alleging she claimed primary residency in two different states, leading to her removal and an impending lawsuit from Cook's attorney. This article explains that owner-occupancy mortgage fraud, while financially incentivized by lower interest rates and tax benefits, is often difficult to prove due to the need to establish specific intent to deceive. Legal experts suggest such cases are challenging to win in court, requiring more than just an incorrect form submission. Similar allegations have recently been made against other public figures, underscoring the political nature of these claims.</p>

          <p>Despite market expectations for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, this article explains that credit card interest rates are unlikely to fall significantly or quickly for consumers. Credit card APRs, currently near 22%, are tied to the prime rate but tend to adjust slower and less generously when the Fed cuts rates, compared to their rapid increases during hikes. Issuers also factor in high risk due to rising delinquencies and persistent inflation, keeping rates elevated to protect against potential losses. The article advises consumers to proactively seek lower rates through negotiation, balance transfers, debt management plans, or personal loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Evolving Debate on Unrestricted Cash Transfers and Universal Basic Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 13:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the ongoing and increasingly polarized debate surrounding unrestricted cash transfers and universal basic income (UBI), once heralded as a solution to poverty. Recent studies have yielded mixed results, showing that while cash aid can keep families housed and pay bills, it doesn't always lead to lasting improvements in mental health or financial well-being, challenging some proponents' earlier claims. The piece highlights how conservatives are using these findings to criticize welfare, while some Democrats emphasize cash aid's role in providing basic security and addressing market failures. Despite new pessimism, the movement for cash assistance continues, with new experiments and positive outcomes in specific contexts.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a high-profile Massachusetts retrial. This article details the verdict reached on the fourth day of deliberations, where jurors convicted Read only of driving under the influence of alcohol, sentencing her to one year probation. The defense had argued Read was framed by law enforcement and others, alleging an elaborate cover-up, while prosecutors maintained she hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die. The complex case, which saw a mistrial in 2024, has been marked by intense public scrutiny and legal battles over evidence.</p>

This article also highlights O'Leary's skepticism regarding sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates, calling them "nonsense" and asserting that the UK's 2030 target of 10% SAF use is unattainable due to supply shortages.

The discovery of a smaller pool for babies and a larger, cross-shaped one for adults speaks to this historical shift. The article reflects on how these enduring traces, despite the harsh desert environment, serve as a poignant reminder of the constant change societies undergo and that even significant cultures do not last forever.</p>
