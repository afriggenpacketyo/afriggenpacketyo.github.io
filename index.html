          <h2>Chinese Electric Vehicle Brands Gain Significant Market Share in Norway</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:10:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are rapidly increasing their market presence in Norway, which is known for being the world's most EV-friendly country. Brands like BYD, XPeng, and MG now hold a combined market share of approximately 10%, challenging established players like Tesla. This growth is notable as Norway has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the U.S. and EU, allowing these competitively priced and technologically advanced cars to flourish. Analysts view Norway as a key entry point for Chinese brands aiming to expand across the European continent.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, along with the first lady and several high-level officials, attended the FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in New Jersey. The event coincided with the one-year anniversary of a failed assassination attempt on his life, which he commemorated in a public statement. During the match, which Chelsea won, Trump also engaged in informal diplomacy, with his envoy indicating plans to meet with Qatari officials regarding Gaza ceasefire negotiations. The visit is part of a trend of the president attending major sporting events since taking office.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Unethical Sales Practices at Major UK Estate Agencies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation has uncovered questionable sales tactics at two prominent UK estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks. An undercover reporter at Connells found evidence of staff prioritizing buyers who used the company's in-house mortgage services, potentially costing sellers a higher sale price. At Purplebricks, a whistleblower alleged the company overvalued properties to secure listings and then incentivized staff to persuade sellers to lower the price. These practices raise legal and ethical questions about whether agents are acting in their clients' best interests or prioritizing company profits.</p>

          <p>A woman living in West Yorkshire has been found to have unlawfully brought a baby into the UK from Nigeria after falsely claiming to have given birth. After her arrest at Gatwick Airport, DNA tests proved she and her husband were not the baby's biological parents, despite her providing forged hospital documents. A Family Court investigation uncovered evidence suggesting the baby was purchased, potentially from an illegal "baby factory." The judge has ordered the infant, who is now settled with foster carers, to be placed for adoption, highlighting a disturbing trend of child trafficking.</p>

Huang emphasized the need for U.S. technology to be available to all markets, including China, to remain the global standard. His comments come as he navigates the complex relationship between Washington and Beijing while facing significant revenue losses from the restrictions.</p>

This growth was supported by strong shipments to Southeast Asian and European markets, which helped offset a continued, albeit slowing, decline in exports to the United States. A temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China contributed to the better-than-expected performance.

The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This economic rebound is partially attributed to a temporary pause in U.S.-China tariffs, which may have encouraged businesses to front-load exports. Despite the positive figures, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty in the global economy for the remainder of the year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for significant federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports outlets like NPR and PBS. The president has urged Republican senators to support the measure, accusing the organizations of bias. However, the proposed cuts are facing resistance, as over 70% of the federal funding goes to local stations, many of which are in rural areas. Some Republican senators from these states have expressed opposition, warning that defunding could eliminate vital news and emergency information sources for their constituents, many of whom are Trump voters.</p>

TfL states that fare dodging costs the city vital investment and has committed to reducing evasion rates by expanding its enforcement teams.

          <p>Kwon Ping Ho, the founder of the Banyan Group luxury hotel chain, observes that today's tourists are vastly different from those of 30 years ago. He notes that younger travelers are no longer satisfied with simple sightseeing and instead seek deeper, more authentic experiences that involve interaction with local communities. Furthermore, he describes a shift from predominantly Western tourists to a more diverse, "rainbow tourism" landscape with travelers from all over the world. This evolution in travel demands that the hospitality industry adapt to offer more personalized and experiential services.</p>

This unbroken, handwritten record, which began on July 14, 1795, is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland. The data provides an invaluable resource for studying long-term climate patterns and includes historical notes on major weather events like the "Night of the Big Wind" in 1839. The tradition continues today with a human observer still manually recording daily measurements, preserving a unique link to the history of meteorology.</p>

This strategy allows for faster delivery of military equipment to the front lines. The discussions come as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to take stronger action against Russia, including imposing significant economic sanctions on countries supporting Moscow's war effort.</p>

In a speech to the armed forces, Macron emphasized the need for France to be powerful to remain free in a world of complex geopolitics. The proposed budget increase must still be approved by the French government but reflects a broader trend among NATO nations to bolster their military capabilities.</p>
