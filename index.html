          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died after being struck by a boat in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. The collision nearly capsized the vessel and threw a passenger overboard, who was recovered safely. Officials from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions and the need for heavy equipment, a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death is scheduled for Monday. Boaters are advised to use caution in the area.</p>

Over 40 disposal bins have been placed at police stations for citizens to surrender the weapons without penalty before the ban takes effect on September 1. After an amnesty period ending November 30, possessing a machete without a valid exemption could result in up to two years in prison or a significant fine. Exemptions exist for agricultural and cultural uses under strict conditions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and judge, to the position of top federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia. The confirmation followed the withdrawal of President Trump's previous nominee, Ed Martin Jr., who faced opposition for his support of the January 6 Capitol rioters. Pirro, who has extensive courtroom experience as a former district attorney, was also a defendant in a multi-billion dollar defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic over false 2020 election claims.

          <p>An Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to eight years in prison for facilitating a massive remote-work scam that funneled millions of dollars to North Korea. Chapman acted as the "US face" for North Korean IT workers, using stolen American identities to secure remote jobs at hundreds of U.S. companies, including Fortune 500 firms. She managed "laptop farms," received paychecks, and transferred funds, which the U.S. government says helped finance North Korea's nuclear weapons program. The scheme highlights a growing cybersecurity threat where foreign actors exploit the remote work economy.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's stalled promises to release files on Jeffrey Epstein, several ongoing legal cases could compel their disclosure. A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Radar Online is appealing the FBI's refusal to release over 10,000 pages of documents related to its Epstein investigation. Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a civil case against Ghislaine Maxwell could be unsealed. These legal pressures offer a potential path to transparency, independent of the political maneuvering in Washington, regarding Epstein's criminal network.</p>

Although a potential lead from an FBI database was later excluded after more advanced testing, officials remain hopeful that the existing DNA sample can still identify the killer as science improves. The case, which involved the victims being bound, shot, and the shop set on fire, has haunted the city for over 30 years.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler, known for his dominant but often stoic demeanor on the course, is winning praise for his comedic cameo in the new movie "Happy Gilmore 2." The article suggests that while Scheffler's consistent excellence can make tournaments less dramatic, his fun, self-effacing performance in the film helps build a more engaging public image. In the movie, he playfully references his real-life arrest earlier this year, showing a willingness to laugh at himself. This appearance is seen as a positive move for both Scheffler and the sport of golf, making the top player more relatable to fans.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for Storm Floris, with an amber weather warning issued for most of Scotland due to expected strong winds and potential danger to life. The warning, active on Monday, anticipates gusts of 70-90 mph in many areas, with some models suggesting speeds could reach 100 mph in exposed locations. A less severe yellow warning is also in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. The storm is expected to cause significant travel disruption, power outages, and damage from falling trees, which are more vulnerable while in full leaf.</p>

          <p>The BBC has launched an investigation, aided by an external law firm, into allegations of cocaine use by two unnamed stars of its popular show, "Strictly Come Dancing." The claims were reportedly brought to the corporation's attention in a legal letter from a former celebrity contestant. This probe adds to a series of recent controversies surrounding the long-running program, including allegations about the behavior of professional dancers. In response to past issues, the BBC had previously implemented new welfare measures, including chaperones and additional training for cast and crew.</p>

          <p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has reported that an Israeli military attack on its headquarters in Khan Younis, Gaza, has killed one of its workers and injured three others.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated it had no knowledge of an airstrike or artillery fire in that area. This incident occurs amid growing international warnings about the dire humanitarian crisis and rising death toll from malnutrition and violence in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Israel's National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has publicly called for Israel to "occupy the entire Gaza Strip and declare full sovereignty," while also encouraging the voluntary emigration of Palestinians. The far-right lawmaker made the inflammatory remarks during a visit to Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a sensitive holy site where he also prayed in defiance of long-standing rules. Ben-Gvir's comments are likely to intensify accusations that Israel is pursuing a policy of ethnic cleansing.

          <p>The Czech Republic has amended its criminal code to outlaw the promotion of communist ideology, placing it on the same legal footing as Nazism. Signed into law by President Petr Pavel, the amendment imposes a prison sentence of one to five years for supporting movements that aim to suppress human rights. The move is seen by supporters as correcting a historical injustice but is decried by the country's communist party (KSCM) as a political attack by the current government. The law could potentially lead to a ban on the KSCM, which recently re-entered the European Parliament.</p>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian researchers suggests that earthquakes can provide the energy necessary to sustain life in Earth's deep, dark biosphere. This vast, hidden ecosystem is estimated to contain up to one-fifth of the planet's total biomass. The research provides a potential answer to how microbes survive in these isolated, nutrient-poor environments. The findings indicate that seismic activity can trigger chemical reactions that release hydrogen, a key energy source for deep-earth microorganisms, fundamentally changing our understanding of life's limits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay reflects on the crucial, yet undramatic, work George Washington undertook in the summer and fall of 1775 to forge the Continental Army. Faced with a chaotic assembly of disparate colonial militias, Washington implemented structure, discipline, and sanitation, transforming them into a cohesive fighting force. He demonstrated remarkable leadership by transcending his own prejudices to appoint talented men from different backgrounds, like Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox, to key positions. The author argues that this quiet, foundational leadership, based on character and judgment, was more vital to the Revolution's success than battlefield brilliance and remains a valuable example today.</p>

          <p>A $10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Trump against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Co., and its owner Rupert Murdoch, has exposed the volatile relationship between the two powerful figures. The suit, over a report about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein, marks a new low in a half-century association that has been both mutually beneficial and fraught with tension. While Murdoch's Fox News has been instrumental in Trump's political rise, Murdoch has privately expressed disdain for him and has periodically backed rivals. This legal battle reveals the complex dynamic between the media mogul and the president he helped create.</p>

          <p>In California's highly competitive 13th Congressional District, voters from all political affiliations are united in their demand for the government to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Many recall President Trump's campaign promises to unseal the records and now view the administration's perceived backtracking with suspicion. The sentiment reflects a rare point of bipartisan agreement in a deeply divided nation, with voters asserting that the public has a right to know the full extent of Epstein's crimes and the identities of his powerful associates.

          <p>Faced with one of the world's highest homicide rates and a deeply corrupt police force, the new mayor of Celaya, Mexico, fired over half of the city's officers and called in federal troops.

While Celaya's leaders report a subsequent drop in homicides, high-profile violence continues, and the strategy is controversial.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that a recent Board of Immigration Appeals ruling under the Trump administration is a major setback for women's rights and refugee law. The decision holds that gender cannot be the basis for defining a "particular social group," a key ground for asylum, effectively making it much harder for women fleeing gender-based violence to gain protection. The author contends this reverses decades of progress since the 1990s, which recognized that violence against women is a human rights issue, not a "private matter." This legal shift is presented as a deliberate attempt to roll back history and deny refuge to vulnerable women and girls.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's escalating trade war and new tariffs on numerous countries, the U.S. economy has remained surprisingly resilient, with stock markets near record highs and recent GDP growth surpassing expectations. This resilience can be attributed to several factors, including businesses stockpiling goods, multinationals absorbing costs, and a belief that the worst tariff threats will be negotiated away. However, warning signs are emerging, with recent jobs data showing weakness and uncertainty hitting investment. The analysis concludes that while a hurricane may be avoided, protectionist policies are inflicting damage and pushing the consumer tariff burden to its highest level since the 1930s.
