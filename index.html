          <p>Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has hinted that new versions of the YJ-21 and DF-17 hypersonic missiles could be featured in an upcoming military parade. A military commentator suggested an air-launched variant of the YJ-21 could be deployed from bombers outside enemy air defense zones, highlighting its enhanced penetration capabilities. This development points towards a versatile family of land, sea, and air-launched hypersonic weapons, underscoring China's ongoing military modernization and its focus on advanced strategic assets. The country has not officially confirmed that such a missile is in service.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler, a prominent liberal Democrat from New York, has announced he will not seek re-election, ending a 34-year career in Congress. Nadler, 78, cited the need for generational change within the Democratic party as a key factor in his decision. A vocal critic of Donald Trump and the chairman who steered articles of impeachment through the House Judiciary Committee in 2019, his departure marks the end of an era for a significant voice on the party's left flank. He expressed confidence in the Democrats' chances of retaking the House next year.</p>

He is set to join Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, gathering the leaders of three nations considered adversaries of the United States. This visit underscores the deepening trilateral relationship between the countries, as North Korea has actively supported Russia's war in Ukraine in exchange for economic and military aid.

          <p>A BBC investigation may have shed light on the nearly 50-year-old disappearance of revered Lebanese Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr, who vanished in Libya in 1978. Using a unique facial recognition algorithm, researchers at Bradford University analyzed a 2011 photo of a corpse from a secret Libyan mortuary. The results showed a high probability that the body is that of al-Sadr, suggesting he was killed. The cleric's disappearance has been a source of enduring mystery and conspiracy in the Middle East, with his followers holding him in mythic regard.</p>

          <p>Eric Peters, the investment chief at Coinbase Asset Management, has suggested that Bitcoin has a 25% chance of experiencing a massive speculative rally akin to the 18th-century South Sea Bubble. He attributes this potential to Bitcoin's fixed supply, noting that unlike other assets, more cannot be created as its price increases, which could lead to a massive upward move as institutional barriers to entry fall. However, he also outlined other possibilities, including wild price swings or a potential decline over the next five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights a growing concern among some Anglo-American intellectuals that their countries are beginning to resemble the late Soviet Union of the 1980s. The piece cites arguments that institutional Britain, for example, suffers from political rigidity and a fear of questioning obsolete dogma, similar to the conditions preceding the USSR's collapse. While not predicting an imminent fall, the commentary suggests that the mere decline of the West, fueled by such internal issues, could have serious consequences for the rest of the world.</p>

The inn's iconic rustic style, known as "parkitecture," was so influential that it inspired the design of grand lodges in other major parks like Yosemite and Glacier.

          <p>A new scientific study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil found in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This finding, achieved through advanced uranium-series dating, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and resolves decades of conflicting age estimates. The fossil, likely belonging to the species Homo heidelbergensis, strengthens the theory that more primitive human populations coexisted alongside emerging Neanderthals. This discovery provides a critical key to understanding Europe's complex and branching human evolutionary history.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" that the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, will be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom in the coming days. This rare opportunity is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which could push the spectacular light display further south than usual. While visibility is never guaranteed and depends on clear, dark skies away from city lights, those in areas like the Midlands could be rewarded with a memorable celestial event.</p>

          <p>The summer transfer window has ignited a debate about the growing power of football players to force moves, exemplified by strikers Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa. Both players refused to train and issued public statements demanding transfers, which they ultimately secured on deadline day. Their success is contrasted with the case of defender Marc Guehi, who maintained his professionalism at Crystal Palace but saw his dream move to Liverpool collapse. This raises questions about whether disruptive tactics are becoming a more effective strategy for players than fulfilling contractual obligations.</p>

          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to set records for longevity at the US Open, but questions remain about his physical ability to win another Grand Slam title. Despite playing himself into good form, Djokovic has required medical attention for various physical issues in almost every match of the tournament. An analysis suggests that while his skill is undeniable, his aging body may struggle to withstand the grueling demands of two weeks of best-of-five-set matches against the world's best players, a challenge he has acknowledged himself.</p>

They specifically linked the fight for workers' rights with the fight for immigrant rights, condemning immigration raids as a tool to terrorize families and break the backbone of the economy.

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated threats to punish Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine, his administration has held back on implementing severe new sanctions. According to analysts, this hesitation is strategic and twofold. First, Trump reportedly still believes he can broker a peace deal and take credit for ending the conflict. Second, there are concerns in Washington that completely isolating Russia would push it into a deeper, more formal alliance with China, thereby strengthening Beijing's access to resources and military technology, which is seen as a greater long-term threat.</p>
