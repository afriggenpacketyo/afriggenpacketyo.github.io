          <h2>China Denies Tariff Talks as Trump Softens Tone</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese official refuted claims of ongoing tariff negotiations between the U.S. and China, labeling them as "fake news." This statement comes after President Trump indicated that tariffs would be imposed if trade deals are not reached within a few weeks. Despite the uncertainty, markets rallied following Trump's remarks about not firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and a generally softer stance on China. The situation remains fluid, with daily contact between the U.S. and China as they attempt to resolve trade disputes. Optimism is cautiously tempered by the denial from China, reflecting a complex and evolving trade landscape.</p>

          <p>During Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared Hamas to Nazis, emphasizing their intent to destroy all Jews. This year's commemoration occurred amid the ongoing war in Gaza, adding a layer of tension to the event. A Holocaust survivor defied protocol during the ceremony by calling for the release of hostages held in Gaza, highlighting the intersection of historical remembrance and current conflict. The event also featured calls for refraining from comparing the October 7th attacks to the Holocaust, in an effort not to marginalize either event.</p>

          <p>Former Philadelphia Eagles star C.J. Gardner-Johnson voiced his surprise at being traded to the Houston Texans shortly after the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX victory. Despite the shock, Gardner-Johnson sees the move as a positive opportunity for growth and a chance to mentor a young Texans team. The Eagles' decision to trade Gardner-Johnson was reportedly financially motivated, allowing them to allocate resources to younger players. Gardner-Johnson, who recorded six interceptions in his second stint with the Eagles, believes the change of scenery will prevent him from becoming too comfortable.</p>

          <p>A mistakenly filed DOJ document outlined legal vulnerabilities in the Trump administration's attempt to dismantle New York City's congestion pricing plan. The document, intended as internal legal guidance, suggested that arguments against the tolls were unlikely to hold up in court. It proposed an alternative justification based on changed agency priorities. The MTA sued after the Trump administration tried to rescind the agreement authorizing the congestion toll, arguing the termination was unlawful and detrimental to public transit funding.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has limited the Trump administration's authority to withhold federal funding from public schools based on their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The judge ruled that the administration's definition of DEI was insufficiently detailed and that the policy threatened free speech in the classroom. While not issuing a nationwide pause, the ruling applies to schools affiliated with the National Education Association and the Center for Black Educator Development. The judge also noted that the loss of federal funding would severely impact educational institutions.</p>

This request follows a federal appeals court decision to uphold a lower court order blocking the ban nationwide.

          <p>U.S. spirit exports reached a record $2.4 billion in 2024, largely driven by concerns over potential tariffs and ongoing global trade disputes. Exports to the EU surged by 39% due to fears of a 50% tariff on American whiskey imports. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on French Champagne and other EU spirits prompted European leaders to advocate against retaliatory bourbon tariffs. The U.S. and EU are currently engaged in trade negotiations, potentially mitigating the threat of these tariffs.</p>
