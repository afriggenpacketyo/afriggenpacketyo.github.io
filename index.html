        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has publicly denounced President Trump's tax-and-spending-cut bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on his social media platform X. Musk argues that the bill will significantly increase the federal budget deficit, potentially reaching $2.5 trillion, and place an unsustainable debt burden on American citizens. The White House dismissed Musk's criticism, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt affirming the President's support for the bill. This statement comes after Musk led the Trump administration's DOGE effort to cut government spending, making his criticism all the more poignant.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced that 287 child sexual exploitation cases, previously dropped by local police forces, are being re-examined. These cases have been handed over to a national police taskforce, which will assess whether to reopen them and pursue any new, previously uninvestigated leads. Cooper initiated this review in January, requesting all police forces in England and Wales to revisit historic gang exploitation cases where 'No Further Action' was taken. The national Police Child Sexual Exploitation Taskforce will be responsible for reviewing these cases, with half of the police forces having already reported back.</p>

          <p>Louise Perry argues that Elon Musk is a visionary who, despite his volatility and recklessness, is driven by a desire to save humanity from future threats and its own complacency. Perry acknowledges Musk's recent political setbacks but emphasizes the success of his space program, SpaceX, which launched seven times more tonnage into space than the rest of the world combined in the first half of 2024. Musk's vision extends beyond politics, focusing on space exploration and the establishment of a multi-planet civilization to ensure humanity's survival. The article draws parallels between Musk and Cecil Rhodes, another businessman, politician, and visionary who bent reality around his will.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering established U.S. immigration policy. This proposal, spearheaded by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, would effectively suspend the issuance of new work permits until all asylum claims are decided within an average of 180 days. Critics argue that this timeframe is unrealistic given existing backlogs and operational constraints, and the proposed changes could force migrants to work illegally or prevent them from supporting themselves and their families. The Department of Homeland Security has not commented on the proposal but stated its commitment to protecting national security and increasing program integrity.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, have been charged with allegedly smuggling a fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the U.S., with the Justice Department classifying it as a "potential agroterrorism weapon." Officials allege that Jian and Liu received Chinese government funding for their research, some of which was conducted at the University of Michigan. Jian's electronics reportedly contained information indicating her membership and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party, while Liu initially lied about smuggling the fungus before admitting to it. The FBI says the fungus causes "head blight," a disease affecting wheat, barley, maize, and rice, resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses annually.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' has passed the House and is moving to the Senate, drawing criticism for its potential rollbacks of Obamacare. Critics say the bill could cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage and health insurance, while making it harder and more expensive to sign up for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans. Republicans argue that the bill aims to reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" in Medicaid and other government health programs, rather than repealing the ACA. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would leave nearly 9 million more people without health insurance by 2034, with that number rising to nearly 14 million if Congress doesn't extend premium subsidies for Obamacare plans.</p>

          <p>Sonia 'Sunny' Jacobs, a US woman who spent years on death row for murders she did not commit, was among two people found dead after a house fire in the Republic of Ireland. Jacobs, who was in her 70s, died alongside Kevin Kelly in County Galway, with the cause of the fire under investigation but foul play not suspected. She had been sentenced to the electric chair in the US for killing two police officers in 1976, but it was later commuted to a life sentence, and upon her release, she campaigned against the death penalty. Jacobs had been living in Ireland for several years, having married Peter Pringle, who was also wrongly convicted of a double murder.</p>

          <p>Credit card issuers can lower your credit limit at almost any time and for a range of reasons, including inactivity, a drop in your credit score, high balances, missed payments, or changes in your financial situation. While issuers are legally required to notify you after the fact, they don't have to ask for your permission beforehand. If your credit limit is lowered, it's important to contact your issuer for an explanation, request a credit limit increase, review your overall credit utilization, monitor your credit reports for errors, and consider switching to another card if necessary. Taking these steps can help protect your finances and credit score.</p>

Trump is actively working to secure support for the bill, which extends his 2017 tax cuts and boosts spending for the military and border security, while making some cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and other assistance programs.
