          <p>President Trump publicly disparaged Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "numbskull" for not lowering interest rates. Trump claimed that reducing rates by two percentage points would save the U.S. $600 billion annually. This attack follows similar criticisms from other administration officials, who believe the economy is ready for lower rates due to low inflation. Markets, however, remained largely unaffected by Trump's remarks, with traders pricing in minimal chances of rate cuts in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>There has been an unexpected surge in people claiming Social Security benefits, with claims nearly 18% higher between January and May compared to the same period last year. This increase is attributed to a peak of retiring Baby Boomers, a rule change boosting benefits for some with pensions, and individuals refiling for higher benefits based on their own records. Some also worry about their economic future under the Trump administration, leading them to claim benefits earlier. Experts advise caution, as delaying claiming benefits generally leads to higher monthly payments.</p>

Many believe tariffs on goods from the European Union, Vietnam, India, and Mexico will remain at 10% rather than the steeper rates initially imposed. This optimism stems from progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations and a court ruling challenging Trump's authority to impose the tariffs. Despite the optimism, some caution that the situation could still change and that companies should plan for both scenarios. (not investment advice)</p>
