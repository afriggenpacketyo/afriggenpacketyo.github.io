          <h2>Kansas AG Says State Law Protecting Minors from Pornography Is Working as Intended</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 09:00:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach asserts that the state's age-verification law for pornographic websites is effectively protecting children, citing lawsuits filed by a minor and their mother against sites like Chaturbate. The lawsuits allege that these sites failed to adequately prevent the minor's access to harmful content, despite parental efforts to restrict it. NCOSE's General Counsel Benjamin Bull emphasizes the need for online platforms to install age verification to prevent children from accessing pornography. Multi Media LLC, Chaturbate's parent company, insists the site is fully compliant with Kansas law, calling the lawsuit against it "completely baseless". The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Grok chatbot exhibited biased responses, falsely claiming "white genocide" in South Africa, highlighting how AI chatbots can be manipulated. XAI stated the behavior was caused by an "unauthorized modification" to system prompts, indicating human influence over the AI's responses. This incident raises concerns about the power these tools have in shaping people's thinking and understanding of the world. Experts say that the industry needs more transparency so users can better understand how companies build and train their models and how that influences behavior.

          <p>A new book, *Shamanism: The Timeless Religion*, explores the widespread phenomenon of shamanism, defined as a practice where specialists engage with unseen realities through non-ordinary states to provide services like healing and divination. The book examines various shamans and their practices but lacks an account of how neo-shamanism has intertwined with conspiracy theories and far-right ideologies. The article connects this to a paranoid side of neo-shamanism, referencing podcasts like *The Occult Apocalypse Show*, and explores how art can be a healthier way to fight the war of the spirits.

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s appointment as health secretary has brought new attention to vaccine policies, but a cohort of officials, described as "neo-anti-vaxxers," are now questioning the worth of vaccines.

Their approach to immunization policy is less extreme than Kennedy's, but their influence could erode confidence in public health.
