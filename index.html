          <p>The Trump administration fired Shira Perlmutter, the top copyright official in the U.S., shortly after terminating Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. Perlmutter, who oversaw the U.S. Copyright Office, received an email from the White House stating her immediate termination. Hayden had appointed Perlmutter in October 2020, and she was also notified of her firing via email. Perlmutter's office recently released a report examining whether AI companies can use copyrighted materials to train their AI systems, emphasizing the centrality of human creativity in copyright protections.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its intention to release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement with Israel, ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The decision is also intended to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. A senior Palestinian official said the announcement was a goodwill gesture before Trump's arrival, with a meeting scheduled to finalize the release, requiring a temporary halt to Israeli military activity. President Trump confirmed the release, calling it "monumental news" and "a step taken in good faith".</p>

          <p>CVS Health's Caremark will stop covering Zepbound, a weight-loss drug, in favor of Wegovy, despite research indicating Zepbound's superior effectiveness. This decision, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), will force many patients to switch medications. Caremark claims the move will lower drug prices for employers by 10-15%, but doctors prefer Zepbound for most patients, limiting their ability to tailor prescriptions. Patients and doctors are expressing concerns, with a petition urging Caremark to reverse course, highlighting the growing trend of insurance limitations disrupting patient treatments.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration offered refugee status to 49 white South Africans, who departed for the United States under a new program accusing South Africa's government of racial discrimination. This action has faced criticism, with refugee groups questioning the prioritization over those from war-torn countries. The South African government denies the claims of persecution and racism, stating Afrikaners are economically privileged. The Trump administration cited affirmative action laws and land expropriation as reasons for the relocation, while South Africa insists these claims are based on misinformation.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy revealed that Mounjaro is more effective, leading to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% over 72 weeks. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese individuals and found that those on Mounjaro also experienced greater waistline reduction and better blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. While both drugs have a role, researchers suggest Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those needing to lose the most weight. Both medications are available privately in the UK, with Mounjaro sales currently surpassing Wegovy.</p>

          <p>The United States will suspend imports of live cattle from Mexico through southern border ports for at least two weeks to review strategies against the screwworm parasite. Secretary Brooke Rollins cited recent detections of the screwworm in areas far from the border, emphasizing the importance of animal and food supply safety. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué acknowledged the decision but expressed confidence in reaching an agreement. The screwworm, a potentially fatal parasite, has been spreading north, prompting the U.S. to take additional action.</p>
