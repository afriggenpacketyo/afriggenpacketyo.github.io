            <p>A University of Michigan survey revealed a significant drop in consumer sentiment in April, driven by soaring inflation expectations. The mid-month reading fell to 50.8, the lowest since June 2022 and the second-lowest in the survey's history. Inflation expectations for the coming year surged to 6.7%, the highest since 1981, while the five-year outlook reached 4.4%, a level not seen since 1991. This decline in sentiment spanned across all demographics, raising concerns about a potential recession as consumers expressed anxieties about business conditions, personal finances, and the labor market.</p>

            <p>President Trump's plans to impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could have detrimental effects on drugmakers and American patients. Experts warn that these duties could disrupt the pharmaceutical supply chain, increase drug prices, and exacerbate existing drug shortages. Generic drug manufacturers, already operating on thin margins, could be particularly vulnerable, potentially leading to some leaving the U.S. market. While the administration hopes tariffs will incentivize domestic drug production, experts believe this would be a costly and lengthy process. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling declined to block a lower court's order to facilitate his return, though it raised questions about the judge's authority. Garcia, a Salvadoran, was deported as part of an arrangement between the U.S. and El Salvador, where alleged gang members were flown to a mega-jail. His lawyers accuse the government of delaying his return, while the government alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies.</p>

Estimates range from a 25% increase based on labor costs alone to a $3,500 price tag. Apple currently manufactures over 80% of its products in China, and moving production to the U.S. would require significant investment and time to build plants and train a workforce.

            <p>The Chinese government is making efforts to reassure private entrepreneurs of official support and protection amid a slowing economy and trade war with the U.S. The reappearance of Jack Ma, former CEO of Alibaba, signals a potential easing of regulatory pressures on the private sector. However, entrepreneurs like Gu Chujun, who lost his company due to alleged wrongful prosecution, remain skeptical and seek the return of their assets. Encouraging the private sector is more challenging now due to overcapacity, heavy debt, and a less favorable economic situation.</p>

            <p>Over 130 Jewish students, staff, and alumni from Georgetown University signed a letter opposing the arrest and detention of researcher Badar Khan Suri, arguing that President Trump's policies make Jews on campus less safe. Suri, an Indian national, was arrested on accusations of spreading Hamas propaganda. The letter accuses the Trump administration of weaponizing Jewish identity and fears of antisemitism to advance an authoritarian agenda. The signatories, holding diverse views on Israel-Palestine, agree that Suri's detention violates civil liberties and creates a climate of fear.</p>

            <p>Senate Democrats have called on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate President Trump and others for potential securities law violations related to his announcement of a pause in reciprocal tariffs. The Democrats are questioning whether the President or his administration engaged in insider trading or market manipulation when Trump announced that it was a 'GREAT TIME TO BUY' into the stock market, which came hours before the tariff pause, which lead to a market rally after days of dramatic declines. The White House dismissed the concerns as partisan.</p>

            <p>The leader of an elite Mexican police unit known as the "Gringo Hunters" was allegedly killed by a convicted murderer who escaped from California corrections custody.

A manhunt is underway to apprehend Hernandez. Esparza Reyes had led the unit for eight years, carrying out operations aimed at arresting U.S. fugitives in Mexico.</p>

            <p>Volvo Cars, controlled by Geely, may need up to two years to expand its U.S. car production to avoid hefty import tariffs, according to CEO Hakan Samuelsson. The company imports most of its hybrid and electric models from Europe, making it vulnerable to President Trump's auto tariffs. Selling European-made cars in the United States at a 27.5% tariff is not sustainable in the long term, and importing from Chinese plants is impossible due to higher U.S. tariffs on China. The company is working towards increasing production in the U.S. as a response to the tariffs.</p>

            <p>U.S. companies are responding to President Trump's tariffs by implementing "tariff surcharges" and raising prices on goods. Labucq, a footwear company, announced price increases due to tariffs on imports from the European Union. Dame, a sexual wellness brand, implemented a "Trump tariff surcharge" on online orders. Other companies are using pre-tariff sales as a promotional tool to boost sales. Consumers are stocking up on goods they believe will become more expensive if tariffs take effect.

Trump has previously expressed frustration with Putin over the state of talks.

            <p>"Drop", a techno-thriller directed by Christopher Landon, follows Violet (Meghann Fahy) on a blind date that becomes deadly when an unknown stranger threatens her son. The film is a mix of romantic comedy, send-up of fine dining, and exploration of abusive relationships. Fahy's performance is praised, but the movie struggles with tone and a convoluted plot. The best scenes take place at the restaurant, where Henry wonders why she’s sabotaging their meet-up.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump’s whiplash decisions on tariffs have brought uncertainty to a sector of the US economy usually squarely behind the president: the gun industry. For gunmakers, tariffs pose the risk of sharply raising costs on imported raw materials, such as copper, steel and aluminum, as well as safety products like gun locks and lockable cases that often are made overseas. With tariff policy in constant flux, gunmakers and adjacent companies are trying to adapt to a situation that remains fluid. Every day, we’re talking about this. And the frustrating part is that it’s changing.</p>

The film follows two queer couples caught in a web of lies as they try to create their own happy endings. The actors shared that the experience was filled with kindness and openness. Making up one half of the quartet is Angela (Tran) and Lee (Gladstone), devoted partners whose IVF journey has so far been unsuccessful and who are unsure of how they can afford more treatments. Then there’s commitment-phobic Chris (Yang), Angela’s best friend, and his boyfriend Min (Han), an artist and the heir to a giant multinational corporation who is not out to his conservative family in Korea.</p>

In February, an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 probationary workers were laid off from the IRS, and reports have indicated the agency may cut as much as half of its roughly 90,000-person workforce in the coming months.</p>
