          <p>Hurricane Imelda weakened to a post-tropical storm after impacting Bermuda, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the archipelago. The National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories for Imelda as it moved into the central Atlantic Ocean, forecasting gradual weakening but maintaining a large and powerful system. While hurricane-force winds were recorded on Bermuda, no immediate damage reports were issued, though swells generated by Imelda and Hurricane Humberto were expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast. The storm followed closely after Hurricane Humberto, which reached Category 5 status before weakening, and forecasters previously considered the possibility of the two storms interacting. The article provides context for the hurricane's path and potential impact. Optimism score is not mentioned in the article.</p>

          <p>Amid the government shutdown, White House officials indicated the possibility of mass firings and cuts to federal programs, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt stating the threat was "very real." The Office of Management and Budget encouraged federal employees to include messages in their out-of-office replies blaming "Democrat Senators" for the shutdown. President Trump announced a meeting with OMB Director Russ Vought to determine which agencies to cut, referencing Vought's involvement with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for government reform involving federal layoffs. The majority of Americans blame Trump and congressional Republicans for the shutdown, according to a Washington Post poll.

          <p>Many Filipino migrant workers in Taiwan are choosing to remain there despite the looming threat of a potential attack by mainland forces, prioritizing better economic opportunities over safety concerns. Despite facing the possibility of being caught in the crossfire, these workers express a desire to stay in Taiwan due to limited options for survival back in the Philippines. The article highlights the often-overlooked plight of the island's foreign residents amid geopolitical tensions, who are also vulnerable to second-class treatment and abuse under Taiwanese labor laws.

The suspect, who drove a car into worshippers and then attacked people with a knife, was shot and killed by police, who declared the incident an act of terrorism. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the attack as horrific, especially given its occurrence on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and announced increased police presence at synagogues across the country. The article provides details of the attack, the response from officials, and the broader implications for the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>Disney's image and the sentiment surrounding its Disney+ streaming service have plummeted to multiyear lows following the Jimmy Kimmel controversy, according to Jefferies analysis. The decision to temporarily remove Kimmel's show from the air after his comments about Charlie Kirk alienated both Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats showing a sharper decline in sentiment. Disney also faced criticism for both Kimmel's original comments and the decision to halt and then resume his show's production, as well as recent price hikes for Disney+ subscriptions.

          <p>President Trump ordered the declassification of all government records related to Amelia Earhart, but aviation historians largely agree that Earhart and her navigator ran out of fuel over the Pacific. The enduring mystery surrounding her 1937 disappearance has fueled numerous conspiracy theories, but Earhart's family's Bible records state she was "lost at sea." While Earhart was brave and determined, her public image was cultivated by her husband, and her final flight was a risky gamble. The article explores the facts and myths surrounding Earhart's disappearance.</p>

          <p>Many believe a $70 stock has more upside than a $700 stock, which is misguided and is known as low-price bias, or the unit bias. The money illusion bias occurs when someone fails to distinguish between nominal value and real value. The nominal price of stock is not an indicator of value, and the great companies don't want to trade on OTC markets. Stock splits can instantly reduce the price of a stock, but that mechanical adjustment in no way alters the valuation or outlook of the company.

          <p>With the S&P 500 near record highs, experts suggest reconsidering the set-it-and-forget-it strategy, recommending a broader investment mix. Many investors assume the S&P 500 index is synonymous with diversification, but the market capitalization-weighted index means larger companies may drag down the fund. For a simple approach, opt for a total market index fund instead of an S&P 500 index fund, which also provides exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks. The set-it-and-forget-it S&P 500 strategy was intended to provide broad market exposure, but that's no longer the case. The article provides context for the importance of diversifying investments.

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated on October 3, marks the formal completion of reunification between East and West Germany in 1990. The day was chosen to avoid overshadowing the tragic events of November 9, 1938, the "Reichspogromnacht," which marked the beginning of the systematic persecution of Jewish people. While most cities host events, Germans celebrate quietly, and Saarland will organize the official festival in Saarbrücken this year.
