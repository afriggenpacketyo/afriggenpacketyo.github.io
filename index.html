        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack has warned that U.S. consumers could soon face higher inflation as businesses begin passing on costs from the Trump administration's tariffs. Many companies had previously absorbed these costs or used stockpiled inventory, but shrinking margins are now forcing price hikes. Hammack anticipates inflation could reach a 3% annual rate, exceeding the Fed's 2% target. She also highlighted a "two-speed economy," where high-income individuals thrive while low-income households struggle with rising living costs, creating a difficult challenge for monetary policymakers.

          <p>The recent U.S. jobs report for July, which showed a meager increase of 73,000 nonfarm payrolls, has intensified concerns about a sharp economic slowdown. Combined with significant downward revisions for May and June, the data points to a cooling labor market, a key indicator of economic health. Economists are now debating the heightened risk of a recession, citing pressures from tariffs on consumer spending and business investment. Despite some optimistic views from the White House, many analysts believe the weak job growth will pressure the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political standoff is escalating in Texas as dozens of Democratic state lawmakers have fled to other states to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial congressional redistricting map. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent Democrats from office, citing an attorney general's opinion, while the lawmakers hold events in states like New York and Illinois to protest the plan. The proposed map, supported by President Trump, could create up to five new Republican seats, impacting the balance of power in the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell 27% on Monday, giving back a significant portion of the gains from its successful initial public offering last week.

Despite the subsequent drop, Figma's current valuation remains nearly triple the amount of Adobe's unsuccessful 2022 acquisition offer. The company has demonstrated consistent profitability and expects its second-quarter revenue to grow by approximately 40% compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

The earnings report included a notable $3.8 billion write-down on its Kraft Heinz investment, a move long anticipated by analysts.

          <p>As retirees seek financial stability amid inflation and market volatility, the choice between fixed and variable annuities has become more critical. Fixed annuities currently offer attractive, guaranteed rates, often above 5.5%, providing a safe haven for conservative investors before potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Conversely, variable annuities offer the potential for higher, market-linked growth that can better hedge against long-term inflation, appealing to those with a higher risk tolerance and longer time horizon. The best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, risk comfort, and retirement timeline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent walkout by Texas Democrats to block a redistricting bill highlights a political tactic known as "breaking quorum," which has a mixed history of success. By leaving the state, minority party lawmakers can halt legislative business, drawing national attention to contentious issues. However, as seen in past instances in Texas, Oregon, and Minnesota, the strategy is often a delaying tactic rather than a permanent block, as governors can call repeated special sessions. While it can force negotiations or create political heroes, it also risks escalating partisan tensions and may ultimately fail to prevent the opposed legislation from passing.</p>

          <p>Rapper Soulja Boy, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested by Los Angeles police on suspicion of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. The arrest occurred during a traffic stop early Sunday morning near his clothing store on Melrose Avenue. This incident adds to the artist's recent legal troubles, which include being found liable in civil court for sexually assaulting and abusing a former assistant and a separate verdict involving an ex-girlfriend. He was booked into jail and is facing a new felony charge, though details of the traffic stop were not immediately released.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order in a Louisiana redistricting case suggests the conservative majority may be preparing to weaken or strike down key protections against racial gerrymandering. The Court has asked for briefings on whether a lower court's order to create a new Black-majority district, based on the 1986 precedent in Thornburg v. Gingles, is unconstitutional. This move indicates a potential reversal of the Court's own recent decision in a similar Alabama case and aligns with its historical skepticism of the Voting Rights Act. The outcome could significantly reduce safeguards against diluting minority voting power across the country.</p>

          <p>The search for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of killing four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has entered its fourth day. Authorities believe Brown, who is considered armed and dangerous, shot the victims in The Owl Bar before fleeing and stealing a vehicle containing camping gear. Investigators say Brown was a regular at the bar and knew the victims, but a motive remains unclear. Brown's niece stated he has struggled with mental illness for years, while the tight-knit community remains shocked by the violence.</p>

          <p>Despite leading the league in several offensive categories, the Los Angeles Dodgers' lineup has struggled recently, with several star players in a slump. Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Teoscar Hernández have all seen their production decline significantly over the past couple of months. Betts is battling a prolonged hitless streak, while Ohtani's strikeout rate has climbed since he resumed pitching, and Hernández has not returned to his early-season form after a groin injury. The team is counting on these key hitters to regain their consistency and power for the crucial stretch run of the season.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is scheduled to execute inmate Byron Black despite unresolved concerns about his implanted heart defibrillator. Black's attorneys have argued that the device could deliver painful shocks during the lethal injection process, but the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to have it deactivated. The state contends that even if the device were to activate, Black would be unconscious and unable to feel pain. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters, and his case has raised unique questions about medical ethics in executions.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has granted CEO Elon Musk a new interim compensation package of shares worth approximately $29 billion, aimed at incentivizing him to remain with the company. This award is designed as a placeholder while his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 is contested in court, after a Delaware judge voided it. The new shares will vest over two years, provided Musk stays in a key executive role, and will be forfeited if the original package is ultimately reinstated on appeal. The move comes as Musk has publicly expressed a desire for greater voting control over the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Biden administration's SAVE student loan plan now defunct and interest resuming for those in its forbearance program, experts are advising borrowers to switch to a new repayment plan. Staying in the payment pause will cause debt balances to grow, as a typical borrower could accrue over $200 in interest per month. Furthermore, time spent in forbearance does not count toward loan forgiveness. Most experts recommend borrowers transition to the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, which is now one of the few remaining affordable options to manage payments and work toward eventual debt cancellation.
