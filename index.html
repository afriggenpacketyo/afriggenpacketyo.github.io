The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) responded to what they described as a "mass casualty" event and later confirmed that the suspect in the attack has also died. The investigation is now being led by the RCMP's major crimes unit, and the community's chief and council have offered condolences to those affected by the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The recent assassination of former Ukrainian parliamentary leader Andriy Parubiy in Lviv has intensified concerns about the safety of public figures in Ukraine. The suspected perpetrator, who later confessed, claimed personal motives, but Ukrainian authorities and experts suggest a link to Russian intelligence services aiming to destabilize the country. This event is part of a perceived pattern of attacks against Ukrainian politicians and activists, fueling a debate about the effectiveness of Ukrainian security services and the methods Russia uses in its hybrid warfare strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical trial conducted by researchers at Saarland University in Germany found that an over-the-counter azelastine nasal spray could substantially lower the risk of contracting COVID-19. In the study, healthy adults who used the spray three times daily had a 2.2% infection rate, compared to 6.7% in the placebo group. The findings suggest the readily available allergy spray may serve as an additional prophylactic measure, particularly for vulnerable individuals, though researchers emphasize the need for larger trials to confirm its effectiveness against various respiratory viruses.</p>

Rayner referred herself to the standards adviser after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a property, which she attributed to incorrect legal advice. While Starmer affirmed he would act on the adviser's forthcoming report, he deflected questions about potential consequences, emphasizing the need to first establish the facts, as opposition parties call for her resignation.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has stated that a coalition of 26 Western allies is prepared to deploy troops to Ukraine immediately following a ceasefire agreement to provide security guarantees. This "reassurance force" would be activated the moment hostilities cease, with U.S. support for the initiative expected to be finalized soon. The announcement comes amid dimming prospects for direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, as allies focus on securing a ceasefire first and then providing robust security assurances to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis examines the best age for Americans to claim Social Security benefits to maximize their retirement income. While benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, this results in a permanently reduced monthly payment. Waiting until full retirement age (66-67) provides the standard benefit, but delaying until age 70 can increase payments by approximately 8% for each year of deferral. The article suggests that for those who can afford to wait, delaying claims can provide a significantly larger and more secure income stream in later life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas is poised to sign a new law that empowers private citizens to file lawsuits against any out-of-state manufacturers or distributors who supply abortion pills to Texas residents. Under the legislation, successful plaintiffs could be awarded at least $100,000 in damages from the providers. This law is seen by opponents as a tactic to intimidate providers in states where abortion is legal and further restrict access for Texans, who already face a near-total ban on abortion. The measure is expected to face immediate and significant legal challenges.</p>

He suggested that such a program could play an "important part" in reducing incentives for unauthorized entry into the UK. Starmer noted that public perception of digital identity has evolved significantly since a previous, controversial physical ID card scheme was abandoned over a decade ago due to privacy concerns, indicating a new debate on the issue may be forthcoming.</p>
