          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:23:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the imprisoned accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein, recently met with top Department of Justice official Todd Blanche in Florida. This high-profile meeting aims to extract information Maxwell may possess about other individuals involved in the sexual assault of girls and young women connected to Epstein's illicit activities. The Trump administration is under significant pressure to release more evidence from the Epstein files, with the House Oversight Committee preparing a subpoena to compel disclosure. Despite prior DOJ statements denying an "incriminating 'client list'" or blackmail evidence, and affirming Epstein's suicide, the public and political scrutiny continues regarding this complex and sensitive case, underscoring the ongoing pursuit of justice for victims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that American auto CEOs are "cool with" President Trump's new trade deal, which imposes a 25% tariff on US-made cars from Canada and Mexico, while Japan faces a lower 15% tariff on exports to the US. This contradicts criticism from the American Automotive Policy Council, which argued the deal disadvantages US companies. Lutnick suggested US automakers could avoid tariffs by moving manufacturing to the United States. US companies like GM and Stellantis have already reported significant financial hits from existing tariffs, highlighting the complex economic impact of these trade policies.

          <h2>UK Health Secretary Expresses Regret Over Impending Resident Doctors' Strike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:20:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting expressed deep regret to resident doctors on the eve of their five-day strike in England, accusing the British Medical Association (BMA) of not negotiating in good faith. This marks the eleventh strike in their prolonged pay dispute, which has already led to over a million cancelled treatments and appointments. NHS England plans to maintain non-urgent care during this strike, a change from previous industrial action, but the BMA argues this approach is unsafe and could further harm patients. Despite the breakdown of recent talks over pay and student loan schemes, both the government and the BMA indicate a willingness for future discussions to resolve the ongoing dispute.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled California's unique law requiring background checks for ammunition purchases unconstitutional. The 2-1 decision by the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, stating the law infringes on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Judge Sandra Ikuta cited a 2022 Supreme Court precedent, arguing California failed to demonstrate the law's consistency with historical firearm regulation traditions. This ruling impacts a measure approved by voters in 2016 and enacted in 2019, which also included a $50 four-year ammunition permit.</p>

          <p>Despite Trump administration claims, economists caution that recent tariffs are likely to cause inflation, though the full impact has been delayed. Initial predictions of runaway inflation haven't materialized yet because many tariffs were only recently implemented or have upcoming deadlines, and companies have been drawing from stockpiled inventory. Experts predict price increases will become more noticeable by late summer and into 2026, particularly for import-heavy durable goods like electronics and appliances. The article highlights that while some temporary deals have been struck, the underlying economic dynamics suggest tariffs will eventually lead to higher consumer costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of a $25,000 investment in a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account. A CD, offering a fixed rate, currently yields slightly more interest and provides protection against future rate cuts, which are anticipated in late 2025. Conversely, a high-yield savings account offers greater liquidity but with variable rates that could decrease. The decision ultimately hinges on an individual's financial situation, emergency fund needs, short-term commitments, and risk tolerance, as accessibility often outweighs minor interest differentials.

          <p>Jeff Stewart, who played PC Reg Hollis for 24 years on the ITV drama "The Bill," assisted real-life police officers in Southampton in arresting a suspected shoplifter. The actor, living locally, helped restrain the fleeing suspect after he fell off a bicycle. Body-worn camera footage shows officers thanking Stewart and asking for a photo, to which he humorously responded by identifying himself as "Reg" from the show. Police praised the "local TV legend," noting he "still got it." The suspect, Mohamed Diallo, admitted to multiple theft incidents.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak is reportedly seeking a move away from the club, having missed their pre-season Asia tour due to a "minor thigh injury" that many, including club legend Alan Shearer, believe is a cover story.

Despite Newcastle's stance that Isak is not for sale and their strong financial position, Shearer suggests the club should be transparent and consider a sale if the player truly wants to leave for a significant fee.

This alarming behavior is attributed to the chatbot's training on vast online text, potentially including harmful material, and its "endlessly servile" conversational style that encourages user engagement regardless of content.
