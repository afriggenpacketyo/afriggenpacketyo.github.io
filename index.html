          <h2>US Requests Japan Increase Defense Spending Amidst Security Concerns</h2>

          <p>The United States has requested that Japan increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its GDP, a move that could potentially disrupt planned high-level meetings between the two countries. This request, reportedly made by U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby, follows Japan's earlier commitment to double its defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027. The increased demand reflects ongoing U.S. concerns about the U.S.-Japan security treaty and the financial burden of American troops stationed in Japan, with the Trump administration seeking greater financial contributions from Tokyo. The request comes as bilateral negotiations over tariffs are proceeding.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News asserts that legacy media outlets exhibit bias by selectively covering congressional hearings based on partisan interests.

          <p>Donald Trump's presidency has increasingly blurred the lines between business and politics, with the launch of Trump-branded products and real estate ventures raising ethical concerns. Since his reelection campaign began, Trump's net worth has reportedly doubled to $5.4 billion, fueled by ventures like Trump Mobile and other licensing deals. Critics argue that Trump's commercial activities exploit his political persona and undermine the separation between power and profit. Despite the ethical questions, Trump's supporters view his business success as evidence of his self-made status and outsider appeal.</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* argues that going to war with Iran would pose a significant threat to American democracy, given Donald Trump's increasing consolidation of power. The author suggests that Trump could exploit a state of war to further strengthen his dictatorial control, suppress dissent, and expand the use of military force for domestic oppression. Additionally, the author expresses concern that any success Trump claims in Iran would bolster anti-liberal forces globally. The author concludes that the United States is at risk of becoming a military dictatorship and that war with Iran would likely accelerate its demise.</p>

          <p>Celine Song's film *Materialists* uses a plotline involving sexual assault to drive the protagonist's emotional growth, drawing comparisons to the controversial film *Showgirls*. In *Materialists*, the protagonist Lucy's client, Sophie, is assaulted after being set up by Lucy's matchmaking company, leading Lucy to confront her cynical approach to love and dating. While not as exploitative as *Showgirls*, the article argues that the film uses Sophie's trauma as a means of redeeming Lucy, which feels cynical given the film's marketing as a rom-com.

Gabbard shared a video of her earlier testimony where she cited US intelligence agencies' conclusion that Iran was not actively building nuclear weapons.

          <p>The LAPD's response to recent protests has triggered outrage, injuries, and lawsuits, raising concerns about excessive force. Demonstrators and journalists report being targeted with foam projectiles, tear gas, and pepper spray, despite promises to rein in indiscriminate use of force. Tensions reportedly ran high between LAPD commanders and City Hall officials, who pushed for restraint. Civil rights attorneys are filing excessive force claims against the city, while the LAPD defends its actions as necessary to address agitators throwing objects at officers.</p>

          <p>Two large sculptures worth $2.1 million were stolen from a warehouse in Anaheim Hills, California, baffling authorities. The sculptures, created by artist Sir Daniel Winn, weigh thousands of pounds and required significant effort to move. Police are investigating whether the theft was carried out by an unscrupulous collector or if the sculptures will be destroyed for scrap metal. The artist, who considers the sculptures his "children," expressed distress over the loss, while an art recovery expert believes they will likely be melted down.</p>

          <p>Investigators are exploring whether anti-abortion extremism played a role in the recent killings and shooting in Minnesota. While initial focus centered on political motives, attention has shifted to the suspect's religious background and views on abortion. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, had notebooks detailing potential targets, including Democratic officials and abortion rights supporters. Some scholars suggest the attack aligns with a pattern of anti-abortion violence linked to conservative Evangelical Christian movements, particularly the New Apostolic Reformation, which uses war-like rhetoric against those supporting abortion rights.</p>

          <p>As the war between Israel and Iran continues, the effectiveness of Israel's air defense system is being tested. Iran has launched hundreds of missiles and drones, prompting Israel to use its interceptors at a rapid pace. Experts worry that Israel's supply of interceptors could eventually run out, forcing the country to prioritize defending key military targets over civilian infrastructure. Israel claims to have crippled Iran's air defense, allowing it to strike targets at will, but civilians on both sides are paying a heavy price.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has increased its military maneuvers around Taiwan, evolving from occasional sorties to a well-coordinated campaign designed for both combat training and strategic signaling. These operations fall into three categories: near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises. Near-daily patrols have increased sharply since 2024, while combat-readiness patrols simulate attacks on Taiwan. Large-scale joint forces exercises, such as Joint Sword 2025, demonstrate the PLA's comprehensive capabilities and resolve.</p>

          <p>China's real estate sector, already struggling with a prolonged downturn, faces further challenges due to a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in urban cities will remain suppressed, falling to below 1.39 billion by 2035. The country's population has been declining for the past three years, and shrinking population will cripple home demand by 0.5 million units every year in the 2020s and a lead to a bigger dent of 1.4 million units annually in the 2030s. Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, stagnant incomes and job instability have dissuaded young people from having more children.</p>

          <p>Japan's proactive approach to supply chain resilience offers a valuable lesson for Western nations facing China's dominance in critical minerals. Following a 2010 export ban on rare earths targeting Tokyo, Japan diversified its supply chains by investing in non-China projects, stockpiling resources, and promoting alternative technologies. As a result, Japan has reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. While challenges remain, particularly in heavy rare earths, Japan's experience underscores the importance of strategic planning and diversification to mitigate supply chain risks.</p>

It points to recent criticism of celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae, suggesting that these critiques often lack historical context and economic awareness. The author argues that the current online discourse, driven by algorithms and puritanical views, has stifled nuanced discussion about women, power, and sexuality. The piece advocates for a return to more complex and economically informed feminist critiques.</p>
