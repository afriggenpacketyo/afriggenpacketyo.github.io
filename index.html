          <p>Danish wind farm operator Orsted has announced plans to cut 2,000 jobs, a quarter of its workforce, by the end of 2027. This decision follows significant challenges in the U.S. market, including a Trump administration executive order suspending new wind leases and a temporary halt to its Revolution Wind project. The company aims to refocus its efforts on Europe and achieve annual savings of approximately $311 million by 2028, citing the need for a more efficient and competitive organization to bid on new projects.</p>

          <p>Luxury automaker Ferrari has revised its electric vehicle ambitions, now targeting a 2030 model lineup of 20% fully electric cars, down from a previous goal of 40%. The company cited a client-centric approach and evolving market conditions for the change, a trend seen across other global carmakers facing challenges with EV adoption. While unveiling the chassis for its first EV, "elettrica," set for a late 2026 delivery, the announcement led to a significant 13% drop in its Milan-listed shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially designating the loosely organized, leftist movement Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. The administration accuses the group of radicalizing young Americans for political violence, though experts question the practical and legal implications of targeting a movement without a formal leadership or structure. Legal scholars have raised concerns that the move could be challenged on First Amendment grounds and may lead to governmental overreach, as there is no existing legal mechanism for such a domestic designation.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo announced fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, driven primarily by strong growth in its international markets. This global success helped to balance a continued decline in sales volume within its North American division. The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.29 per share on revenue of $23.94 billion, narrowly beating the LSEG forecast. Despite the positive results, net income was down compared to the same period last year, falling from $2.93 billion to $2.6 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, a prominent supporter of Israel, offered congratulations to President Donald Trump for a peace plan agreed upon by Israel and Hamas. The first phase of the deal is set to secure the release of all hostages and involve a withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed-upon line. Fetterman highlighted a shared "ironclad commitment to Israel" despite party differences, joining others who have praised the president's diplomatic efforts in ending the two-year conflict.</p>

          <p>The legal case of Bella Culley, a 19-year-old British woman accused of smuggling drugs into Georgia, has been postponed to allow for the finalization of a plea bargain. Culley, who is pregnant, was arrested at Tbilisi International Airport with 12kg of marijuana and 2kg of hashish and faced a potential life sentence. Her family has reportedly raised a substantial sum of money which is expected to significantly reduce her jail time. Her lawyer plans to appeal to the Georgian president for a pardon once the plea deal is finalized.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the most significant threats from artificial intelligence to democracy are not immediate election deepfakes but long-term structural changes. The authors identify three primary risks: AI supplanting genuine communication between politicians and constituents, the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of tech leaders who may dismantle democratic governance, and the erosion of the fact-based news industry as AI models divert traffic. They urge policymakers to resist arguments for inaction and instead focus on developing cautious, human-centric regulations for AI.</p>

This idea, later amplified by Enlightenment thinkers, provided a moral foundation for the American experiment, challenging the prevailing European doctrine of the divine right of kings.</p>

          <p>This article examines the Declaration of Independence's final grievance, which condemns King George III for inciting “merciless Indian Savages” against the colonists. This portrayal was a strategic departure from the colonists' long-standing interactions with sophisticated Native governments, such as the Iroquois Confederacy, which even Benjamin Franklin admired. By casting Native peoples as irrational and lawless, the colonists justified their own expansionist ambitions and erased the legitimacy of Indigenous sovereignty. This framing reveals how the Revolution was a contest over land and governance, not just a fight against tyranny.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has claimed that a boat recently bombed by the United States in the Caribbean was carrying Colombian citizens, an allegation the White House has dismissed as "baseless." The U.S. has conducted at least four strikes on vessels in the region, stating they were targeting narco-traffickers, but has not provided details on the identities of the 21 people killed. The strikes have drawn condemnation from regional leaders over concerns they may violate international law, while a U.S. Senate measure to block the military action was narrowly rejected.</p>

          <p>Germany's coalition government has presented a new package of reforms that includes stricter sanctions on social welfare payments, changes to the pension system, and new subsidies for electric vehicles. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that obligations for welfare recipients to cooperate will be strengthened, a move criticized by the opposition Green party as "cold-hearted and inhumane." The reforms come after extended negotiations within the coalition and also address economic competition from China by boosting support for the domestic electric vehicle industry.</p>
