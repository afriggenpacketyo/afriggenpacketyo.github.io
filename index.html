          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a Â£2 billion upgrade project that began in 2002. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While Welsh ministers tout the economic benefits, critics cite the project's cost and delays, with Plaid Cymru criticizing the funding model as a waste of public money.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government began releasing its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, offering consumers cheaper alternatives amid soaring rice prices. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice, pricing a 5 kilogram bag at 2,160 yen ($15) including tax. The initiative aims to alleviate the financial burden on households struggling with rising costs. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes this direct approach will be more effective in curbing rice prices than previous auction-based efforts.</p>

          <p>A California prisons panel has recommended that Patricia Krenwinkel, a member of the Manson "family" serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Los Angeles killings, be released on parole. The parole board cited Krenwinkel's age and spotless behavior record as reasons for deeming her a low risk for reoffending. The decision is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a similar recommendation in 2022. Krenwinkel was convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder for her involvement in the Manson family's violent spree.</p>

          <p>Brazil's environmental movement is under threat as President Lula sides with the oil industry, leading to legislative defeats and attacks on Environment Minister Marina Silva. Silva was publicly berated in a senate meeting while defending efforts to protect Brazil's natural resources. Lula's support for oil exploration in the Amazon and the passage of a bill stripping environmental licensing powers from Silva's ministry have weakened environmental protections. Despite Lula's defense of Silva after the senate attacks, his actions highlight the contradictions between his environmental promises and his support for economic projects.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax bill, which includes a tax on remittances leaving the U.S. from non-citizens, is expected to significantly impact African economies.

The tax is criticized for disproportionately affecting lower-income migrants who send money to support their families back home. Experts predict that migrants will seek unofficial channels to evade the tax, reducing recorded transactions (not investment advice).</p>
