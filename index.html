        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has accused Pakistan of violating a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, heightening tensions that have been escalating since an April attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that Pakistan violated the ceasefire agreement on Saturday evening and urged Pakistan to cease violations to prevent further escalation, promising an appropriate response. Omar Abdullah, chief minister for the territory of Kashmir and Jammu, reported hearing explosions in Srinagar. The conflict stems from a recent attack on Hindu tourists, which India blames on Pakistani-backed militants, while Pakistan denies involvement and claims retaliatory strikes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease using the "social cost of carbon" metric when developing policies and regulations, a tool that estimates the economic damage from global warming. Jeffrey B. Clark of the White House argued there were too many uncertainties in calculating the figure, doubting the scientific consensus on pollution's role in climate change. Scientists and environmental groups criticize this decision, arguing it ignores the real and growing harms of climate change. The move is expected to facilitate the rollback of climate regulations, potentially facing legal challenges from environmental groups.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described the talks between Ukraine's allies in Kyiv as a significant moment in the effort to secure a ceasefire with Russia, while acknowledging it's not the end of the process. Around 30 global leaders reaffirmed their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening substantial sanctions if Russia does not comply. Sir Keir noted the unity in the demand and the planned response, a unity not previously seen during the conflict. The Kremlin reacted with skepticism, accusing European leaders of confrontational remarks and insisting that weapons shipments to Ukraine must cease before any ceasefire can be considered.</p>

          <p>As negotiations intensify for President Donald Trump's tax agenda, key issues and potential obstacles are emerging, particularly within the House Ways and Means Committee. With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, they aim to pass Trump's package via reconciliation, bypassing the Senate filibuster. However, the narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for fiscal responsibility could complicate the process, impacting individual provisions. Experts highlight the challenges of fitting the proposals within a limited budget framework given competing priorities.</p>

Democrats, previously open to stablecoin legislation, have defected due to Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, and his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces the risk of being labeled "Too Late" by President Donald Trump, as historical patterns suggest the Fed often acts slowly in response to economic shifts. Despite Trump's calls for rate cuts, Powell is hesitant amidst volatile policies and tariff threats, with economists divided on the appropriate course of action. The Fed's caution stems from uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs on both growth and inflation, leaving Powell in a challenging position. While recent data shows no immediate price spikes or slowdown, surveys indicate heightened concerns in the manufacturing, service, and consumer sectors.</p>

The protests, which led to multiple arrests, prompted Columbia University and Barnard College to temporarily suspend student journalists who reported on the events.
