          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested while protesting at the Delaney Hall Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center alongside members of Congress. Baraka was taken into custody after allegedly trespassing and ignoring warnings from Homeland Security Investigations. The city of Newark had previously raised concerns about the facility's safety protocols, while the Department of Homeland Security maintains that the facility has proper permitting and houses undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy criticized Baraka's arrest and called for his immediate release.</p>

          <p>South Africa's foreign ministry has criticized a U.S. plan to potentially accept white Afrikaners as refugees, calling the move politically motivated and undermining South Africa's constitutional democracy. The U.S. State Department stated it is prioritizing Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination. This decision comes as the Trump administration has halted nearly all migrant asylum claims. Elon Musk, a top adviser in the Trump administration who grew up in South Africa during apartheid, has been critical of Pretoria, claiming that it is leading a "genocide" against white farmers.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned Congressional leaders that the U.S. could face default by August if Congress does not address the debt ceiling. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, Bessent urged lawmakers to act by mid-July to avoid jeopardizing the nation's financial system and global leadership. Failure to suspend or increase the debt limit could have severe consequences for financial markets, businesses, and the federal government. The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>A brief radar outage at an air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, which guides planes at Newark Liberty International Airport, caused further disruptions to air travel and intensified safety concerns. This incident follows a similar outage last week that caused widespread delays and cancellations. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a plan to modernize the air traffic control system, but the plan requires Congressional approval. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby criticized the FAA's handling of flight scheduling at Newark, citing weather, staffing, and technology breakdowns as contributing factors to the airport's congestion.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in April due to steep tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, making it too costly for U.S. retailers to import goods. In response, China has retaliated with levies on American goods. President Trump indicated that the levies on China could come down to 80%. Retailers are rethinking their supply chains to reduce reliance on China. UBS analysts expect U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to settle around 34%.</p>

          <p>Analysts are lowering expectations for the trade talks between top US and Chinese officials in Switzerland, anticipating discussions focused on frameworks and setting boundaries rather than a definitive deal. The meeting follows the U.S. imposing 145% tariffs on Chinese imports and China retaliating with 125% import taxes. Experts suggest that both sides have wish lists but are primarily setting the stage for more formal negotiations. Trump has preemptively suggested nearly halving the sky-high US tariffs, contingent on his deputy's decision.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association's enforced skort rule has sparked a debate about sexism, with former players and county teams calling for a change to allow women and girls the choice between wearing skorts or shorts.

Cork camogie player Ashling Thompson said her team would wear shorts in the Munster final and refuse to change.

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store, following a court ruling that favored the game maker in a contempt ruling. Fortnite was removed from the App Store in 2020 after Epic Games attempted to bypass Apple's commission fees. The recent ruling allows link-outs to external websites, paving the way for Fortnite's return. Apple is appealing last month's contempt ruling.</p>

          <p>The stock market has been rocked with uncertainty in 2025, with many of the perennial megacap winners falling out of favor and defensive names stepping up. Linde, Honeywell, Eaton, Dover and DuPont are all industrial stocks with defensive qualities. The portfolio's most defensive stocks, so it's no surprise that it's also our best-performing industrial-focused name in 2025 and No. 4 overall.</p>
