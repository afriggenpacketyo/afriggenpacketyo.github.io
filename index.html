          <p>Several major banks and the American Bankers Association have voiced support for President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," arguing it provides necessary tax relief and could stimulate the U.S. economy. Proponents, like economists from Nomura and Citi, believe the bill will avert a fiscal contraction by extending expiring tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. However, critics, including the Congressional Budget Office and the Tax Foundation, raise serious concerns about its fiscal irresponsibility, projecting it will add at least $3 trillion to the federal deficit. The bill's complexity and potential administrative burden on the IRS are also cited as significant drawbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is advancing its version of a massive spending and tax package, aiming for passage before the July 4th deadline. Central to the legislation is an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, alongside increased funding for border security, defense, and energy, offset by cuts to health and nutrition programs. Key provisions include new work requirements for Medicaid, an increased cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and cost-sharing changes for the SNAP food assistance program. The bill also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion and makes adjustments to the child tax credit and deductions for overtime and tips.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Jessica Pegula, the third seed at Wimbledon, was unexpectedly eliminated in the first round by Italy's Elisabetta Cocciaretto, who is ranked 113 places lower. Pegula, who recently won a title in Germany, described the 6-2, 6-3 loss as her "worst result of the year," struggling with 24 unforced errors and failing to generate a single break point. The defeat marks a significant setback for Pegula, who has consistently been a top-10 player but has struggled to advance deep into Grand Slam tournaments. This is her earliest exit from a major since the 2020 French Open.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her duties pending an ethics investigation. The case stems from a leaked phone call with a senior Cambodian leader regarding a deadly border dispute, which sparked public protests and accusations that she undermined national sovereignty. The court voted unanimously to accept the petition and gave her 12 days to present evidence in her defense. Paetongtarn has maintained that her intention was to prevent armed conflict and save soldiers' lives, stating she was working to maintain sovereignty during the conversation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials. Located at the remote Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, the site has been rapidly modified to hold up to 5,000 undocumented immigrants for processing and deportation. Governor Ron DeSantis highlighted the facility's isolation and surrounding dangerous wildlife as a natural security feature, while the administration noted it will be funded in part by FEMA. Environmental groups have filed a lawsuit to block the center's opening, demanding a proper environmental review for the project.</p>

Due to the nature of the alleged crimes, health officials are recommending that approximately 1,200 children who attended two of the centers be tested for infectious diseases as a precaution.

          <p>The suspension of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has plunged the nation into further political uncertainty, with analysts predicting her likely dismissal by the Constitutional Court. This event marks another blow to the Pheu Thai party and the influential Shinawatra family, whose leaders have been repeatedly removed from power by courts and coups over the past two decades. The move is seen as a victory for the conservative, royalist establishment that has long opposed the Shinawatras. With Paetongtarn's father, Thaksin, also facing legal challenges, the future of the family's political dynasty and the country's stability remains highly precarious.</p>

          <p>European analysts express concern that escalating conflict in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran, could have a destabilizing ripple effect across volatile regions of Africa. The Horn of Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable due to existing alliances, such as the cooperation between Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and the al-Shabab militia in Somalia. While some experts believe the direct footprint of Iran and Israel in Africa is limited, the indirect geopolitical effects could include trade disruptions, increased market instability, and security gaps as international attention is focused elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Despite expectations for a rebound, U.S. spending on luxury goods fell in the first five months of 2025 compared to the previous year, according to a Citigroup report. While categories like leather goods and ready-to-wear faltered, jewelry has consistently outperformed, with spending surging 10.1% year-over-year in May. Analysts suggest this resilience is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment, especially with rising gold prices, and its sentimental value for commemorating milestones. In contrast, other luxury sectors have seen demand wane amid significant price hikes without corresponding innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

The operation targeted complex fraud operations, some run by transnational criminal organizations, that submitted false claims to programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Officials reported that the actual loss to the government was about $2.9 billion, and the enforcement action led to the seizure of over $245 million in assets. Among those charged are 93 doctors and other medical professionals.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock fell over 5% after President Donald Trump suggested in a social media post that the government should investigate and potentially cut federal subsidies for Elon Musk's companies. The comment came after Musk renewed his public criticism of the administration's large tax and spending bill, which Musk argues will bankrupt the country. Trump stated that without subsidies, Musk might have to "close up shop," and suggested his Department of Government Efficiency should examine the matter. This reignites a public feud between the two influential figures that had previously caused a significant drop in Tesla's market value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Iran's recent conflict with Israel has exposed the limitations of China's and Russia's strategic partnerships and global influence. Despite strong condemnations, neither country offered tangible support to Iran, leaving it isolated and unable to effectively deter or retaliate against Israeli strikes. This perceived weakness could send a powerful message to other nations in Asia, potentially bolstering arguments for developing their own nuclear deterrents to ensure their security. The author suggests that China's inability to project power in the Middle East undermines its ambitions as a global security mediator and could inadvertently increase regional instability.</p>

          <p>This article explains the critical differences between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke, offering guidance on how to recognize and respond to each. Heat exhaustion, an earlier stage of overheating, presents with symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and dizziness, and can be treated by moving to a cool place and rehydrating. If left untreated, it can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening emergency where the body's temperature regulation system fails, sweat production stops, and body temperature can rise rapidly. For heat stroke, immediate emergency medical attention is crucial, along with rapid cooling measures.</p>

          <p>A novel titled "Parting," written in 1932 by a 24-year-old Sebastian Haffner before he fled Nazi Germany, has become a bestseller nearly a quarter-century after its manuscript was discovered. Haffner, a renowned journalist and historian, shelved the autobiographical love story, which was found by his son after his death in 1999. The book, which captures a sense of hope and joie de vivre amidst the looming threat of fascism, tells the story of a young couple torn between Berlin and Paris. Its publication offers a new perspective on Haffner, revealing a talent for fiction that was overshadowed by his later, more serious historical works.</p>

Conversely, provisions such as eliminating federal income tax on tips and overtime have been met with excitement by service workers and firefighters.

With its traditional reliance on the global rules-based order and a military designed to complement America's, Canada finds itself vulnerable and unprepared.
