          <p>A tense calm has settled over the Syrian city of Suweida following a week of violent clashes involving Druze fighters, Bedouin gunmen, and government forces. The fighting, which erupted after the abduction of a Druze merchant, has resulted in over 1,000 deaths and displaced at least 128,000 people. Despite a ceasefire declared by Syria's president, the humanitarian situation is dire, with local hospitals overwhelmed and facing severe shortages of medical supplies. The city remains under the control of local Druze fighters after Bedouin gunmen reportedly withdrew, but tensions in the region persist.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Penalty Kicks Are Increasingly Missed in Women's Soccer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:11:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Euro 2025 tournament has seen a historically low penalty success rate of just 58.5%, prompting analysis into the reasons behind the trend. Experts suggest a combination of factors is at play, including the increased pressure on players due to the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight. Additionally, goalkeepers are now better prepared with data-driven scouting on penalty takers' habits, and the overall physical and technical abilities of female keepers have significantly improved. This evolution marks a shift from the days when penalties were considered almost certain goals in the women's game.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation has released hundreds of documents related to the controversial "Cop City" police training center. The records, obtained after a lawsuit by a news outlet and a research group, reveal the foundation's efforts to lobby city officials against a public referendum on the project. This case sets a significant precedent for the transparency of private police foundations, which often operate without public scrutiny. While the ruling doesn't classify all police foundations as public agencies, it opens the door for further accountability efforts nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is aggressively promoting oil, gas, and coal while cutting support for green energy, a move critics argue is setting back environmental protection by decades. Citing a self-declared national energy emergency, the administration has gutted tax credits for wind and solar projects and proposed shuttering federal labs that research climate change. Scholars and watchdogs contend these policies ignore scientific evidence linking fossil fuels to climate change and are designed to benefit fossil-fuel industry donors. The actions are occurring even as the country faces an increase in climate-related natural disasters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new "Gold Standard" for scientific integrity, which critics argue is a thinly veiled attempt to politicize science and delay regulations. The policy gives political appointees, rather than career scientists, the power to define what constitutes credible evidence, echoing tactics used by the tobacco industry to manufacture doubt. This framework could allow officials to block public health and environmental protections, such as those for PFAS "forever chemicals," by demanding unattainable levels of certainty or cherry-picking data. This move is seen as part of a broader effort to weaken the nation's scientific infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has issued new evacuation orders for parts of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, an area previously spared from ground offensives, causing widespread panic among residents and displaced families. The directive suggests an imminent military operation in the crowded city, where it is also feared Israeli hostages are being held. This development comes as health officials report more than 40 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while awaiting aid trucks in Gaza City. The ongoing war, now in its 21st month, has displaced the vast majority of Gaza's population.</p>

The book excerpt highlights the era's spirit of exploration, where vast parts of the world remained unknown and every expedition held the promise of fame.

While infections are still relatively rare, they can be serious, particularly for individuals with weakened immune systems, and can be contracted by eating raw shellfish or swimming with open wounds.

Morrison, whose work influenced the film, notes that Superman was created by the sons of Jewish immigrants and was originally portrayed as a "socialist figure" and "champion of the oppressed." Early comics depicted him fighting corrupt bosses and tearing down slums to force the construction of affordable housing. The character's identity has evolved over the decades, reflecting the changing social and political landscapes of America, from a patriotic warrior to a cosmic seeker.</p>

          <p>Amid growing public dissatisfaction with the two major political parties, experts like Lee Drutman argue that the American two-party system has outlived its usefulness. The primary obstacle for third parties is the "single-winner" electoral system, which renders votes for smaller parties as "spoilers" and discourages ambitious candidates from joining them. Drutman advocates for a shift to a multi-member proportional representation system, common in other democracies, where parties gain seats proportional to their vote share. This reform would make gerrymandering irrelevant and allow for a more diverse and representative range of political voices.</p>

          <p>An epidemic of pitching-related arm injuries is affecting baseball at all levels, from youth leagues to the MLB, driven by an industry-wide obsession with maximizing velocity and spin. Orthopedic surgeons like Dr. Keith Meister, the Texas Rangers' team physician, warn that this high-stakes pursuit is leading to a surge in career-altering surgeries, even for teenage athletes. While MLB has acknowledged the problem, critics argue that not enough is being done to change the culture. The pressure to throw harder is so intense that some youth players now see the risk of Tommy John surgery as a sign they are throwing hard enough.</p>

          <p>New US tariffs have crippled the garment industry in Lesotho, once known as the "Denim Capital of Africa," leading to factory closures and widespread unemployment. The tariffs, imposed by the Trump administration due to a trade imbalance, have effectively nullified the benefits of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which had previously allowed tariff-free access to the US market. Thousands of workers, many of them single mothers, are now jobless and facing hunger. The economic fallout is severe, with spillover effects threatening the livelihoods of an estimated 40,000 people in the impoverished nation.</p>

          <p>A new study by Common Sense Media reveals that nearly three-quarters of American teenagers have used conversational AI companions for social interactions like flirting, seeking advice, or simply chatting. While a majority still prefer and find more satisfaction in human friendships, a concerning one-third have discussed serious matters with AI instead of people. The study raises concerns about data privacy, as many teens share personal information, and the potential impact on social development during the critical adolescent years. The nonprofit recommends that no one under 18 use these AI companions due to these risks.</p>

          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' first Test victory over Australia, much of the narrative has focused on the "desperation" of the Wallabies to keep the series alive. However, this analysis suggests that desperation alone may not be enough to bridge the gap in quality between the two teams. While the Lions had a period of sloppiness that allowed Australia to score late, their performance in the first 50 minutes showed a team on a different level, both physically and creatively. The article posits that if the Lions can maintain their focus, they are likely to win convincingly in the next match.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently passed "big beautiful bill" introduces several significant tax changes that will take effect in 2025 and impact returns filed in 2026. Financial advisors are currently analyzing the complex legislation to understand its full implications for their clients. The law contains numerous interconnected provisions, and experts warn that without careful income planning, taxpayers could inadvertently reduce or lose tax benefits they might otherwise be eligible for. The full effect of the so-called "working family tax cuts" will vary greatly depending on an individual's financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, calling it a "water revolution." Acknowledging that the water sector is "broken" and its regulator is "failing," the government plans tougher measures for water company bosses, including potential prison sentences for non-compliance. The pledge marks the first time a clear numerical target has been set for reducing pollution spills, following widespread public anger. The government ruled out nationalizing the industry, citing prohibitive costs of over £100 billion.</p>

          <p>A remarkable fossil of a pterosaur discovered in northeastern China is challenging long-held beliefs about the diet of these ancient flying reptiles. The stomach contents of the Sinopterus atavismus fossil contained microscopic plant mineral deposits, known as phytoliths, and quartz crystals, which were likely ingested to help grind tough plant matter. This is the first direct evidence confirming herbivory in this type of pterosaur, suggesting that not all of these creatures were fish-eaters or carnivores. The finding, published in Science Bulletin, sheds new light on the diverse ecosystems of the dinosaur era.</p>
