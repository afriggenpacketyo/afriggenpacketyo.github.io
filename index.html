          <h2>Economic Shifts May Explain the Growing Political Divide Between Men and Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 06:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economist argues that the increasing political divergence between young men and women is rooted in economic shifts over the past half-century. The decline of manufacturing, traditionally a male-dominated sector, has left men with fewer job opportunities and lower social trust, leading to more regressive gender norms. While women have found empowerment through feminist messages and new roles in the cognitive economy, men have struggled to adapt, creating a crisis of masculinity. The article suggests that redefining men's roles in caretaking and producing could help bridge this divide, emphasizing that most young men are not inherently misogynistic and are open to more inclusive roles. This economic perspective offers a nuanced understanding beyond culture war narratives.</p>

          <p>Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina, has voiced his support for Ukraine and echoed President Trump's sentiment that Vladimir Putin is "crazy." Wilson advocated for secondary sanctions and increased arms support for Ukraine, emphasizing that the civilized world will not stand by as Putin continues his invasion. This statement comes amid bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate for proposed sanctions against Russia, with Wilson co-sponsoring the House version. The article also notes Zelenskyy's call for stronger sanctions to compel Russia to cease fire and respect international norms, highlighting a unified front against Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Ten people sustained minor injuries following explosions at a construction site in eastern Tokyo, with dozens of buildings damaged. The explosions, possibly caused by a gas leak, occurred in Edogawa Ward, where a fragment of a gas cylinder was recovered. Police suspect workers may have struck the cylinder with a drill during piling work for a new apartment building, leading to the gas ignition. The incident prompted an emergency call, reporting the sound of explosions, and resulted in a service vehicle catching fire, while nearby residents and workers inhaled smoke and sustained other minor injuries.

          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. have risen significantly, while shipments from China have fallen, as Apple accelerates its "made in India" plans to adapt to tariffs. Despite this growth, analysts expect it to slow down, as India's manufacturing capacity is not expected to grow fast enough to meet total U.S. demand. Analysts also suggest that protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing could curb India's ability to expand its iPhone capacity. The article notes that shipment numbers reflect final assembly but are not representative of the entire supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Critics argue that a provision hidden within a Republican budget bill would severely weaken the power of federal courts, effectively allowing President Trump to disregard judicial orders. The measure blocks courts from using contempt to enforce orders, making most existing injunctions unenforceable. According to legal experts, this provision would remove any restraint on Trump, ending American democracy. The article warns that if enacted, no Congress or court could stop Trump, as the bill neuters the ability of the courts to enforce laws.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Four Mothers," compares the experiences of mothers in Japan, Kenya, Finland, and the US, revealing how policy shapes parents' lives. The US is the only rich country without national paid leave, and childbirth costs are significantly higher than in other nations. The author, Abigail Leonard, argues that being 'pronatal' is not the same as being pro-woman, emphasizing that extensive external support like affordable maternity care and childcare are crucial. Leonard points out that resistance to government aid in childrearing in the US is linked to upholding a traditional view of the American family, with corporations having a vested interest in keeping childcare privatized.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warns that Donald Trump's policies and actions are similar to those of far-right regimes in the 1930s. In his new book, Dalio argues that Trump is acting like a CEO without a board, aggressively expanding executive power. He notes that aggressive leaders often work to eliminate opposition, change laws to assume special powers, and control the media. Dalio questions the checks and balances on Trump's power, as there is no board for the US president, highlighting the risk of Trump pushing things too far and the need for effective regulators.</p>

          <p>Jane Lynch, who plays Sazz Pataki in "Only Murders in the Building," initially welcomed the idea of her character being killed off, but the exploration of Sazz and Charles' relationship added poignancy to the series. Despite Sazz's storyline seemingly concluding in Season 4, Lynch confirms she will return in a flashback in the next season. She appreciates Sazz's lack of insecurities and devotion to Charles, drawing parallels to the dynamic between the King's Hand and the king in "Game of Thrones."

          <p>In Vietnam, an unlikely group of barbers and tattoo artists are embracing Chicano culture, calling themselves Viet Chicanos. Nguyen Phuoc Loc, a Vietnamese barber, has never been to the United States, yet he considers himself Chicano, filling his life and work with tributes to Mexican American identity. Symbols of Chicano identity, such as oversized streetwear, elaborate tattoos, and lowrider cars, have permeated mainstream culture, and this subculture is a way of defying traditional societal norms. While the community faces challenges and scrutiny, they persist in perpetuating cultural appreciation and rejecting violence.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, was likely carved rapidly 2.1 million years ago. This occurred when a shifting landscape in Idaho caused a giant lake to overflow, according to ancient river sediments found inside the canyon's caves. Geologists dated the canyon using these cave sediments, finding it younger than the Grand Canyon. The researchers believe the canyon emerged when a huge lake in Idaho drained away, leading to a 'fill and spill' episode that carved out Hells Canyon.</p>

          <p>Japan views President Trump's tariffs as a 'national crisis' due to the threat they pose to its flagging economy, as the U.S. is Japan's most important export market. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces pressure for his handling of tariff negotiations, reflecting Japan's electoral cycle and the LDP's flagging poll numbers. Japan's limited room for maneuver in negotiations with the U.S., coupled with its strategic priority of preserving its security relationship with Washington, further complicates the situation. Despite the constraints, Japan has options, including increasing imports of U.S. agricultural goods and LNG, and leveraging its membership in mega trade blocs like CPTPP and RCEP.</p>
