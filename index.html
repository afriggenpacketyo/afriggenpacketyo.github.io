The industrial conglomerate reported a 7% year-over-year revenue increase to $10.41 billion and raised its full-year guidance for sales and earnings per share. This positive performance comes as the company prepares to spin off its Solstice Advanced Materials business, a move intended to unlock greater shareholder value and allow for more focused operations across its divisions.

This denial follows a Wall Street Journal report suggesting such talks were underway, which caused a temporary surge in the stocks of several quantum firms. While the administration has recently taken stakes in other sectors deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors, the spokesperson clarified that no such discussions are currently happening with quantum technology companies. The development of quantum computing remains a national security interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have detailed the advanced cheating methods allegedly used in a high-stakes illegal poker ring involving NBA figures and organized crime families. According to the indictment, the scheme employed technologies like X-ray tables to read face-down cards, altered card-shuffling machines that predicted winning hands, and hidden cameras. Victims, referred to as "fish," were reportedly lured into games with the promise of playing alongside professional athletes, who were complicit in the fraud. The operation, which allegedly cheated victims out of at least $7 million, highlights a complex and technologically advanced criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump has issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Zhao had previously pleaded guilty to failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program and was sentenced to four months in prison. In its statement, the administration characterized the prosecution as part of the Biden administration's "war on cryptocurrency," arguing that the case lacked allegations of fraud or identifiable victims. The pardon reverses the legal consequences for Zhao, who stepped down as Binance's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>An internal Department of Justice memo from September suggests that prosecutors investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James found evidence that weakens the mortgage fraud case against her, according to sources. The memo indicated that any financial benefit James received from the disputed mortgage was minimal, approximately $800 in the first year, and that proving intent would be difficult due to vague federal guidelines on what constitutes "occupancy" for a second home. This information comes to light after the previous U.S. attorney, who resisted bringing charges, was ousted by President Trump, raising questions about the motivations behind the indictment.</p>

          <p>Following a New York City mayoral debate, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa declared he would organize resistance and become the "worst nightmare" for Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani if Mamdani is elected. Sliwa's comments came after Mamdani admitted he would rank Sliwa second if the election used a ranked-choice system, a statement Mamdani later defended by saying he values candidates who love the city. Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, contrasted himself with others who might leave New York, vowing to remain and hold a potential Mamdani administration accountable. The exchange highlights the contentious political climate of the race.</p>

          <p>The UK government has stated that its planned digital ID scheme will not be applied retrospectively to the current workforce. Instead, it will only be mandatory for individuals starting a new job after the system is implemented, which is expected by 2028. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that the digital ID will not be compulsory for accessing essential services like healthcare and is intended to streamline processes like renting a home. Despite these assurances and aims to "cut the faff," the proposal has faced significant public opposition, with a petition to scrap it garnering nearly three million signatures amid privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, a bill designed to make Internal Revenue Service notices for simple tax return mistakes clearer and more understandable for taxpayers. The legislation, which now heads to the President's desk, addresses concerns that current "math error" notices are often confusing and do not adequately explain how to correct mistakes or the consequences of not responding within the 60-day deadline. While the act will not reduce the number of errors made on returns, proponents argue it will help taxpayers resolve issues without needing to hire expensive legal help.</p>

Defense lawyers have argued that the procedure, which induces death by oxygen deprivation, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, citing witness accounts of previous prisoners convulsing on the gurney. Despite these concerns, a federal judge denied a stay of execution, ruling that the Constitution does not guarantee a painless death. Boyd, who has maintained his innocence, was sentenced to death for a 1995 murder based on a non-unanimous jury verdict.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive is planning to lay off more than 600 employees, which amounts to approximately 4% of its workforce. The decision comes as the company navigates a more difficult market environment, characterized by slowing demand and the elimination of federal EV incentives under the Trump administration. Rivian has been grappling with significant financial losses, reporting a $1.1 billion loss in the second quarter, and has narrowed its vehicle delivery forecast for 2025. These layoffs reflect broader pressures on EV makers as they adjust to shifting economic conditions and consumer habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness options beyond making minimum payments. One primary method is working with a debt relief company, which negotiates with creditors to settle debts for a lump sum, often reducing the total balance significantly. Alternatively, borrowers facing temporary hardship can contact their credit card issuers directly to enroll in hardship programs that may lower interest rates or pause payments. Other strategies include working with a credit counseling agency for a debt management plan or, for those with good credit, using a debt consolidation loan to simplify payments.</p>

After more than a decade in the taxi industry, he launched an advertising agency for drivers and later opened Dandies Barbershop & Beard Stylist, inspired by his mother's salon business. Despite facing significant challenges, including going into debt to keep the barbershop afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic, both of his enterprises are now profitable. Singh attributes his resilience and work ethic to his childhood experiences in Punjab and plans to launch a third business.</p>

          <p>A former British paratrooper, known only as Soldier F, has been found not guilty of murder and attempted murder for his role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry, Northern Ireland. The judge at Belfast Crown Court stated that while members of the Parachute Regiment had shot unarmed civilians and lost all discipline, the evidence against Soldier F specifically did not meet the threshold for a conviction. The verdict was met with disappointment by the families of the victims, who have campaigned for justice for over five decades. Soldier F was the only military veteran prosecuted over the shootings.</p>

The claims are for damages related to the Russia investigation and the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago. In their letter, Representatives Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia argue that any payment would violate the Constitution's Domestic Emoluments Clause, which prohibits a president from receiving federal funds beyond their salary.

          <p>Shares of luxury group Kering surged after the company reported a narrower sales decline in the third quarter, signaling a potential turnaround for its flagship brand, Gucci. While overall sales were down 5%, this marked a significant improvement from the 15% drop in the previous quarter. Sales at Gucci, though still down 14%, showed sharp sequential improvement from a 25% plunge, beating analyst expectations. This performance, coupled with Kering's recent decision to sell its beauty unit to focus on core fashion businesses, has built investor optimism that the company's recovery strategy is beginning to take hold.

          <p>Ford Motor is scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting adjusted earnings of 36 cents per share on $43.08 billion in automotive revenue. While many analysts predict Ford will beat these estimates, there are concerns that the company's guidance for the rest of the year may be disappointing. Key issues weighing on the outlook include the impact of tariffs, ongoing cost-cutting and quality improvement efforts, and supply chain disruptions, such as a recent fire at a key aluminum supplier's plant.

          <p>This article delves into the complex connection between wealth and well-being, suggesting that money can increase happiness, but only when it is not pursued for that purpose. Citing psychological research, the author argues that materialism and earning money for motives like social comparison or seeking power are negatively correlated with life satisfaction. In contrast, acquiring money for security or to support family does not harm well-being. The piece concludes that true wealth is found by interrogating financial motives, practicing modesty in consumption, and spending quietly on experiences with loved ones rather than on status-signaling possessions.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Strong, known for his intensive character preparation, discusses his recent roles as Roy Cohn in 'The Apprentice' and Bruce Springsteen's manager Jon Landau in 'Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.' For the Springsteen film, Strong had direct access to Landau and Springsteen on set, which he described as having an "oracle" to consult. He contrasts this with the darker experience of portraying Cohn, which he found emotionally taxing. Strong explains his process, which he calls "identity diffusion," as a way to create an "anechoic chamber" where the role can take possession of him, allowing for a more authentic performance.</p>

          <p>New research from Southern California indicates that E. coli from contaminated meat may be responsible for approximately one in five urinary tract infections (UTIs). Researchers compared E. coli strains from over 5,700 UTI patients with samples from retail meat sold in their neighborhoods, finding a significant link. The study challenges the long-held belief that UTIs are primarily caused by poor personal hygiene, reframing many cases as a food safety issue. Contamination was highest in poultry, and the study found that food-borne UTIs disproportionately affect women and residents of lower-income areas, where lower-quality meat products are more common.</p>

          <p>A certified financial planner advises families to maximize their paychecks by first evaluating their spending to distinguish between intentional and unintentional expenses. Instead of traditional, restrictive budgeting, he recommends a "reverse budget" or investment-first approach. This involves allocating a set percentage of income towards financial goals like retirement and college savings before any other spending. The remaining funds can then be spent with more freedom. The article stresses the importance of periodically re-evaluating expenditures to ensure they align with the family's values and to eliminate wasteful spending, such as unused subscriptions.</p>
