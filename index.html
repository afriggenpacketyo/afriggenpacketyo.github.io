        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British newspapers are dominated by the government's Strategic Defence Review, highlighting a Â£2 billion investment in drones and modernized military tactics, aiming to make the Army "ten times more lethal." The review also includes plans for 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and a potential military "gap year" for over-18s. Former Army chief Lord Dannatt criticized the review's timeline as too slow given current Russian threats, while Kemi Badenoch voiced concerns about a "backdoor blasphemy law" following a conviction for Quran burning, urging an appeal to defend freedom of belief. A separate report claims recent airstrikes on Palestinian schools in Gaza are part of a deliberate Israeli bombing strategy, a charge the IDF denies, citing military necessity within international law.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is set to test a domestically produced kamikaze sea drone this month to strengthen its naval defenses against increasing pressure from mainland China. The drone, developed under the "Kuai Chi Project" by NCSIST, will undergo combat capability evaluations, with live combat testing planned for August. The defense ministry has allocated over $25 million for the project, aiming to begin mass production of more than 200 of these vessels by 2026. Equipped with an AI-enabled targeting system, the drones are designed to autonomously lock onto and strike enemy ships, reflecting Taiwan's focus on asymmetric defense strategies.</p>

          <p>In a closely contested election, Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian, as its new president, defeating the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski. This outcome reverses the trend of recent elections in other countries that rejected Trumpist candidates and underscores the resilience of populism. The Tusk government had some successes in restoring judicial independence and unlocking EU funds, but struggled to fulfill key promises like liberalizing abortion laws. The election has significant implications for Poland's foreign policy, particularly its role as a NATO frontier state bordering Ukraine and its relationship with the European Union. </p>

          <p>MI5 is under renewed scrutiny after a High Court judge expressed a lack of confidence in the Security Service's account of false evidence provided in the case of a violent neo-Nazi agent. The judge ordered MI5 to disclose secret documents and raised concerns about the accuracy of new evidence from a senior MI5 officer. The case involves an agent known as X, who used his MI5 role to terrorize his girlfriend, and MI5's subsequent false claims about disclosing X's status during investigations. A panel of High Court judges will now consider potential actions, including contempt of court proceedings, regarding MI5's false evidence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in May, with the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI falling to 48.3, the steepest decline since September 2022. This contraction is largely attributed to a sharp decrease in new export orders, reflecting the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. The job market also weakened, with employment shrinking for the second consecutive month, and factories accumulated finished goods inventory due to falling sales. The divergence between the Caixin and official PMI readings may stem from timing differences in the surveys, with the official PMI showing a slight improvement, indicating potential stabilization later in the month.</p>

Lutnick highlighted the need for reasonable market access for US businesses and a reduction in the trade deficit. He also cautioned against India's arms trade with Moscow and its involvement in de-dollarization efforts within the BRICS economic alliance. BRICS consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

          <p>Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene has resigned after losing a confidence vote in parliament following weeks of protests against corruption, inequality, and rising living costs. Oyun-Erdene received insufficient support in the 126-seat parliament, leading to his departure. He warned that the confidence motion could destabilize the country's democracy and economy. The protests were fueled by reports of lavish spending by Oyun-Erdene's son and Mongolia's decline in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.</p>
