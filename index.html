          <p>A fire in a building near the Charminar monument in Hyderabad, India, resulted in the deaths of at least 17 people and several injuries. The fire, believed to have been caused by a short circuit, started in a building that housed a jewelry store on the ground floor and residential units above. Emergency responders found numerous unconscious individuals who were transported to local hospitals, but the narrow staircase and single exit complicated escape efforts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced financial assistance for the families of the victims, highlighting the prevalent issue of disregarded building laws and safety standards in India.</p>

          <p>New England's seafood industry is adopting an "eat them" strategy to control the population of invasive green crabs, which are harming the shellfish industry and ecosystem. Green crabs, introduced from Europe and West Africa in the 1980s, consume various species, including soft-shell clams. Efforts to eradicate the crabs through state-funded programs have faced challenges due to their high reproduction rate and lack of market demand. However, Sharon St. Ours & Company has found a use for the crabs by creating a crab broth powder, which debuted at the Seafood Expo North America trade show and has garnered interest from the culinary world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CDC study reveals a dramatic decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies due to widespread availability of a vaccine administered during pregnancy and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Hospitalization rates for babies under seven months decreased by up to 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop as high as 71%. Emergency physician Heather Auerbach notes fewer critically ill children and lower levels of care needed for those hospitalized. The study suggests increased use of these preventatives could further reduce RSV hospitalizations in infants, marking a significant public health breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary pause in Donald Trumpâ€™s Chinese tariffs, businesses, particularly small businesses, should prepare for a potential resurgence of trade war tensions. Existing tariffs on Chinese goods remain significant, and Trump's past actions indicate a likelihood of renewed trade disputes. Businesses are advised to consider strategies such as buying up products during the suspension, finding alternative suppliers, or bringing manufacturing back to the US. Companies that failed to prepare earlier are now in a precarious position, highlighting the need for proactive planning in response to Trump's volatile trade policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's upcoming private dinner for top meme coin holders may primarily include non-Americans, according to blockchain analytics. The event, scheduled for May 22, invites the top 220 $TRUMP holders, but analysis reveals that many of the largest wallets are linked to international exchanges, suggesting owners are not U.S. citizens. Bloomberg's analysis indicated that 19 of the top 25 wallets are likely operated from outside the U.S. Justin Sun, known for purchasing a substantial amount of the Trump family's World Liberty Financial token, is believed to be a leading $TRUMP meme token holder.</p>

The survey also reveals that 81% of Japanese citizens feel "uneasy" about Donald Trump's second presidency, largely due to concerns about tariffs. Additional news includes Nissan's plan to solicit early retirement applications from office staff, Taiwan's shutdown of its last nuclear reactor, and doubts among female executives about Japan reaching its goal for women in top corporate roles by 2030.</p>

          <p>A look into the realities of Victorian orchid hunters reveals a stark contrast to the romanticized image of bold explorers. These hunters, often poor and ill-educated, faced harsh conditions, exploitation, and significant personal losses. Employed by companies like Sander & Co., they endured disease, financial hardship, and violence in their pursuit of exotic orchids for the emerging middle classes. The article highlights the human cost of this obsession, revealing the sacrifices of expendable men behind the commercial success of orchids, while also noting society's eventual concern over environmental impact rather than labor conditions.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic discusses how Donald Trump's actions exemplify the conflicts of interest the Founding Fathers sought to prevent through the Constitution's anti-corruption provisions. Trump's ventures, such as accepting the gift of a Qatari jet and auctioning off dinners, reflect a disregard for these constitutional limitations. The article emphasizes that the Constitution explicitly prohibits the president from receiving emoluments or gifts from foreign states without congressional consent. The author argues that the absence of congressional oversight and effective enforcement mechanisms has left the nation in a precarious position, undermining the Framers' efforts to constrain self-interest and uphold constitutional duty.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's frequent declarations of national emergencies raise questions about the scope and appropriateness of such powers. Since taking office for his second term, Trump has declared eight emergencies, far exceeding previous presidents. These declarations unlock enhanced presidential powers, allowing him to bypass congressional approval on various policies. Experts like Elizabeth Goitein from the Brennan Center for Justice argue that Congress may have made a mistake in granting such broad powers, particularly given Trump's unusual approach to the presidency, emphasizing the potential for abuse.</p>

This initiative is part of broader negotiations ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, with hopes for agreements on youth mobility and lower food prices. While Thomas-Symonds expresses confidence in reaching a deal on food and easing border congestion, Conservative MP Alex Burghart voices concerns about the UK becoming a "rule taker" by aligning with EU standards.

          <p>Two volumes of 2,300-year-old silk books, the earliest known in China, have returned to Beijing from the National Museum of Asian Art in the United States after 79 years abroad. The Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, dating back to the Warring States Period, are considered the oldest ancient classics found in China. These manuscripts were illegally excavated in 1942 and later gifted to the museum. The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts after the Smithsonian adopted a new ethical returns policy, marking a significant cultural heritage achievement for China.</p>

          <p>Haas has requested a review of the decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, arguing that the lap was completed before a red flag was issued due to a crash. The team believes the FIA stewards made a mistake and is seeking clarification and measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. Despite television footage and live-timing data showing Bearman crossing the line before the red flag, the FIA upheld its original decision, citing the presence of orange 'abort lap' lights on the start-line gantry.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in Southern California have performed the first human bladder transplant, potentially revolutionizing treatment for debilitating bladder conditions. The procedure, conducted by doctors from UCLA and USC, involved a 41-year-old man who had lost bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. The doctors plan further clinical trials to assess outcomes before expanding its use. This breakthrough could offer a better alternative to current treatments that repurpose bowel tissue, which often lead to complications. While risks remain, such as organ rejection, the initial success marks a significant advancement in transplant medicine.</p>
