          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar is set to win his fourth Tour de France after maintaining his overall lead in the penultimate stage. The final day is traditionally processional, meaning his victory is virtually assured barring any accidents. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves secured his first-ever Tour stage win in Pontarlier after a bold solo attack with 16 kilometers remaining. This victory marks a significant career milestone for Groves, as he has now won stages in all three of cycling's Grand Tours.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, the incoming Republican chair of the National Governors Association (NGA), expressed disappointment over reports that some Democratic governors may stop paying dues to the bipartisan organization. The move is reportedly a protest against the NGA's response to the Trump administration. Stitt emphasized that governors should not engage in the same political games as Washington, D.C., and urged for continued dialogue and problem-solving. The controversy highlights growing partisan rifts extending into traditionally cooperative state-level organizations.</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave continues to affect more than 80 million people across the United States, with dangerous 'feels-like' temperatures soaring into the 90s and 100s from the Southeast to the Midwest. Cities like St. Louis are under an extreme heat warning, with heat indices expected to reach 114 degrees. The National Weather Service has issued its highest-level 'Extreme Heat Risk' warning for large parts of the Southeast, indicating a rare and long-duration event with little overnight relief. The conditions also elevate fire weather concerns in western states already battling wildfires.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men who were expelled by the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison allegedly endured 'state-sanctioned torture,' according to their lawyers. Following a prisoner swap deal between the U.S. and Venezuela, the repatriated men are sharing harrowing accounts of their detention. Testimonies describe severe beatings, humiliation by guards, unsanitary conditions, and psychological torment. These accounts provide the first detailed look inside the controversial prison, which human rights groups have condemned for its brutal conditions and lack of due process.</p>

This move provides certainty for employers who were hesitant to offer the benefit due to its previous temporary status.

          <p>Justin Bieber has unexpectedly released a new album, 'Swag,' with its lead single 'Daisies' quickly climbing to number two on the Billboard Hot 100, providing a potential 'song of the summer.' The album marks a departure from his previous pop sound, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production. Critics note the album's downtempo yet intricate sound seems to capture the current cultural mood, offering a soothing and melancholic vibe rather than an upbeat party anthem. The release is Bieber's first since parting ways with long-time manager Scooter Braun.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) narrowly avoided a $400 million funding cut, but its long-term future remains uncertain under the Trump administration. The program, credited with saving 26 million lives since 2003, has faced significant disruptions due to a halt in foreign aid, impacting services and treatment adherence in countries like Mozambique. While the funding for the current year was preserved due to bipartisan support, experts worry about proposed cuts for next year and the cessation of most HIV prevention work, which could undermine decades of progress against the global epidemic.</p>

          <p>To combat the devastating impact of dengue fever, Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by releasing millions of specially engineered mosquitoes. These 'Wolbitos,' bred by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, carry a bacterium called Wolbachia which prevents them from transmitting the dengue virus. Field trials in the city of Niterói have shown dramatic success, with dengue cases dropping by approximately 90%. The Brazilian government is now scaling up the program, aiming to protect 140 million people across the country over the next decade.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that Britain is working with Jordan to facilitate airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza, following Israel's late approval for such deliveries. This comes as Starmer faces increasing pressure at home, with over a third of MPs signing a letter urging the government to recognize a Palestinian state. Aid groups maintain that airdrops are insufficient to address the catastrophic conditions and can be dangerous, insisting that Israel must open all land borders to prevent a man-made famine.</p>

          <p>According to Harvard professor Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before even casual conversations can significantly improve their outcome and make you more influential. This brief mental rehearsal involves thinking about topics, questions, or goals for the interaction. Wood Brooks explains that this forethought allows you to be more present and prepared, as brainstorming during the conversation itself is cognitively overwhelming. This simple strategy can help build stronger relationships and enhance communication skills in both personal and professional settings by making you appear more considerate and prepared.</p>

          <p>A new Bankrate study has ranked the worst U.S. states for retirement, with Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma topping the list. The analysis evaluated all 50 states based on 15 metrics, heavily weighting affordability, weather, and neighborhood safety according to what Americans prioritize. Six of the bottom ten states are in the South, often scoring poorly due to factors like natural disasters, which impacted the weather scores for Texas and Florida. The report advises that while data is a useful starting point, personal preferences, like proximity to family, remain crucial in retirement decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

The moment highlighted the unique challenges even elite athletes face in the U.S. employer-based healthcare system, where eligibility is tied to active employment.

The KMT and its allies currently hold a majority, enabling them to block legislation from President Lai Ching-te's government. The failure of the recall effort signals that President Lai will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance for the remainder of his term.</p>
