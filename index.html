          <h2>CATL Claims New EV Battery Outperforms BYD in Charging Speed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 03:37:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CATL, the world's leading EV battery supplier, has announced its second-generation Shenxing battery, claiming it can add 323 miles of driving range in just five minutes of charging, surpassing BYD's recent fast-charging technology. This development could address consumer concerns about EV range and convenience, potentially accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. While BYD's claims faced skepticism, CATL's announcement places them ahead of Western competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in charging speeds. Tesla's superchargers add up to 168 miles of range in 15 minutes, while Mercedes-Benz can recharge up to 202 miles in 10 minutes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese-funded e-commerce sites Temu and Shein plan to raise prices for US customers due to increased operating costs from new global trade rules and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The 145% tariff on most Chinese-made goods, coupled with the elimination of the 'de minimis' exception for items under $800, has impacted their business models. Both companies, known for offering extremely low prices, have encouraged customers to continue shopping in the coming days, promising to minimize the impact of price adjustments. These changes could affect social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok, which rely heavily on advertising revenue from these companies.</p>

          <p>Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, will invest $50 billion in the US over the next five years, creating over 12,000 jobs, as President Trump threatens tariffs on pharma goods. The investment will fund new R&D sites, expand manufacturing facilities in multiple states, and support the development of next-generation weight loss medicines. This move is part of a broader effort by pharmaceutical companies to strengthen their US presence in response to potential tariffs. Once the new manufacturing capacity investments are complete, Roche said it would export more medicines from the U.S. than it imports.</p>

          <p>Qatari and Egyptian mediators have proposed a new ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, envisioning a truce lasting five to seven years, the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. This proposal comes after the previous ceasefire collapsed a month ago, with both sides blaming each other. Hamas has signaled its willingness to hand over governance of Gaza to a Palestinian entity agreed upon at the national and regional level, showing "unprecedented flexibility." Despite this, Prime Minister Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in the future governance of Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump is currently engaged in conflicts with numerous institutions, including top private universities, law firms, the media, the Federal Reserve, and the courts. He is also targeting former aides, Hill Republicans, the Kennedy Center, and even the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. This aggressive approach, encouraged by loyalists, involves using Truth Social to attack opponents and pushing for settlements from law firms. While some criticize his methods, Trump maintains a high degree of access to the press, though coverage remains largely negative.

          <p>The introduction of the first ATM in Tuvalu, a cash-based society, signals a broader trend of increasing automation and the erosion of human contact. While technology offers convenience and efficiency, it has infiltrated areas of life where it replaces essential human interaction, leading to increased loneliness and misery. Automated checkouts, AI chatbots, and the decline of customer service departments contribute to this dehumanization, prioritizing profit over the needs of workers and customers. There are signs of resistance, such as supermarkets introducing slower checkouts for customers who prefer human interaction, highlighting the importance of human contact for mental health and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>The military regime in Burkina Faso claims to have thwarted a coup attempt planned by individuals in neighboring Ivory Coast, accusing them of trying to sow chaos in the country. Interim President Ibrahim Traore, who came to power in a 2022 coup, has frequently accused Ivory Coast of harboring his opponents. Since taking power, the junta has cracked down on dissent, with reports of kidnappings and extrajudicial arrests. The government has also questioned dozens of military officers accused of plotting against the state, amid ongoing jihadi violence in the region.</p>

          <p>The US Commerce Department will impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, following an investigation into alleged subsidies from China and the dumping of unfairly cheap products. These tariffs, known as countervailing and anti-dumping duties, vary depending on the company and country of origin. Some Cambodian exporters face the highest duties due to a lack of cooperation with the investigation, while some products made in Malaysia face lower duties.

This move is in retaliation for Washington's tariffs on Chinese goods, putting pressure on US manufacturers reliant on rare earths from China. China holds a dominant position in the rare earth supply chain and is using this strategic advantage amid the trade war. US-bound exports of tellurium and tungsten have declined sharply, while shipments of molybdenum powder and bismuth products have stopped completely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar fell below 140 yen for the first time since September 2024, driven by President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. Trump's remarks raised concerns about the central bank's independence, leading to a sell-off of the U.S. currency. The dollar also faced pressure amid speculation that the U.S. administration would urge Japan to address the yen's weakness during upcoming finance talks. The dollar's decline reflects broader market anxieties about the U.S. economy and monetary policy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration was ordered by a U.S. District Court in Georgia to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students whose statuses had been unlawfully revoked. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleged that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively ending the students' statuses and making them deportable. The judge granted a temporary restraining order, requiring the administration to notify the court upon compliance.

          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers made a cross-party visit to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a move likely to spark controversy with neighboring countries. The shrine is seen by some as a symbol of Japan's past militarism, honoring wartime leaders convicted as war criminals alongside millions of war dead. The visit coincided with Prime Minister Ishiba sending a ritual offering to the shrine, though he is not expected to visit in person. The Yasukuni Shrine has long been a source of diplomatic friction with China and South Korea due to its association with Japan's wartime past.</p>
