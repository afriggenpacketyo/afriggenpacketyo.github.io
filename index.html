          <p>The parents of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy from South Carolina, are raising public awareness following his death from a rare brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. They emphasized that they were unaware of the risks of swimming in Lake Murray and hope their son's death will prevent similar tragedies. This was the first known case in the state since 2016, and health officials recommend precautions like using nose clips in freshwater. The family remembers their son for his loving, compassionate, and athletic nature.</p>

          <p>Professor Michele Dougherty has been appointed as the UK's first female Astronomer Royal, a prestigious advisory role to the monarch that has existed for 350 years. Despite not studying science in secondary school, she became a leading space scientist and is currently involved in a mission to explore Jupiter's icy moons for potential life. Professor Dougherty hopes her appointment will inspire more women and girls to pursue science and aims to engage the public with the wonders of astronomy. Her achievement is celebrated as a reflection of growing diversity in the scientific community.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly mass shooting in Manhattan, attention has turned to past statements by Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani regarding policing. A December 2024 post on social media, in which Mamdani pledged to "disband" the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group (SRG), has drawn renewed scrutiny. The SRG is a specialized unit that responds to major incidents, including civil disorders and mass shootings. In response to the recent tragedy, Mamdani expressed his condolences for the victims and gratitude for first responders, while his campaign did not comment on the resurfaced pledge.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer analyzed the upcoming initial public offering of design software company Figma, expressing admiration for its business model but cautioning against investing immediately. He noted that while Figma has impressive revenue growth and profitability, it is already priced at a high valuation that could become excessive if the stock surges upon debut. Cramer also raised concerns about the broader weakness in the enterprise software sector and the potential for increased AI spending to negatively impact Figma's profitability in the near term, as mentioned by the company's CEO.

The shooter, a former high-school football player, speculated that CTE might have caused his mental illness. However, brain injury experts interviewed for this article expressed that the risk of developing CTE from playing football only at the high school level is quite low. They caution against the dangers of self-diagnosis, as the symptoms associated with CTE can have many other causes, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made posthumously, which could lead to harmful assumptions of an irreversible condition.</p>

The fruit also contains high levels of tyramine, an amino acid that can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals.

Despite this evidence, official records likely undercount heat-related deaths due to inconsistent certification practices.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union has marginalized itself in the competition between the US and China due to its own policy incoherence. The author contends that the recent China-EU summit yielded minimal results for Brussels, demonstrating that Beijing no longer sees a need to make significant concessions. The article suggests that by failing to establish strategic autonomy and instead increasing its military and economic dependence on the United States, Europe has become a client rather than a partner. This submission to US pressure has undermined the EU's leverage with both global powers.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that Britain will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel meets specific conditions. These demands include agreeing to a ceasefire, committing to a two-state solution, and allowing the UN to restart aid distribution in Gaza. The move follows a similar announcement by France and comes amid growing pressure on the UK government to take a stronger stance. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the announcement, calling it a reward for terrorism, while the US expressed reservations about the timing of such a step.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a new executive order aimed at changing the national approach to homelessness, which has advocacy groups worried. The order seeks to make it easier for states and cities to move unhoused individuals into treatment for mental illness or addiction, including the potential for forced treatment. The administration argues that past federal spending has not addressed the root causes of homelessness. However, critics of the new order are concerned that it will also fail to solve these underlying issues and could lead to harmful policies for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Officials in Anchorage, Alaska, are urging hikers to be cautious after two people were mauled by bears in separate incidents within a week. Both hikers survived the attacks, one of which involved a man whose dog encountered a brown bear with a cub near Eagle River. Authorities advise people to avoid salmon-bearing streams where bears congregate to feed and to take precautions like traveling in groups, making noise, and carrying bear spray. Anchorage is a large urban-wildlife interface, home to an estimated 350 black bears and 65 brown bears, making human-wildlife encounters a regular possibility.</p>

However, Democrats remained unified to block other measures, including the elimination of DEI initiatives and a bill to allow permitless concealed carry. The votes demonstrate the GOP's ability to form a "working supermajority" on certain issues by winning over a few Democratic members.</p>

This comes as Trump has indicated he may announce a blanket tariff of 15-20% on countries without individual agreements. The statement is unlikely to comfort import-dependent businesses, especially small businesses, already struggling with the uncertainty of the administration's trade policy.

The author argues the policy is driven by resentment, insecurity, and fear rather than a coherent strategic purpose. It suggests that unqualified political appointees may be avoiding forums where their lack of expertise would be exposed. Furthermore, the author contends the ban is a Trumpian tactic to prevent officials from making public statements that could contradict the president's unpredictable whims, ultimately damaging civil-military relations and intellectual exchange.</p>
