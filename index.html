          <p>IBM announced first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed expectations, driven by its hybrid cloud and AI strategy. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for free cash flow and revenue growth, although it noted some caution regarding consulting contributions. CEO Arvind Krishna emphasized the importance of cost savings, productivity gains, and trusted partnerships for clients. Despite concerns about the macroeconomic environment and potential impacts from tariffs, IBM's performance reflects the continued success of its strategic focus. The company also settled lawsuits with GlobalFoundries and closed its acquisition of HashiCorp. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue due to a slowdown in consumer spending and adverse weather conditions, leading to a decline in same-store sales for the first time since 2020.

The company lowered its full-year same-store sales growth outlook to low single digits.

          <p>Southwest Airlines announced it will reduce its capacity in the second half of the year due to signs of weaker domestic bookings. The airline expects unit revenue to be flat to down as much as 4% in the second quarter and is not reaffirming its earnings guidance for 2025 and 2026. This decision reflects concerns about the current macroeconomic uncertainty and the difficulty in forecasting booking trends.

          <p>Despite improvements in air quality over recent decades, nearly half of Americans still live with unhealthy air pollution, according to a new report. The report highlights that 156 million people reside in areas with high smog or soot pollution, which can harm lungs, hearts, and brains. The report also notes that people of color are disproportionately affected, being twice as likely to live in polluted areas. The findings come as the Trump administration considers rolling back air quality regulations, raising concerns among doctors and health experts.</p>

Lilly alleges that these companies are deceiving patients and threatening their safety by offering compounded tirzepatide with different additives and dosages, and even in unapproved forms like pills.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to negotiate numerous individual trade deals with various countries within a short timeframe, driven by the desire to mitigate the negative impacts of tariffs. While President Trump aims to achieve significant trade gains, experts believe the administration faces an uphill battle given the complexity and time-consuming nature of trade negotiations. The administration's reliance on tariffs as leverage has created financial strain for businesses, particularly small U.S. businesses that rely on Chinese imports, and has not brought major trading partners like China to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>A dozen states have filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his administration, seeking a court order to declare his new tariffs on foreign imports illegal. The lawsuit argues that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The states contend that the tariffs disrupt the constitutional order and harm the American economy, arguing that they are essentially taxes imposed without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's proposed plan to end the conflict between Ukraine and Russia involves effectively selling out Ukraine to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The plan would include lifting sanctions against Russia, accepting a cease-fire in place that leaves Russian troops on conquered Ukrainian territory, and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia. In return, Ukraine would receive a security guarantee from the US, which is seen as unreliable given Trump's hostility towards the country. This plan is viewed as an instrument of surrender that would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future aggression.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the installation of a makeup studio near the Pentagon press briefing room at a cost of several thousand dollars. The renovation, which included a new chair and a large mirror with makeup lighting, was suggested by a former Fox News producer. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, is reportedly doing his own makeup for TV appearances. The project comes at a time when the administration is emphasizing cost-cutting measures.</p>
