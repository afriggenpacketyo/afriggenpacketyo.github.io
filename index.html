            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court instructed a lower court to clarify its order, specifically regarding the extent to which the administration is required to 'effectuate' his return, while acknowledging the executive branch's role in foreign affairs. Garcia's lawyers argue that his deportation was illegal, as he had a withholding order preventing his removal to El Salvador. The Justice Department maintains that his deportation was due to an 'administrative error' but alleges he is a member of MS-13, a claim his lawyers deny.</p>

            <p>China has revealed details of a 60 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) state fund dedicated to early-stage investments in artificial intelligence (AI) projects. The AI Industry Investment Fund, established in January, aims to support China's state-led strategy through equity investments. The fund will be managed by Guozhi Investment (Shanghai) Private Equity Fund Management, a state-backed company. This initiative underscores Beijing's commitment to advancing its AI industry amid a global race for technological dominance and increasing U.S. restrictions.</p>

            <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has terminated the jobs of hundreds of climate workers after a court ruling cleared the way for dismissals. These probationary employees, who were initially fired and then rehired, have now been terminated again. The firings are part of a broader move by the Trump administration targeting probationary workers, impacting the agency's ability to provide essential climate and weather intelligence. The terminations also come as the White House pulled funding for the national climate assessment.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's effort to reduce inflation to a 2% rate. On a monthly basis, prices fell 0.1%, driven by lower fuel prices and decreased travel-related costs. Experts note that the data is backward-looking and doesn't fully reflect recent trade policy changes. Despite the cooler inflation numbers, risks remain due to ongoing tariffs and potential future increases in import duties.</p>
