        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, primarily driven by voters' concerns over the city's unaffordability. The survey reveals that a desire for change outweighs the need for experience, with Mamdani performing especially well among voters who prioritize the cost of living. The poll also highlights that many voters prefer a mayor who would oppose former President Donald Trump, a sentiment that further benefits Mamdani's candidacy over competitors like former Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock has surged, erasing its losses for the year and rising approximately 85% from a low point in April. The significant turnaround was bolstered by a recent filing revealing that CEO Elon Musk purchased about $1 billion worth of the company's shares, a move seen by investors as a strong vote of confidence. Despite this recovery, the electric vehicle maker still faces challenges from an aging product lineup, increased competition, and a consumer backlash linked to Musk's political activities.

          <p>Wall Street continued its record-setting rally, with the S&P 500 reaching a new all-time high at the start of a pivotal week for economic policy. The market's upward momentum is largely fueled by expectations that the Federal Reserve will announce its first interest rate cut of the year on Wednesday. Technology stocks like Alphabet, which surpassed a $3 trillion market capitalization, and Tesla contributed significantly to the gains, though investors remain cautious about potential inflation impacts from tariffs and the overall health of the job market.

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted a second strike in international waters against a vessel alleged to be transporting drugs from Venezuela, resulting in the deaths of three individuals. President Trump announced the operation, framing it as part of a broader effort to combat "narcoterrorists" and warning that any cartels transporting illicit drugs will be targeted. This action follows a similar strike two weeks prior that killed eleven people and has significantly escalated tensions between the United States and the government of Nicolás Maduro.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance guest-hosted "The Charlie Kirk Show" in a tribute to the slain conservative activist, joined by senior Trump administration officials including Stephen Miller. During the broadcast, Vance and his guests blamed "far-left" rhetoric for creating a climate of violence, despite no official motive being released for the killing. Miller vowed that the administration would use the full power of the Justice and Homeland Security departments to "identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy" networks they hold responsible for the political atmosphere.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports, a change he argues would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. While the idea has support from some business leaders who dislike the pressure of frequent reporting, many financial experts and investor advocates have raised concerns. Critics argue that less frequent disclosures would reduce transparency for investors, potentially increase market volatility, and create more opportunities for corporate misconduct or insider trading.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to announce an interest rate cut, homeowners should not anticipate an immediate and significant reduction in mortgage costs. While the Fed's benchmark rate influences short-term borrowing, fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to long-term instruments like the 10-year Treasury note. Financial markets have largely priced in the anticipated cut already, with average 30-year mortgage rates recently falling to their lowest level in nearly a year. Experts suggest that future guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely have a greater impact on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

A $15,000 deposit in a one-year CD with a 4.25% APY could earn approximately $637.50 in guaranteed interest, while a three-year term could yield over $1,800. Unlike high-yield savings accounts with variable rates, CDs offer a fixed return, protecting savings from declining interest rates. This makes them a potentially valuable tool for savers looking to maximize earnings in a changing economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two separate sailing crews required rescue off the coast of Portugal after their boats were attacked by orcas. In total, nine people were brought to safety without injury after the incidents near Lisbon. These encounters are part of a growing number of documented interactions between orcas and vessels in the waters off Spain and Portugal. While the reasons for this behavior are not fully understood, it has led to damage and, in some cases, the sinking of boats, prompting maritime authorities to issue warnings to sailors in the region.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that a "framework" for a deal regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations has been agreed upon with China. The agreement aims to resolve national security concerns that the popular app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could share American user data with Beijing. President Trump is scheduled to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize the details, which could prevent a nationwide ban of the app. The deal is a significant development in the long-running dispute over the platform's future in the United States.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, numerous individuals have faced professional consequences, including termination, for their public comments about the event. A sports reporter, a university employee, and an MSNBC analyst were among those fired after making statements that their employers deemed insensitive or harmful to their reputation. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to dismiss employees for public speech that violates company policy or is seen as damaging, highlighting the limited First Amendment protections for workers in the private sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve poised to cut interest rates, financial experts are advising savers to move their money out of traditional, low-yield savings accounts. To maximize returns, savers could consider locking in current high rates with a certificate of deposit (CD), which offers a fixed interest rate for a set term. Alternatively, high-yield savings and money market accounts still offer competitive, albeit variable, rates while providing greater access to funds. Acting quickly is recommended, as the high-return environment for savers is expected to diminish following the Fed's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, and experts warn that calculations may be more complex this year due to recent tax changes enacted by the Trump administration. These payments are typically required for income not subject to withholding, such as from self-employment, freelance work, or investments. To avoid underpayment penalties, filers should generally pay at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's. Tax professionals recommend running projections to ensure payments are accurate under the new laws. (not investment advice)</p>

Porter, who won two MLS Cups with previous teams, was in his second season with the Revolution but failed to improve the team's performance. Assistant coach Pablo Moreira will serve as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season.</p>

Attorneys for the deportees argue that Ghana is now preparing to send them back to those very countries, violating diplomatic assurances given to the U.S. The judge ordered the government to explain what steps it was taking to prevent this from happening.</p>

          <p>Israel's international standing is facing significant strain as the war in Gaza continues, leading to what some analysts are calling a potential "South Africa moment" of isolation. Several European countries, including Spain and Belgium, have imposed sanctions, such as arms embargoes and bans on imports from West Bank settlements. The pressure is also mounting in cultural and sporting arenas, with calls for boycotts. While the Israeli government remains defiant, former diplomats express deep concern over the country's deepening diplomatic isolation, even as it retains the staunch support of the United States.</p>
