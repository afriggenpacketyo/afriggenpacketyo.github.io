          <p>The Metropolitan Police have confirmed that 890 people were arrested at a Saturday demonstration in London protesting the UK government's ban on the group Palestine Action. The majority of arrests were made under the Terrorism Act for showing support for a proscribed organization, with additional arrests for offenses like assaulting police officers. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw clashes between demonstrators and police, with both sides accusing the other of violence. The government banned Palestine Action in July after activists damaged military aircraft at an RAF base.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles women's rugby team was eliminated from the World Cup despite a decisive 60-0 victory against Samoa. Their exit was sealed after Australia's performance against England secured the Wallaroos a quarter-final spot based on points differential. Despite the disappointment, the team's performance highlighted the emergence of promising young talent, such as 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored four tries against Samoa. The article emphasizes the positive future for the team, pointing to the growing strength of college rugby as a feeder system for the national squad.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists from the University of Haifa have unearthed a 1,600-year-old Christian care facility in the ancient city of Hippos, which may be the world's oldest known nursing home. The discovery was prompted by a mosaic at the building's entrance with the Greek inscription, "Peace be with the elders." Dating to the Byzantine era, the structure is believed to be the first physical evidence of an institution specifically dedicated to caring for the elderly in antiquity. Researchers state the find offers a rare glimpse into the social values and communal institutions of the period.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Solar Power Aligns with Conservative and Prepper Ideologies</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that solar power should be embraced by right-wing preppers and conservatives, not for environmental reasons, but for its alignment with principles of self-sufficiency and individualism. The article contrasts the complexity and dependency of fossil fuels with the simplicity and long-term reliability of solar panels and batteries, which provide energy independence from fragile supply chains. It suggests that in a crisis scenario, solar energy offers a more practical and resilient power source than storing diesel or gasoline.

          <p>Arizona State Senator Analise Ortiz is facing an ethics complaint and calls for her expulsion from the chamber after she reshared an Instagram post alerting the community to potential ICE activity near an elementary school. Republican colleagues, led by State Senator Jake Hoffman, filed the complaint, accusing her of jeopardizing officer safety and tipping off individuals pursued by law enforcement. Ortiz defends her action as protected First Amendment speech intended to inform her constituents, stating the move is an attempt at intimidation and authoritarianism. Free speech experts and Arizona's Democratic attorney general have condemned the expulsion effort as a misuse of the ethics process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates a sharp partisan divide over President Trump's authority to deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities. Supporters, primarily Republicans, believe such actions reduce crime and enhance personal safety, regardless of their own location. Opponents, largely Democrats, view the deployments as politically motivated and express concern that they undermine their rights and freedoms without effectively curbing crime. The poll also found that while most Americans believe both a president and local leaders should have deployment authority, opinions are more closely tied to political affiliation than to whether respondents live in urban or rural areas.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will step down, succumbing to mounting pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The decision follows the party's historic defeat in the July parliamentary election, where the ruling coalition lost its majority in the upper house. Ishiba had initially resisted calls to resign, citing the need for political stability amidst key national challenges. His resignation preempts a party vote on holding an early leadership election, which was widely seen as a no-confidence motion against him.</p>

Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the shorter work week as unaffordable.

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for its decision to ask broadcast partners not to show any on-screen disruptions or negative reactions directed at Donald Trump during the US Open men's final. Critics have labeled the move cowardly and hypocritical, contrasting it with the tournament's history of televising other disturbances, such as climate protests. The USTA defended its request as consistent with its policy of not showcasing off-court disruptions. However, commentators argue that by shielding a political figure from public disapproval, the organization is compromising the event's authenticity and democratic spirit.</p>

The concept gained traction through word of mouth and expanded internationally, eventually becoming Lithuania's first tech unicorn. Despite a near-disastrous period in 2016, the company recovered by removing seller fees and now boasts over 16 million users in the UK alone.</p>

This stance is being criticized as a violation of the separation of church and state, especially given Paxton's past actions. In 2017, his office expressed formal concerns about Muslim students using a classroom for prayer, suggesting an exclusionary practice.

This centralization of economic power, where policy is driven by presidential whim rather than consistent rules, risks creating an uncompetitive and cronyist system, similar to the one that led to Argentina's long-term economic decline.

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot recently reaching a historic $1.8 billion, an analysis shows that a winner's take-home amount varies significantly based on state taxes. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing winners to keep a larger portion of their prize after federal taxes are withheld. In contrast, states with high income tax rates, such as New York and New Jersey, would see the lowest after-tax payouts.

The case against her was largely circumstantial, focusing on a troubled marriage, alleged infidelity, and testimony that she had previously discussed killing her husband.

The 21-year-old all-rounder, who had an impressive debut Test series last winter, found himself in a limited role this season. After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his Indian Premier League commitments, he lost his place in the starting XI and served as a spare batter for most of the series against India. Bethell acknowledged the lack of match time but suggested the break might also prove beneficial for the long season ahead.</p>

          <p>One year after CEO Brian Niccol took charge of Starbucks and pledged constructive engagement, the company and the Starbucks Workers United union remain at a standstill over a first contract. While over 12,000 workers at nearly 650 stores have unionized since 2021, progress on a collective bargaining agreement has stalled under Niccol's leadership. Workers criticize his "Back to Starbucks" strategy for increasing their workload without improving pay or staffing, leading to widespread understaffing issues. The union has rejected the company's latest pay offer and warns of further labor actions to bring management back to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>Despite public commitments from the Trump administration to fully investigate Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, attorneys representing approximately 50 of his survivors say they have not been contacted by the Department of Justice. This lack of outreach casts doubt on the thoroughness of the government's investigation into Epstein's network of co-conspirators. Lawyers expressed frustration, noting that survivors are being ignored while officials engage with figures like Ghislaine Maxwell. This development comes as the administration faces political pressure over its handling of the case and the president's own past ties to Epstein.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant number of federal student loan borrowers are utilizing deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, more than doubling the rate from the previous year. While these tools are critical for avoiding default, which can severely damage credit scores, they are not long-term solutions. Interest often continues to accrue during forbearance, increasing the total debt owed. Consumer advocates advise borrowers to explore income-driven repayment plans first, as they can offer affordable monthly payments, sometimes as low as zero, while still allowing progress toward eventual loan forgiveness.</p>

          <h2>The Proliferation of Surveillance Technology Raises Questions About Animal Privacy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid expansion of surveillance technology, from satellite imagery and camera traps to home security systems, is making it increasingly difficult for animals to remain unseen by humans. This constant monitoring raises philosophical questions about whether animals have a right to privacy. Some animal behaviors, such as seeking seclusion or avoiding observation, suggest a preference for being undisturbed. Philosophers and researchers argue that while surveillance can aid conservation, it can also cause harm by disrupting animal tranquility, enabling poaching, or exposing them in ways that violate their potential interest in privacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive deportation campaign, combined with historically low U.S. birth rates, could cause the nation's population to shrink for the first time on record in 2025. With natural increase (births minus deaths) at a slim margin, a significant drop in net immigration could tip the balance into negative growth. Economists warn that such a decline would have severe consequences for key sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, which rely heavily on immigrant labor. This could lead to labor shortages, rising prices for food and housing, and a strained elder care system.</p>

          <p>With over half of Americans having high blood pressure by age 40, new recommendations from the American Heart Association stress the importance of early intervention to prevent serious health issues. Known as a "silent killer" because it often has no symptoms, untreated hypertension is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia. The guidelines advocate for lifestyle changes like a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction for those with blood pressure above 130/80. For readings of 140/90 or higher, starting treatment with at least two medications is now recommended to effectively manage the condition.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has confirmed the government is considering an expansion of its use of military sites to accommodate asylum seekers. This initiative is part of Labour's broader plan to end the costly reliance on hotels, which currently house over 32,000 people. The new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is expected to announce more detailed proposals soon. This "all of government effort" aims to address the rising number of small boat crossings in the English Channel, which has become a significant political and logistical challenge for the new administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term is marked by a chaotic and systematic assault on established U.S. economic norms, from imposing sweeping tariffs to taking government stakes in private tech companies like Intel. This approach, combined with attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve and labor boards, is fundamentally altering the American economic model. While the stock market has remained buoyant, fueled by the AI boom, the president's unpredictable interventions are creating radical uncertainty. The resulting economic framework is likely to be unrecognizable from the free-market consensus of recent decades. (not investment advice)</p>
