          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with outfielder Juan Soto regarding his effort running to first base after two plays where he appeared to not hustle. The first incident occurred when Soto watched his hit bounce off the Green Monster for a single, and the second was a ground ball where he was easily thrown out. Soto defended his hustle, stating he has been hustling hard. Mendoza acknowledged Soto's belief that he was hitting a home run on the play with the Green Monster, but stated that he still needs to run hard regardless. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary trade truce between Beijing and Washington, a survey reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters are planning to increase exports to markets outside the U.S. due to lasting scars from the trade war. The U.S.-China "decoupling" remains a likely scenario in the medium term, as Chinese exporters seek alternatives and American firms shift production out of China. Companies expect a hit on export turnover this year due to U.S. tariffs, even after the recent tariff reduction. Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, is a top choice for Chinese businesses seeking to move production overseas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., aiming to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries. Relations have deteriorated due to ideological differences, geopolitical alliances, and domestic policy conflicts. Ramaphosa's visit follows the U.S. welcoming white South African "refugees" whom Trump claims are facing persecution, allegations denied by the South African government. Ramaphosa will also seek to present a new trade framework post-AGOA, as Trump's trade tariffs have significantly impacted South Africa's automotive industry. </p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen, a long-time critic of President Trump, recently voiced strong disapproval of the administration from a British stage, calling it "corrupt, incompetent and treasonous". Trump responded by labeling Springsteen a "dried out prune of a rocker" and suggested that Springsteen and Beyoncé should be investigated for illegal campaign donations related to their support for Kamala Harris. Springsteen has consistently challenged his audience politically throughout his career, addressing issues such as immigration and police brutality, sometimes angering conservative fans. Despite Trump's attacks, Springsteen repeated his criticisms the following night.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail told CNBC that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, partnerships with suppliers, and productivity improvements. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and they have diversified their import sources, aiming for no single country outside the U.S. to represent more than 10% of purchases by next year. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which anticipates raising prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot missed Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations but beat sales estimates.</p>

          <p>In April, shipments of smartphones made in China, including Apple’s iPhone, to the United States declined to their lowest levels since 2011, indicating the impact of U.S. tariffs on trade between the two countries. Smartphone exports plummeted by 72% to under $700 million last month, outpacing an overall 21% drop in Chinese shipments to the U.S. This disruption of tech supply chains is attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs campaign, which imposed levies as high as 145% on Chinese goods, and has led to a diversion of electronics production to other countries. Tensions remain high as Beijing accuses the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, lifting a lower court's order that had barred the administration from ending the protections. The decision leaves hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants unsure of their legal status and employment authorization. Lawyers representing the TPS holders criticized the Supreme Court’s decision as callous and lacking clarity, leaving the timing of the rollback at the government's discretion.

          <p>Tommy Robinson, the far-right anti-Islam activist, is set to be released from prison four months early after a High Court hearing reduced his sentence for contempt of court. Robinson was jailed for ignoring an order not to repeat false allegations about a Syrian refugee, but his lawyers successfully argued that he had since shown a "commitment" to comply with the order. The judge noted an "absence of contrition or remorse" but acknowledged Robinson's assurance that he would comply with the injunction in the future.</p>

          <p>A Chinese scientific study suggests that the ancestor of animals and plants was a hydrogen-metabolizing cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event. The research indicates that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. Eukaryotes are cells or organisms characterized by a membrane-bound nucleus, forming the foundation of complex, multicellular life. Understanding the origins of eukaryogenesis could provide insights into the evolution of life and have implications for the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is facing challenging times after his unsuccessful presidential bid, with analysts noting a significant fall from grace. His once-strong grip on Florida's lawmakers has weakened, and he's seen himself eclipsed by rising newcomers in Trump's political circle. Some Republicans are even supporting Trump-endorsed congressman Byron Donalds for governor, even before Casey DeSantis has made a decision to run. DeSantis's political style, similar to Trump's, has created enemies, and his office has not responded to questions about his future plans.</p>

The president seemed sapped and not quite there, requiring a soft drink. Quigley observed a loss of energy and a soft, weak voice, leading him to question Biden's ability to run for reelection. Quigley, along with other Democrats, expressed concerns about Biden's cognitive decline, but felt they could not voice these concerns publicly without angering the president.</p>

          <p>In Sonora, Mexico, the Northern Jaguar Project (NJP) is working with ranchers to conserve jaguars by compensating them for cat sightings on their land. The Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats, turning them from perceived threats to valuable ecosystem features. This approach has proven successful, with the population of jaguars in the reserve and surrounding ranching region remaining stable or growing. The program has expanded the protected area and fostered a shift in attitudes among ranchers, making them more tolerant of wild cats and their potential impact on livestock.</p>
