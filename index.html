        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs," declaring them illegal. The decision, which the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, affects levies on numerous countries, including China, Canada, and Mexico. However, sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, imposed under a different authority, remain unaffected by the ruling, preserving a key component of Trump's trade agenda. The court's decision introduces significant uncertainty into the administration's economic policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus among child development experts suggests limiting screen time for children, especially in early years, to foster crucial developmental skills. Recommendations range from "screen-free until three" to supervised, limited daily use for older children, emphasizing that real-world interaction, play, and imagination are vital. Experts are concerned that excessive screen use replaces time needed for developing motor skills, social interaction, and language, though they acknowledge technology can also offer benefits like educational content and maintaining social connections. Parents are encouraged to monitor content and engage with their children about their digital activities.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve could undermine its independence and harm the U.S. economy long-term. She argues that politicizing the central bank could lead to higher inflation, a weaker dollar, and reduced foreign investment, drawing parallels to other countries where institutional integrity has eroded. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, Patterson believes the sustained negative consequences would eventually damage consumption and earnings expectations.

          <p>Footballer Jack Grealish is experiencing a career revival since joining Everton on loan, delivering man-of-the-match performances and multiple assists in recent games. His impressive form has contrasted sharply with his limited playtime at Manchester City last season, leading to discussions about his potential return to the England national team under manager Thomas Tuchel. Despite his recent success and praise from Everton's manager David Moyes, Grealish was omitted from the latest England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly demanded the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health through his anti-vaccine advocacy and promotion of conspiracy theories. Sanders highlighted the recent firing of the CDC director and subsequent resignations of other top officials as evidence of Kennedy's detrimental impact on the nation's health agencies. The senator warned that Kennedy's actions are undermining scientific integrity and could lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases, representing a full-blown war on science and truth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with plans to cut more than 500 jobs at Voice of America and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), despite ongoing legal challenges. The move, announced by acting CEO Kari Lake, comes a day after a federal judge blocked her from removing the VOA director. This action is part of a broader effort described as reducing federal bureaucracy, but it has been criticized by employees and some lawmakers as an attack on the federally funded news organization's mission to provide objective news in countries with restricted press freedom.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned a temporary injunction. The ruling was seen as a setback for councils arguing that the practice breaches planning laws and creates public safety risks. Amid ongoing protests and counter-demonstrations, councils like Epping Forest are considering appealing to the Supreme Court, signaling a persistent local-level resistance to the central government's asylum accommodation policies.

The mandate comes during a period of turmoil for the CDC, which has seen leadership changes and controversy under the Trump administration, and a workforce left shaken by the violent attack where a gunman killed a police officer before taking his own life.</p>

          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, is a well-made tribute that updates the crude, low-budget spirit of the 1984 Troma original for a modern audience. The article notes that while the film retains the gore and blunt parody, its polished production and star-studded cast, including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood, create a different experience from the gleeful "cine-garbage" of its predecessor. The story now features a more sincere emotional core and a direct environmental message, with Dinklage playing a janitor transformed into a mutant hero.</p>

          <p>As American unions prepare for Labor Day, the mood is described as somber due to mounting challenges from the Trump administration. Labor groups are grappling with the impact of immigration raids, proposed cuts to Medicaid, and a weakened National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Union leaders state their focus is on organizing workplaces and educating members on their rights while protesting government policies they see as hostile to workers. Experts suggest that federal policies and budget cuts will put significant strain on unions, particularly in the public sector, forcing the labor movement into a fight for its survival.</p>

          <p>The term "red pill," originating from the 1999 film "The Matrix," has evolved from an internet meme into a global ideology rooted in misogyny and conspiracy theories. Initially used in online forums for "pick-up artists" and men's rights activists, the "manosphere" now encompasses a range of anti-feminist beliefs, often spread via social media algorithms that reward provocative content. The ideology has seeped into mainstream political discourse in the U.S. and has adapted to different cultural contexts worldwide, feeding on male insecurity and resentment.</p>

          <p>Swimmers along the U.S. coastline are being met with water quality advisories at numerous beaches due to unsafe levels of fecal contamination ahead of the Labor Day holiday. A recent report from Environment America found that nearly two-thirds of beaches tested nationwide in 2024 had at least one day of potentially unsafe water quality. The contamination, which can cause gastrointestinal illness and rashes, is largely attributed to outdated sewer systems and stormwater runoff, problems exacerbated by increasingly severe weather. Despite the warnings, many beachgoers appear undeterred by the potential health risks.</p>

          <p>The Pickett fire in northern Napa County has caused an estimated $65 million in agricultural losses, primarily impacting wine grape growers in the region. Wineries like the Robert Craig Winery lost their entire crop from one vineyard after firefighters used the property for a controlled burn to protect a nearby town. The fire revives painful memories of the 2020 Glass fire, which also devastated the area. Beyond direct fire damage, vineyards face the persistent threat of "smoke taint," which can ruin grapes and make them unusable for wine production, adding to the financial devastation.</p>

          <p>After a comprehensive, two-year study on Iowa's water quality identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor, public officials have reportedly stripped the funding intended to promote the report's findings. The study, which links pollutants from the state's powerful farm industry to health risks like high cancer rates, has been controversial. Approximately $400,000 remaining in the project's budget, partly earmarked for public awareness campaigns, was "zeroed out" without explanation. Critics fear this move is an attempt by agricultural interests and their political allies to downplay the report and impede necessary reforms.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has surged to $1 billion for the first time in over a year, following 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. This prize ranks as the sixth-largest in the game's history. Winners face a choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option, both of which are subject to significant federal and state taxes. A 24% federal tax is withheld immediately, with winners likely owing more at tax time, and most states also levy their own income taxes on the winnings. (not investment advice)</p>
