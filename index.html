          <h2>China's Q2 GDP Growth Surpasses Expectations, Potentially Reducing Need for Major Stimulus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 00:54:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts and keeping the nation on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. This stronger-than-expected performance may reduce pressure on policymakers to implement significant new stimulus measures. However, the data revealed underlying weaknesses, as retail sales growth slowed and the real estate investment slump deepened, indicating a fragile and uneven recovery. These mixed signals suggest that while a major stimulus push might be delayed, targeted support may still be necessary to sustain economic momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume selling its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. This marks a significant reversal of a policy that had effectively halted sales of the chip, which was specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls. The development follows intensive lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued the restrictions were harming American tech leadership. This policy shift is seen as a major win for Nvidia and could serve as a fresh growth catalyst for the company in the crucial Chinese market.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Government Bond Yields Reach Multi-Decade Highs Amid Fiscal Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 00:35:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's 10-year government bond yield has surged to its highest point since 2008, reflecting growing market anxiety over the country's fiscal stability ahead of an upper house election. The spike in yields is fueled by political discussions around potential consumption tax cuts, which analysts warn would be fiscally irresponsible given Japan's massive public debt. This political uncertainty is creating doubt about the government's commitment to fiscal discipline. The situation has prompted bond investors to demand higher yields to compensate for the perceived increase in risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intense storms on Monday night triggered flash flood warnings across the New York City metropolitan area, causing significant damage and disruption. Heavy rainfall led to severe flooding in parts of New York state and New Jersey, where a state of emergency was declared. The deluge inundated subway stations, leading to major service delays, and flooded numerous roads and highways, stranding vehicles and requiring emergency rescues. Photos and videos from the region showed streets turned into rivers and water gushing into public transit infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The murder trial of James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes, began with jury selection on Monday. Prosecutors are focusing on Craig's alleged internet search history on a work computer, where he reportedly looked up "undetectable poisons" and purchased cyanide. His defense team is challenging the admissibility of this electronic evidence, arguing the searches went beyond the scope of the warrant. The case centers on the accusation that Craig carried on an affair while plotting to murder his wife, the mother of his six children.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial over a 2019 crash in Florida where a Model S on Autopilot struck and killed a young woman. The plaintiffs argue that the car's driver-assistance feature failed to provide adequate warnings and should have braked before the collision. In its defense, Tesla claims the driver was distracted by a dropped cell phone and is solely to blame for the incident. This trial is significant as it directly scrutinizes the shared responsibility between a human driver and a semi-autonomous system, potentially setting a precedent for similar cases.</p>

These smoke-free products contain nicotine, which can be fatally toxic to small children. Researchers found that while these incidents are a small fraction of all nicotine exposures, they are more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization. The study raises alarms about the products' colorful packaging and flavorings, which may be attractive to children.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Victorville, California, have arrested a man on suspicion of planting a macabre teddy bear that appeared to be made of human skin at a local gas station. The incident, which prompted a response from deputies and the coroner's office, was determined to be a prank. The bear was created by a South Carolina artist who confirmed she had shipped it to a customer in the area. The suspect was arrested for filing a false emergency report and intentionally planting evidence, which tied up valuable emergency resources.</p>

          <p>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is reportedly considering quitting his post after a heated confrontation with Attorney General Pam Bondi regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The dispute is linked to the fallout from a Department of Justice memo that concluded Epstein died by suicide and that a rumored high-profile client list did not exist, contradicting theories Bongino had promoted. This public squabbling has reportedly made Bongino's position untenable and highlights a significant rift within the MAGA movement over the sensitive issue.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. Maxwell's attorneys argued that her prosecution in New York was barred by a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement from Florida. The DOJ countered that the agreement's authority was limited to that specific district and that Maxwell was not an intended beneficiary of the deal, asking the high court to let the lower court's ruling stand.</p>

The announcement is anticipated after a meeting of the National Drought Group, which manages water resources. England experienced its driest spring in over a century, compounded by successive heatwaves, which has led to low reservoir levels and river flows. A formal drought declaration enables water companies to implement their contingency plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans to conserve water.</p>
