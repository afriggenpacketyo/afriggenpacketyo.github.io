          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, reiterating demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and guaranteed humanitarian aid flow. The group proposed a hostage exchange involving the release of 10 living and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have reportedly killed dozens of Palestinians in the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll in Gaza to over 54,000 since the conflict began in October 2023. The White House has confirmed that Israel approved the ceasefire proposal before it was submitted to Hamas, while Israel's defense minister warned Hamas to accept the deal or face destruction. The group's demands are consistent with previous negotiations.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a commercial truck carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities urged the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away from the scene, especially those allergic to bee stings. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue effort, aiming to re-hive as many bees as possible and locate their queen bee. The road was closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the bee recovery, and authorities have since stated that most bees should have returned to their hives. Initial reports of 250 million bees escaping were corrected following assistance from a beekeeper at the scene.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned of an "imminent" threat from China to Taiwan, urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the U.S. to deter war. Speaking at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth characterized China as seeking regional dominance and military expansion, citing a potential 2027 deadline for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. In response, the Chinese embassy in Singapore accused the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea. Hegseth also cautioned Asian countries against economic ties with China, fearing Beijing would use it as leverage to exert malign influence.</p>

          <p>The Independent reports that obese patients are being denied hip and knee replacements by the NHS in England and Wales to reduce costs, despite NICE guidelines stating BMI shouldn't restrict access to joint replacement surgery. Patients are required to lose weight before becoming eligible, but waiting lists for NHS weight loss programs are extensive, leaving many in pain for years. The Royal College of Surgeons criticized the policy, warning it could worsen patients' mobility and health, while former health minister James Bethell called for government action on obesity and an end to the "misery for millions". The policy is deemed "unfair" and "discriminatory".</p>

          <p>An article in Vox discusses Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, a view that is contradicted by many autism scientists. Kennedy has launched a federal effort to find environmental culprits for rising autism rates, arguing that genetic research is a "dead end." Scientists have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, suggesting genetics are the main driver. Researchers fear Kennedy's focus could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of new therapies for profound autism. The increase in autism rates is mostly explained by expanding definitions, more awareness, and better screening.</p>

Milwaukee is proceeding with its own inspections and lead water line replacements, but lacks the resources to complete the job without federal or state funding.

          <p>Federal health officials have altered COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, stating the vaccine is not recommended for healthy children or pregnant women. The CDC now offers “no guidance” on whether pregnant women should get the vaccine and asks parents to consult with a healthcare provider before vaccinating their children. This decision has faced criticism from pediatricians and obstetricians, who argue there is no new evidence to support the change. California's Department of Public Health continues to support the availability of COVID-19 vaccines for all persons aged 6 months and older who wish to be vaccinated.</p>

          <p>UK steelmakers have condemned President Donald Trump's decision to double import taxes on steel and aluminum to 50% as "yet another body blow" to the industry. UK Steel warns that some orders could be delayed or canceled, causing uncertainty for shipments already en route across the Atlantic. The UK government is engaging with the US to seek clarity for the industry, urging finalization of the trade deal to eliminate UK steel import tax. The new 50% import tax is set to take effect on Wednesday.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a volatile week, influenced by President Trump's trade policy announcements and strong earnings reports from key companies.

Nvidia stood out with better-than-expected earnings and guidance, while Salesforce faced criticism for its focus on AI. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in cooler than expected, but concerns about future tariff impacts remain. (not investment advice)</p>
