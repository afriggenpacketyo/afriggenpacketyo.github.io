        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First Minister John Swinney has announced his opposition to the assisted dying bill currently before the Scottish Parliament, citing concerns about the potential impact on patient-clinician relationships and the vulnerability of individuals who may feel pressured to end their lives prematurely. Swinney, a man of faith, acknowledged that his religious beliefs and his wife's terminal condition influenced his decision, which he described as an agonizing one. Despite his stance, the Scottish government will allow a free vote for SNP MSPs on the bill, which is being proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur. McArthur has expressed disappointment but thanked Swinney for his considered approach and recognition that the vote is a matter of personal conscience.</p>

She maintained that she and Gordon prioritized their baby's well-being and had no intention of causing her harm, explaining that they wanted to keep her longer rather than have her taken away by social services.

          <p>The European Union is contemplating imposing tariffs on US aircraft and car exports as a response to Donald Trump's existing and proposed tariffs against the EU, seeking to persuade the US to drop these measures. The potential tariffs target various US exports, including chemicals, electrical equipment, and certain food products, with Boeing facing significant impact. Brussels has also initiated consultations with member states regarding potential litigation against the US over the blanket 20% reciprocal tariffs announced by President Trump. While preparing for a possible prolonged trade war, the EU emphasizes its commitment to seeking beneficial deals for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most of the claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including stars like Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen, Kevin O'Leary, and Stephen Curry. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's catastrophic collapse in November 2022, which wiped out billions of dollars in customer funds and triggered investigations worldwide. The plaintiffs accused the stars of being paid millions of dollars to endorse FTX without disclosing their financial incentives, a violation of federal and state advertising laws.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts offer varying perspectives on whether gold investment allocations should change in today's economy, with some suggesting an increase due to economic uncertainty, while others recommend maintaining traditional levels for diversified portfolios. Jack Hanney of Patriot Gold Group suggests investors might consider moving closer to 20% or even 25% allocation, while Brandon Aversano of The Alloy Market recommends most people maintain the conventional 10% to 15% allocation. The decision depends on individual financial situations, risk appetite, and outlook on economic factors, with considerations for debt levels, inflation trends, currency strength, and global instability. Experts recommend exploring options like gold bars, coins, Gold IRAs, and Gold ETFs to add gold to an investment portfolio (not investment advice).</p>

President Trump stated that the agreement will cement the relationship between the two countries for many years to come. Economists caution that it will likely generate only a small boost for Britain, which is still vulnerable to global economic uncertainty. The deal is likely to vindicate overtures that the prime minister has made to the president, including an invitation from King Charles for a state visit, and might overshadow a setback in local elections last week.</p>

The decision coincides with the announcement of a tariff deal between the UK and US, which Bailey believes will help reduce uncertainty.

          <h2>mRNA Vaccines: How They Work, Safety, and Potential</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 09:56:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article explains how mRNA vaccines work, addressing safety concerns and exploring their potential in medicine. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information from DNA to build proteins, and mRNA vaccines use this process to create viral proteins that trigger an immune response. These vaccines cannot alter DNA and have been deemed safe, with common side effects being muscle aches and flu-like symptoms. Beyond infectious diseases, mRNA is being studied for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and rare genetic disorders. The technology offers hope for disease treatments where prior technologies have failed, though its success will vary across different diseases.</p>

          <p>In a first for U.S. courts, the family of Christopher Pelkey, a road rage shooting victim, used artificial intelligence to create a video of his likeness delivering his victim impact statement. The AI-generated Pelkey expressed forgiveness to his killer and offered advice on living life to the fullest. While AI is increasingly used in courts for administrative tasks, this marks a new application for sharing information. However, concerns are raised about the potential for deepfake evidence in courtrooms. The judge acknowledged the video's impact and sentenced the perpetrator to 10.5 years imprisonment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the U.S. surgeon general. Means replaces Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, whose nomination was withdrawn due to concerns about her credentials. Means is known for her advocacy of Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, focusing on nutrition and wellness. She has expressed skepticism about the current vaccine schedule and supports Kennedy's push for vaccine safety. Her nomination has garnered both support and skepticism, particularly from Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, who fear a shift away from vaccine-related issues.</p>
