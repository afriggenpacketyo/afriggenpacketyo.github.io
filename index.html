          <p>The United Kingdom recorded its hottest day of the year, with temperatures exceeding 32Â°C, and Suffolk became the first area to officially enter a heatwave after three consecutive days above 27Â°C. Amber heat health alerts are in effect across England, with warnings of potential strain on health and social care services, and temperatures are expected to peak at 33Â°C on Saturday, with some areas potentially experiencing "tropical nights." Fire services are issuing water safety warnings, and health organizations are advising precautions for vulnerable individuals, while a change in wind direction on Sunday is expected to bring cooler temperatures and break the heatwave. The Met Office declares a heatwave when a threshold temperature is met for at least three consecutive days. The heatwave is due to an area of high pressure situated across the UK which, with a south-easterly wind, draws in hot weather from other parts of Western Europe. The rising temperatures are down to an area of high pressure situated across the UK which, with a south-easterly wind, draws in hot weather from other parts of Western Europe.

          <p>US troops stationed in the Middle East could face increased attacks if the US becomes involved in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, as President Trump is considering striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran has warned that any US military intervention will result in significant damage, and the Pentagon has reinforced its forces in the region, including deploying aircraft carriers. Concerns have been raised about the capacity to defend against drone attacks, referencing a prior attack in Jordan that killed three US service members. The US maintains over 40,000 troops and Defense Department civilians across various Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, where they could be at risk. </p>

          <p>President Trump is considering military action against Iran, specifically targeting the Fordo nuclear site, due to concerns about the rapid production of weapons, but he has not made a final decision.

The UK is actively engaged in diplomacy to find a resolution, and Trump is aware of meetings scheduled between European officials and the Iranian Foreign Minister.

          <p>Aid distribution in Gaza has become increasingly dangerous, with over 400 people killed and 3,000 wounded since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began operations in late May. Residents describe the situation as a "death race," with people risking their lives to obtain food. The GHF, backed by the US and Israel, took over assistance operations after Israel sidelined the UN and other humanitarian organizations. Instead of humanitarian workers, the GHF has deployed armed private contractors with the Israeli military stationed nearby, and aid deliveries are concentrated in a few hubs, forcing people to travel long distances through combat zones. </p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck the Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel, causing injuries and prompting Israeli leaders to vow intensified attacks on Iran, with Defense Minister Israel Katz accusing Iran of war crimes. The attack also hit residential buildings near Tel Aviv, and Israel's Home Front Command warned of "new threat of cluster bombs" fired by Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack and promised a response, while President Trump is considering US involvement in Israel's efforts to destroy Tehran's nuclear program. Israel also carried out strikes on Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, escalating the conflict. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are set to undergo a significant change as the majority ownership is being sold to Mark Walter's TWGC Global for an estimated $10 billion. This transaction would be the richest in sports history, giving the Lakers a massive financial boost. Walter's group, which acquired the Dodgers in 2012, has demonstrated a commitment to winning, which could translate into substantial investments in the Lakers' infrastructure and player acquisitions. While Jeanie Buss will remain the governor of the Lakers, the change in ownership could signal a new era focused on sustained success and a more forward-thinking approach to team building. </p>

Musk highlighted that interest payments now account for 25% of all tax revenue, and economist Peter Schiff agreed, stating that the U.S. is already bankrupt. Schiff cautioned that interest rates will skyrocket and the Federal Reserve will resort to runaway inflation to prevent the situation from worsening. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank also warned of a gradual erosion of confidence if the fiscal situation is not addressed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has granted TikTok another 90-day extension for its sale in the US, addressing national security concerns related to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The video-sharing app faced potential banning unless sold, and the new deadline for securing a buyer is now September 17. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support in keeping the app available for its 170 million US users, and the authorities in Beijing must approve any sale. The law prompting the sale stems from fears that the Chinese government could compel TikTok or ByteDance to hand over data on US users. </p>

Former principal Prof Iain Gillespie was criticized for an "overbearing leadership style" and a dislike of questioning. The report cited poor financial judgement and weak governance as primary causes, including the spending of ringfenced money elsewhere and a failure to address a shortfall due to a drop in international student recruitment. </p>

          <p>Social Security is now projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, a year earlier than previously forecast, potentially leading to a 20% cut in monthly benefits. The new projection is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees. Even if the trust funds are depleted, benefits won't disappear, but beneficiaries could see a reduction of 19% to 23%. Experts suggest that Congress needs to act quickly to shore up the program, either by raising revenue or cutting benefits, with potential solutions including lifting the income cap or increasing the retirement age.
