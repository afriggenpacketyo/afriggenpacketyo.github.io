          <p>Amazon reported mixed first-quarter results, with slower overall sales growth since the pandemic's peak, particularly in its North American retail business. Sales rose 9% to $155.7 billion, while profit increased 64% to $17.1 billion. The company expects sales between $159 billion and $164 billion for the current quarter, with operating profits potentially shrinking. CEO Andy Jassy noted that tariffs and trade policies add uncertainty to forecasts, and the company is focused on managing prices. The article also highlights the growth in Amazon's cloud computing and advertising sectors, while noting challenges related to data center capacity.</p>

          <p>During a commencement speech at the University of Alabama, President Trump reaffirmed his stance on transgender athletes in women's sports, drawing significant applause. He mocked Democrats for their policies on trans athletes and recounted anecdotes about transgender athletes in women's boxing, weightlifting, and swimming. Trump also referenced a lawsuit involving a former University of Alabama volleyball player who alleged she had to share a locker room and bedroom with a transgender teammate. The article notes that trans inclusion in women's sports was a significant issue in Trump's 2024 election victory, and exit polls indicated that a majority of Americans opposed transgender athletes competing in women's sports.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to hold intense ministerial-level tariff talks around mid-May, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal soon. Following meetings in Washington, Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa reported "progress" in discussions on nontariff barriers, bilateral trade expansion, and economic security cooperation. Japan is expected to offer proposals to increase purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplify the screening process for imported cars. The U.S. has prioritized striking early tariff deals with Japan, India, and South Korea to gain leverage over China in the Indo-Pacific region, and the Trump administration's new tariffs on goods imported from Japan have been paused until early July.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow the removal of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan immigrants, affecting hundreds of thousands of people. A federal judge had previously blocked the administration's plan, citing potential irreparable harm and concerns about racial bias. The administration argues that the law creating TPS prohibits judicial review of executive branch decisions regarding the program. The Supreme Court has been involved in several emergency applications concerning Trump's immigration policies, including cases involving wrongful deportation and the Alien Enemies Act. The Temporary Protected Status program allows migrants from countries facing disasters or conflicts to live and work legally in the U.S.</p>

Bolton believes Trump's primary motivation is to be the center of attention, lacking a coherent philosophy or grand strategy. He notes that while some of Trump's decisions may align with problematic philosophies of those around him, it's not because Trump shares their worldview. Bolton expresses concern about constitutional infringements but believes that the institutions are stronger than Trump and will ultimately prevail. He anticipates that many of Trump's efforts in the first 100 days will fail due to judicial challenges.</p>

          <h2>Cambodia Still Grapples with Landmine Threat Decades After Conflict</h2>

          <p>Cambodia continues to contend with the deadly threat of landmines, a remnant of decades of conflict stemming from the Vietnam War. Millions of mines, cluster bombs, and unexploded ordnance still litter the countryside, posing a significant danger to the population. The U.S. bombing raids in the 1960s and 1970s destabilized the country, contributing to the rise of the Khmer Rouge and a brutal civil war. While Cambodia had hoped to be mine-free by 2025, nearly 700 square miles of known minefields remain to be cleared. The article highlights the work of organizations like Cambodia Self Help DeMining, which risk their lives to clear landmines and help victims of explosions.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a soda tax, adding a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners, defying a statewide ban. The tax applies to beverages with 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces, including sodas, coffees, and energy drinks. Santa Cruz is the first city to institute a new soda tax since the ban was signed in 2018. Proponents framed the campaign as a battle between Santa Cruz and the American Beverage Association. The American Beverage Association has criticized the tax as an unfair burden on working families.</p>

          <p>President Trump has shifted his frustration from Ukraine's leader to Vladimir Putin in his approach to ending the war in Ukraine. After a difficult meeting with President Zelensky, Trump accelerated diplomacy with Putin, but he has now grown increasingly frustrated with Putin's demands. The article highlights the economic deal between the U.S. and Ukraine and a friendly meeting between Trump and Zelensky at the Vatican. Analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions due to Trump's zigzagging approach and differences among his advisors. Trump has recently criticized Putin after a deadly missile attack on Kyiv, threatening to escalate U.S. economic pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>A North Korean hacker who attempted to infiltrate the ranks of a US tech company has been caught red-handed. The hacker applied for an engineering role at the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, which knew he was a malicious actor from the very start. Instead of rejecting his CV, executives allowed him to advance through the recruitment process so they could gather intelligence about his tactics. The first red flag emerged when the hacker joined a video call using a different name to the one on his resume, with his voice occasionally switching throughout the interview.</p>

          <p>Federal health officials published a report declaring that the use of hormonal and surgical treatments in young people with gender dysphoria lacked scientific evidence and expressing concern about long-term harms. The report prioritized psychotherapy, a divisive intervention to treat gender dysphoria that many advocates and physicians have equated with so-called conversion therapy. Transgender rights advocates criticized the new assessment as seeking to paint over an ideological view with scientific gloss. The report may set the stage for additional restrictions on gender-affirming care.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using Signal during a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, just one day before President Trump announced he was replacing Waltz with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. In the photo, the names of people Waltz had been texting included Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy. Waltz came under fire in March after he inadvertently invited a journalist to a Signal group chat with other national security officials, where they discussed a U.S. attack on terrorists in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks discussed the toy maker's efforts to diversify its supply chain and adapt to President Trump's tariff hikes on China. Hasbro aims to source 40% of its global production outside of China by the end of 2026, and the company has shifted some manufacturing to countries including the U.S., Turkey, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Despite diversification efforts, China will remain an important place for Hasbro to source products. While Cocks expects prices to go up, he believes that the increases might be lower than peers because of "sourcing flexibility."</p>
