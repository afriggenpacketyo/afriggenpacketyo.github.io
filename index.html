          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted on federal charges for an alleged conspiracy to defraud the city of over $70,000. The indictment claims she maintained an improper relationship with a taxpayer-funded bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, and used city funds for personal travel and benefits. Prosecutors allege Cantrell and Vappie took steps to conceal their relationship, including deleting messages and making false statements to a grand jury. The indictment marks a significant moment in New Orleans politics, as Cantrell is the first sitting mayor in the city's history to face criminal charges.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be sold separately from the main property it accompanies. This development follows a city law passed a year ago aimed at creating more affordable homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this new housing model, often referred to as a "granny flat" or backyard cottage, will serve as a template for other cities in the state. Amid a statewide housing crisis, ADUs have become increasingly popular, accounting for approximately one-fifth of California's housing growth in 2024.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Otter.ai, accusing the company of secretly recording and transcribing private conversations from virtual meetings without the consent of all participants. The suit alleges that the popular AI transcription service uses this data to train its artificial intelligence systems, violating federal and state privacy laws. According to the complaint, Otter's default settings fail to adequately notify or seek permission from every individual in a meeting. This legal challenge raises significant privacy questions about the widespread adoption of AI notetaking tools in professional and confidential settings.</p>

Due to declining health, Gabriel could not travel but fulfilled his commitment by leading the Illinois-based band remotely from his home in Virginia. The contract was originally drawn up as a hopeful gesture by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, in the early 2000s. Gabriel, renowned for his leadership of the U.S. Air Force Band, emphasized the importance of keeping one's word, successfully conducting the performance via a video link.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the exposed, dusty shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the shrinking lake is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers now suggest that pollution sources are more varied, including agricultural chemicals, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. The report recommends shifting focus from shoreline dust control to protecting residents through indoor air filtration and improved public health alerts.</p>

          <p>British Labour MP Afzal Khan has resigned from his position as the UK's trade envoy to Turkey. The resignation follows significant criticism of his personal visit to the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a territory not officially recognized by the UK government. During the trip, Khan met with Turkish-Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar, a move condemned by the Cypriot government. In his resignation letter, Khan stated his visit was made in a personal capacity and was unrelated to his official duties, but he chose to step down to avoid distracting from the government's work on trade deals.</p>

          <p>New research from India challenges the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes. Two clinical trials found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like white bread, may actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. One study showed that post-meal glucose fluctuations were smaller after eating mango, while another eight-week trial observed improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Researchers emphasize that the key is portion control and incorporating the fruit into a balanced diet under clinical supervision, not as an additional source of calories.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Premier League season opener was marked by powerful tributes to former forward Diogo Jota, who died in a car crash in July. With Jota's family in attendance at Anfield, fans created a mosaic in his honor and sang his song throughout the match, creating a deeply emotional atmosphere. Players also paid their respects, with Mohamed Salah replicating Jota's signature celebration after scoring. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt for the season and will feature a 'Forever 20' emblem on their jerseys as a lasting tribute to the beloved player.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression has been censored after officials from the Chinese embassy lodged complaints. The show, which featured works by exiled artists from China, Tibet, and Hong Kong, was altered, with artists' names and references to their homelands covered in black paint. The exhibition's Burmese curator, Sai, and his wife have since fled to the UK to seek asylum, fearing repercussions. The Chinese embassy accused the show of promoting independence movements, while the gallery indicated it made the changes due to diplomatic pressure, raising concerns about transnational repression and freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is developing a compact, barebones electric pickup truck with a focus on affordability and customization. The company's strategy is to minimize manufacturing costs by offering a simple base model, then allowing owners to add features and accessories from a large catalog or third-party creators. With a target price point under $30,000, Slate aims to address the high cost of EVs, a major barrier for many consumers. However, the company faces challenges as federal EV tax credits are rolled back, potentially making its price less competitive against other vehicles in the market.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the federal government's controversial takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the new pact, control of the MPD will remain with its current chief, Pamela Smith, rather than being transferred to a federal administrator from the DEA. The agreement came after the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit seeking an emergency restraining order against what it called a "hostile takeover." The federal government will still be permitted to use MPD officers for federal purposes during emergencies.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to end President Trump's federalization of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Citing the Home Rule Act, the resolution argues that Trump has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" legally required to justify such a takeover. Lawmakers, including Rep. Jamie Raskin and D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, called the move a "lawless" and egregious attack on the city's autonomy. They contend the only emergency is a political one created by the president, not a public safety crisis in the District.</p>

One federal complaint claims the company's platform facilitated the sexual exploitation of a 10-year-old girl. The lawsuits argue that Roblox prioritizes profit over user safety and misrepresents its platform as a safe space for kids. In response, Roblox has stated it has rigorous safeguards and is using AI to detect child endangerment, while also testing new age-verification methods to restrict access to certain virtual experiences.</p>
