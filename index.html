          <p>Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman advises that critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability will be the most vital skills for succeeding in the age of artificial intelligence, rather than highly technical knowledge. He shared that this is the advice he gives his own teenage son, emphasizing that AI cannot replicate human intellect in generating new ideas and making nuanced judgments. Garman also highlighted the enduring importance of communication and other "people skills," as customers will continue to value personal interaction and insight from human beings.</p>

The records show then-NSA Director Mike Rogers expressing concerns that his team lacked sufficient time to review the intelligence and be "absolutely confident" in the conclusions. Clapper reportedly responded that more time was "not negotiable" and that they might have to "compromise on our ‘normal’ modalities" to meet the compressed schedule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite criticism from President Trump, multiple economists from major Wall Street firms agree with Goldman Sachs' analysis that increased tariffs will lead to higher consumer inflation. Experts at JPMorgan Chase and UBS suggest that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, businesses will increasingly pass the higher costs onto consumers, potentially adding over a percentage point to inflation. While this rise in prices could dampen consumer spending and slow GDP growth, it is not expected to prevent the Federal Reserve from initiating interest rate cuts later in the year.

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, is experiencing record-breaking flooding after an ice dam on the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive volume of water from the adjacent Suicide Basin. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and causing significant inundation in the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area and nearby residential zones. This annual event, driven by climate change, has prompted evacuations and the installation of temporary barriers to protect hundreds of homes from the destructive glacial outburst.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic analyzes how Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is effectively advancing an anti-vaccine agenda by capitalizing on public anger and skepticism surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic response. By targeting mRNA vaccines and ousting officials associated with pandemic-era policies, the administration is using "COVID revenge" as a tool to undermine broader vaccine confidence and scientific institutions. This strategy is seen as a politically convenient way to attack all vaccines by first discrediting the highly politicized COVID shots.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the progressive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has widened his lead over rivals Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Eric Adams, according to a recent poll. While facing attacks from Cuomo over his housing situation, Mamdani has shifted his campaign's focus to opposing President Trump, launching a "Five Boroughs Against Trump" tour. This strategy aims to unite Democrats against a common adversary and deflect from criticisms about his relative lack of governing experience.</p>

          <p>The legal battle between Priscilla Presley and her former business partner, Brigitte Kruse, has intensified with a new $50 million lawsuit filed in Los Angeles. Kruse alleges that Presley committed fraud and breach of contract, undermining their joint ventures and exploiting her daughter Lisa Marie Presley's death to gain control of her trust. The suit presents a counter-narrative to Presley's earlier claims of elder abuse, contending that Kruse and her associate were the actual victims who invested millions to revitalize Presley's brand.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is dealing with internal disruption as star striker Alexander Isak remains determined to leave the club for Liverpool, despite Newcastle rejecting a £110m bid. Isak is currently training away from the first team, creating an unsettling situation for the club ahead of the new Premier League season. While the club is contractually empowered to hold Isak to his contract, the commercial reality of paying an unhappy, high-value player who isn't playing presents a complex challenge for management.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk and meat, for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. The move comes as concerns about rising consumer prices are renewed due to tariffs, and the company framed it as a response to employee feedback for expanded benefits. This enhanced perk could also serve to boost Walmart's own sales by encouraging its large workforce to shop in-house and may help with employee retention.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study predicts that global wild reindeer populations could plummet significantly by the end of the century as a result of climate change, with North American caribou facing the most severe risk. Researchers used ancient DNA, fossils, and computer models to find that warming periods have historically led to population declines, but future losses are expected to be much worse. The potential loss of reindeer could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and an acceleration of climate warming through the release of carbon from Arctic soils.</p>
