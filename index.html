          <p>Poland stated it downed drones that entered its airspace during Russian aerial attacks on Ukraine, marking a first for a NATO country during the conflict. Prime Minister Donald Tusk communicated with NATO allies, emphasizing that drones posing a direct threat were shot down as Poland's military scrambled aircraft alongside allied forces to intercept "hostile objects" within Polish airspace, which they deemed an act of aggression posing a threat to the safety of Polish citizens. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that eight Russian drones were directed toward Poland, calling the incident an extremely dangerous precedent for Europe, while EU leaders condemned Russia's actions and affirmed solidarity with Poland. The article details Poland's response to the incursion and the international reaction, underscoring the escalating tensions and potential implications for European security. </p>

          <p>A team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has developed an AI system that automates a robotic arm to assist surgeons with routine tasks during operations. The AI-automated arm acts as a third hand, controlled from a console where surgeons view live endoscopic footage, and helps with tissue retraction, gauze handling, and blood vessel clipping. The researchers published their work in Science Robotics, highlighting the growing clinical demand and strain on surgeons due to an aging population.
