        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed imported goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, a change expected to significantly impact small and medium-sized businesses. This policy shift means millions of daily packages will now face tariffs, increasing costs and logistical complexity for e-commerce companies that relied on the provision. Experts warn that many smaller businesses, operating on thin margins, may struggle to absorb the new duties, potentially leading to higher consumer prices, shipping delays, and financial distress. The move has also caused several international postal services to temporarily suspend shipments to the U.S. (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has ended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, a decision made seven months after she left office. Standard protocol under a 2008 law provides protection for six months, and a threat assessment reportedly found no alarming issues that would warrant an extension. The move is part of a broader pattern of the administration revoking security details for former officials and family members of the previous administration, including John Bolton and the adult children of former President Joe Biden. Harris's office acknowledged the decision and thanked the Secret Service for their service.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government has announced that it will not invite an official Israeli government delegation to a major defense exhibition in London, citing Israel's decision to escalate its military operations in Gaza. While individual Israeli defense firms can still participate, the government's absence is a significant diplomatic statement reflecting growing criticism of Israel's conduct in the war. Israel's defense ministry condemned the move as discriminatory and politically motivated, confirming it would withdraw its national pavilion from the event. The decision comes amid increasing calls from UK leaders for a ceasefire and greater humanitarian aid for Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose to an annual rate of 2.9% in July, meeting economists' expectations. This slight increase from the previous month suggests that tariff impacts are filtering through the economy, keeping inflation above the central bank's 2% target. Despite the persistent inflation, consumer spending remained strong, increasing by 0.5%. The report is unlikely to deter the Fed from considering an interest rate cut at its next meeting, as policymakers weigh the risks of a weakening labor market against rising prices.

          <p>President Trump's legal team has asked a federal judge to reject a request from Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for a temporary restraining order that would prevent him from firing her. Cook filed a lawsuit arguing her termination is illegal, seeking to remain in her position while the case is litigated. In a separate filing, the Federal Reserve Board took no official stance on the lawsuit but urged the court to issue a prompt ruling to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the leadership dispute.

          <p>Relations between Ukraine and Hungary have become strained after Ukrainian strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia disrupted Hungary's primary source of crude oil. Hungarian officials, including Prime Minister Viktor Orban, condemned the attack as a threat to European energy security, while Ukraine maintains its goal is to undermine Russia's war economy. The situation is compounded by Hungary's ongoing obstruction of Ukraine's EU accession talks and its deep energy dependence on Russia. The conflict exposes the geopolitical vulnerabilities created by Hungary's close ties to Moscow amid the wider war.</p>

          <p>Colin Smyth, a Member of the Scottish Parliament, has denied a new allegation that he hid a camera in a toilet at the Holyrood parliament building. This charge comes after Smyth was previously suspended by the Labour Party over an investigation into the possession of indecent images of children. The Scottish Parliament's corporate body has revoked his access to the building, though police searches found no recording devices. Smyth, who is cooperating with the police, stated the new allegation was a complete shock and criticized the public release of his details.</p>

The motion argues that public statements from officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who labeled Abrego Garcia an "MS-13 gang member" and a "monster," are prejudicial and could taint the jury pool. This is the second time the defense has made such a request, claiming the repeated negative characterizations threaten their client's right to a fair trial.

The vessel was en route to Spain's Canary Islands, an increasingly common but perilous migration route across the Atlantic. According to survivors, the boat overturned when passengers shifted to one side after spotting coastal lights. This tragedy highlights the extreme dangers faced by migrants, with a non-governmental organization estimating that over 9,000 people died attempting this crossing last year alone.

          <p>India's economy demonstrated robust growth, expanding at an annual rate of 7.8% in the April-June quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts. The expansion was driven by strong performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. However, some economists note underlying signs of a slowdown, as nominal GDP growth, which isn't adjusted for inflation, has decreased. The strong real GDP figure was partly boosted by a soft deflator, which measures the impact of inflation. Despite concerns about the potential impact of new U.S. tariffs, analysts believe India is on track to achieve world-leading growth for the year. (not investment advice).</p>

The IPPR argues that interest rate losses from this program have effectively become a subsidy for commercial banks.

Conversely, the absence of previously prominent figures may signal that they have fallen out of favor or become targets of President Xi Jinping's ongoing anti-corruption campaign.

          <p>Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold has been dropped from the latest England national football squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. The 26-year-old right-back's omission follows his recent move from Liverpool and being left out of Real Madrid's starting lineup. In his place, manager Thomas Tuchel has given first-time call-ups to Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Tottenham full-back Djed Spence. The squad also sees the return of Marcus Rashford and Adam Wharton, while notable players like Kyle Walker and Phil Foden were not included.</p>

          <p>A jogger in Cologne, Germany, has ignited a national conversation after she confronted and filmed a man who was secretly recording her from behind. When she learned that filming a clothed person is not a criminal offense under current German law, she launched a petition demanding legal reform. The petition, which calls for making any sexually motivated secret recording a crime, has gathered over 125,000 signatures and has drawn widespread support. The incident and her subsequent activism have highlighted the prevalence of sexual harassment in public spaces and put pressure on lawmakers to address gaps in legal protections for victims.</p>

The weapon was donated by a family who wished to remain anonymous and was authenticated via its serial number.

While localized ceasefires will remain in effect in southern and central Gaza, the lifting of protections in Gaza City marks a significant escalation.

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has dismissed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office for an ethics violation, creating political instability. The ruling stems from a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen, in which her familiar tone and criticism of the Thai army were deemed to have undermined national interests during a period of border tension. Paetongtarn is the third member of the powerful Shinawatra political dynasty to be removed from the premiership.

          <p>The arrival of pumpkin spice season coincides with new 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imports from India, a major exporter of key spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. This trade policy threatens to raise the cost of the iconic autumn flavor blend that has become a massive cultural and commercial phenomenon in the U.S. While the immediate impact may be limited due to existing stockpiles, spice importers and manufacturers anticipate they will eventually have to pass the increased costs on to consumers. The situation highlights how broad trade wars can have specific, tangible effects on everyday consumer goods. (not investment advice).</p>
