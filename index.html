          <p>Texas Democratic state legislators have departed for Chicago, strategically denying Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a new congressional map. This proposed redistricting, strongly supported by former President Trump, aims to significantly increase GOP representation in the U.S. House, potentially adding five seats. Democrats accuse Governor Abbott of leveraging crucial disaster relief as political leverage to force this gerrymander, asserting their walkout is a necessary stand for the democratic process against a system they deem rigged. This tactic, echoing past quorum breaks by Texas Democrats in 2005 and 2021 to protest redistricting and voting bills, underscores the deep partisan struggle over electoral boundaries and political power within the state, with lawmakers facing potential fines and arrest threats for their absence.</p>

          <p>A violent prison riot erupted at the Taxpan prison in Veracruz, Mexico, leading to the tragic deaths of seven inmates and injuries to eleven others. The unrest, which saw fires and plumes of smoke, reportedly stemmed from inmate anger over extortion and abuse by the Grupo Sombra criminal organization. This incident highlights long-standing issues within Mexican prisons, including overcrowding, corruption, and control by criminal groups like Grupo Sombra, which also claims to engage in social work while being linked to serious crimes.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, a dedicated search continues on Ninoshima, an island south of the city, for the remains of thousands of victims. Many of the dead and dying were brought to Ninoshima's field hospital, where poor care led to mass burials. Researcher Rebun Kayo and others are actively unearthing bone fragments, driven by a profound desire to honor the missing and bring closure to survivors still haunted by loss. This ongoing effort underscores the lasting trauma of the atomic attack and the community's commitment to remembrance and accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing lessons from the Ukraine war, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant technological enhancement for combat drones to drastically improve their survival rates. The innovative concept involves equipping small to medium-sized drones with compact, side-mounted rocket boosters, enabling instantaneous, high-G evasive maneuvers just before missile impact. Digital simulations suggest this "terminal evasion" system could boost drone survival rates to nearly 90%, representing a substantial leap in military drone capabilities. This development highlights the ongoing evolution of drone warfare and the strategic adaptation of defense technology.</p>

Police, responding to the chaotic scene, encountered multiple canines, possibly strays, and an injured woman. An officer was forced to shoot and kill one pit bull when two more dogs charged. Authorities removed 14 dogs from the park as the incident remains under investigation to determine how many animals were involved and their origin.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton expressed profound disappointment with his performance at the Hungarian Grand Prix, labeling himself "useless" after qualifying 12th and finishing in the same position. This challenging weekend, despite Ferrari's recent car upgrades, sparked speculation about his future, which he quickly dismissed. Team principal Frederic Vasseur contextualized Hamilton's frustration, noting the tough situation for a seven-time world champion when his teammate secures pole position. Despite struggles with the new ground-effect cars, Hamilton's determination and past achievements suggest he remains a formidable competitor.</p>

          <p>Following Japan's Nippon Steel acquisition of U.S. Steel, the U.S. government, under President Trump, has implemented an unusual "golden share" arrangement, granting significant control over the company's operations. This agreement, reviewed by CFIUS for national security, dictates that Nippon cannot change the company's name, must invest billions, and requires presidential approval for factory closures or salary reductions. While not a typical equity stake, this symbolic "golden share" provides the U.S. government with "extra special governance rights," ensuring national and economic security interests are safeguarded.

          <p>NPR's "Tested" series delves into the long and complex history of sex testing in sports, prompted by World Athletics' new regulations requiring genetic testing for female athletes. The article highlights that such testing is not new, dating back to 1936, and questions the scientific basis for "biological woman" as a sporting category. It discusses the distinction between cisgender women with natural biological variations and transgender women, noting limited research on competitive advantages. Athletes affected by these policies often express a desire to simply compete, while others prioritize issues like equal pay and protection from exploitation over gender categorization debates.</p>

          <p>The White House is struggling to justify President Trump's sudden firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, whom Trump accused of manipulating jobs numbers. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited "historically important outlier" revisions in recent employment data as justification, but offered no evidence of manipulation. The move drew sharp criticism from economists and former BLS officials, who warn it undermines trust in government data and sets a dangerous precedent, suggesting political interference in an independent statistical agency.
