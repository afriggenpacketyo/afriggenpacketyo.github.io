        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to levy 30% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and the European Union, scheduled to take effect on August 1. The stated rationale for the tariffs is to address national security threats posed by persistent trade deficits and, in Mexico's case, insufficient efforts to curb drug trafficking. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen criticized the move, warning it would disrupt transatlantic supply chains and promising proportionate countermeasures if necessary. This policy marks a significant escalation in trade disputes and a departure from long-standing global trade norms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The mother of rising motocross star Aidan Zingg has confirmed his cause of death following a fatal crash during a race in Mammoth Lakes, California. Shari Zingg stated that the 16-year-old died from cardiac tamponade, a condition where fluid buildup puts extreme pressure on the heart, dispelling initial reports that he was run over by other riders. Zingg was a celebrated amateur competitor and a member of the Monster Energy Kawasaki Team Green, having won an AMA National Championship in 2024. The racing community mourns the loss of the dedicated and talented young athlete.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," aiming to provide an alternative to the Democratic and Republican parties by capturing a small number of congressional seats to act as deciding votes. However, political science experts express skepticism, citing the immense structural and financial advantages of the two major parties and the historical role of third parties as disruptors rather than seat-winners. The new party currently lacks a clear platform, and its formation appears to stem from a personal dispute with Donald Trump. Musk's own high public unfavorability rating is also seen as a significant hurdle to the party's success.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration program, presenting a significant challenge to the United States' long-held dominance in space. The country aims to land two astronauts on the moon before 2030, with key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development and testing phases. This progress puts China on a competitive timeline with NASA's Artemis program, which targets a crewed landing by 2027 but faces significant technical challenges, such as the need for in-orbit refueling. The intensified space race is underscored by recent US Senate approval of an additional $10 billion for NASA's lunar exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>This article presents a personal essay on the experience of being a transgender person in the current political environment, which has seen a rise in restrictive laws and debates over gender-affirming care. The author, who transitioned as an adult after a closeted childhood, argues against the idea that delaying transition is beneficial, framing it as a form of survivorship bias that ignores those who suffer without care. The piece draws parallels between skepticism of trans-affirming care and tactics used to create doubt about climate change. It emphasizes that while social transition is the primary form of care for younger children, access to medical interventions like puberty blockers is crucial for adolescents to avoid the pain of undergoing the wrong puberty.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its aerial assault on Ukraine, launching nearly 600 drones and over two dozen cruise missiles in overnight attacks that killed at least six people and injured many more across the country. The widespread strikes targeted various regions, including Chernivtsi in the southwest, Lviv in the west, and the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Ukrainian air defense systems reportedly intercepted a significant portion of the incoming projectiles. This intensified bombing campaign coincides with a major Russian push along the front line, placing Ukrainian forces under severe pressure and further diminishing hopes for a resolution to the long-running war.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague, marking the state's first recorded fatality from the disease since 2007. Plague is a rare bacterial infection in humans, typically transmitted through bites from infected fleas carried by rodents like prairie dogs. While bubonic plague is the most common form, pneumonic plague infects the lungs and is the most deadly and easily spread variant. Health experts advise caution when handling sick or dead animals in rural areas of the western U.S., where most cases are reported, though the disease is treatable with modern antibiotics.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved multiple requests from Camp Mystic to remove dozens of its buildings from the 100-year flood map in the years preceding the recent deadly flood. These exemptions, granted in 2013, 2019, and 2020, loosened regulatory oversight and insurance requirements for the camp, which was located in a high-risk area known as "flash flood alley." Experts find it disturbing that a camp responsible for children would seek such exemptions, especially as data models show nearly the entire property was at significant risk. The catastrophic July 4 flood, which killed dozens at the camp, was far more severe than the 100-year event standard.</p>

This new IDR plan will extend the repayment timeline to 30 years, after which any remaining balance is forgiven.

She advises against waiting for an annual review, as budgets are often set by then, and instead suggests initiating the discussion during a mid-year check-in. The goal of the first meeting should be to open the dialogue and present your case, not to get an immediate agreement. It is crucial to schedule a follow-up meeting to ensure accountability and to send a summary email with notes to document the conversation. Valentine emphasizes that patience and a collaborative mindset are key to a successful negotiation.</p>

The first is excessive phone use, which signals a lack of presence and emotional connection with a partner. Another significant blocker is unresolved emotional attachment to an ex, which prevents new connections from forming. The article also points to negativity bias, where self-doubt and assumptions of rejection prevent vulnerability, and the physiological effects of stress, which can act as a major brake on desire for many individuals. The therapist suggests open communication and setting boundaries to overcome these challenges.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams are continuing their search for more than 170 people who remain missing after catastrophic flash floods struck Central Texas on July 4. The death toll has risen to at least 122, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River swelled to historic levels. A significant number of victims were from Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp that was devastated by the rapidly rising waters. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, and scrutiny is growing over the adequacy of weather warnings and the lack of a local emergency alert system.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions concluded their tour matches with a decisive 48-0 victory over the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in Adelaide. Winger Duhan van der Merwe scored a hat-trick as the Lions ran in a total of eight tries in a dominant performance. The match also saw the return of Owen Farrell as a second-half substitute, providing a boost ahead of the first Test against the Wallabies. However, the team suffered a setback with news that center Garry Ringrose will miss the Test due to a head injury, and hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie was stretchered off with a knee to the head.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering the authorization of new funding for Ukraine's defense, a potential shift from his previous criticisms of aid spending. According to diplomatic sources, this move could be intended to send a strong message to Russia following its recent wave of intense missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities. The administration has access to approximately $3.85 billion in leftover presidential drawdown authority and the power to seize $5 billion in frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's benefit. This consideration follows recent tensions between Trump and Vladimir Putin, with Trump stating that Russia's actions might prompt him to send more defensive weapons to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>A new book, "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America," provides a deeply sourced account of the turbulent election, attributing Donald Trump's victory to widespread public frustration with the political system. The authors argue that Joe Biden's campaign was flawed, citing a warning from Barack Obama and internal dissent, and that Kamala Harris's campaign never saw a lead in its internal polling despite some positive public polls. The book posits several "what-if" scenarios, including the impact of the assassination attempt on Trump and Biden's disastrous debate performance, which ultimately led to his withdrawal from the race. It also chronicles Trump's actions in the initial months of his new term.</p>

He recounted how Obama gathered the communications team in the Oval Office to deliver an early version of his public speech, emphasizing the need for a peaceful transfer of power despite the administration's dire warnings about a Trump presidency. Earnest also reflected on the difficulty of defending the integrity of the election while simultaneously preparing to hand over power.</p>

          <p>Scientists are concerned that promising cancer research utilizing mRNA technology could be stalled by the political backlash against COVID-19 vaccines. Groundbreaking therapeutic mRNA vaccines, which have shown potential in treating difficult cancers like pancreatic and melanoma, are at risk of being defunded or restricted as officials target the technology. The Trump administration has already made significant cuts to NIH research funding, and scientists report being told to remove mentions of mRNA from grant applications. This uncertainty threatens to halt critical progress and could discourage researchers from pursuing innovative projects that have the potential to transform the treatment of cancer and other diseases.</p>

However, these findings, submitted to the journal Nature, were reportedly rejected twice by a review panel, highlighting ongoing contention within the international planetary science community.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's natural inclination for free, unstructured movement, which is crucial for their physical and cognitive development. With rising sedentary behavior and limited access to safe play spaces, many children are missing out on activities that build healthier bodies, improve cognitive skills, and foster resilience. Injury-prevention experts suggest that such "wild" play helps develop superior movement quality, making children less prone to injury in organized sports later in life. Parents are encouraged to allow for more adventurous play, like climbing trees and wrestling, to help children build a robust movement vocabulary that they may never get back if missed during childhood.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Florida are developing new, unwritten rules for driving due to fear of being detained during traffic stops, following a state policy that grants highway patrol officers authority to detain individuals based on immigration status. Many now avoid displaying foreign flags or Spanish-language stickers, listen only to English-language radio, and refrain from driving work vans or wearing work uniforms to avoid being targeted. This climate of fear has led some to stop driving altogether, impacting their ability to get to work and causing disruptions for businesses. The trend is seen by rights advocates as part of a broader administration effort to expand border-style immigration enforcement nationwide.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has dismissed concerns that a political dispute within the ruling coalition over judicial appointments is damaging the country's highest court. The controversy arose after the conservative CDU/CSU bloc abruptly withdrew its support for a Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for the Federal Constitutional Court, leading to the postponement of a parliamentary vote. Critics from the opposition and the SPD accused the conservatives of deliberately undermining democratic institutions. Dobrindt, however, described the postponement as a normal part of the political process and stated that he sees no harm done to the esteemed court.</p>

          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the significant and recurring costs of maintaining an "acceptable feminine appearance" represent an insidious and often-overlooked financial burden for women. She describes this cycle of spending on hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel," where each expense necessitates future spending, effectively creating a depreciating asset. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to understand their financial impact and then experimenting with eliminating services to reclaim money, time, and mental energy. This saved capital can then be redirected toward building wealth through debt repayment, savings, or investing.</p>

Michael Coen, the agency's former chief of staff, expressed concern that FEMA lacks the resources to manage two or three concurrent disasters, a likely scenario during hurricane season.

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the nature of summer camp as a place for children to learn bravery and resilience, in light of the recent tragic deaths of young campers in the Texas floods. The author, who grew up at a Girl Scout camp run by her mother, recalls how even frightening events like tornado warnings were managed safely and became part of the camp experience. The article touches on the profound grief and fear the Camp Mystic tragedy has instilled in the camping community, but argues that camps remain vital spaces for personal growth. The author hopes the disaster will not lead parents to prevent their children from having these life-changing, character-building experiences.</p>
