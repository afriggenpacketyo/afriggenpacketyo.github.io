Discussions include a youth mobility scheme, access to an EU defense fund, and easing trade red tape. Conservative MP Alex Burghart voiced concerns about the UK becoming a rule taker by adhering to EU standards, which is what the country voted against during Brexit.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office.

Both President Trump and Democratic House Representative Ro Khanna have extended their support to Biden and his family. The news arrives almost a year after Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election due to health and age concerns, and Biden himself has previously denied claims of cognitive decline.</p>

However, the review suggests that the show struggles to transform this sentiment into compelling drama, sometimes tipping into sentimentality. While the series portrays the scale and violence of the event effectively, it lacks conflict and stakes, resembling reporting more than drama.</p>

The two men are set to compete in a runoff on June 1. The election is viewed as pivotal as the government seeks to unwind hard-right policies put in place by a previous administration. The eventual winner will replace Andrzej Duda, a conservative and an ally of Law and Justice, who has used his powers to undermine Mr. Tusk’s plans.</p>

          <p>Exit polls in Portugal indicate that the ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) is likely to win the most votes in Sunday's election, but is expected to fall short of a full majority. This is the third election in as many years in Portugal. The AD will likely have to forge deals with smaller parties in order to secure a majority of at least 116 seats in Portugal's 230-seat parliament. This year's election has been dominated by issues such as housing and immigration.</p>
