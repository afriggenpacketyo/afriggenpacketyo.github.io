            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has expressed strong opposition to President Trump's threat of additional tariffs on Chinese goods, stating it will take countermeasures to protect its interests. This comes after Trump threatened to impose a 50% duty on U.S. imports from China if Beijing doesn't withdraw its 34% tariff on American products. The ministry emphasized that escalating tariffs is a mistake and China will fight to the end if the U.S. persists. China had previously announced 34% additional tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Trump's initial levies, with analysts suggesting Beijing is prepared for a prolonged trade war, potentially resorting to measures like halting U.S. agricultural purchases and expanding export controls.

            <p>A recent CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concern that President Trump's tariffs will lead to a recession, increased prices, and job losses. A majority (69%) of CEOs expect a recession, with over half predicting it will occur this year. Many CEOs expressed frustration and confusion over the tariffs, fearing boycotts of American brands and rising inflation. They anticipate price hikes ranging from 5% to 20% and are preparing for potential disruptions to their supply chains. The survey highlights the uncertainty and economic pessimism prevalent among corporate leaders regarding the long-term impact of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Global stock markets experienced significant volatility following President Trump's tariff announcements. Trump threatened further tariffs on China unless it rescinded its retaliatory measures, defending his policies as necessary medicine. Meanwhile, the EU revealed it had offered the U.S. a "zero-for-zero" tariff deal on cars and industrial goods weeks prior to Trump's trade war, an offer that remains on the table. The Supreme Court allowed Trump to continue using a 1798 law for deportations, albeit with limits, and Trump announced direct talks with Iran regarding its nuclear program. These events highlight the complex and rapidly evolving landscape of international relations under the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can continue using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, but mandated that deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal. This decision vacates a lower court's block on the deportations, but emphasizes the need for judicial review. The ruling stems from the administration's claim that migrants were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, prompting the invocation of the 1798 law. While the ACLU claims this as a victory, rights groups have widely condemned the use of the Act, arguing it's unprecedented without a formal declaration of war.</p>

These revocations are allegedly due to minor legal infractions, participation in demonstrations, or unknown reasons. The State Department has revoked over 300 student visas since the beginning of Trump's second term. The universities are actively tracking the number of students impacted, highlighting concerns about the administration's targeting of international students.

            <p>China's top diplomat Wang Yi declared a milestone in South China Sea Code of Conduct (COC) negotiations, but observers caution that few gains have been made on contentious issues. Disputes linger over enforcement, scope, legal status, and the role of external powers. The Group of Seven (G7) nations issued a tough statement accusing China of “illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions” endangering maritime security. Wang labeled Manila’s maritime frictions with Beijing “a shadow play” controlled by the US and other Western powers.</p>

            <p>At least 22 people have died from flash flooding and tornado damage across multiple states in the US Midwest and South, with Tennessee reporting nearly half of the deaths.

Tragic incidents included a young boy swept away by floodwaters and a volunteer firefighter killed while rescuing others. The storms brought heavy rainfall to Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, with officials warning that water recession could take days or weeks in some areas.</p>

Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO's military committee, was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration, reportedly due to her support for diversity in the force.

This firing aligns with the administration's stance against "woke policies" and its efforts to remove leaders who promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Sen.

The court majority said a group of alleged Venezuelan gang members facing deportation to El Salvador may appeal, but only before a federal judge in Texas, where they are held. The ruling was a victory for President Trump, as the court set aside the orders of judges in Washington who said the administration had overstepped its power.
