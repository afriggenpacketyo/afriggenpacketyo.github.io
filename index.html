          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations, except where explicitly required by law. This directive effectively suspends the use of the "social cost of carbon," a metric used to weigh the economic benefits of limiting carbon pollution against the costs to industries. Critics argue that this decision ignores the scientific consensus on climate change and will hinder efforts to address its harmful effects.

          <p>Manchester City's manager, Pep Guardiola, acknowledged the intense competition for Champions League spots after a draw against Southampton, emphasizing that his team must "fight until the end." The draw leaves City only two points above Newcastle and Chelsea. Guardiola noted the team has three cup finals left, including an FA Cup final against Crystal Palace. The race for European competition qualification remains tight, with multiple teams vying for limited spots, while only champions Liverpool have sealed a Champions League place so far.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have resumed trade talks in Switzerland, signaling a potential easing of the trade war. Top trade officials from both countries met to discuss tariffs, which have hurt both economies. Despite stern rhetoric, both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock, but neither wants to appear to be backing down. Trump acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting of the tariffs. The outcome of the talks remains uncertain, but the resumption of negotiations offers a glimmer of hope for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Ramona Sarsgaard, the daughter of actors Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, was arrested during a Columbia University protest against Israel's war in Gaza. The 18-year-old was given a desk appearance ticket for criminal trespassing after student activists occupied part of the Butler library building. The university called in the police, leading to multiple arrests. Following the protests, Columbia University and Barnard College temporarily suspended student journalists who reported on the demonstrations, before later reinstating them. The protests are part of a broader wave of anti-war demonstrations at US universities.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China concluded their first day of meetings in Geneva, setting up a second day of high-stakes negotiations on Sunday that could determine the fate of a global economy. Neither side provided an immediate readout about how the talks went. The meetings are the first since Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent and China retaliated with its own levies of 125 percent on U.S. goods. While the stakes for the meetings are high, expectations for a breakthrough that results in a meaningful reduction in tariffs are low.</p>

          <p>Heavy flooding in eastern Congo, following torrential rains, has resulted in at least 62 deaths and 50 missing, washing away several villages along Lake Tanganyika.

The Red Cross is the only humanitarian organization currently present. The flooding compounds the existing humanitarian crisis caused by decades of conflict between government forces and rebels in the region.</p>

          <p>As the Philippines prepares for midterm elections, many young voters are expressing a desire to end the concentration of political power among entrenched political dynasties. A recent report revealed that the majority of provincial governments are led by members of political dynasties, and some families are flaunting their legacy. Critics argue that political dynasties hinder economic development and erode checks and balances. Student groups are calling for enforcement of the constitutional ban on political dynasties, emphasizing that public office should not be inherited like private property.</p>
