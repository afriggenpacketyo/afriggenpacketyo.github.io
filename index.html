          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has designated Canadian-based TechInsights an "unreliable entity," banning Chinese entities from sharing data with the semiconductor research firm. This move follows TechInsights' report revealing that Huawei's latest AI chips contained components sourced from outside mainland China, consistent with other research. The blacklist is seen as a response to the firm's coverage of Chinese chip breakthroughs and could increase opaqueness in the country's semiconductor industry. It highlights China's intensified efforts to build a self-sufficient supply chain amid U.S. export controls.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution. This indictment follows President Donald Trump's public calls for charges against his long-time antagonist, with a Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney presenting the evidence. James is accused of making false statements on a mortgage for a Norfolk home, allegedly renting it out despite classifying it as a secondary residence. James vehemently denies the charges, calling them a "continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system."</p>

          <p>The New York Giants secured a decisive 34-17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, who are the defending Super Bowl champions. The game sparked controversy when the Eagles repeatedly ran the "tush push" play four straight times to score an early touchdown, drawing criticism from prominent figures like Micah Parsons and Dave Portnoy. Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart led his team to victory despite an injury scare, with fellow rookie Cam Skattebo contributing three rushing touchdowns. This marked a significant win for the Giants, their fourth against the Eagles in 18 games.</p>

Her identification resulted from a crucial tip-off following an international police campaign, Operation Identify Me, which publicly released Interpol "black notices." Pommer's body was discovered in sand dunes near Wassenaar with no obvious injuries, and a key linked her to Bottrop, Germany.

Drake's lawyers had argued UMG promoted a false and malicious narrative, but the court found that a reasonable listener would not perceive the lyrics as verifiable facts.

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, is reportedly set to announce her campaign for the U.S. Senate next week, challenging longtime Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, who is term-limited as governor, gained national attention for publicly confronting President Trump over his administration's stance on transgender athletes. Her entry into the race is seen as a significant opportunity for Democrats to potentially flip a GOP-held seat and contest the Republican Senate majority in a state that leans Democratic. The race is expected to be one of the most closely watched contests in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan's LDP leadership race signals the potential end of centrist pragmatism, marking her as Japan's first female prime minister in waiting. Her arch-conservative and nationalist stance is expected to reshape domestic economic policy with a blend of fiscal expansionism and protectionist undertones, focusing on state-led industrial revival in defense and technology. This approach aims to reduce reliance on China and bolster security autonomy. Her rise could also alter Japan's foreign policy, tying economic engagement more closely to strategic cooperation with Southeast Asian partners.</p>

          <p>Electronic Arts (EA) is making a significant gamble with Battlefield 6, investing hundreds of millions to challenge Call of Duty in the military shooter genre. Developed by four studios, the game incorporates lessons from its negatively received predecessor, Battlefield 2042, by engaging fans early through community playtests. The new installment restores a single-player campaign and has generated huge buzz, with analysts predicting strong initial sales. While the project is immense, developers are optimistic about its potential, focusing on delivering a game that satisfies its community and leverages new technologies like generative AI in preparatory stages.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at strengthening the state's property insurer of last resort, the California FAIR Plan, which faced significant losses from recent wildfires. The legislation includes measures allowing the FAIR Plan to issue bonds and secure lines of credit for catastrophic claims, addressing its financial woes. Additionally, the bills increase legislative oversight by adding non-voting members to the plan's governing committee and mandate modernizations like automatic payment plans. These reforms seek to stabilize the insurance market amidst escalating climate-fueled fire risks.</p>

          <p>UK universities have announced over 12,000 job cuts in the past year, with additional cost savings equivalent to 3,000 more positions, according to analysis by the University and College Union (UCU). This comes as four in ten English universities are reportedly in financial deficit. UCU members are preparing to vote on strike action over a 1.4% pay offer, which employers deem the "only prudent option" given the sector's financial challenges. Staff are described as "demoralised, exhausted and furious," with students also feeling the impact on services and course availability.</p>

          <p>A Riverside County woman, known as “the butt lady,” has been convicted of second-degree murder after a second client died from illegal silicone injections she administered. Libby Adame was previously convicted of involuntary manslaughter for a 2019 death but continued performing unauthorized procedures. Her latest conviction stems from the fatal embolism of a TV actress in Malibu. Prosecutors argued Adame was aware of the dangers, having fled a salon in 2018 after another client died. She faces a significantly longer sentence, highlighting the severe risks of unapproved cosmetic procedures.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 576 into law, prohibiting streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video from broadcasting commercials significantly louder than their programming. The initiative, inspired by new parents whose baby was woken by blaring ads, extends federal CALM Act protections to streaming platforms, which were previously exempt. Despite opposition from the Motion Picture Association, the bill passed, reflecting widespread consumer frustration. This legislation, taking effect in July 2026, is expected to set a precedent for nationwide regulation due to California's market influence.</p>

          <p>A congressional stalemate over the government shutdown is putting Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance subsidies at risk, potentially impacting millions of Americans. Democrats insist on extending these subsidies, authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act, which are set to expire in 2025. Without them, an estimated 3.8 million Americans could lose affordable health insurance by 2035, with average premiums doubling. This situation highlights the critical role of federal aid in healthcare access and the severe financial and health consequences for individuals if the subsidies are not renewed.</p>
