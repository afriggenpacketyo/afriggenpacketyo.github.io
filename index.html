          <p>Major Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened to a powerful Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, leading to a Tropical Storm Watch for Bermuda due to anticipated life-threatening surf and rip currents. The National Hurricane Center projects Humberto will maintain its major hurricane status for several more days, potentially affecting parts of the Southeast U.S. coast. This article also mentions the concurrent development of Tropical Storm Imelda, the ninth named storm, which is expected to bring significant rainfall to Cuba and the Bahamas. Forecasters are closely tracking both systems for their evolving paths and impacts.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sony Financial Group surged 36% on their market debut after Sony Group spun off the unit, valuing the company at over $6.7 billion. The parent company stated the separation allows the financial arm, including Sony Life Insurance and Sony Bank, to raise its own growth capital while maintaining brand ties. This article notes that Sony Group cited competing demands for investment in entertainment and semiconductors as a key reason for the financial unit's independence. Broader Asia markets traded mostly higher, despite Japan's Nikkei 225 falling after a record high. (not investment advice)</p>
