        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Denver issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the removal of migrants from Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act, following arguments from the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network regarding the imminent deportation of two Venezuelan men. The lawyers highlighted that 11 men from Colorado had already been sent to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) by the Trump administration, prompting the judge to mandate a 21-day notice for individuals facing deportation under the AEA, including informing them of their right to judicial review and legal counsel. The restraining order is set to expire on May 6, with the ACLU vowing to fight permanently against sending people to foreign prisons without due process. This act was last invoked during World War II, interning Japanese Americans at Camp Amache in Colorado.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. The FDA is looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and work with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes commonly used in cereals, ice cream, snacks, and yogurts. While the health effects of these dyes are debated, Kennedy cited studies linking petroleum-based synthetic dyes to health conditions, including ADHD, obesity, and cancer, despite scientists cautioning that the evidence is not entirely clear. The proposed timeline is contingent on an "understanding" with major food companies, who have expressed concerns about the timeline, though some consumer groups are supportive.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in the 2019 death of her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona. Charles Vallow was fatally shot by Vallow Daybell's brother, Alex Cox, who initially claimed self-defense but was later implicated in the conspiracy, with prosecutors arguing Vallow Daybell planned Vallow's death to collect life insurance money and marry Chad Daybell. Vallow Daybell, already serving life sentences in Idaho for the murders of her children and conspiring to murder Chad Daybell's wife, Tammy, now faces another life sentence in the Arizona case. She is scheduled for another trial in June on charges of conspiring to murder Brandon Boudreaux, her niece's ex-husband.</p>

          <p>Tesla's profit fell sharply in the first quarter, down 71% to $409 million, amid brand controversy stemming from Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration and the impact of tariffs. Revenue also declined, and Tesla's stock price has fallen nearly 40% this year, with analysts citing a decline in automotive sales and increasing competition. Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has drawn criticism and led to calls for him to refocus on Tesla. The company also faces challenges from tariffs, disrupting imports of auto parts from China, which could affect plans for the Cybercab and electric semi-truck production.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is experiencing profound internal divisions regarding its future direction and how to address current challenges, with disagreements ranging from fighting Trump's policies to winning back disillusioned voters. Some leaders, like Al Gore, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are focused on resisting Trump's actions, while others prioritize winning elections by appealing to disaffected Trump voters. These disagreements extend to electoral strategies, as seen in the conflict between David Hogg's call for younger candidates and James Carville's focus on coalition-building, revealing a party struggling to define its identity in the post-Biden era.</p>

Musk announced plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE starting in May, but will still be involved throughout Trump's term.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs, along with growing land-use and environmental regulations, could devastate Southern California's nearly $300-billion trade and logistics industry, according to a Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. report.

A 145% tariff on Chinese goods, coupled with retaliatory tariffs, could dramatically curtail the region's trade with China, leading to less work across the region's supply chains and threatening foreign investment.</p>

          <p>The Veterans Affairs Department (VA) is instructing staff to report colleagues for instances of “anti-Christian bias” to a newly established taskforce, furthering Donald Trump’s initiative to reshape government policy on religious expression. The VA secretary, Doug Collins, stated in an internal email that the department had launched a taskforce to review the Biden administration’s “treatment of Christians.” The department is seeking instances of anti-Christian discrimination, including informal policies hostile to Christian views and adverse responses to requests for religious exemptions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America, at least temporarily, ruling that the administration's decision to dismantle the agency was "arbitrary and capricious." The judge ordered the Trump administration to return Voice of America employees and contractors to their status before a March 14 executive order suspended their work, also covering Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. The targeted networks deliver information to countries around the world that lack a robust or free press, intended to promote American democratic values.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced that he's scaling back his work at the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), saying the amount of time he spends on the task force will "drop significantly" starting in May. Tesla's sales have taken a hit as the automaker's vehicles have increasingly become a symbol of the Trump administration, repelling some consumers. The stock has also plunged more than 50% from its most recent high in December, when the shares surged after the presidential election. Analysts suggest that Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced that the time he spends with Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will "drop significantly" from May, and he will allocate more time to Tesla. This comes after first-quarter profits at Tesla sank as the company grapples with falling sales, partly due to President Trump's tariffs. The cuts at DOGE, which included axing government jobs, have divided the country and prompted a backlash against his company, including protests and attacks on Tesla showrooms. Tesla said that quarterly profits fell by 71% to $409m (£306.77m) from $1.39bn (£1.04bn) in the first quarter of 2024.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year despite the UK grappling with higher-than-expected inflation. The organization predicted UK inflation would be the highest in the world's advanced economies this year at 3.1%, largely due to higher bills, including for energy and water. The fund also said the UK economy would grow less than previously predicted, up 1.1% in 2025 instead of 1.6%, because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs.</p>

The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control published after U.S. Rep.
