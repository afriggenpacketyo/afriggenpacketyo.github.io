          <p>Israeli ministers have announced the approval of 22 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, marking the most substantial expansion in decades; some settlements already exist as unauthorized outposts and will now be legalized, while others are entirely new. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that this move prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state, while the Palestinian presidency condemned it as a dangerous escalation. Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog, warned that the expansion would dramatically reshape the West Bank and further entrench the occupation, noting that Israel has built approximately 160 settlements housing around 700,000 Jews since occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Court of International Trade stated that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The White House has criticized the ruling and requested the court to block the order suspending tariffs while it appeals the case, and the case could eventually go to the Supreme Court. The ruling was based on two separate cases brought by small businesses and US state governments, challenging Trump's tariffs imposed on most of the US's trading partners.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade has ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs on imported goods illegal, creating uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses. The ruling halts tariffs assessed on virtually every other country, some of which had faced duties as high as 145% on China-produced goods. The Trump administration intends to appeal the ruling, but the president could also seek alternate routes to reimpose the import duties. The ruling provides relief to American businesses and consumers who typically bear the cost of tariffs, but uncertainty remains until the appeal is resolved, although some of Mr. Trump's other tariffs remain in place.</p>

          <p>Economic tensions between the US and China are escalating, particularly in the realm of advanced technology, potentially undermining the recent "Geneva ceasefire." The US Department of Commerce has reportedly instructed American electronic design automation firms to cease supplying their technology to China, while Washington has suspended licenses allowing American companies to sell products and technology to China's state-owned aerospace manufacturer, Comac. These actions are seen as a response to China's export controls on critical minerals, and analysts suggest that US-China frictions are shifting away from tariffs and into more challenging areas of their economic relationship.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's announcement of "aggressively" revoking visas for Chinese students, many applicants in Beijing expressed anxiety and uncertainty about their prospects for studying in the United States. Despite the promise of a world-class education, students are increasingly wary of the perceived lack of openness and diversity in America. The new revocations, targeting those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields, are likely to be far-reaching, although the Chinese government's response has been relatively muted. Some experts suggest China may retaliate in unrelated ways, such as reducing cooperation on fentanyl control or withholding rare earths exports.</p>

          <p>Best Buy has revised its full-year sales and profit guidance downward, citing increased costs from higher tariffs on consumer electronics. The retailer has already raised prices on some items to offset these costs, with changes taking effect by mid-May, although the company declined to specify which items are affected. The company's CEO, Corie Barry, emphasized that price hikes are a last resort after other cost-offsetting measures have been taken, while acknowledging the recent federal trade court decision striking down many of Trump's tariffs and reinforcing the need for the company to remain adaptable. Best Buy's mix of imports has shifted, with China now accounting for 30% to 35% of its merchandise compared to 55% previously.</p>

It also covers a streaming star suspended from Twitch for broadcasting the DC shooting suspect's manifesto, and a Washington Post post that was deleted following the murders of Israeli embassy staffers.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining current federal funds rates, savers are considering whether to invest in short-term or long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) to maximize returns. Short-term CDs are currently offering higher interest rates compared to long-term CDs, making them an attractive option for those seeking the highest yields. However, long-term CDs can still be useful for those seeking a fixed rate for a longer period, though early withdrawal penalties apply. Experts recommend considering personal financial situations and goals before deciding between short-term and long-term CDs, and suggest using a CD ladder strategy to diversify investments across various maturity dates.

The court’s ruling included a detailed discussion of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, concluding that the law does not authorize any of Trump’s tariff orders. The ruling affirms Congress's power over tariffs, as Article I of the Constitution delegates the tariff power to Congress.

          <p>Beijing has criticized the US decision to target Chinese students as "discriminatory," warning that it will further damage America's image on the world stage. The US State Department has announced measures targeting international students, including a freeze on new visa interviews, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio singling out Chinese nationals for visa revocations. China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning stated that the decision harms the lawful rights and interests of Chinese students and disrupts exchanges, exposing the lie of US's so-called freedom and openness.</p>

          <p>The Institute for the Quality of Life released its 2025 Happy City Index, ranking 200 cities based on 82 indicators across six categories: citizens, governance, environment, economy, health, and mobility. The cities were separated into gold, silver, and bronze groups, with gold indicating the highest scores across all metrics. The index included health as a category for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the results showed that most of the cities that were gold cities in the past remained so, indicating sustainable development. No U.S. cities ranked in the top 10, but New York City and Minneapolis received the "gold city" distinction.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is engaged in a legal battle with the Trump administration, which is attempting to strip the school of its ability to enroll international students. A federal judge set a hearing to decide whether to extend an order blocking the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. Harvard argues that its students have become "pawns in the government's escalating campaign of retaliation" and alleges that the SEVP revocation is unlawful because it violates the school's free speech rights. The Trump administration claims the revocation was necessary because Harvard failed to turn over information about international students.</p>

Observers suggest that the decision may be related to ongoing talks to resolve the US-China tariff war, internal reshuffles, and reduced interest in the "Western-centric" security dialogue.</p>

The court decision does block a set of across-the-board tariffs, but the administration could quickly replace them with other measures. The European Commission declined to comment, while Australia said it would “study this ruling,” reflecting the fragile nature of the reprieve.</p>

GHF's Swiss branch does not have the required signatory member of its board resident in Switzerland, that it doesn't have the minimum three board members required by Swiss statutes, and that it did not appear to have a Swiss bank account, a valid Swiss address, or an auditor — all of which are requirements for foundations like GHF which are registered in the country.</p>
