          <p>Air Canada flights are resuming after the airline reached a tentative agreement with its flight attendants' union, ending a four-day strike that stranded over 500,000 passengers. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stated the deal brings "transformational change" for workers, addressing issues like unpaid ground work and seeking immediate pay increases. While the full terms are undisclosed, the union previously criticized Air Canada's initial offer as "below inflation." The breakthrough occurred after government-appointed mediation, with full service expected to take days to restore.</p>

Japan's exports saw their sharpest drop in over four years, contracting 2.6% year-over-year, exceeding economists' forecasts. This weakness, particularly in shipments to the U.S. and mainland China, contributed to broad market falls across Japan, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The economic data indicates potential challenges despite earlier stronger-than-expected GDP growth for Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking from New Mexico, Noem stated the initiative aims to deter illegal immigration, with Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks adding it would also prevent rust. The Trump administration continues to fortify the border, including deploying military personnel and acquiring significant funding for wall completion, emphasizing a hardline immigration policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to extend his anti-“woke” campaign beyond the Smithsonian Institution to museums nationwide, criticizing exhibits for focusing on negative aspects of American history like slavery. He instructed attorneys to initiate a process similar to efforts made with colleges and universities to remove "improper ideology." This follows his earlier executive order targeting the Smithsonian and attempts to influence its leadership, raising concerns among museum professionals about censorship and the potential for historical revisionism.</p>

          <p>The city has postponed the release of its report on the Palisades fire, which killed 12 people and devastated a Westside neighborhood, at the request of the U.S. attorney’s office. The delay aims to prevent interference with a federal investigation into the blaze's cause, focusing on whether a previous fireworks-sparked fire reignited. The decision has drawn criticism from city officials and fire commissioners who seek immediate insights into the Fire Department's response, particularly given warnings about severe winds and the lack of pre-deployed resources.</p>

          <p>A Southern California community is advocating for the release of Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, an 18-year-old high school student detained by ICE agents while walking his dog. His family described the arrest as a "kidnapping," alleging agents treated him like a criminal and let his dog loose.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning against consuming certain raw frozen shrimp sold under the Great Value brand at Walmart stores in 13 states, due to potential Cesium-137 radioactive contamination. While the detected amount would not pose an acute hazard, long-term consumption carries an elevated cancer risk. U.S. Customs and Border Protection initially detected the isotope in a shipment from Indonesia. Walmart has since recalled the affected products, and federal officials are investigating the root cause of the contamination.</p>

          <p>Kayle Bates, 67, was executed in Florida for the 1982 murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, and attempted sexual assault of Janet White. This marks Florida's 10th execution in 2025, setting a new state record for executions in a single year. Bates declined a last meal and final words. His attorneys' appeals, including claims of organic brain damage and discriminatory death warrant processes, were denied by state and U.S. Supreme Courts.

          <p>Three firefighters were injured, one severely, after a hit-and-run driver crashed into a North Carolina veterinary clinic, causing a gas line rupture and subsequent explosion. The incident occurred as firefighters were searching the building. The driver, Jason Lee Beach, 46, was arrested and charged with multiple offenses including felony DWI with serious injury.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following high-level White House meetings, discussions are intensifying around "security guarantees" for Ukraine, a concept with a wide spectrum of interpretations. While NATO membership is currently ruled out, a "Coalition of the Willing" is forming to provide international reassurance post-peace deal. Potential measures include policing Ukrainian airspace from neighboring bases and ensuring Black Sea commercial flow. Land support would likely focus on training and intelligence rather than direct troop deployment, as Russia vehemently opposes any NATO presence. The challenge lies in crafting robust guarantees without provoking further Russian opposition.</p>

          <p>U.S. military veterans are organizing as "Battle Buddies" to support Afghan refugees, including former wartime allies, who face deportation from the U.S. Many Afghans, who assisted American efforts and fled the Taliban, are now vulnerable due to the Trump administration ending protective programs. Veterans view this as a moral obligation, asserting that abandoning allies harms U.S. national security and credibility. They attend court hearings to deter ICE agents, advocating for political asylum and highlighting the dangers Afghans would face if returned to their Taliban-controlled homeland.</p>

          <p>England is grappling with a growing number of empty homes, with nearly 720,000 vacant properties, including 265,000 long-term empty. This contradicts a national housing shortage, rising homelessness, and long social housing waiting lists. Despite past successful government programs to bring these properties back into use, funding cuts in 2016 shifted responsibility solely to local councils, leading to varied and often ineffective approaches. Experts highlight complex reasons for vacancies, like probate delays and untraceable owners, suggesting a need for diverse solutions and renewed national strategy to address this "baffling conundrum."</p>

          <p>North Hollywood's Valley Plaza, once a vibrant 1950s commercial hub, has been approved for demolition by Los Angeles city commissioners after years of neglect and blight. The site, plagued by squatters and crime, was declared a public nuisance, paving the way for the removal of six derelict buildings. While this won't solve broader retail closures, local leaders hope the demolition will attract new development, potentially including residential housing and retail. The owner's attorney blamed the city for permit delays, while city officials criticized the owner's neglect.</p>

          <p>A TV advertisement for Sanex shower gel has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for reinforcing a racial stereotype. The ad depicted black skin as cracked and itchy, followed by white skin appearing smooth and problem-free after using the product. The ASA ruled this could be interpreted as suggesting white skin was superior, despite the brand's claim of promoting diversity. Colgate-Palmolive, Sanex's owner, stated the ad intended to show a "before and after" scenario for different skin types, not to compare ethnicities.</p>

This incident highlights the dire circumstances faced by a large number of Afghans, with over 1.2 million having been returned or forced to return from Iran and Pakistan this year alone due to pressure from Tehran.</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued new COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, strongly advising shots for children aged 6 months to 23 months, and suggesting them for older children at parents' discretion.

The AAP emphasizes its recommendations are "rooted in science" amidst an environment of misinformation, while HHS accuses the AAP of undermining national policymaking and being influenced by commercial interests.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, has launched an investigation into whether Washington, D.C., police falsified crime data. President Trump alleged D.C. created a "false illusion of safety" by manipulating numbers, countering his narrative of widespread lawlessness. While recent data shows a significant decline in violent crime in D.C., tracking a national trend, some internal doubts and a police commander's leave sparked the probe. Critics suggest the investigation is politically motivated, aligning with Trump's broader "takeover" of the city.</p>

While Rangers showed some offensive capability in the second half, pulling one goal back, the article suggests the team is not yet ready for Champions League football.
