        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has dismissed a contempt order against Trump administration officials concerning the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Justice Department, which argued a lower court judge overstepped his authority. The case originated when U.S. District Judge James Boasberg tried to halt the deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, but the planes had already left U.S. airspace. The ruling is a significant legal victory for the administration's immigration policies, though a dissenting judge argued it undermines judicial authority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revoking a 2009 "endangerment finding" that legally underpins the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. This move, part of the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda, would eliminate emissions standards for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. If enacted, the proposal would ease pressure on automakers to produce electric vehicles, allowing them to align production more closely with current consumer demand. While the auto industry is reviewing the proposal, experts note that global competition and long-term product cycles mean immediate, drastic shifts in strategy are unlikely.</p>

          <p>Following a significant 14% drop in Eli Lilly's stock due to disappointing trial results for its obesity pill, Wall Street analysts are urging investors to see the pullback as a buying opportunity. Firms like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have voiced support, calling the sell-off "overdone" and suggesting a "compelling entry point." Despite this defense, the stock continued to fall, indicating that investors remain hesitant to re-enter the market for the pharmaceutical giant. The negative reaction overshadowed an otherwise solid quarterly earnings report, reflecting high market sensitivity to the lucrative obesity drug sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a strong warning against any judicial attempts to block his tariff policies, claiming they are a "huge positive" for the U.S. economy and stock market. In a social media post, he suggested that a court ruling against the tariffs could trigger an economic crisis comparable to the Great Depression of 1929. His comments come as a federal appeals court considers the legality of his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose duties. Despite the president's claims, market data often shows positive reactions when tariff threats are eased, creating uncertainty about their actual economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, under the Trump administration, intends to end the $7 billion "Solar for All" program, which was designed to provide affordable solar energy to over 900,000 low-income households. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the program was repealed by a recent Republican-led spending bill, a claim disputed by program grantees. Opponents argue the move will prevent vulnerable families from accessing lower utility bills and will hinder climate goals, with some preparing for legal challenges. The program's funds had already been allocated to states and organizations to develop rooftop and community solar projects.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists from East Carolina University has potentially discovered the wreck of an 18th-century Spanish privateer, La Fortuna, near the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site. The ship exploded during an attack on the port in 1748. Wood samples suggest the vessel was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was found in 1985. The team also uncovered three other shipwrecks and colonial port infrastructure, providing new insights into the area's maritime history, trade, and military conflicts.</p>

          <p>Nearly 24 years after the September 11th terrorist attacks, New York City's chief medical examiner has identified the remains of three more victims. The individuals are Barbara Keating, 72, and Ryan Fitzgerald, 26, with the third victim's identity withheld at her family's request. This progress, bringing the total number of identified victims to 1,653, is attributed to significant advancements in DNA extraction and testing technology from bone fragments.

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) will take over the investigation into allegations that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. The decision follows calls for transparency, as the force was initially investigating its own former officers. Five women have claimed they were abused by officers while also being exploited by grooming gangs, with one survivor stating she was sexually assaulted in a marked police car. The inquiry will now be managed by Operation Stovewood, the NCA's broader investigation into historical child sexual abuse in the area.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system, inspired by Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, is facing scrutiny for its ambitious scope and strategic rationale. This article argues that the concept is flawed, particularly if it models itself after Israel's Iron Dome, which is designed for short-range rockets, not intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Pentagon has been notably quiet about the project's specifics, leading to speculation that the plan is not yet well-defined. Critics warn that pursuing such a system could be destabilizing, provoking adversaries to build more offensive weapons to overwhelm it, while offering unreliable protection.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the remarkable coincidence of two separate billion-dollar lottery jackpots being won from tickets purchased at Publix grocery stores in Florida beach towns. In January 2016, a couple from Melbourne Beach claimed a share of a historic $1.586 billion Powerball prize. Then, in August 2023, a single ticket sold at a Neptune Beach Publix won a $1.58 billion Mega Millions jackpot, the largest in that game's history. Both winning stores received a $100,000 commission for selling the tickets, highlighting a fascinating and lucky convergence for the Florida-based supermarket chain.</p>

          <p>California's Lieutenant Governor, Eleni Kounalakis, has announced she is withdrawing from the 2026 governor's race and will instead seek the office of state treasurer. Kounalakis, an early entrant into the gubernatorial campaign, stated she believes she can make a greater impact by focusing on the state's financial future. Her exit reshapes the dynamics of the crowded Democratic primary, opening up a significant fundraising lane connected to her deep ties with Bay Area donors. Kounalakis will now enter a competitive race for treasurer against several other established California politicians.</p>

          <p>Gold futures surged to an all-time high after the U.S. announced that certain 1kg and 100-ounce cast gold bars from Switzerland would be subject to a 39% tariff. This move is a significant blow to Switzerland, which is the global hub for gold refining. U.S. Customs and Border Protection clarified that these bars, primarily used to back commodity exchange contracts, are not exempt from the duties. The tariffs make it economically unviable to export these products to the U.S., roiling the precious metals market and driving investors toward the perceived safety of gold amid trade uncertainty.

          <p>Residents of Gaza City are reacting with terror and hopelessness to the Israeli government's announced plan to take full military control of the territory's largest city. Civilians told the BBC they fear the plan will lead to mass death, displacement, and starvation, describing the situation as a "death sentence." Many expressed a feeling of being trapped and abandoned, with some directing anger at Hamas for failing to negotiate an end to the war. The plan, which Israel says is to disarm Hamas and free hostages, has been condemned by the UN human rights chief as a precursor to more suffering and potential atrocity crimes.</p>

          <p>A recent unanimous opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) established that nations have a binding legal obligation to protect the climate system, framing inaction as a potential international crime. This article contrasts the ruling with current U.S. policy, where the EPA is moving to rescind the 2009 endangerment finding that underpins most federal climate regulations. This creates two "completely separate worlds" of legal understanding regarding climate responsibility. The author argues that while the U.S. attempts to abdicate its legal duties, the global trend toward climate accountability, supported by international courts, will likely continue to grow.</p>

The company now projects lower revenue and negative same-store sales growth, citing a "really, really rough quarter." Executives attributed the poor performance to a flawed transition of its loyalty program, weaker consumer spending, tariff impacts, and operational challenges in its restaurants. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss and a 7.6% drop in same-store sales, signaling significant headwinds for the fast-casual brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis article posits that the Israeli government's plan to take over Gaza City will lead to a devastating new phase of the war, inflicting immense suffering on the estimated one million civilians still there. The plan will likely force another mass evacuation into a southern region already obliterated by previous fighting, with little infrastructure left to support displaced populations. The author suggests the fate of Gaza City could mirror that of Rafah, which was systematically destroyed after its civilian population was forced to leave.

          <p>Robert Gordon, the former Michigan health director who oversaw the implementation of the state's Medicaid work requirements in 2020, is warning of the consequences as a new federal law expands the policy nationwide. Despite a $30 million effort to create a robust reporting system, Gordon's team estimated 80,000 people were on track to lose coverage before a court blocked the law. He argues that such policies are administratively wasteful and inevitably cause large numbers of eligible people to lose their health insurance due to bureaucratic hurdles. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the new mandate will leave 4.8 million more people uninsured by 2034.</p>
