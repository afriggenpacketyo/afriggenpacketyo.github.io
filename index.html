          <p>Three large wildfires are burning north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, with the Jenkins Creek Fire believed to be human-caused and the Camp House Road Fire destroying over 150 structures. The Munger Shaw Fire is nearly 100% contained. Interactive maps from the National Interagency Fire Center show the spread of these fires. Donations are being accepted through the Head of the Lakes United Way and the United Way Northeastern Minnesota to support relief efforts for affected community members in Lake and St. Louis Counties. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was caused by human activity, although the investigation is still ongoing, which is troubling given the damage and displacement caused by the blaze.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is defending the House budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," despite a Congressional Budget Office analysis suggesting it could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade.

Republican senators have expressed concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit and are planning to propose changes.

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts are questioning the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines that recommend against routine screening for men over 70. While the USPSTF advises men aged 55 to 69 to discuss the potential benefits and risks of PSA screening with their doctor, Dr. Marc Siegel argues that all men over 45 should be screened, regardless of age. Dr. Shawn Dason notes the importance of individual discussions with healthcare providers about the risks of over-treatment versus the potential benefits of early detection. The discussion is centered on the importance of patients making informed decisions about their health.</p>

          <p>Following the renationalisation of South Western Railway (SWR), the Labour government admits it cannot guarantee cheaper train tickets, despite the move being hailed as a "new dawn for rail." Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that the day-to-day running of trains is already heavily subsidised by taxpayers, with Â£2bn spent annually. Instead, the focus will be on improving services and infrastructure, raising questions from the public about the purpose of renationalisation if prices remain high. The government hopes to find ways to cut rail travel costs but cannot make promises before Great British Railways (GBR) is formally established.</p>

Experts suggest the administration's actions represent a brazen use of government office, eclipsing previous scandals, and the normalization of such activities is eroding ethical boundaries in Washington.

Some emphasize the value of cash when technology fails, citing instances where ATMs were out of service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservationists are advocating for a shift towards directly protecting ecosystems, rather than solely focusing on individual species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This approach aims to protect larger structural features and dynamic systems, especially as climate change prompts species to move. While the ESA has been effective, its focus on saving the most imperiled species is costly and reactive. A native ecosystem-protection act could ensure sufficient area is protected for each type of American ecosystem, fostering a more proactive and comprehensive approach to conservation.</p>

          <p>A guest essay argues that a recent Supreme Court order has granted President Trump additional power by blessing some or all of his firings of high-level officials. The author contends that the court's decision effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument. This action, along with other decisions, raises concerns about the court enabling the consolidation of power in the presidency and undermining the rule of law. The author suggests that the court's actions may embolden the administration to act outside of traditional constitutional order.</p>

          <p>An expert outlines a new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting," which emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, and fostering trust through open communication. Unlike authoritative or gentle parenting, this approach focuses on emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing for parents. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, view challenging behavior as a signal for support, and take responsibility after conflicts. The goal is to create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves and big emotions.</p>

The shift in US policy has undercut Israel's efforts to prevent the rise of an anti-Israel neighbor, causing Israel to reassess its approach and potentially seek dialogue with the Syrian regime.
