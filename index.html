            <p>Two Petaluma mothers, Elena Kaljian and Kate Greenspan, are collaborating to open the Art Play Cafe in downtown Petaluma, repurposing the former Roaring Donkey bar, which was shut down due to frequent disturbances. Kaljian, a barista and mother, envisioned a family-friendly space where parents and children can gather comfortably, while Greenspan, who runs a mobile art play business, sought a brick-and-mortar location. The Art Play Cafe will offer coffee, food, and art activities for kids, transforming a once rowdy saloon into a welcoming community hub for families. The cafe is expected to open in June, and the partners plan to host an informal open house during Petaluma's annual Butter and Egg Days Parade. </p>

            <p>Jury selection has concluded in the second murder trial of Karen Read, who is accused of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of a deadly accident in connection with the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in January 2022. Read maintains her innocence, arguing that O'Keefe may have been killed inside a house and then moved outside, where he succumbed to head trauma and hypothermia. The first trial ended in a hung jury after the defense raised concerns about the investigation and a conflict of interest involving a former state trooper, Michael Proctor, who was later fired for sending inappropriate text messages about Read. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks, and Read faces a potential life sentence if convicted.</p>

            <p>During Meta's antitrust trial with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an email from 2018 revealed that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning off Instagram due to rising antitrust litigation concerns against Facebook.

Meta disputes these allegations, claiming the FTC mischaracterizes the competitive landscape and fails to acknowledge rivals like TikTok and Apple's iMessage.

            <p>Former President Barack Obama has praised Harvard University for rejecting demands from the Trump administration, which he called an "unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom." Obama's statement followed Harvard's refusal to comply with a series of demands from the Trump administration related to combating antisemitism on campus, which led to a multibillion-dollar funding freeze. Trump has called for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status, while Obama has urged universities to stand up to intimidation and defend academic freedom. The White House insists Harvard must follow federal law and apologize for alleged antisemitism on campus.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's recent actions, particularly his dismissive treatment of a court order regarding a wrongly deported man, reveal an authoritarian political performance, drawing parallels to strongmen like El Salvador's Nayib Bukele and Hungary's Viktor Orbán. While Bukele employs violent and overt tactics, Orbán utilizes subtle legal manipulations to undermine democracy while maintaining its facade. Trump's administration appears to be blending both approaches, potentially inflaming resistance to his policies and ultimately hindering his goals. The article argues that Trump lacks the core strengths of both leaders, facing legal checks and lacking the public support to fully embrace either authoritarian style.</p>
