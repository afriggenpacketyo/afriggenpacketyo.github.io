          <p>A New Yorker, known as "Streeter," earns over six figures annually by reporting vehicles idling illegally in the city.  New York City's law prohibits idling for more than three minutes, but enforcement is lax, creating an opportunity for citizens to report violations and receive a portion of the fines.  This program has generated nearly $70 million for the city, but has also drawn criticism from the trucking industry, which argues the law is overly burdensome and doesn't account for the complexities of truck operation in New York City.</p>
