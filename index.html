          <p>Mark Knoller, a revered CBS News correspondent known as the unofficial historian of the White House, has passed away at the age of 73. For decades, he meticulously documented presidential activities, creating a comprehensive personal database of travel, speeches, and daily actions that he generously shared with colleagues and historians. Knoller covered eight presidential administrations, earning numerous awards and later reinventing himself as a prolific presence on Twitter, sharing his vast knowledge with a wide public audience. His colleagues remember him for his encyclopedic knowledge, kindness, and unwavering dedication to journalism.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has revealed that he recently underwent surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer. The 58-year-old shared photos on Instagram showing a large bandage and subsequent stitches on the side of his jaw, using the experience to issue a public health warning. Ramsay urged his millions of followers to remember to use sunscreen, humorously noting that the procedure was not a facelift.

          <p>The Irish government has formally expressed concern to German authorities after a 25-year-old Irish citizen was struck by police during a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Berlin. Video footage shows Kitty O'Brien being hit in the face, and an activist group claims she later required surgery for a broken arm. Berlin police state that force was used after protesters, at an unregistered event, ignored orders to disperse and became agitated. The incident has prompted an internal police review to assess the proportionality of the officers' actions and has sparked protests at the German Embassy in Dublin.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order seeks to prohibit federal agents from wearing masks, require them to display identifying information, and bars city departments from participating in federal actions that could violate rights to peacefully assemble. Johnson stated the city has not requested federal intervention but is preparing a response based on credible reports of imminent deployment. The White House criticized the move as a publicity stunt, while Illinois Governor JB Pritzker called the potential deployment an "invasion."</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has identified the remains of Idan Shtivi, a 28-year-old hostage, who was recovered from Gaza during a recent operation. Shtivi was kidnapped from the Nova music festival during the October 7th attack and had been held for 693 days. This announcement follows the recovery of another hostage, Ilan Weiss, from the same operation. With this news, 48 hostages are now believed to remain in Gaza, prompting renewed rallies from families demanding a ceasefire deal to secure the return of all captives as Israel's military offensive in Gaza City continues.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has implicated famed sheriff Buford Pusser in the 1967 murder of his wife, Pauline, an event that inspired the movie "Walking Tall." Previously believed to be the victim of an ambush meant for her husband, new forensic evidence suggests Pauline was shot outside their vehicle before being placed inside. Investigators found inconsistencies in Pusser's original account, and analysis indicates a gunshot wound he sustained was likely self-inflicted. The case, reopened decades later, aims to provide closure for Pauline's family, who expressed devastation but not surprise at the findings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America (VOA), has announced the elimination of over 500 employee positions, a move directed by the Trump administration. The decision, announced by acting CEO Kari Lake, comes despite a federal judge recently blocking her from removing the VOA director and ordering her to be deposed. Employee groups have called the layoffs an "abhorrent" attack on the agency and are continuing their legal fight, arguing the administration is not following the required congressional review process. The cuts are seen by critics as a significant blow to the mission of the government-funded international broadcaster.</p>

Rahawi, who held the post since 2024, was considered more of a figurehead than a key military decision-maker. The strike is part of Israel's response to ongoing Houthi attacks on commercial shipping and missile launches toward Israel, which the group claims are in solidarity with Palestinians.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on most countries are illegal, stating he overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The decision puts levies affecting a large portion of U.S. goods imports on uncertain legal ground, though it does not impact sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum. The court has stayed the ruling until October 14 to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. If the ruling stands, it would significantly curtail the president's ability to unilaterally impose broad tariffs on global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly during a family golf outing, putting an end to viral social media rumors about his death. The hashtags "Trump Is Dead" and "Where Is Trump?" trended after recent comments from J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in should a tragedy occur, which fueled speculation. Trump, 79, was photographed at the White House before heading to his Virginia golf course. This appearance also follows recent public concern over his health after photos showed bruising on his hand, which his physician attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

This novel creation pays homage to Hamburg's local food culture by combining two beloved local products.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that a direct bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is unlikely to happen soon. However, Trump did state that a trilateral meeting involving the U.S. "will happen" at some point. In the same interview, he also suggested a willingness to use U.S. aircraft as part of a security guarantee to help end the war in Ukraine. This development comes as a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of expedited removal for immigrants, dealing a setback to his deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. Investigations traced the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters of the disease.</p>

He claims he can now earn as much as $5 million in a single week, attributing the acceleration to the principle of compound growth once a certain threshold is passed. Since reacquiring Barstool from Penn Entertainment for $1, Portnoy has expanded the brand's visibility, notably through a new content deal with Fox Sports for its college football coverage.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three common heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. A UK-based study involving over 200 GP surgeries showed the device significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope analyzes subtle heart sounds and electrical signals that are undetectable by the human ear, sending data to the cloud for instant analysis. This innovation is being hailed as a potential game-changer for early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive treatment sooner and improve outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, offers a polished and well-crafted take on the 1984 Troma cult classic. While maintaining the original's gore and goofy parody, this version replaces the low-budget trashiness with higher production values and a more sincere emotional core. Dinklage plays a janitor who, after being exposed to toxic waste, becomes a mutant hero fighting a villainous corporation run by a CEO played by Kevin Bacon. The film functions as a diverting homage that pokes fun at superhero tropes but may lack the offensive, outsider charm that defined the original.</p>
