          <p>Despite continued state repression, Iranian women are increasingly resisting mandatory hijab laws following the death of Jina Mahsa Amini in 2022, which sparked widespread protests. Women are increasingly appearing in public without headscarves and challenging traditional norms, such as women carrying coffins at funerals. Activists argue that the state lacks the power to reverse these changes, despite ongoing debates and attempts to enforce stricter measures through controversial new laws. The article highlights the ongoing struggle for women's rights and the limitations of the Iranian government's ability to control personal freedoms.</p>

          <p>President Trump pressured House Republicans to unify around a sweeping budget bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," aimed at advancing his domestic agenda. The New York Times article details the intense negotiations and internal rifts among Republicans, with various factions demanding changes related to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions (SALT), and overall spending levels. Despite Trump's efforts to rally support and Speaker Johnson's attempts to broker compromises, significant divisions remain, threatening the bill's passage. The article underscores the challenges of balancing competing interests within the Republican party while adhering to Trump's policy priorities.</p>

          <p>Four British former special forces soldiers have made history by climbing Mount Everest in under five days without acclimatizing on the mountain, using a controversial method aided by xenon gas. The team, including a UK government minister, pre-acclimatized to low oxygen levels at high altitudes using xenon, enabling a significantly faster ascent compared to the typical six to eight weeks. While the science behind xenon's effectiveness is disputed, the expedition's organizer claims it helps protect the body from altitude sickness. This record ascent has drawn criticism from some in the mountaineering industry, who question the reliance on artificial aids.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK inflation rate has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest in more than a year, primarily driven by increases in household bills such as water, gas, and electricity. This rise exceeds economists' expectations and pushes inflation further above the Bank of England's 2% target. The BBC article notes that the rise in employer National Insurance contributions and higher minimum wage also contributed to the increased costs for firms. Economists are now reconsidering the likelihood of multiple interest rate cuts this year in light of the higher-than-expected inflation figure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury yields increased on Wednesday as investors grew concerned that a new U.S. tax bill could exacerbate the country's deficit following a Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. The CNBC article notes that discussions around President Trump's budget bill, particularly regarding state and local tax deductions, have raised alarms about the potential impact on the government's deficit. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates warned that Moody's downgrade understates credit risks by not considering the possibility of the government printing money to pay its debt. This situation highlights ongoing concerns about the U.S. fiscal outlook and its potential effects on the bond market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of illegal immigrants deported to South Sudan, ensuring their return if the removals are deemed unlawful. The ruling follows accusations that the administration illegally deported immigrants from Myanmar and Vietnam, violating a court order that mandates a "meaningful opportunity" to establish the safety of third-country deportations. The judge has demanded information about the deported immigrants, including when they learned of their removal and the opportunity to raise fear-based claims.

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Middle East has been marked by leveraging the American private sector as an instrument of national power and navigating regional politics with less constraint from domestic concerns. The Atlantic article suggests that Trump's focus on commercial partnerships and his willingness to engage with various actors, including those traditionally at odds with the U.S., have been successful in some respects. By prioritizing economic interests and avoiding lectures on internal affairs, Trump has resonated with Gulf states seeking to diversify their economies. However, the article cautions that Trump must balance economic gains with other American interests and maintain conditions that make the U.S. an attractive investment destination.</p>

          <p>Despite cultivating close ties with right-wing populist leaders worldwide, President Trump's recent foreign policy actions have left many of his allies frustrated. The Vox article highlights instances where Trump has seemingly prioritized transactional gains over political affinity, such as engaging in direct negotiations with Hamas and criticizing Apple's move to India. Even leaders like Israel's Netanyahu and Hungary's Orbán have faced unexpected challenges in their relationships with the Trump administration. This suggests that Trump's foreign policy is driven more by immediate deals and personal interests than ideological alignment.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has backed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission should be required. The BBC article explains that the ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public a right of access for open-air recreation, including camping. This decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights.

          <p>China has criticized the U.S. plan to build a new missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," warning that it could escalate the risk of an arms race and militarize outer space. The South China Morning Post reports that the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman stated the system would entail a "significant increase in outer space combat means." China views the U.S. as "obsessed with pursuing absolute security," violating the principle of undiminished security for all countries and undermining global stability.</p>

This New York Times article explains how the buying and selling of government debt, known as Treasuries, also influences interest rates on a wide variety of debt extended to American households and businesses, including mortgages, credit cards and car loans. Then this week’s attempt to push through sweeping tax cuts without significantly slashing spending set off a fresh bout of bond market turmoil. American bonds “are the best buy in the world,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House on Monday. He added that they would become an “even better buy once all of our policies are in place.”</p>
