          <p>Congressional Democrats are making healthcare provisions a central demand in negotiations to avert a government shutdown. Leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries insist on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits, which, if expired, could cause a 75% average premium increase. Democrats also seek to reverse Medicaid cuts, setting up a contentious policy battle with Republicans who appear unwilling to compromise. With the September 30 funding deadline approaching, a stopgap measure seems likely, but even that faces significant hurdles.</p>

          <p>Venezuela has accused the United States of illegally detaining one of its fishing boats for eight hours in its exclusive economic zone. The incident involved the USS Jason Dunham destroyer and occurred amidst heightened U.S. military patrols targeting drug cartels in the Caribbean. Caracas labeled the seizure a "direct provocation" aimed at escalating conflict and regime change, demanding an immediate cessation of such actions. Tensions between the two nations have been rising, particularly after the U.S. doubled its bounty for Venezuelan leader Maduro.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly drafted a proposal to deploy 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops to conduct law enforcement operations in the state's urban centers. Citing military planning documents, the article indicates the plan aims to supplement local police, particularly in cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge, which have majority Black populations. Critics view the deployment as a political stunt rather than a serious crime-fighting effort, raising legal concerns and fueling protests. The Pentagon has not confirmed the plans, stating leaked documents should not be interpreted as policy.</p>

Inscriptions found on bullet casings, including "Hey fascist! Catch!", are being analyzed, though a motive has not yet been officially determined for this "targeted attack."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated his readiness to impose significant sanctions on Russia, contingent on NATO nations agreeing to and implementing similar measures, specifically stopping all purchases of Russian oil. He described current oil purchases as "shocking" and suggested imposing heavy tariffs on China to weaken its influence over Russia. Trump's proposal comes amid heightened tensions following Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace and ongoing conflict in Ukraine. European reliance on Russian energy has already significantly decreased, but Trump advocates for a faster and more complete cessation.</p>

The move aims to allow refugees to support themselves and stimulate the local economy, a decision welcomed by the UN Refugee Agency.

          <h2>Economist Warns of "Gigantic Price Bubble" and Negative Stock Returns</h2>

          <p>Famed economist David Rosenberg, known for predicting the 2008 recession, is warning investors about a "gigantic price bubble" in the stock market, forecasting negative S&P 500 returns. He highlights the Shiller CAPE ratio, currently at its third-highest level ever, as a reliable predictor of weak long-term market performance. Rosenberg's analysis suggests that when valuations reach such historical extremes, one-year forward returns have consistently been negative. This warning comes as recession risks are also reportedly rising due to a slowing labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nepal's eight major political parties have collectively demanded that President Ram Chandra Poudel reinstate the parliament, which he dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests. The parties argue that the president's action, taken on the recommendation of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki, was unconstitutional. The dissolution was a key demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement, which saw over 50 fatalities in clashes with police. While the president urges restraint and new elections, the parties insist that public demands should be addressed through a people-voted institution.</p>

          <p>Illinois lawmakers and local officials are demanding a full investigation into the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during a traffic stop. The incident, which occurred near a school, is being condemned as "inevitable violence" stemming from the Trump administration's deportation campaign. ICE claims Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged an officer, but surveillance videos show agents breaking into his car after a crash. Critics highlight a previous settlement requiring ICE policy changes on warrantless arrests, questioning the agency's conduct and demanding transparency and accountability.</p>

Romania, a NATO and EU member, has experienced repeated Russian drone fragments falling on its territory, leading to a new law enabling the army to shoot down illegally breaching drones, though enforcement rules are pending.</p>

While proponents see it as a crucial step to regulate fast-moving technology and prevent mass casualty events, critics argue it could stifle innovation and create unnecessary compliance costs.
