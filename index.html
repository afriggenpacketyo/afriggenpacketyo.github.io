          <p>Elon Musk indicated he would reduce his involvement with the federal government, though he would continue to advocate for lower tariffs. He acknowledged the limits of his influence on President Trump, a shift from earlier when Musk held significant sway in Washington, driving government changes and drawing varied reactions from different political factions. This change reflects a more subdued approach from Musk, who previously held considerable power in Washington.</p>

          <p>The FBI reported that online scams cost victims a record $16.6 billion in 2024, a 33% increase from the previous year, with investment scams being the top cause of loss. The report highlights that people over 60 were the most frequently targeted and suffered the highest average losses, often through cryptocurrency-related schemes.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight synthetic food dyes from the American food supply, citing potential links to behavioral changes and cancer in animals. HHS and the FDA aim to revoke authorization for certain dyes and work with manufacturers to eliminate the remaining ones, replacing them with natural alternatives. Experts are divided on the safety of synthetic dyes, with some advocating for their removal and others calling for more research.</p>
