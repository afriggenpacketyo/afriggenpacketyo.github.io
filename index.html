          <p>During Karen Read's murder trial, the mother of slain Boston police officer John O'Keefe conveyed a powerful, silent message to the defendant through her courtroom demeanor. A body language expert noted Peggy O'Keefe's intense gaze towards Read, interpreting it as a sign of distrust and belief in Read's guilt in O'Keefe's death. Meanwhile, Read's father has been actively engaging with supporters and the press, presenting a stark contrast to O'Keefe's mother's behavior. The expert noted that Read's father's demeanor reflects his confidence in the case, with both parents showing solidarity with their children throughout the trial.</p>

Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. began selling the rice at a reduced price, leading to high demand and quick sell-outs. The government's effort aims to lower soaring rice prices affecting households, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 being offered through direct contracts with retailers.

          <p>CPAC, the US Conservative Political Action Conference, held large gatherings in Poland and Hungary, signaling a push by US-backed conservatives to gain mainstream acceptance in Europe. Speakers at the conferences, including Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, criticized the European Union's Green Deal, mass immigration, and "gender and woke madness." In Warsaw, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem emphasized the importance of electing leaders who will work with President Trump.

          <p>President Trump's tax bill includes a plan to impose a tax on remittances leaving the US, raising concerns about the impact on migrants and their families, particularly in Africa. The tax, initially proposed at 5% and later reduced to 3.5%, could significantly affect African economies that rely on remittances as a major source of income. Experts warn that the levy may drive migrants to use unofficial channels to send money, potentially reducing the overall flow of recorded remittances. The proposed tax has drawn criticism for its potential to harm lower-income groups who depend on financial support from relatives abroad. (not investment advice)</p>
