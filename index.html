          <p>University of Chicago professor Robert Pape suggests that the US could revitalize its "rust-belt" cities by adopting China's "Wuhan model" of integrating university research with private industry in second-tier cities. Following a 10-day trip to China, Pape highlighted how cities like Wuhan have become advanced manufacturing clusters, offering a potential blueprint for economic renewal and stabilizing US-China relations. This proposal comes amid a temporary de-escalation in the trade war, pointing to potential avenues for constructive superpower collaboration.</p>

In Plainfield, a 79-year-old man and a 25-year-old man were killed when a tree fell on their car, leading the city to declare a state of emergency. Mayor Adrian O.

          <p>President Trump stated he was "very disappointed" after a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, admitting he "didn't make any progress" on resolving the war in Ukraine. The call occurred shortly after the White House announced a halt on some weapons shipments to Ukraine due to concerns over dwindling US military stockpiles. Despite the lack of progress with Putin, Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss strengthening Ukraine's air defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to form a new left-wing political party in the UK, following ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana's announcement that she was co-founding it with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's "principled decision" and stated the new party would offer a "real alternative" to the current political system. This move aims to formalize an alliance of independent pro-Gaza MPs into a party that could contest local elections, reflecting a growing appetite for an alternative to the main Labour and Conservative parties.</p>

This development contrasts with Governor Hochul's 2021 vow that her administration would never be described as a "toxic work environment."</p>

          <p>At least 29 people, including nine police officers, were injured after a massive explosion at a petrol station in Rome's Prenestino neighborhood. The blast occurred after a tanker truck reportedly hit a pipe, causing a gas leak and an initial, smaller explosion that emergency services were already responding to. A subsequent, much larger fireball caused widespread damage to nearby buildings and vehicles, with Rome's mayor stating that a timely evacuation of the area prevented a "much more serious tragedy."</p>

          <p>A proposed 25% budget cut for NASA under the Trump administration is being called an "extinction-level event" that jeopardizes America's leadership in space exploration. The cuts would be particularly devastating to the Science Mission Directorate, which is developing the Habitable Worlds Observatory, a telescope designed specifically to find signs of life on distant planets. Critics warn the funding crisis will force the cancellation of numerous missions, lead to a massive loss of skilled personnel, and cede the search for extraterrestrial life to other nations like China.

          <p>A prominent Chinese academic has stated that for a potential summit between President Trump and Chinese leadership to be successful, the US must first clarify its position on Taiwan. Wu Xinbo, a dean at Fudan University, asserted that Trump should explicitly state that the US does not support Taiwan's independence, a position he argues is consistent with past US policy. This demand for clarity from Beijing highlights the extreme sensitivity of the Taiwan issue and sets a key precondition for any high-level diplomatic engagement between the two superpowers.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease has shared five types of food he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, and deep-fried foods prepared in industrial oils that fuel inflammation, recommending healthier, home-prepared alternatives instead.</p>

Homeowners should consider if they have valuable items that would be expensive to replace, and whether the time saved by outsourcing is worth the price. It's also important to assess the value of "peace of mind" and reduced stress, while ensuring the expense does not jeopardize long-term financial goals or force one into debt.

          <p>Two new books offer a refreshing perspective on the female body, advocating for a shift from aesthetic obsession to an appreciation for functionality. Casey Johnston's memoir on weightlifting, "A Physical Education," and a biography of fashion designer Claire McCardell both champion a philosophy that sees "women as doers." This approach encourages valuing bodies for what they can accomplish—from lifting heavy objects to moving comfortably in practical clothing with pockets—rather than how they appear, presenting a powerful alternative to restrictive beauty standards.</p>

The proposed new trade organization could partner with blocs like the CPTPP to liberalize trade and create new rules, isolating US protectionism and countering China's market-distorting practices.

          <p>A cross-cultural study has identified six personality traits consistently associated with people perceived as "cool." Researchers found that across a dozen countries, individuals considered cool tend to be more extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open to new experiences, and autonomous. The study distinguishes these traits from those of a "good" person, which include conscientiousness and traditionalism, suggesting that coolness is more about pushing boundaries and sparking change. The findings indicate that the concept of "cool" represents a fundamental human admiration for innovation and non-conformity.</p>
