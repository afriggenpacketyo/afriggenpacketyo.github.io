            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries, excluding China, where tariffs were raised to 125%. He stated that countries not retaliating against US tariffs would receive a reprieve, facing a 10% blanket tariff until July. Trump attributed the pause to concerns about countries "jumping a little bit out of line." This decision follows days of insisting on an aggressive trade strategy. The move has been interpreted as both a strategic retreat and a negotiating tactic. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The United States and Panama have signed a new security pact aimed at reinforcing control over the Panama Canal, driven by concerns over China's growing influence in the region. The agreement reaffirms Panamanian sovereignty while establishing a cost-sharing model for services provided to U.S. warships, aiming for cost neutrality. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated a broader framework is in development to guarantee U.S. warships priority passage through the canal. Despite this, the Panamanian President denies China controls the canal.</p>

            <p>President Trump directed the Justice Department to investigate Kirstjen Nielsen, former Homeland Security Secretary, and Christopher Krebs, former election security director, both of whom have become critical of his administration.

The delay risks undermining President Trump's agenda, as the Senate-passed blueprint is necessary to meet his calls for action. Johnson is exploring options to sway the holdouts, including amending the Senate bill or going to conference.</p>

            <p>A group of MPs in the UK is proposing a levy on streaming services to support the British TV production industry. The Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee suggests that streaming companies pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to finance dramas of specific interest to British audiences. Concerns have been raised that a levy could damage streamers' investment in the UK and raise costs for businesses. The report highlights a decline in domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK.</p>

            <p>A Delaware judge has ruled that Newsmax broadcast false and defamatory claims about Dominion Voting Systems' role in the 2020 election. The judge stated that Dominion presented clear evidence that Newsmax aired inaccurate information that would negatively impact viewers' perception of the company. A jury will decide on damages and whether the broadcasts were aired with "actual malice." This ruling follows a similar defamation lawsuit against Fox News, which resulted in a $787.5 million settlement.</p>

The move fuels speculation about increasing technological decoupling between the US and China. Microsoft has not publicly explained the reason for the suspensions. BGI Group has been a target of US authorities, with several subsidiaries added to the Commerce Department's trade blacklist.</p>

The bill now heads to the Senate. The legislation aims to address concerns about judicial overreach and partisan activism.</p>
