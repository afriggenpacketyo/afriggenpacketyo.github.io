          <p>European leaders, including those from Poland, the UK, France, and Germany, convened in Kyiv to pressure Russia into agreeing to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, which is set to begin on Monday. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of this ceasefire for reconnecting Ukraine's economy and reuniting families, while French President Emmanuel Macron indicated that the US would monitor the truce, with coordinated sanctions prepared in case of violations. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz condemned Russia's actions as a war of aggression, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed the need for real and lasting security guarantees. The meeting was a symbolic response to a gathering in Moscow a day earlier, and Russia has so far insisted on halting Western military aid to Ukraine before considering a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years, splashing down in the Indian Ocean. The spacecraft became stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket booster malfunction, serving as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program. The program achieved several milestones, including the first probes to enter another planet's atmosphere and transmit images from Venus's surface. The re-entry highlights the increasing frequency of objects falling from the sky as space activities grow, and despite the challenges, the Soviet Union's Venus exploration remains a point of pride.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee was felt across several southern states, including Georgia and North Carolina, on Saturday morning. While no injuries or major damage were immediately reported, the event served as a reminder of the region's earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid and Eastern Tennessee seismic zones. The USGS received over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour after the earthquake. Experts noted that seismic waves travel more efficiently in the eastern US, causing earthquakes to be felt over a larger area.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent leads the U.S. delegation, while Vice Premier He Lifeng represents China, and Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed hope that the talks would benefit the world economy.

          <p>A bronze sculpture depicting the attempted assassination attempt on President Donald Trump in Butler, PA, last year has been displayed in the Oval Office. The sculpture captures the moment when then-candidate Trump was pulled off stage by Secret Service agents after shots were fired. The image became a symbol of Trump's resilience and bravery during the 2024 presidential election. The sculpture is believed to be a maquette of a larger statue planned by artist Stan Watts, intended to immortalize the event and its symbolism.</p>

This settlement brings the total compensation for Hadden's crimes to nearly $1 billion, raising questions about how he was able to abuse patients for over two decades. Victims accuse the institutions of protecting a serial predator instead of their patients.

Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week" concept, and how he valued gut feeling over market research. He argues that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea, and that simple human instinct is crucial. Diller shares anecdotes about greenlighting projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which became highly successful despite lacking perfect scripts or extensive data backing.</p>

          <p>Police in the UK are questioning four Iranian men arrested on suspicion of preparing a terrorist act, with their detention extended until May 17. The Metropolitan Police stated that officers are searching addresses in Greater Manchester, London, and Swindon as part of the investigation. While police have not confirmed the specific target, it is believed to be the Israeli embassy in London. In a separate investigation, three other Iranian men were arrested under the National Security Act, though police are not linking the two cases.</p>

However, Indian officials disputed that the U.S. mediated the agreement. Tensions have been high following an attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants, leading to retaliatory strikes by both sides.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers, once a dominant force in the diet industry, has filed for bankruptcy after losing over a million members, struggling to compete with the popularity of weight loss injections like Mounjaro and social media influencers. The company, which has stressed that it is not going out of business, attributes points to food and drink, stating that it uses a "groundbreaking algorithm" to assess their nutritional makeup and then uses a point system to inform its members which food is better to eat. Weight loss injections mimic a hormone that suppresses appetite, and some experts are concerned about the long-term effects of these medications. This shift reflects a broader trend towards a more holistic approach to wellbeing.</p>
