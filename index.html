          <p>The dating intelligence app 'Tea', which promoted itself as a safe space for women to share information about men, has experienced a significant data breach. Hackers leaked highly sensitive user data, including driver's licenses, private messages, and selfies, which was then circulated on the internet forum 4chan. This incident has exposed the personal information of its users and sparked a debate about the inherent risks of digital "whisper networks," which gained popularity during the Me Too movement. The company now faces class-action lawsuits, and the breach highlights the potential for such platforms, intended for safety, to become sources of harm and privacy violations for their users.</p>

          <p>England's Charley Hull has positioned herself as a strong contender for the Women's Open title, sitting just three shots behind leader Miyu Yamashita of Japan after a stellar third round. Hull shot an impressive six-under-par 66 at Royal Porthcawl, moving into a tie for fourth place. Yamashita, who held a larger lead earlier, struggled with a two-over 74, narrowing her advantage to a single stroke over South Korea's A Lim Kim. With unpredictable weather forecasted for the final day, the tournament is poised for a dramatic conclusion as multiple players remain within striking distance of the lead.</p>

          <p>Reigning 100-meter world champion Sha’Carri Richardson was arrested for an alleged domestic violence incident involving her boyfriend, sprinter Christian Coleman, at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. According to the police report, airport security footage showed Richardson grabbing Coleman's backpack and shoving him into a wall. The incident, which occurred just days before she competed at the U.S. track and field championships, resulted in her being booked on a fourth-degree domestic violence offense. The report noted that Coleman declined to participate further in the investigation, and USA Track & Field has stated it is aware of the reports but is not commenting on the matter.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for their news, favoring short, algorithm-driven videos over traditional media outlets. According to a Pew Research Center poll, 39% of adults under 30 regularly get news from the app, often from "newsfluencers" like Aaron Parnas rather than established news organizations. This trend is driven by convenience and a preference for simplified, entertaining content, from rapid-fire updates to news-related skits and memes. While critics raise concerns about misinformation and the platform's Chinese ownership, users often trust crowdsourced fact-checking in the comments, signaling a fundamental shift in media consumption habits.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted President Trump's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border, ruling that the administration cannot bypass laws protecting migrants from deportation to countries where they face torture or persecution. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel determined that while the administration can continue to deny access to the standard asylum system, it must still process claims for other mandatory humanitarian protections like "withholding of removal." This decision modifies a lower court's complete block of the policy, creating a complex legal situation where some protections are upheld while the broader asylum ban remains partially in effect pending further legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting raids in the Los Angeles area based primarily on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that such practices, which led to widespread protests, likely violate the Constitution's protection against unreasonable searches. The ruling requires agents to have reasonable suspicion that an individual is in the country illegally before detaining them. This decision is a significant setback for the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics and was hailed by advocates as a protection of civil rights for the region's diverse communities.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton described his own performance as "just useless" after a disappointing qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he finished 12th.

This continues a trend of qualifying difficulties for Hamilton in the 2025 season. Despite his personal frustration, Hamilton congratulated Leclerc and the team, acknowledging the car's capability and highlighting the unexpected nature of his teammate's success, which was attributed to changing weather conditions that favored Ferrari.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a turbulent week, ending on a four-day losing streak after the S&P 500 had reached a record high.

This, combined with new tariff announcements, hotter-than-expected inflation data, and mixed earnings from tech giants like Amazon, contributed to significant market volatility.

          <p>A new study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that aligning your fitness routine with your personality type could lead to greater enjoyment and adherence. The research found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group workouts like HIIT or team sports, while conscientious individuals enjoy goal-oriented activities such as marathon training. People prone to anxiety may benefit more from private, one-on-one sessions, whereas introverts gravitate toward solo exercises like running or at-home yoga. The findings suggest that instead of forcing a particular workout style, individuals may find more success by choosing activities that naturally fit their disposition.</p>

          <p>Following the recent passing of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner at age 54, this article reflects on his iconic and nuanced role as Theo Huxtable on 'The Cosby Show.' Warner skillfully portrayed Theo not as a simple slacker, but as a complex teenager whose journey from apathy to purpose was central to the series. The character's eventual diagnosis with dyslexia reframed his academic struggles, allowing him to find his calling in mentoring other children with similar challenges. Warner's performance gave depth and vulnerability to Theo, creating a character arc that was about more than just academic success, but about finding one's identity.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of a jobs report that showed a sharp slowdown in hiring. The July report indicated only 73,000 new jobs were added, far below expectations, and included a steep downward revision for the previous two months. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes. The move was swiftly condemned by economists and some lawmakers as an unprecedented politicization of a vital, nonpartisan federal agency, warning it could undermine the integrity of U.S. economic data.</p>

The soldiers also discovered equipment for prolonged stays within the tunnel network. This development occurred after a period of intense operations by Israel's Givati Brigade in the area, which had been a threat to nearby Israeli communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after a weak jobs report has drawn condemnation from senior members of his own party. Republican senators, including Cynthia Lummis and Thom Tillis, expressed concern that the move appears to be a punitive reaction to unfavorable but accurate data, which could undermine public trust in government statistics. The firing, which Trump defended by making unsubstantiated claims of rigged numbers, has been described by critics as a dangerous precedent that politicizes a critical and independent federal agency.</p>

          <p>A new memoir by Stephen Starring Grant, who became a rural mail carrier in Virginia after a corporate career, is earning praise for its exploration of blue-collar work and community connection. A review in The Atlantic highlights how the book portrays postal workers as a force for order and predictability in a country that can feel unstable, especially during crises. The memoir delves into the quiet heroism of daily mail delivery, a federal service that provides a consistent and reliable link to even the most remote communities.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he considers Sean "Diddy" Combs "sort of half-innocent" following his recent conviction, but indicated that a presidential pardon would be difficult due to the music mogul's past hostile comments. In a Newsmax interview, Trump acknowledged that Combs's past criticisms, including a statement that "white men like Trump need to be banished," make it harder to consider a pardon. Combs was found guilty in July on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. The president's comments highlight the personal and political calculations that influence his use of pardon power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe reveals a stark contrast in how much apartment space a monthly rent of $1,500 can secure across major U.S. cities. In Manhattan, that budget gets a renter an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, it can afford a spacious 1,329 square feet. The data highlights the extreme affordability gap between expensive coastal markets like Boston and San Francisco and more affordable cities in the Midwest and South. This disparity is driven by factors like housing supply, demand, and land availability, shaping vastly different living experiences for renters nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

In a moving eulogy, Vanessa's sister described the family as having been taken in a "cruel and vicious manner," expressing the profound loss felt by their loved ones. The three were buried together, with symbols of their lives—a vet's cattle tag for Vanessa, a hurling stick for James, and a cat toy for Sara—placed beside their coffins. The suspected killer, a man from the same household, died in the hospital from gunshot wounds in what police are investigating as a triple murder and attempted suicide.</p>
