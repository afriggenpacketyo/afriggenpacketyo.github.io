          <p>The U.S. Senate entered a prolonged legislative session known as a "vote-a-rama," debating dozens of amendments to President Trump's major domestic policy bill. The marathon of votes highlights significant divisions, with Republican leadership struggling to secure enough support from within their own party to pass the sprawling package. With several GOP senators remaining firm holdouts, the bill's passage is uncertain, and the administration has acknowledged that its self-imposed July 4th deadline is unlikely to be met. The outcome of this legislative battle is critical for the president's second-term agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab indicates the Republican 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' would primarily benefit high-income households while financially harming the lowest earners. The report finds that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction, largely due to significant cuts in programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Conversely, the wealthiest households would experience a substantial income increase, driven by the extension of tax cuts. These findings align with other nonpartisan analyses suggesting the bill's net effect would be regressive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China appears to be on the verge of placing another massive aircraft order with European manufacturer Airbus, a move that would further isolate its American rival, Boeing. Boeing has not secured a significant order from China since 2017, a situation attributed to ongoing trade tensions and, more recently, to Boeing's reputational setbacks from safety and production issues. This potential deal underscores a major shift in the global aerospace market, leaving Chinese airlines that rely heavily on Boeing fleets in a difficult position.</p>

          <p>A review of a new biography celebrates the enduring influence of American fashion designer Claire McCardell, who revolutionized women's clothing in the mid-20th century. McCardell championed a new vision of comfortable, practical, and elegant apparel, freeing women from restrictive styles. Her innovations, including the popularization of ballet flats, the introduction of functional pockets and side-fasteners, and the development of versatile separates, fundamentally shaped the 'American Look' and what women wear today, yet her name is not widely remembered.</p>

Citing a Yale study, the article contends the legislation would lead to tens of thousands of deaths annually and substantially increase the national deficit, contrary to administration claims.</p>
