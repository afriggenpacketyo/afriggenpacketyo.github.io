            <p>Attorneys for Karmelo Anthony, a 17-year-old charged with the murder of Austin Metcalf at a Texas high school track meet, expressed condolences to the Metcalf family. The lawyers urged the public to avoid rushing to judgment, emphasizing Anthony's right to a fair legal process. Anthony is currently held on a $1 million bond, and his attorneys plan to seek a reduced bond and a reevaluation of the charges. The incident occurred during an altercation at a Frisco Independent School District stadium, prompting police to investigate misinformation circulating on social media.</p>

            <p>The heads of six UN agencies have issued a joint statement appealing to world leaders to urgently provide food and supplies to Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel has blocked deliveries for over a month. They stated that Palestinians are "trapped, bombed and starved again," with essential supplies piling up at crossing points. The blockade, which began on March 2 after a ceasefire expired, has led to the closure of UN-supported bakeries, empty markets, and hospitals rationing medical supplies. The UN chiefs urged world leaders to protect civilians, facilitate aid, release hostages, and renew a ceasefire, emphasizing Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law.</p>

            <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the country needs to keep coal plants open to meet the increasing electricity demand from AI data centers and other industries. He argued that halting the closure of coal plants is essential to growing America's electricity production over the next five to ten years. Wright's comments coincide with President Trump's plan to classify coal as a critical mineral, aiming to facilitate its extraction on federal lands. The Trump administration seeks to expand electricity output by 25%, viewing coal as a crucial reliable and affordable energy source.</p>

            <p>U.S. crude oil prices closed below $60 per barrel as fears of a full-blown trade war, triggered by President Trump's tariffs, continued to weigh on the market. The U.S. benchmark fell to $59.58 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent was down to $62.65 per barrel. Analysts cite a "toxic cocktail" of recession fears due to the tariffs and OPEC+'s decision to increase production as contributing factors. The U.S. tariff rate on China is set to increase to 104% on Wednesday, with Beijing vowing to "fight to the end."</p>

            <p>Prince Harry returned to London for a court appeal regarding his security arrangements, but reportedly did not meet with his father, King Charles, who was in Rome for an official visit. Experts suggest the tension between them, exacerbated by Harry's legal battles, made a meeting unlikely. Harry is appealing a High Court ruling that denied him government-funded security after stepping down as a senior royal. The King's visit to Rome aims to strengthen the U.K.â€™s relationship with key European allies, further complicating the possibility of a meeting between father and son.</p>

Their death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment shortly before a visit by President Trump's senior advisor to Africa, Massad Boulos.

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-08 14:38:48 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Amid stock market volatility, experts recommend tax-loss harvesting as a tax planning opportunity. This strategy involves selling losing assets from a brokerage account to offset investing gains, thereby lowering taxes. Losses can offset gains from investment sales or capital gains distributions, and up to $3,000 can be subtracted from regular income. Financial advisors emphasize that investors should consider tax-loss harvesting opportunities during periods of stock market volatility. With the S&P 500 Index still down more than 15% from its February high, tax-loss harvesting may be an attractive option. (not investment advice)</p>

The average rate on the 30-year fixed rate increased significantly, erasing last week's decline.

Experts suggest that the initial drop in rates was a knee-jerk reaction to economic fears, while the recent increase reflects a less panicked market.

            <p>A Pew Research Center survey reveals that a majority of Americans, including nearly a quarter of Republicans, believe tariffs on Chinese goods negatively impact the U.S. The survey, conducted after the Trump administration imposed tariffs, found that 52% of Americans think the tariffs will have a negative effect, while 24% believe they will have a positive impact. Experts suggest the findings reflect growing public awareness of the effects of tariffs on their livelihoods.</p>

            <h2>Experts Warn Against Trump's Optimism Regarding Falling Oil Prices and Borrowing Costs</h2>

            <p>President Trump has touted falling oil prices and borrowing costs as positive signs resulting from his new tariffs. However, experts disagree, suggesting that these trends indicate expectations of an economic slowdown, which would reduce energy demand and drive investment into safer assets like bonds. While lower oil prices and borrowing costs may offer some near-term relief, experts caution that this is unlikely to offset the broader economic pain. The drop in oil prices reflects increased odds of a U.S. recession, while lower Treasury yields stem from higher demand for safe-haven investments.</p>

            <p>Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, issued a statement clarifying that social media reports attributing endorsements of President Trump's tariff policies to Buffett are false. While Buffett has not commented directly on Trump's recent tariff actions, he has previously stated that tariffs tend to increase prices and can lead to trade wars. In past interviews, Buffett has expressed concerns that tariffs could hurt consumer budgets and slow down the global economy, describing them as "an act of war, to some degree."</p>

Many also feel that Trump favors Russia too much, though his stance on Russia has reportedly changed since the survey was conducted.</p>

The election was triggered after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned as leader of the Liberal Party, and Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on the country has fueled calls for an early vote. The main contenders are Carney (Liberal Party) and Pierre Poilievre (Conservative Party). Recent polls suggest a tight race, with support for the Liberals increasing after Trudeau's resignation.
