            <p>Asian-Pacific markets traded mixed as investors analyzed Japan's inflation data, which showed a 3.6% year-on-year increase in March, slightly lower than February's 3.7%. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose by 0.78%, while South Korea's Kospi added 0.43%, and China's CSI slipped 0.37%. Shipping stocks in South Korea and Japan saw gains following the U.S. imposing fees on Chinese-built ships, a move intended to bolster the U.S. shipbuilding industry and challenge China's dominance, impacting trade dynamics in the region.

            <p>New research suggests that domesticated brown rats may have spread across the globe via ships in Admiral Zheng He's Ming Dynasty treasure fleets. Artwork from the Ming Dynasty provides early evidence of brown rat domestication in China, predating previously known records by over two centuries. The study posits that these domesticated rats could have stowed away on Zheng He's ships, which involved tens of thousands of men and hundreds of vessels, leading to their worldwide distribution. Brown rats, originally from Northern China and Mongolia, are now ubiquitous and include both pet and laboratory varieties.</p>

            <p>A report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China's "Made in China 2025" plan has missed several targets for technological self-sufficiency. While the country achieved domestic dominance in sectors like autos, it has not met goals in aerospace, high-end robotics, and manufacturing value-added growth. The plan, intended to transform China into a global manufacturing powerhouse, has faced international criticism and U.S. restrictions, prompting China to double down on domestic tech development. The report also notes that China's success has led to overcapacity and increased global concerns about security risks.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an organization led by Elon Musk, from accessing Social Security records, citing privacy concerns. Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander ruled that granting DOGE unlimited access to personally identifiable information would betray the government's commitment to citizen privacy. The order prohibits DOGE members from accessing records containing personal information, installing software on SSA systems, or altering SSA computers. This decision follows a temporary block issued last month and allows the Trump administration to appeal the ruling.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen was blocked from entering an El Salvador prison holding Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident whom courts say was erroneously deported. Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to check on Abrego Garcia's condition, was denied access despite a U.S. federal judge and the Supreme Court ordering the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. The Trump administration alleges Abrego Garcia is a gang member, a claim disputed in court. Republican members of Congress have gained access to the prison, while Van Hollen was denied entry.</p>
