          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in Earth orbit for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry will occur around May 10th, but the exact location remains unknown due to the spacecraft's high speed. The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield, has a good chance of surviving its descent and could make it to the surface partly intact, although the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low. If any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia, as it is considered the registered owner of the object.</p>

          <p>The conflict between India and Pakistan has intensified, with both sides targeting air bases and military sites, each accusing the other of initiating the attacks. Pakistan claimed India targeted its air bases with missiles, retaliating with strikes on Indian military installations. India stated it struck Pakistani radar sites in response to drone attacks on multiple locations. Diplomatic efforts from various countries are underway to de-escalate the crisis, but tensions remain high, with fears of further escalation among the people of both nations.

          <p>Donald Trump's trade policy is characterized by frequent reversals and uncertainty, leaving businesses worldwide struggling to adapt to rapid changes. Despite promises to overhaul economic orthodoxy, the specifics of his administration's approach shift daily, impacting sectors from strollers to movies. Recent actions include potential tariff exemptions for childcare products, a brief consideration of tariffs on foreign films, and fluctuating stances on trade deals themselves. This week, a trade deal with the UK was announced, but the announcement felt hasty, with key details still unresolved. The administration also appears to be shifting its approach to China, with Treasury Secretary Bessent dispatched to Geneva for negotiations.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is seeking an apology from the Football Association after being banned for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a match. Vaughan, then 17, inquired if the player was a man and raised safety concerns with the referee. While the initial ban was overturned on appeal due to an unfair hearing, Vaughan asserts the case has negatively impacted her life. The FA has closed the case after the complainant withdrew, but Vaughan believes she deserves an apology for the stress and disruption caused.</p>

Director Liu Jiang emphasized that all details of modern spy warfare were produced under the MSS's supervision, with state security personnel checking every shot to ensure realism without revealing top secrets.

          <p>Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google for changing the label of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following an executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum argues that the Gulf of America label should only apply to the part over the U.S. continental shelf, as the gulf shares borders between the United States and Mexico. Google Maps currently displays both names, but Mexico views the change as an alteration of its continental shelf's name. The lawsuit follows a House Republican vote to codify Trump's order, further escalating the dispute.</p>

The proposed measures include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, visa restrictions for nationalities with a high risk of overstaying, and potentially longer waiting periods for migrants seeking permanent residency. The government is also reviewing how the 'right to a family life' is applied in immigration cases, potentially leading to stricter interpretations of international law.

          <p>Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, once close friends, have turned against each other after illegally felling the Sycamore Gap tree. The pair, who used to work together, are now blaming each other for the act. Graham's phone and vehicle were used in the felling, while Carruthers' phone was traced to the area. Both men have offered conflicting accounts and accused each other of lying. The prosecution argues they were in it together, united by their guilt in destroying a beloved landmark, but neither is willing to take full responsibility.</p>

          <p>Changes to de minimis, which allowed low-value packages to enter the US without tariffs, has caused a shopping frenzy. US President Donald Trump signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures. In anticipation of the May 2nd deadline, shoppers rushed to purchase items from online retailers like Shein and Temu. The move is expected to lead to higher prices and potential shortages, disproportionately affecting lower-income households. Temu has already announced changes to its sales model, shifting to locally based sellers.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for negotiations aimed at de-escalating the trade war initiated by President Trump. The meetings come after Mr. Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting retaliatory measures from China. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, the fact that talks are occurring has raised hopes for a potential reduction in tariffs. The outcome of the negotiations is being closely watched by economists and investors, who fear that a prolonged trade war will lead to slower growth and higher prices globally.</p>

          <p>For years, China's leader, Xi Jinping, has been planning to make the world dependent on its exports and know-how, a strategy with costs for his own country. Mr. Xi has ramped up exports and deepened China’s position as the world’s leading base for manufacturing, in part by directing the central bank to lend nearly $2 billion to industrial borrowers over the past four years. Faced with Washington’s concerns about the trade imbalance, China chose an aggressive course of action and imposed export restrictions on a wide range of critical minerals and magnets, the global supply of which China had cornered.</p>

The relationship has evolved over time, particularly after Macron's visit to Kyiv and his shift in stance towards Russia. Since Mr. Trump’s return to power in Washington, Mr. Macron has proved to be an important conduit and translator between the American president and Mr. Zelensky.</p>

The national consumer price index (CPI), a key gauge of inflation, edged down by 0.1 per cent year on year last month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday. Although the trade war may ease to a degree as China considers entering negotiations with the United States, tariffs remain prohibitively high and continue to stifle bilateral trade, leaving Chinese manufacturers with mounting stockpiles of unsold goods.</p>
