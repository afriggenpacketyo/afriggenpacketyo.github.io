          <p>US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander has been reunited with his family in Israel after being freed by Hamas, who held him captive in Gaza for 19 months. The 21-year-old was captured during his service in the Israeli army on the Gaza border in October 2023. His release occurred as Israel paused military operations for a few hours to facilitate the transfer, intended as a goodwill gesture ahead of President Trump's Middle East visit. Despite the release, Israel plans to intensify military actions in Gaza, while Qatar and Egypt view Alexander's release as a promising sign for new truce talks.</p>

          <p>The well-preserved body of St. Teresa of Jesus, a 16th-century Catholic saint, was put on public display in Alba de Tormes, Spain, for the first time since 1914. Catholics were visibly moved by the display, with some observers crying and praying at the sight of the Spanish saint. The body, dressed in a nun's habit, appeared mostly skeletal but with certain areas, including her foot, remarkably well-preserved. Experts noted the saint's 'perfectly preserved' condition, attributing it to the dry atmosphere of her tomb, and highlighting the serenity it transmits even after more than 400 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's initial decision to impose triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products caused significant disruption to global trade, but ultimately proved unsustainable. Trade talks in Geneva resulted in an agreement to reduce levies on both sides, lowering the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports to 30% and China's tariff on American goods to 10%. While this provided relief to businesses, it also raised questions about whether the trade disruptions were worth it, as China made no immediate concessions beyond agreeing to further talks. The article emphasizes the limitations of Trump's aggressive trade approach and the shared interest in avoiding a complete decoupling of the two economies.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is targeting toxic chemicals in food, particularly petroleum-based synthetic food dyes, believing they contribute to the rise in obesity and chronic illnesses. Kennedy intends to eliminate nine of these chemicals within 18 months. This article points out that the U.S. allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals through the GRAS (generally recognized as safe) regulatory pathway, without prior FDA approval. Researchers estimate that around 1,000 chemicals in the food supply are unknown to regulators, raising concerns about long-term health effects and interactions between chemicals.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Authority (PA) has lifted its ban on Al Jazeera in the West Bank, which was imposed in January due to accusations of inciting sedition and interfering in internal Palestinian affairs.

This article notes that the PA, dominated by the Fatah party, has long been at odds with Al Jazeera, accusing the channel of supporting Hamas.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reducing high prescription drug prices, but its details and long-term effects remain unclear. This article explains that the order directs U.S. officials to ensure foreign drug deals do not result in 'unreasonable or discriminatory' price hikes for Americans. The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers and explore importing drugs from foreign countries. Experts are skeptical of the claims that prices will fall significantly, and the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts reached a record level of $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Trump's trade war.

While the U.S. still has a significant budget deficit, the increase in tariffs contributed to a surplus in April. High interest rates continue to pose a budgetary burden, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion in April.</p>

This article highlights that the middle class is increasingly out of reach for younger generations, requiring a six-figure income to maintain a middle-class lifestyle. Rising costs of housing, healthcare, and insurance, combined with the responsibility for funding their own retirement, contribute to the problem.
