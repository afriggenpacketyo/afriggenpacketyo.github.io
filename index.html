          <p>A significant heat wave is forecasted to sweep across the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts for over 140 million Americans, with the total number affected by heat advisories rising to 200 million. Potential daily record highs are predicted for parts of the Rockies and Plains, with temperatures in the 90s expected to reach the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The heat wave is expected to shift into the Midwest and Ohio Valley by the end of the weekend and arrive in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, lasting through the first half of next week. The National Weather Service warns of a "High Risk" of extreme heat in parts of the Northeast, with temperatures forecast to be well into the 90s or even triple digits. The simplest way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say. The article provides maps illustrating the forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Steve Bannon played a significant role in President Trump's decision to hold off on a potential military strike against an Iranian nuclear facility. Bannon, who holds no official government position, reportedly advised Trump against the strike, citing concerns about the reliability of Israeli intelligence and the potential ineffectiveness of the "bunker-buster" bomb. Other influential conservatives, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, have urged Trump to support Israel in eliminating the nuclear threat. Despite Bannon's influence, officials caution that Trump's decision could be temporary, as he remains open to military action in the future. This article explores the dynamics within the White House regarding foreign policy decisions and the influence of external advisors.</p>

          <p>Following an FBI investigation into the "764" criminal network, which targets children online, Dr. Stephen Boyce, a former FBI agent, is advising parents on how to protect their children. The 764 Group, originating around 2021, is a global network with neo-Nazi and satanic ideologies. Predators use tactics like love bombing and sextortion to manipulate minors into creating violent or sexual content, which is then shared online. Parents are urged to monitor their children's online activities, be aware of who they are communicating with, and watch for behavioral changes.

          <p>Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island has criticized President Trump for dismissing his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggests that Trump's stance is politically motivated, as he contemplates an attack against Iran and needs to justify the conclusion that they possess nuclear capabilities. He highlights that National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified weeks ago that the intelligence community continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. The article raises questions about the reliability of intelligence assessments and the potential for political influence on national security decisions.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with severe heart failure, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant to address her high antibody levels and risk of organ rejection. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, performed the surgery after Baker's heart function continued to decline, and she faced limited options. The liver transplant helped lower her antibody levels, allowing her body to accept the new heart. Baker's story highlights the potential for innovative medical solutions to save lives and pave the way for future treatments.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a home-grown operating system in space , marking a major step towards reducing reliance on foreign software and boosting the performance of future small satellites. More than 1,000 hours of in-orbit testing were conducted aboard the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat to evaluate how satellite subsystems performed under the OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS) â€“ a lightweight version of Huawei â€™s open-source operation platform, according to a team of researchers from the Chinese cities of Dalian and Xian. With OpenHarmony , the suitcase-sized satellite, which was released from Chinaâ€™s Tiangong space station last year, delivered faster data updates and improved stability compared with earlier set-ups using simpler firmware or foreign software, the researchers reported in the latest issue of the journal Space: Science and Technology.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested that Japan increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP), potentially leading to the cancellation of a planned high-level meeting with Washington. The request was reportedly made by Elbridge Colby, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, who had previously urged Japan to increase its defense spending to 3% of GDP. Japan's potential cancellation of the meeting stems from the request's timing, as the meeting was scheduled before Japan's House of Councillors election, expected on July 20. The increased demand will likely lead Japan to cancel a planned meeting of the countries' foreign and defense chiefs, which was scheduled in Washington before Japan's House of Councillors election, expected on July 20.</p>

          <p>This article examines how Donald Trump has taken the commercialization of politics to a new level by blurring the lines between business and politics. Since his reelection campaign began, Trump is estimated to have more than doubled his net worth to $5.4bn. The article points to the launch of Trump-branded products, such as the Trump Mobile phone service, as examples of this trend. The article explores the ethical implications of a president profiting from their office and the impact on political engagement. The article notes that Democrats have found it hard to find a footing in calling out the interplay, in part because Trumpâ€™s predecessor, Joe Biden, was similarly accused of allowing a family business of influence peddling to evolve around him and issued a pre-emptive pardon of family members before he left office.</p>
