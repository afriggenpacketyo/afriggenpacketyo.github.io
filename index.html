          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper secured his place in the fourth round of the French Open with a dominant victory over Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca. Draper, the fifth seed, showcased his superior quality and experience in a straight-sets win.

Draper had never won a match at Roland Garros until this week, marking this tournament as a significant milestone in his career. Draper's experience proved to be the deciding factor in this match. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity, which is close to weapons-grade, has significantly increased. The confidential report indicates Iran possesses over 400kg of this highly enriched uranium, a near 50% increase in three months, raising concerns about its potential use for nuclear weapons. While Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, the IAEA cannot confirm this, and Israel has accused Iran of actively pursuing nuclear weapons. The IAEA assessment also details troubling findings about Iran's past undeclared nuclear activities at three previously unknown sites, despite ongoing negotiations with the US. The IAEA's director general has expressed serious concern over Iran's increased production and accumulation of highly enriched uranium. Optimism is tempered by the lack of progress in slowing enrichment efforts despite ongoing negotiations. </p>

The situation highlights the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, described by the U.N. as the "hungriest place on Earth," with a population of nearly 2.3 million people on the brink of famine. Hamas is reviewing a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire, which includes the release of hostages and increased aid to Gaza.

Hegseth had claimed China was "destabilizing" the region and warned of a potential Chinese military takeover of Taiwan. Hu countered that some countries are promoting confrontational circles and increasing their military presence, opposing the use of Asia-Pacific waters for seeking hegemony.
