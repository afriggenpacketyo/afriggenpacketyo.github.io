          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, suggesting its primary objective has been to maintain Israel's military and technological dominance over regional powers. It cites a U.S. senator's past statement indicating a strategy to reduce any potential rival state to a "pre-industrial society," a policy that reportedly intensified after the September 11 attacks. The piece frames the recurring conflicts, including those involving Iraq and Iran, as part of this long-standing American quest to prevent any other nation in the region from achieving military parity with Israel. This context helps explain the deep-seated tensions and cyclical violence that characterize regional geopolitics.</p>

          <p>China's solar panel manufacturing industry is experiencing a severe downturn, marked by significant financial losses and a pessimistic outlook. The sector is simultaneously battling a domestic price war, which has caused prices to plummet by up to 80%, and prohibitive U.S. tariffs that are blocking key export markets. Many leading Chinese solar firms are reporting substantial losses, with some company stocks slumping by over 60% since 2022. Industry leaders describe the situation as deeper and more prolonged than anticipated, raising questions about the future stability of what was once considered a major driver of China's economy.

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh has been added to a class-action lawsuit against the University of Michigan concerning a former assistant, Matt Weiss. The suit alleges that Harbaugh and other university officials knew Weiss was improperly accessing private computer data but allowed him to coach in a crucial playoff game. Weiss faces separate criminal charges for allegedly hacking into over 2,000 college athletes' accounts to find intimate photos. The lawsuit claims that with proper oversight from Harbaugh, the misconduct could have been prevented, arguing that student welfare was treated as secondary to the football program's success.</p>

Sources close to the player have dismissed rumors of his frustration at the club, highlighting his recent five-year contract and breakthrough season.

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, has issued a stern warning to U.S. President Donald Trump, demanding he cease using a "disrespectful" tone towards Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a social media post, Araghchi stated that respect is a prerequisite for any potential deal and threatened that Iran would not hesitate to "unveil its Real Capabilities" if provoked further. The statement comes after a recent 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, which ended in a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, and subsequent verbal sparring between Trump and Khamenei. Araghchi also dismissed Trump's claims of imminent nuclear talks, asserting that Iran acts based on its own national interests.</p>

          <p>The recent NATO summit was notably missing the leaders of Japan and South Korea for the first time in four years, a development that experts believe reflects growing concerns in the Indo-Pacific. While both nations, along with Australia, sent lower-level representatives, the absence of their heads of state suggests a strategic shift in priorities. Analysts interpret this move as an indication that the region is worried about the United States being distracted by conflicts in the Middle East. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reportedly canceled his trip specifically because a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump seemed unlikely, highlighting the importance of direct engagement.</p>

          <p>Canadian business owners are expressing frustration over the lack of predictability in trade relations with the United States, as President Trump's fluctuating tariffs create significant market indecision. The article highlights the story of one business owner whose company was hit with a C$35,000 tariff charge due to a shipment narrowly missing a deadline, even though the tariff was paused hours later. This uncertainty has slowed Canada's economy, with 75% of its exports traditionally going to the U.S. Business leaders are calling for a stable set of rules, regardless of the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations, to allow them to plan for the future effectively.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted 53-47 against a resolution that would have required President Trump to seek congressional approval before taking further military action against Iran. The measure, introduced by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, failed to get the simple majority needed to advance. The vote followed recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and occurred amid a contentious debate over the president's war-making authority. Democrats expressed anger over a lack of transparency from the administration regarding the strikes' effectiveness, with some accusing the president of misleading the public about the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tulane University has found that sections of New Orleans' concrete flood walls, reinforced after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at an alarming rate, in some places by nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is occurring faster than sea levels are rising, which reduces the flood protection system's capacity and increases flood risk for the low-lying city. Researchers identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and new residential developments, likely due to soil compression and groundwater withdrawal. The findings serve as a critical warning that ongoing monitoring and maintenance are essential to prevent a future degradation of the city's defenses against storm surges.</p>

Guterres emphasized that the UN's own humanitarian efforts are being strangled and that Israel is obligated to facilitate safe aid delivery throughout the territory.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark 6-3 decision that significantly limits the ability of federal judges to impose nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block presidential policies across the country. The ruling came in a case related to President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such broad orders likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts by Congress. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, the decision narrows the scope of existing injunctions against it and re-shapes a key tool used to challenge executive power.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican budget bill in the U.S. Senate could lead to as many as 3.4 million Californians losing their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, which Newsom estimates a large portion of the state's 15 million enrollees would struggle to meet, potentially leading to a loss of coverage. He described the proposed cuts as "reckless and cruel," warning they could also force the closure of rural hospitals and drive up insurance premiums for others. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the requirements would leave 4.8 million Americans uninsured nationwide.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Traditional Japanese Diet May Be Linked to Lower Rates of Depression</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, analyzed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. While 30.9% of the total cohort showed depressive symptoms, those who adhered more closely to a Japanese diet were less likely to do so. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, found in the diet's components, may help release mood-regulating neurotransmitters and provide anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago in a major jailbreak. Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 escape, which officials have criticized as a result of poor management and infrastructure, went unnoticed for hours. Only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his capture. At least 16 other individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

The theft occurred in December 2020 while the church's founder, Rev. Jesse James Taylor, was in the final months of his life. Prosecutors stated that Lemons issued himself a cashier's check from the church's bank account, a significant portion of which came from the founder's personal funds. He then moved to Tennessee and used the money for personal expenses, including airline tickets, a new car, and property, while initially claiming he had given it to charity.</p>

The show, which follows two sisters and their mother, uses dark humor to explore taboo subjects like mental health, abortion, and financial desperation. Sadler, the writer, says the new series will be even more depressing but funnier, influenced by their own upbringing in an all-woman household and the "bleak" modern dating scene. The comedy satirizes the pressures on young women, with one character declaring it's "better dead than single," reflecting the show's twisted and cutting perspective.</p>

Newsom's legal team argues that Fox News willfully distorted the facts to curry favor with the president.

The author participates in a project by collecting samples, one of whichâ€”from a toiletâ€”is found to contain a phage capable of killing bacteria from a patient's persistent urinary tract infection.

U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled the order "unconstitutional from beginning to end," following three similar rulings against orders targeting other major law firms. The executive orders sought to penalize firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president by suspending security clearances and ending government contracts.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has performed a major U-turn on planned cuts to disability benefits following the threat of a large-scale rebellion from its own MPs. The proposed changes to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) were intended to generate quick savings to meet self-imposed borrowing rules, but critics argued they were a short-sighted cost-cutting exercise rather than a genuine reform. This reversal has raised significant questions about the new government's ability to manage its affairs and whether its overall strategy is credible. The episode highlights the tension between achieving short-term fiscal targets and implementing the long-term structural reforms needed to address rising health-related welfare claims.</p>

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, President Donald Trump has repeatedly labeled him "a communist." Trump warned that the city would become "communistic" if Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, is elected in November. Mamdani's platform, which includes higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, has caused alarm among some business leaders and conservative commentators. In response to Trump's comments, Mamdani encouraged the president and all New Yorkers to learn about his actual policies, which are aimed at making the city more affordable for its residents.</p>

          <h2>Defense Argues Sean Combs's 'Private Sex Life' Was Unfairly Criminalized in Closing Arguments</h2>

          <p>In the closing arguments of Sean "Diddy" Combs's sex-trafficking trial, his defense team argued that the prosecution has unfairly turned his "private sex life" into a crime scene. Lead counsel Marc Agnifilo contended that Combs's "swinger" lifestyle and consensual group sexual encounters were being misrepresented as a criminal racketeering conspiracy. The defense portrayed the trial as being motivated by money, highlighting that key witnesses had received financial settlements. In rebuttal, the prosecution asserted that Combs had spent decades believing he was above the law and urged the jury to hold him accountable for coercing women into unwanted sexual acts.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Predicts Massive Influx of Capital into Cryptocurrency Market</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has made a bullish prediction for the cryptocurrency market, stating that $100 trillion is coming into the space and warning traders to "Ignore this money at your own peril!" While the figure is close to the entire global GDP, making a direct influx of new capital unlikely, analysts interpret this as a prediction for the total crypto market capitalization to reach that valuation. This forecast aligns with other bullish analysts who believe a global race to accumulate assets like Bitcoin will drive mass adoption over the next decade. The current total crypto market cap stands at approximately $3.26 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer outlined the key events for investors to watch in the upcoming week, focusing on the labor report and an earnings release from Constellation Brands. He anticipates the alcohol maker may report disappointing results, citing challenges from the rise of weight-loss drugs, consumer preference for cannabis, and the impact of U.S. immigration policy on its Hispanic consumer base. Cramer also noted that the upcoming Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. He reflected on the past quarter, observing that the market finished strong after a turbulent start, reinforcing the value of a steady investment approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Australia Secures Decisive Test Match Victory Over West Indies in Barbados</h2>

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over West Indies in their first Test match, largely thanks to a five-wicket haul from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies team suffered a dramatic collapse in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets and allowing Australia to win with two days to spare. Despite a promising start to their second innings, the hosts' top order was dismantled by Hazlewood's controlled bowling spell. A late, entertaining partnership provided some resistance, but it was not enough to prevent the decisive Australian win, sealed in the final over of the day.</p>
