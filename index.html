          <p>Rescue efforts at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile have located the remains of one of the five miners trapped after a partial collapse. The incident was triggered by a magnitude 4.2 seismic event, which also resulted in another fatality outside the mine. Over 100 rescuers are involved in the search, and Chilean President Gabriel Boric has met with families, assuring them that all resources are being deployed. Normal operations at the world's largest underground copper mine have been suspended during the ongoing rescue mission.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party in the UK but have yet to decide on a name. They are inviting their reported 600,000 registered supporters to suggest a title, aiming for a name that encapsulates the party's essence. This unconventional approach highlights the challenges of branding in modern politics, where a name must resonate with voters and be distinct enough for registration with the Electoral Commission. The article notes the importance of branding in a digital age and the risks of choosing a name that could be ridiculed.</p>

          <p>The collapse of a mountain and glacier, which destroyed the Swiss village of Blatten, highlights a growing threat to alpine communities due to climate change. Scientists warn that thawing permafrost, the "glue" holding mountains together, is making catastrophic landslides more frequent and unpredictable. While residents were safely evacuated from Blatten, the disaster has sparked a national debate over the immense cost of rebuilding and protecting such villages. The article explores the tension between preserving cultural heritage and the financial and practical realities of adapting to a rapidly changing environment.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key factor in his decision to leave his career as a doctor for comedy. Hill, who qualified in 1988, felt unsuited for medicine and recalled feeling "completely out of my depth" when breaking tragic news to a patient's family. He explained that his stepfather's passing made him realize he didn't want to spend his life in a profession he wasn't passionate about. The article also touches on his famous show, "Harry Hill's TV Burp," and the stress involved in its weekly production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for a fee of £30 million, despite his recent statements expressing a desire to stay with the club. This development comes as United maintains interest in signing RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, whose arrival would likely marginalize Hojlund. While the club asserts it can make new signings before selling players, offloading assets is seen as necessary to comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules. Selling Hojlund at this price would represent a book loss for the club, given his amortized value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has been solved by researchers. The platypus, named Winston, was sent from Australia in 1943 as a diplomatic gift but died just before reaching the UK. For decades, it was rumored that the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, recent archival research by students at Monash University and the University of Sydney revealed that the platypus likely died from heatstroke, as logbooks showed water temperatures well above the safe threshold for the animal as the ship crossed the equator.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators at protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers in England. Demonstrations took place in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, prompting a significant police presence to manage the confrontations. The protests come as the government plans to phase out the use of hotels for asylum seekers by 2029. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper also stated her intent to "restore order" to the system by fast-tracking the appeals process to reduce the overall number of asylum seekers in the country.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly criticized his players following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their first league match of the season. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and lambasted what he called a "mentality problem," suggesting some players need to "drop their ego." He expressed that the opposing team was braver and more aggressive, and his harsh comments so early in the season have drawn attention. Former players and pundits expressed concern over the performance and the manager's extreme public reaction, which included calling out two unnamed players.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from a four-month injury layoff, but the Tampa Bay Rays secured a 4-0 victory. In his five-inning outing, the two-time Cy Young winner recorded eight strikeouts and issued no walks, flashing the dominant form the Dodgers hoped for when signing him. However, he surrendered three runs on two home runs by Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite the loss, Snell's performance was seen as a promising step forward for the Dodgers' late-season rotation depth.</p>

          <p>South African police have arrested nearly 1,000 undocumented foreign nationals for working illegally at the Sheba Gold Mine in Mpumalanga province. The arrests were part of "Operation Vala Umgodi," a week-long effort to crack down on illegal mining, a major issue in the country which has around 6,000 abandoned mines. The individuals, many from neighboring countries like Eswatini and Mozambique, will face charges for immigration violations and potentially illegal mining. The problem of illegal miners, known as "zama-zamas," is widespread, driven by unemployment and the decline of the formal mining sector.</p>

          <p>The cost of nursing home care in Germany has surged to an average of €3,248 per month, a sum far exceeding the average monthly pension and placing immense financial pressure on seniors and their families. This dramatic increase is attributed to rising wages for care staff and an increase in staffing levels. With statutory long-term care insurance covering only a portion of the costs, nearly a third of residents now rely on welfare payments. The situation has prompted calls for urgent reform of the long-term care insurance system as Germany's aging population is expected to further increase demand. (not investment advice)</p>
