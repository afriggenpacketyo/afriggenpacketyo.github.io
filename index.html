          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of murdering three members of her ex-husband's family with poisonous mushrooms, testified in an Australian court, claiming the poisoning was accidental. Patterson, 50, is charged with the deaths of Don and Gail Patterson, and Heather Wilkinson, as well as the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, after a meal at her home in July 2023. During questioning, Patterson spoke of personal struggles and strained relations with her ex-husband's family. The trial continues with Patterson expected to return to the witness stand, as the prosecution has already presented its evidence to the jury, seeking to prove that she intentionally poisoned the victims.</p>

          <p>A new study has revealed that Delaware courts, where many major companies are incorporated, frequently approve substantial payouts to lawyers. This has sparked further debate among critics of the state's legal system, who argue that it is too favorable to corporate interests and legal professionals. The findings highlight concerns about the potential for excessive legal fees in corporate litigation and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the Delaware court system.

          <p>Tulsa's mayor, Monroe Nichols, has proposed a $100 million private trust to address the lingering effects of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, offering scholarships and housing assistance to descendants. This initiative, framed as a "road to repair," aims to revitalize North Tulsa's Greenwood district, which was destroyed in the massacre, with a significant portion of the funds allocated to improving buildings and infrastructure. While the plan does not include direct cash payments, it acknowledges the economic devastation inflicted on the Black community and seeks to restore Greenwood's commercial prominence. The proposal faces a challenging political climate, but Nichols emphasizes the importance of addressing historical injustices and fostering economic opportunity in Tulsa.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that the United Kingdom faces its most serious military threat since the Cold War, citing growing Russian aggression. As a result, he has outlined ambitious rearmament plans, which include the construction of up to 12 attack submarines. This announcement comes as part of a broader defense review aimed at bolstering the UK's military capabilities in response to increasing global instability. Starmer's emphasis on rearmament reflects a growing concern about the need to deter potential adversaries and protect national security interests.</p>

          <p>Mazyar Azarbonyad, a personal trainer, has been sentenced to 14 months in a young offender institution after causing a pile-up of police cars while fleeing from them on the A1 near Newcastle.

Azarbonyad, who only had a provisional driving license, reached speeds of up to 120 mph with his date in the passenger seat, who pleaded with him to stop. The judge described the incident as a miracle that there were not multiple fatalities, also banning Azarbonyad from driving for three years.</p>

This decision follows negotiations that began in April, as the Trump administration seeks a new deal with Iran after withdrawing from the previous agreement in 2018. Despite ongoing indirect talks, significant differences remain, and Trump has threatened military force if negotiations fail, while Israel reportedly considers attacking Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>

The plans include building 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines and boosting the manufacturing of drones, missiles, and munitions, along with bolstering cyber warfare capabilities. Starmer committed to raising defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% by 2034, contingent on economic conditions. While the European aerospace and defense sector welcomed the spending plans, analysts suggest the impact will be gradual and potentially insufficient to meet broader defense ambitions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip tailored for the Chinese market, designed to comply with U.S. export regulations. The chip, known as B30, will allow users to connect multiple units, creating high-performance computing clusters. Nvidia plans to produce over one million units of the B30 chip this year in an effort to maintain its market share in China. The new GPU is expected to be introduced in July and is likely based on Nvidia's Blackwell platform.</p>

          <p>A recent study by Stop AAPI Hate reveals that 53% of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders experienced race-based hate acts in 2024, reflecting the impact of a divisive election year and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Many incidents go unreported due to the belief that they are not significant enough or that reporting won't make a difference. Advocates are concerned that the Trump administration's policies and rhetoric will further fuel anti-Asian hate and violence.

          <p>In 2013, Stephen Curry made a surprising move by signing with Under Armour, an upstart athletic company, over industry giant Nike. The decision was influenced by Curry's Golden State Warriors teammate, Kent Bazemore, and a botched Nike presentation. Under Armour offered Curry a $4 million annual deal, while Nike declined to match the offer of $2.5 million. Curry's partnership with Under Armour has evolved, with Curry becoming president of the Curry Brand in 2023. The brand invests a portion of its revenue in under-resourced communities.</p>

By defunding and undermining these institutions, the administration seeks to divide Americans and control the message to the public. The aim is to weaken knowledge, beauty, and culture, thereby making the country more amenable to political domination. This strategy involves attacking marginalized groups, university research, and the performing arts.</p>

          <p>Cloning has proliferated in the three decades since Dolly the sheep, with nearly 60 species cloned for various purposes, from police dogs to polo horses. Companies like ViaGen Pets & Equine offer cloning services for pets, with prices ranging from $50,000 for a cat or dog to $85,000 for a horse. Despite ethical concerns and debates, cloning has become routine, with a focus on replicating desirable traits in animals. The process involves somatic cell nuclear transfer, where an animal's DNA is inserted into an egg, creating a genetic replica.</p>

          <p>A new treatment for PTSD called Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) claims to be painless, with patients reimagining their trauma through mental exercises to fade its emotional charge. RTM follows a manualized 89-step protocol, where patients reimagine their trauma through a series of specific mental exercises meant to fade its emotional charge. A large-scale clinical trial of RTM found that 89% of patients completed RTM, compared with a 73% completion rate for prolonged exposure, and after treatment, nearly 70% of RTM patients no longer met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis, compared with 61% of prolonged-exposure patients. Despite skepticism from some researchers, RTM offers a potentially gentler way of addressing past trauma.</p>

Colleges need to support parents, pregnant students, and prospective parents, and financial fears are not irrational. Stronger labor regulations could also curb workplace coercion, and policies like those in Scandinavia could make it easier to balance kids with holding down a job.</p>
