          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his third start of the season, Ohtani's fastball reached a career-high 101.7 mph, though he remained hitless in four at-bats. Despite his strong pitching performance, which included one strikeout and allowing only a single and a walk, the Dodgers' five-game winning streak was snapped in a 9-5 loss.</p>

The measure passed 51-49 only after several Republican holdouts reversed their opposition, narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The successful vote sets the stage for a final debate and vote on the controversial 940-page bill, which still faces significant opposition from Democrats and uncertainty in the House.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "urban heat island" effect is the key reason why cities often feel significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas, especially during heatwaves. This phenomenon occurs because dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's heat, which is then slowly released, raising air temperatures. The lack of vegetation and water, combined with waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning, exacerbates the effect, making urban populations more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and extreme heat.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched through Venice to oppose the lavish wedding celebrations of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, arguing it highlights the city's exploitation for the benefit of the ultra-wealthy. Activists and residents claim such events are an affront to a city struggling with overtourism, high housing costs, and the threats of climate change. Despite a large donation from Bezos to local environmental groups, many demonstrators dismissed it as a token gesture, demanding the city prioritize its citizens over spectacles for the rich.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer. The initiative, planned for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, as experts warn that sunburn in childhood significantly increases later risk. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, health charities and dermatologists emphasize that early education is a key preventative measure.</p>

The ban was based on a controversial "Child Protection" law, but the city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, enabled the march to proceed as a council-organized event.</p>
