          <p>An American woman has been sentenced to eight years in prison for facilitating a large-scale remote-work scam that funneled millions of dollars to the North Korean government. She operated "laptop farms," managing computers for highly skilled North Korean IT workers who used stolen American identities to secure remote jobs at major U.S. companies, including Fortune 500 firms. The scheme generated approximately $17 million, which U.S. authorities say was used to fund North Korea's nuclear weapons program, highlighting a significant national security risk posed by the exploitation of remote work environments.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's campaign promises to release documents from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, his administration has been slow to act, prompting legal challenges to force disclosure. Several court cases, including a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Radar Online, are attempting to compel the FBI to release thousands of pages of records related to the disgraced financier. While the Justice Department argues that releasing the files could compromise ongoing legal matters, such as Ghislaine Maxwell's potential appeals, transparency advocates hope these legal pressures will succeed where political will has failed, potentially revealing more about Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old first-generation American entrepreneur expresses concern that his generation is losing faith in the traditional American Dream due to economic pressures like rising costs and stagnant wages. Citing a Harris Poll, he notes that many in Gen Z feel a 9-to-5 job is insufficient, turning instead to side hustles and social media for financial guidance. The author, who founded a fintech company after dropping out of Harvard, advocates for creating better financial tools and promoting widespread financial literacy to restore belief in economic opportunity and prevent disillusionment among young Americans.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has revealed the development process behind CHSN01, a revolutionary high-strength, low-temperature steel essential for nuclear fusion technology. The material was created to address a critical challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), where existing materials became brittle under the extreme cold and immense magnetic forces inside a reactor. This new steel can withstand temperatures near absolute zero while maintaining ductility, a decade-long achievement that places China in a leading position in advanced materials science and is crucial for building the world's first fusion power generation reactor.</p>

Greer stated that the tariffs are largely set and not immediately negotiable, designed to reduce trade deficits and encourage the reshoring of manufacturing jobs to the U.S. He also addressed the president's use of tariffs as a geopolitical tool, linking them to non-trade issues such as Canada's stance on Palestinian statehood and political prosecutions in Brazil, arguing this is a permissible use of executive power under existing law.

In 1991, Eliza Thomas, Amy Ayers, and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison were killed, and the crime scene was set on fire, complicating the investigation. Although two men were convicted and later had their convictions overturned, a key piece of evidence remains: a male DNA profile found on one of the victims. Despite a promising but ultimately false lead in 2017, investigators believe that with improving science, the remaining DNA sample could finally identify the perpetrator.</p>

          <p>More than three decades after the brutal 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin yogurt shop, a persistent theory focuses on two unidentified men seen in the store shortly before closing. Multiple customers described the men as looking out of place and whispering, but they were never identified despite extensive investigation, including hypnosis of witnesses. While four other men were arrested and two were convicted before their sentences were overturned due to new DNA evidence, some investigators and defense attorneys believe these two mysterious customers could hold the key to solving the case that has haunted the city for years.</p>

          <p>Decades after David Berkowitz, the "Son of Sam" killer, terrorized New York City, two survivors share their harrowing stories of survival and loss. Robert Violante was on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz in 1977 when Berkowitz shot them, leaving him permanently blind in one eye and killing Moskowitz. A year earlier, Carl Denaro was shot in the head while in his car with a date, surviving with a metal plate in his skull. Both men reflect on how the attacks irrevocably changed their lives and express relief that Berkowitz remains imprisoned, preventing him from harming anyone else.</p>

Her replacement, Shaquila Myers, previously worked for a state legislative leader viewed as friendly to big business, raising concerns that the commission may become more favorable to utility interests at a critical time for Michigan's clean energy transition.</p>

The U.S. recently dismantled its primary aid agency, USAID, creating a significant funding vacuum for global health and development initiatives. In contrast, Spain has pledged to more than double its aid budget by 2030, driven by long-standing public support. This shift could lead to a new, more collaborative and less paternalistic future for foreign aid, with former recipient nations playing a larger role.</p>

The movie cleverly plays on his real-life arrest at the PGA Championship, with a scene featuring him in an orange jail jumpsuit.

Arriving to a chaotic assembly of colonial militias outside Boston, Washington implemented structure, discipline, and organization, overcoming his own prejudices to appoint talented men from diverse backgrounds, like Henry Knox and Nathanael Greene. This foundational period demonstrates that his character, judgment, and ability to unite disparate groups were more critical to the Revolution's ultimate success than battlefield tactics, offering a lesson on the importance of steady, pragmatic leadership.</p>

          <p>The complex, decades-long relationship between President Trump and media mogul Rupert Murdoch is facing new tension as Trump pursues a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. The lawsuit stems from a report about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump denies. This legal battle highlights the fluctuating dynamic between the two titans, whose careers have often been mutually beneficial, with Murdoch's Fox News playing a key role in Trump's political rise. Despite their long history, Murdoch has shown a willingness to distance himself from Trump, creating an unpredictable and high-stakes conflict.</p>

          <p>A new biography by renowned music historian Peter Guralnick, "The Colonel and the King," offers a comprehensive look at the life of Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's controversial manager. The book delves into Parker's mysterious origins as an undocumented immigrant from Holland and his early career as a carnival hustler, experiences that shaped his formidable skills in promotion and negotiation. While often portrayed as an exploitative figure, Guralnick's work presents a more nuanced portrait, aiming to correct the record on Parker's complex and pivotal partnership with the King of Rock 'n' Roll.</p>

          <p>In response to rampant cartel violence and deep-seated corruption, the new mayor of Celaya, Mexico, has taken the drastic step of firing over half of the city's police force. The city, which has one of the world's highest homicide rates, has become an epicenter of a brutal war between cartels, with the local police seen as either complicit or powerless. Following the assassination of his predecessor on the campaign trail, the new mayor has called in federal troops and the national guard to take over security, reflecting a broader, and controversial, trend of militarization across Mexico to combat organized crime.</p>

          <p>In California's highly competitive 13th Congressional District, voters from across the political spectrum are united in their demand for the full release of government files on Jeffrey Epstein. Despite deep divisions on President Trump and other issues, Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike expressed frustration with the administration's backtracking on its promise to unseal the records. Many voters feel that transparency is crucial to hold all powerful individuals involved in Epstein's sex-trafficking network accountable, regardless of their political affiliation, and to put an end to speculation surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Board of Immigration Appeals has issued a ruling that significantly curtails the ability of women to receive refugee protection when fleeing gender-based violence. The decision states that a "particular social group," one of the five grounds for asylum, cannot be defined by gender or by gender combined with nationality. Critics argue this binding ruling reverses decades of legal progress that recognized women's rights as human rights and could deny asylum to those escaping honor killings, domestic violence, or sexual slavery by reclassifying their persecution as a "private matter."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's aggressive tariff policies and trade war escalations, the U.S. economy has shown surprising resilience, with recent figures indicating 3% annualized growth in the second quarter. This resilience can be attributed to businesses stockpiling goods to soften price impacts and multinational corporations spreading tariff costs across global markets. However, warning signs are emerging, including a recent rise in the unemployment rate to 4.7% and slowing growth in the first half of the year. While a full-blown crisis has been averted for now, the long-term damage from sustained protectionism and uncertainty remains a significant threat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time since the 15th century, sending an ash plume six kilometers into the sky. Experts suggest the eruption may be linked to a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the region last week, one of the strongest ever recorded. Shortly after the eruption, another significant 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit the nearby Kuril Islands, prompting tsunami warnings. While there is no immediate threat to populated areas, the events highlight the intense seismic activity in the Pacific "Ring of Fire."</p>

          <p>Chile is experiencing a dramatic decline in its birth rate, which has fallen to just over one child per woman, a rate lower than most of Europe and well below the population replacement level. This rapid demographic shift, driven by economic pressures and changing social norms, may foreshadow future trends in the United States, where the fertility rate also recently hit a record low. Researchers point to the rising cost of living and greater educational and career opportunities for women as key factors. The trend is sparking debate between progressives who see it as a sign of empowerment and conservatives who view it as a cultural crisis.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reinstated a more aggressive policy for collecting billions in Social Security overpayments, affecting potentially over a million beneficiaries. The garnishment rate for benefit checks, which was lowered to 10% during the Biden administration, has been increased to 50% as of July 2025. This policy aims to recoup an estimated $23 billion in outstanding overpayments, which can occur due to administrative errors or beneficiaries failing to update their income information. Beneficiaries facing these clawbacks have legal options to request a waiver, reconsideration, or a reduced repayment rate based on financial hardship. (not investment advice)</p>

The move comes as the number of migrants arriving in the UK via small boats in 2025 has already surpassed 25,000, a record for this point in the year, prompting accusations that the government is not doing enough to control the border.</p>
