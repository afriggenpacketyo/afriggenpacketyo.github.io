        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to stimulate its economy amidst trade tensions, China's central bank reduced its benchmark lending rates for the first time in seven months. The People's Bank of China lowered the one-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the five-year LPR to 3.5%, marking the first rate cut since October. This move, part of a broader stimulus package, aims to boost corporate and household borrowing, with economists anticipating further easing of monetary policy by the end of the year. The rate cuts also follow reductions in deposit rates by state-backed commercial lenders, a measure to protect their net interest margins and support the lowering of key lending rates.

Eric Trump said the idea for the medal came to him after attending a service for fallen officers, noting the absence of a medal commemorating law enforcement officers and first responders who die in the line of duty.

          <p>A recent EU deal highlights the UK's complex post-Brexit relationship with the European Union, reflecting the government's self-imposed limits on negotiations. While the deal aims to ease trade frictions, it avoids a return to the EU's customs union or single market, risking dissatisfaction among both staunch Brexiteers and those advocating for closer ties. The agreement involves accepting 'dynamic alignment' with some EU rules, balancing easier trade with a partial surrender of sovereignty. The article suggests that the ongoing negotiations will determine the real-world impact of the deal, including costs, defense cooperation, youth travel, and professional qualification recognition.</p>

          <p>ESPN NFL analyst Ryan Clark criticized former NFL star Robert Griffin III for his comments on the Caitlin Clark-Angel Reese rivalry, accusing Griffin of joining a "hate train" and overlooking the challenges faced by Black women in sports. Clark questioned Griffin's understanding of the experiences of Black women, referencing his marriage to a White woman. Griffin responded to Clark's comments on social media, calling them cowardly and out of bounds. The controversy arose after Griffin claimed that Reese "hates Caitlin Clark" following an incident during a game between the two players.</p>

          <p>Two crew members died and at least 22 were injured when a Mexican Navy sailing ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge. The ship, carrying 277 people, including 175 naval cadets, was on a good-will tour when it veered off course and struck the bridge. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but a maritime expert suggested the ship's propellers may have been running in reverse. Senator Charles Schumer noted that the ship did not use a tugboat's assistance prior to the incident.</p>

          <p>Coral reefs off the coast of Honolulu are experiencing widespread bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures, impacting marine life and biodiversity. Marine scientist Greg Asner notes that 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, leading to the expulsion of algae that give corals their color. Compared to Hawaii, the decline of coral reefs is worse in the Great Barrier Reef and the Galapagos Islands, with the problem most severe in the Caribbean and Florida. Conservation efforts include educating tourists about coral-safe sunscreens and implementing underwater nurseries to help reefs recover.</p>

This decision affects approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, potentially stripping them of work permits and deportation protections. The Biden administration created the program, and after Trump took office for his second term, Noem vacated the extension for more than 350,000 Venezuelans, finding that it was "contrary to the national interest" to continue the program.</p>
