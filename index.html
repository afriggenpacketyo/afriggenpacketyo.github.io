        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an article published in the Communist Party's theoretical journal, Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his country's commitment to globalization and free trade. He criticized the rise of unilateralism, protectionism, and sanctions, positioning China as a champion of an open international economic environment. Xi's statements, compiled from speeches since 2012, were released on the opening day of a major supply chain expo, emphasizing China's desire to uphold "genuine multilateralism." This stance contrasts with the more protectionist policies adopted by some Western nations, highlighting ongoing global economic tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent article in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged China's local governments to utilize their legislative powers to foster economic development. The piece argues that tailored, local laws create a stable and predictable environment, allowing market entities to operate effectively within a legal framework. This approach marks a shift from relying on top-down directives to using legal systems to address economic challenges. The call for creative legislation reflects a strategy to empower cities and adapt to specific regional needs for long-term economic benefits.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 20:58:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a pioneering effort to save Florida's dwindling coral reefs, marine scientists are crossbreeding native Elkhorn coral with a hardier strain from Honduras. This project, nicknamed "Flonduran" coral, aims to introduce genetic diversity and resilience to Florida's reef system, which has been devastated by warming waters and disease. More than 95% of the state's Elkhorn coral, crucial for coastal protection, has been lost. The newly created hybrid corals have been planted on wild reefs for the first time, with hopes they can survive future marine heatwaves and help rebuild the vital ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service's handling of a wildfire at the Grand Canyon's North Rim is being questioned after the blaze destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and over 70 other structures. The fire, started by lightning on July 4, was initially allowed to burn for several days under a "confine and contain" strategy for ecological benefit. However, the fire grew explosively due to hot, windy conditions, prompting emergency evacuations. Arizona's governor has called for a federal investigation into the decision-making process, raising concerns about managing controlled burns during peak fire season.</p>

On a monthly basis, the index increased by 0.3%, driven by rising costs for energy, food, and household furnishings. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.9%. Economists suggest that newly implemented tariffs may be starting to contribute to price increases in certain categories.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with a White House request to cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved funding, targeting foreign aid and federal support for public broadcasters NPR and PBS. The "rescissions package," pushed by the Trump administration, requires only a simple majority to pass but has faced resistance from some Republican senators. Concerns were raised over cuts to global health programs like PEPFAR, leading to a last-minute amendment to preserve its funding. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue it undermines the bipartisan appropriations process and could complicate future government funding negotiations.</p>

Northern Territory police expressed regret that he died without providing this crucial information and noted that a significant reward for finding the remains is still active.</p>

          <p>TV chef Si King, one half of the Hairy Bikers, has spoken about his emotional return to the site of the Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in September 2023. King, who expressed visceral anger at the time of the "mindless" act of vandalism, had avoided visiting the iconic Northumberland location until now. He described the tree as a "sentinel of time" and a special place for personal reflection, including for grieving the recent loss of his co-star, Dave Myers. His visit, filmed for a BBC documentary, captures the profound sense of loss felt by many over the destruction of the beloved landmark.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants." The recommendation aims to reduce patient confusion and clarify the distinction between these roles and fully qualified doctors. The review, prompted by safety concerns and cases where patients mistook PAs for doctors, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges. It further states that associates should not be responsible for diagnosing patients. The BMA, the doctors' union, welcomed the changes but argued they should have gone further.</p>

          <p>The iconic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a massive £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The project will involve moving 1,300 plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and repairing the historic ironwork, which has corroded in the building's humid environment. A key goal of the refurbishment is to make the Victorian-era glasshouse net-zero in emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps. Horticulturists have already begun the complex process of propagating and relocating the priceless tropical plant collection.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advert for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims, such as its ability to "help you feel calm" and reduce stress. The advert for the magnesium-infused beverage was found to be in breach of rules governing health claims for food and drink products. The ASA ruled that language like "crafted for calm" improperly implied the drink could treat anxiety, a prohibited claim. The company was also cited for an inaccurate "0g added sugar" claim and has been ordered not to run the ad again in its current form.</p>

          <p>Conservative MP Julian Smith, who served as Northern Ireland Secretary, has sharply criticized former Prime Minister David Cameron for his handling of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Smith accused Cameron of being "extremely cavalier" and treating the fundamental constitutional question like "some sort of Eton game." He argued that the government failed to properly plan for either outcome, particularly regarding the complex issue of the Irish border. Smith's comments highlight the lasting internal divisions within the Conservative Party over the decision to hold the referendum and the chaotic political period that followed.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of 2,000 of the nearly 4,000 National Guard soldiers deployed to the Los Angeles area six weeks ago. The troops were federalized by the Trump administration to address protests over large-scale immigration raids, a move criticized by state and local leaders as an overreach of authority. While the administration cited a need to quell "lawlessness," the protests were largely peaceful and handled by local police. California's governor and L.A.'s mayor have called for all remaining troops to be sent home, viewing the deployment as unnecessary political theater.</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after he was executed for treason, South Korea's former intelligence chief, Kim Jae-gyu, is being retried for the 1979 assassination of authoritarian President Park Chung-hee. Kim's family fought for the retrial, arguing he was a patriot who acted to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, not a traitor seeking power. The original trial, held under martial law, is now being scrutinized for potential procedural flaws and the use of torture to obtain confessions. The retrial re-examines a pivotal, polarizing moment in South Korean history, forcing a national reckoning with the legacies of both the assassin and the dictator he killed.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, alleging he misrepresented his primary residence to secure a cheaper home loan. Schiff, a longtime political adversary of Trump, dismissed the accusation as a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and an effort to distract from the Epstein files controversy. Trump cited a Fannie Mae investigation, but a memo from the agency reviewed by the press noted only "possible occupancy misrepresentation," not fraud. Schiff's spokesperson stated he has always been transparent about owning homes in both California and the D.C. area and has followed all laws and counsel advice.</p>

The clarification comes as the administration pressures Russia with a 50-day ceasefire ultimatum and promises to facilitate more weapons for Ukraine, paid for by European allies.

          <p>An Arcadia, California couple has been arrested on suspicion of child endangerment after authorities removed 21 children from their home. The investigation began when a two-month-old baby was hospitalized with head trauma, which police allege was caused by a nanny, with the parents delaying medical care. Investigators discovered the couple, Silvia Zhang and Guojun Xuan, had used numerous surrogates across the country to have the children, who range in age from two months to 13 years. The surrogacy agency, Mark Surrogacy, is listed at the couple's home address, and the FBI is now reportedly involved in the case.</p>

The pressure follows outrage from conservative voters after the Justice Department stated no "client list" was found, contradicting Bondi's earlier comment that such a file was on her desk. Johnson's statement reflects growing pressure within the Republican party for more information on the case, with several lawmakers also calling for Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress.</p>
