          <h2>Nvidia to Resume Sales of H20 AI Chips to China Following U.S. Government Assurances</h2>

          <p>Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. This development follows a period of restrictions that significantly impacted Nvidia's market share in the country. The move is seen as a major win for the company and a potential catalyst for growth, coming after intense lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang and recent U.S.-China trade discussions. The news caused Nvidia's shares to rise, signaling investor confidence in the company's ability to reclaim its leadership in the Chinese AI market.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 00:35:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations and keeping the nation on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. Despite the strong GDP figure, other indicators showed mixed results, with retail sales growth slowing and real estate investment continuing to decline. The robust growth, driven partly by strong exports, may reduce the immediate pressure on policymakers to implement major new stimulus measures. However, economists remain cautious about future headwinds and underlying fragility in the economy, suggesting structural reforms are still needed for sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intense storms on Monday night caused severe flash flooding across the New York City metropolitan area, prompting a state of emergency in New Jersey and disrupting critical infrastructure. The heavy rainfall led to flooded subway stations, significant delays on commuter rail lines, and submerged roads and highways, trapping vehicles. Emergency services conducted numerous rescues, particularly in Westchester County, New York, and Scotch Plains, New Jersey. The slow-moving storm system dropped over six inches of rain in some areas, causing extensive damage to homes and businesses.</p>

          <p>The trial of James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes, began with jury selection on Monday. Prosecutors allege Craig used a work computer to research and purchase lethal poisons like cyanide and arsenic while having an affair. The prosecution's case heavily relies on this electronic evidence, which the defense unsuccessfully attempted to suppress. Legal experts anticipate a contentious trial focusing on forensic evidence, toxicology reports, and the admissibility of communications between Craig and his alleged mistress.</p>

          <p>Chinese aerospace company Space Pioneer announced its Tianlong-3 rocket has passed a critical ground-based stress test, a significant milestone after a previous test ended in an explosion. The recent test simulated key mission phases for the rocket's nine-engine first stage, confirming the structural integrity needed for launch, flight, and recovery. This success is crucial for the development of the reusable rocket, which is designed to compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9. The test addresses concerns from a June 2024 incident where the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed during a static-fire test.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in constructing massive AI data centers in the United States to advance "superintelligence." The first facility, named Prometheus, is set to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. One of the data center clusters is described as covering an area nearly the size of Manhattan, highlighting the immense scale of the investment. This strategic move aims to position Meta at the forefront of AI development, though it also raises concerns about the significant energy and water consumption of such large-scale facilities.</p>

Tesla contends the driver is solely responsible, claiming he was distracted by a dropped cell phone at the time of the crash.

          <p>According to analysts, the United States is unlikely to succeed in getting public commitments from its key allies, Japan and Australia, regarding their specific actions in a potential conflict with China over Taiwan. The reported U.S. push is seen by some as an attempt to amplify the "China threat" narrative to encourage allies to increase defense spending and military cooperation. This strategy aligns with President Trump's maximum pressure approach. Analysts suggest that such pressure reveals weakening U.S. confidence in its ability to manage regional tensions independently.</p>

The Commerce Department stated the move is intended to protect American farmers from what it calls unfair trade practices and cheap imports that have harmed the domestic industry. While supporters in states like Florida praised the decision, critics and business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warn it could lead to higher consumer prices for tomatoes and potential retaliation from Mexico.

          <p>In a groundbreaking discovery, researchers at Tel Aviv University have found the first evidence of an animal responding to sounds produced by plants. The study showed that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic "screams" associated with distress, such as dehydration. While the sounds are outside the range of human hearing, many insects and some mammals can perceive them. This opens up a new field of study into a potential invisible ecosystem of communication, suggesting that animals may use plant sounds to make decisions about pollination, feeding, or shelter.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic 763% increase in the rate of young children under six accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that while pouches like Zyn are smoke-free, they contain nicotine that can be toxic to children. The study noted that ingestions of these products were more likely to result in serious medical outcomes compared to other nicotine products. Health experts are concerned that the products' colorful packaging and flavoring make them attractive to children.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested in connection with a macabre prank involving a teddy bear that appeared to be made of human skin, which was left at a gas station in Victorville, California. Authorities responded to a call on Sunday and found the disturbing object, which the county coroner later determined was not made of human remains. The suspect, Hector Corona Villanueva, was arrested on suspicion of filing a false emergency report and planting evidence. The artist who created the bear confirmed she had sold it to a customer in the area but was unaware of their intentions.</p>

          <p>Dan Bongino, the controversial deputy director of the FBI, is reportedly considering resignation after a heated confrontation with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Jeffrey Epstein case. The dispute stems from unfulfilled expectations within the MAGA movement regarding a supposed list of Epstein's powerful clients, which a recent DOJ memo concluded does not exist. Bongino, a former right-wing podcaster with no prior FBI experience, stormed out of a meeting with Bondi and other senior officials. The public infighting has reportedly displeased President Trump, making Bongino's position within the administration appear increasingly untenable.</p>

The method, developed at Dalian University of Technology, allows the metal alloy to be cooled more rapidly during production, enhancing its durability and ability to withstand extreme conditions. This technological breakthrough is crucial for China's ambitions to develop high-performance engines for its next-generation fighter jets. It addresses a long-standing challenge where China has lagged behind Western nations in aircraft engine technology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has asked the Supreme Court to deny the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was only intended to apply within the Southern District of Florida and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary. This move by the DOJ seeks to uphold her 2021 conviction and keep her imprisoned for her crimes.</p>
