The deal retains a 10% tariff, generating $6 billion for the U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick highlighted the deal's benefits, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized its role in boosting trade and creating jobs. Britain reported the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, setting a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.

          <p>President Trump appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin, whose nomination was dropped due to criticism over his support for Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants. Trump praised Pirro as highly qualified and one of the top District Attorneys in New York's history. Pirro, a staunch Trump supporter, was previously the district attorney for Westchester County, New York, and her ex-husband received a pardon from Trump during his first term. The appointment follows Senator Thom Tillis's opposition to Martin's nomination, leading Trump to seek an alternative candidate.</p>

          <p>Federal judges ruled that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents by drawing congressional lines that flouted previous court directives. The state must continue using a court-ordered map that led to the election of Alabama's second Black congressman. The judges found that the 2023 map violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by consigning Black voting strength to a single majority-Black district. This decision follows a February trial and previous rulings against the state's maps. The plaintiffs celebrated the decision as a victory for Black voters, while Alabama is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer can claim a limited win with the new trade deal with America, although it primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a deep free trade agreement. The deal addresses tariffs imposed on the British car industry, providing relief for companies like Jaguar Land Rover. While opponents criticize the deal as overclaimed, it avoids diluting the UK's Digital Services Tax and sensitive issues like the NHS or food standards. The agreement was expedited by American power under President Trump, and ongoing discussions aim to further reduce tariffs. Industries will analyze the specifics to determine the deal's implications, but Starmer views it as positive news amidst international and domestic challenges.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison is facing a lawsuit claiming that the Eaton fire exposed residents to dangerous levels of lead, asbestos, and other toxic substances. The lawsuit alleges Edison's negligence in maintaining its infrastructure caused the fire, leading to the toxic exposure. The lawyers cited an investigation that found toxic heavy metals in soil samples even after federal crews removed ash and topsoil. Edison acknowledges its equipment may have ignited the fire but cautions that the cause remains under investigation. The lawsuit seeks compensation for residents harmed by the toxic substances and money for medical monitoring.</p>

          <p>A judge declared a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict in the murder trial of Christopher Schurr, a Michigan police officer who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya, a black man, during a traffic stop. The incident occurred on April 4, 2022, and was captured on multiple cameras, showing Schurr shooting Lyoya after a scuffle over the officer's Taser. Schurr testified he feared for his life, while Lyoya's family expressed disappointment and vowed to continue fighting for justice. The mistrial follows a recent acquittal of former Memphis police officers in the killing of Tyre Nichols.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increased public attention on lower federal judges is not a positive sign, as it shifts focus from the law to personalities. This trend is concerning because it moves away from a government of laws and toward one of individuals, potentially serving Trump's agenda by attacking judges and delegitimizing the court system. While understanding judges' backgrounds is valuable, the focus should remain on legal interpretation and evidence. The article suggests that the celebrification of judges undermines the rule of law, with the risk of physical harm against judges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant for training first responders in naloxone use, despite recent overdose death declines attributed to wider naloxone access. Experts warn this cut could reverse progress in combating opioid overdoses. The grant supports state and local organizations in training people to use naloxone, administering the medication, and referring patients to treatment. The administration also proposes wider cuts to the Health and Human Services budget, which could dismantle essential services. The Drug Policy Alliance warns these cuts will exacerbate the overdose crisis.</p>

This would roll back a key provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The move aims to offset the cost of tax cuts and protect Medicaid spending. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes with a populist flavor, including raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>
