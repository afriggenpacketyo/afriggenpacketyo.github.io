          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 15:08:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler holds a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final day of The Open Championship at Royal Portrush. A bogey-free third round of 67, including an eagle, positioned him at 14 under par, significantly ahead of his closest competitor, Li Haotong. A victory would mark Scheffler's third major championship and move him closer to a career Grand Slam, a feat few have achieved before the age of 30. Despite strong early charges from Rory McIlroy and others, Scheffler's consistent performance has made him the clear favorite.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to signing Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at his current club since last December. The deal is expected to be an initial loan with an option to buy, which is financially advantageous for the cash-strapped Spanish champions. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona is seeking to strengthen its attack after failing to sign other targets. The article examines the motivations for both clubs and questions whether the 27-year-old English forward can rediscover his top form and truly enhance Barcelona's already potent offense.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated Australia 27-19 in their first Test match in Brisbane, starting the series with a convincing win. The Lions established a dominant early lead, scoring three tries to go up 24-5 shortly after halftime, with fly-half Finn Russell orchestrating the attack effectively. However, the performance leveled off in the final 30 minutes as substitutions disrupted their momentum, allowing Australia to score two late tries. While the victory was secure, analysts noted the flat atmosphere and drop in intensity, suggesting the Lions have more to give in the upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>On the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler, this article revisits the 'Operation Valkyrie' plot led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The bomb planted in a briefcase failed to kill Hitler, leading to the coup's rapid collapse and the execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. Historians reflect on the reasons for its failure, including a lack of support from high-ranking military leaders. The legacy of the plotters has evolved over time, from being seen as traitors to being honored as heroes of the German resistance, despite historical debate over their democratic ideals.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump characterized those demanding the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files as "troublemakers," despite having ordered the Justice Department to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony. In a social media post, Trump suggested that even a full release would not satisfy his critics. This development comes amid widespread public interest and pressure for transparency in the case. A former federal prosecutor noted that grand jury transcripts are often limited and may not reveal significant new information compared to the entire case file, potentially tempering expectations for major revelations.</p>

          <p>Detectives have released new CCTV footage showing a suspect chasing a man with a gun moments after 15-year-old Rene Graham was fatally shot in a west London park last year. Graham was shot in the chest during a music festival at Emslie Horniman's Pleasance Park on July 21, 2024. The footage shows the suspect entering the park, leaving shortly after the shooting, and then pursuing a second individual down the street. Police and the Crimestoppers charity are offering a £20,000 reward for information leading to the killer's identification, urging the community to help bring justice for Rene's family.</p>

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the building collapse in the town of George last year, which killed 34 construction workers, was "entirely preventable." The investigation revealed that multiple red flags, including the use of substandard materials and visible structural cracks, were ignored long before the five-story apartment block fell. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated that work should have been stopped, citing the resignation of a health and safety officer in protest over the issues. A police investigation is ongoing, with calls for criminal accountability for those found negligent.</p>

          <p>On 'The Ramsey Show,' a pregnant stay-at-home mom called for advice on paying off a car loan, but the conversation shifted to her husband's spending habits. She revealed that her husband, who earns $156,000 annually, spends hundreds of dollars monthly on tobacco and marijuana, leaving them struggling to afford groceries. Host Dave Ramsey challenged the caller's handling of the situation, questioning whether it was a budgeting issue or a serious addiction that required intervention. He pointed out that with their income, the spending on vices was not the sole cause of their financial strain but symptomatic of deeper issues.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than originally expected. Muncy, who was injured in a slide on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings without significant discomfort. While initially projected to miss around six weeks, manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism for a much sooner return. Muncy's absence has been felt by the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled recently, making his speedy and effective rehabilitation crucial for the team as they look to regain their form in the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 World Championships was finally awarded their gold medals during a ceremony at the London Diamond League meeting. The team, consisting of Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton, was upgraded from silver after the winning U.S. team was disqualified. The disqualification followed a 2008 confession from U.S. runner Antonio Pettigrew that he had used performance-enhancing drugs. The belated ceremony provided the athletes a moment of recognition in front of a large home crowd, 28 years after the original race.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has reportedly revoked the visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges as part of a campaign to support former president Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is facing trial for an alleged coup attempt, and the U.S. move, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is seen as an attempt to pressure the judiciary. This action follows President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports. Brazilian President Lula has condemned the visa revocations as an affront to national sovereignty, while critics in Brazil suggest the heavy-handed U.S. interference may be backfiring politically.</p>

          <p>The early phase of the earnings season, combined with moderate inflation data, has provided some support for the market, though concerns about potential tariffs persist. While some major companies like Wells Fargo and Abbott Labs saw initial negative stock reactions to their reports, a deeper look reveals underlying strengths and strategic shifts. For example, BlackRock's results, initially viewed as a miss, were later re-evaluated more positively due to strong organic growth. The article suggests that initial market reactions can be short-sighted and that navigating the current economic moment requires a nuanced view of corporate performance. (not investment advice)</p>
