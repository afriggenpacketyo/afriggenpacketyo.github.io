          <p>A refuse collectors' strike in Birmingham has entered its sixth month, leaving residents to contend with overflowing bins and what some describe as "apocalyptic" piles of rubbish. The industrial action by Unite union members began in January over council plans to downgrade roles as part of its efforts to resolve equal pay liabilities. Despite the city's recycling rate being one of the lowest in the country, the council and the union have not yet reached an agreement, leaving services like recycling and green waste collection suspended indefinitely. Residents express frustration over the mounting waste and the lack of accessible disposal options.</p>

          <p>President Trump celebrated the congressional passage of his administration's major tax and spending bill, hailing it as a significant achievement that will stimulate record economic growth. The legislation, which passed the House narrowly, extends tax cuts and increases funding for border security and the military. Trump described the bill as the "biggest of its kind ever signed" and promised it would turn the country's economy into a "rocket ship." The White House echoed this sentiment, stating the package is designed to usher in an era of prosperity by providing substantial tax relief and implementing pro-growth policies.

          <p>In Victorville, California, an infant sustained head injuries after being dropped by their mother during a tragic incident. The mother had allowed her 12-year-old child to move the family car in an apartment complex parking lot while she watched, holding the baby. As the 12-year-old was parking, the car door struck the mother, causing her to fall and drop the infant. The baby was subsequently airlifted to a medical center for treatment. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department is investigating the event as a potential case of child cruelty.</p>

          <p>Veterans, legal scholars, and military family advocates are raising concerns over the Trump administration's deployment of troops to address protests in Los Angeles. Critics argue that using military personnel for domestic law enforcement, even in a support capacity, threatens democratic principles and violates the spirit of the Posse Comitatus Act. Speakers at a virtual news conference highlighted the strain on military families and the inappropriateness of using combat-trained troops in civilian settings. They contend that such actions risk eroding public trust and place service members in situations for which they are not prepared, ultimately weakening the nation's democratic foundations.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that immigrants with no criminal convictions represent the most rapidly growing population within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently detained by ICE have no criminal record, a figure that has almost doubled since May. This trend contradicts administration statements focusing on the removal of violent criminals and indicates a broader enforcement strategy. The article highlights the case of a Guatemalan pastor who was recently deported after 30 years in the U.S. despite having no criminal history, illustrating the policy's human impact.</p>

          <p>Recent staffing cuts within the National Park Service (NPS) are creating potential safety risks for visitors this summer, as exemplified by the lack of lifeguards at Assateague Island National Seashore. The Trump administration's hiring freeze and layoffs have resulted in the loss of 24% of the NPS's permanent staff, according to the National Parks Conservation Association. This has led to fewer seasonal employees, including lifeguards, at a time of peak visitation. While the NPS acknowledges a nationwide lifeguard shortage, critics directly link the understaffing at parks like Assateague to administration policies, expressing fear that it could lead to preventable tragedies.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Los Angeles have charged seven individuals in connection with a sophisticated jewelry heist in Glendale that netted over $1 million in stolen goods. The group, described as a "South American crime ring," allegedly cut a hole in the roof of the targeted jewelry store to gain entry. Authorities stated that during a second, similar attempted break-in in La Verne, the suspects used "signal jammers" and cut utility lines, disabling local internet and emergency services. The seven defendants have been charged with multiple counts, including grand theft, commercial burglary, and cutting a utility line.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the U.S. economy reveals the mixed and uncertain impact of President Trump's aggressive tariff policies implemented earlier this year. While stock markets initially fell, they have since rebounded, though shares of tariff-vulnerable companies remain weak. The article notes that consumer prices have not yet seen a major spike, but many goods facing higher duties have not reached shelves, and economists widely expect customers will eventually bear the cost. With signs of slowing consumer spending and business investment, the economy appears to be in a "wait-and-see mode" as a key tariff deadline approaches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after Keir Starmer's Labour party won a majority, BBC correspondents have assessed its performance across key policy areas, revealing a mixed record. The government has seen some progress, such as resetting relations with the EU and securing a trade deal with India, but has struggled in other areas. Net migration has fallen, but this is largely due to policies from the previous government, and small boat crossings have increased. On the domestic front, the economy has seen minimal growth, a teacher recruitment target has been missed, and significant U-turns on welfare reform have raised questions about the government's priorities and authority.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps is deploying approximately 200 service members to Florida to provide support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This marks the latest instance of the Trump administration utilizing the military to bolster its immigration enforcement activities. According to U.S. Northern Command, the Marines will perform non-law enforcement duties, such as administrative and logistical tasks, and are prohibited from direct contact with detainees. The move is part of a broader authorization for up to 700 military personnel to assist ICE in several states as the agency's capacity is stretched by a surge in detentions.</p>

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with the removal of eight noncitizens who were being held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The ruling clears the way for the men to be sent to South Sudan, a country with which they have no known ties. This decision follows a previous Supreme Court order that lifted a lower court's injunction, effectively removing due process requirements that had blocked such third-country deportations. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration's policy of deporting certain immigrants to countries other than their own.</p>

He argued that the bill's deep cuts to programs like Medicaid would be devastating for children, seniors, and people with disabilities. The marathon speech delayed the final vote and served as a high-profile platform for Democratic opposition to the administration's signature domestic policy.</p>

The court will hear cases from Idaho and West Virginia, two of the 27 states that have enacted such bans. Supporters argue the laws are necessary to ensure fair competition, while opponents contend they are discriminatory and violate the Constitution and Title IX. The decision to take up this highly divisive cultural issue follows a recent ruling that upheld bans on gender-affirming care for minors, signaling a potentially difficult path for opponents of the sports bans.</p>

Critics, including the NAACP which has filed a lawsuit, argue that the generators emit harmful pollutants and that the decision ignores the health of the predominantly Black surrounding neighborhoods. xAI stated its facility will use state-of-the-art emissions control technology.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative David Valadao of California is facing intense criticism for voting in favor of President Trump's major spending bill, which is expected to significantly cut Medicaid funding. This is particularly controversial as roughly two-thirds of his Central Valley constituents rely on the program, known as Medi-Cal. Despite previously vowing to oppose harmful cuts, Valadao supported the bill, citing negotiated concessions for rural hospitals and agriculture. Democrats have already seized on the vote, labeling it a betrayal of his district and vowing to make it a central issue in their efforts to unseat him in the 2026 election.</p>

New work requirements for Medicaid recipients are set to begin in 2026, while changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could start this year. On the tax side, new deductions for tips and overtime will be reflected in 2026 filings, and an increased cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction will also be available.
