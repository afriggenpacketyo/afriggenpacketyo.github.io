          <h2>Bryan Kohberger Receives Four Life Sentences for Idaho Student Murders</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bryan Kohberger was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without parole after pleading guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The sentencing hearing featured emotional victim impact statements from the families and surviving roommates, confronting Kohberger who declined to speak. Judge Steven Hippler condemned Kohberger as a "faceless coward" and expressed that a motive for the senseless killings may never be known. The plea deal allowed Kohberger to avoid the death penalty but required him to waive his right to appeal.</p>

          <p>A high-pressure system known as a heat dome is causing dangerous temperatures for over 160 million Americans. This weather phenomenon occurs when sinking air compresses and heats up, while also preventing cloud formation, trapping hot air over a region for an extended period. The situation is exacerbated by high humidity, partly from moisture drawn from the Gulf of Mexico and evaporated from saturated soil and crops. Climate change has made such heat waves more intense, prolonged, and at least five times more likely, with nighttime temperatures warming especially fast.</p>

          <p>A murder investigation has been launched in Maguiresbridge, Northern Ireland, after a woman and her two children were fatally shot. Police were called to a residence on Wednesday morning where they discovered the victims; a fourth family member, an adult male, is being treated for serious injuries. Authorities described the scene as "harrowing" and stated they are not currently seeking any suspects, indicating a potential murder-suicide scenario. The local community and a Gaelic football club, of which the victims were active members, have expressed profound shock and grief over the tragedy.</p>

          <p>At 95, Clint Eastwood maintains his vitality through a disciplined lifestyle he has followed for decades, according to celebrity biographer Shawn Levy. The actor and director is described as a "lifelong gym rat" who has adhered to an organic, low-fat diet since the 1950s, long before such habits were mainstream. Another key practice for Eastwood has been daily Transcendental Meditation, which he has reportedly done twice a day since the 1970s, even while on film sets. These routines present a contrast to the rugged, tough-guy characters he often portrays on screen.</p>

In her testimony, Benefield claimed her husband lunged at her, forcing her to shoot.

Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has proposed a model of selective conscription, which has raised concerns from employer associations about its impact on the labor force. Economists suggest the effect depends on the scale, with a small draft having minimal impact but a full-scale conscription potentially harming the economy.

          <p>The son of a British couple killed in the Air India plane crash in June has stated that the wrong remains were included in his mother's casket when it was returned to the UK. Miten Patel expressed his distress after a coroner identified the mix-up, raising concerns about how many other victims' remains might be affected. The report follows similar allegations from another family, prompting India's foreign ministry to state that it is working with UK officials to address the issue. The ministry asserted that all remains were handled with "utmost professionalism" according to established protocols.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has opened an investigation into Harvard University's eligibility to sponsor visas under the Exchange Visitor Program. This move is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration targeting the university. While the department did not specify any alleged violations, it stated that visa sponsorship is a "privilege" that can be lost. Harvard condemned the probe as a "retaliatory step" that violates its First Amendment rights, continuing a legal battle that has seen the administration attempt to restrict federal funding and revoke the school's ability to host foreign academics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first six months of the second Trump presidency, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out over 300,000 deportations for the year. This would be the highest annual total since the Obama administration in 2014, according to internal data. The surge follows a reversal of previous limits on immigration arrests and a significant expansion of those eligible for deportation. While the number is a marked increase, it still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, highlighting the operational challenges of such a large-scale effort.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:08:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate experts are skeptical that eliminating or raising the exemption for capital gains tax on home sales, a proposal floated by President Trump, would solve the nation's housing affordability crisis. While the National Association of Realtors argues the tax discourages some homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling and adding inventory to the market, analysts say it's not the primary issue. The current tax affects a relatively small number of sellers with high-value homes or those who have owned for decades. Analysts suggest that broader economic instability and a lack of consumer confidence are bigger obstacles for the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government is facing significant public and international criticism after President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law that curtails the independence of the country's main anti-corruption agencies. The law places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) under the control of the presidentially-appointed prosecutor general. This move has sparked the largest anti-government protests since the 2022 invasion and drawn concern from Western allies, who view the fight against corruption as a core requirement for Ukraine's potential EU membership. Zelensky has since acknowledged the public anger.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a method using gene editing that could render mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria. By making a precise change to a single amino acid in a mosquito's genome, scientists were able to largely prevent the malaria parasite from completing its journey to the insect's salivary glands. The study, published in Nature, demonstrated that this genetic tweak could be rapidly spread through a laboratory mosquito population using a gene drive. While the technology is still years from field testing and faces controversy, it represents a potential new tool in the global fight against the deadly disease.</p>
