          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, also a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested by ICE agents at a federal immigration court in Lower Manhattan while observing court proceedings. According to Lander's office, he was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of the courthouse. Lander stated he was assisting people to avoid ICE arrests, while DHS claimed Lander assaulted law enforcement. Lander was later released without charges, criticizing the treatment of immigrants and accusing Donald Trump of targeting Democratic cities to provoke conflict. The incident sparked outrage from officials like Gov. Kathy Hochul and the ACLU, who condemned it as an abuse of power and a threat to democracy.</p>

The Democratic primary for lieutenant governor remains undecided, while Abigail Spanberger will run for governor against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears.

Democrats are aiming to regain control of state government, facing challenges despite historical trends favoring the party of the sitting president in Virginia.

          <p>President Trump's potential involvement in strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities has revealed a deep split among his supporters. While Trump campaigned against "endless wars," he also maintained Iran couldn't possess nuclear weapons, leading to conflicting views within his party. Some Republicans, like Congressman Thomas Massie, are joining Democrats to block unauthorized military action, while others, including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, advocate for non-intervention. This divide has sparked heated debates, with Trump criticizing Carlson and loyalists like Marjorie Taylor Greene defending him, illustrating the tensions between isolationist and hawkish factions within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose their identified gender and select "X" on passport applications, expanding an earlier decision that only applied to original plaintiffs. The lawsuit, backed by the ACLU, argued the policy was discriminatory against transgender and nonbinary individuals, reversing a previous Biden administration policy. While the White House criticized the ruling as pushing radical gender ideology, the ACLU hailed it as a victory for privacy and dignity, pledging to continue fighting the policy.</p>

This consideration follows allegations from Israel that Iran is rapidly advancing its nuclear weapons program, though U.S. intelligence assessments earlier this year suggested Iran was not actively building such weapons. While there is no full agreement among Trump's advisors on how to proceed, the matter was discussed in a White House meeting with national security officials. Trump has not ruled out U.S. involvement, and his recent social media posts have raised questions about the extent of U.S. participation in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan asserts that President Trump's policies have led to the most secure border in U.S. history, citing a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day. Homan contrasted this with the Biden administration, which he claims released the "vast majority" of encountered immigrants into the U.S. He advocated for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to further solidify these gains and implement a large-scale deportation operation. Homan's claims highlight a trend of reduced illegal immigration under Trump, attributing it to stricter border enforcement measures compared to the Biden years.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments regarding California's challenge to President Trump's federalization of the state's National Guard troops amid protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The judges indicated they might have limited power to rule against the president's authority to deploy troops, with the federal government arguing Trump acted within his discretion due to violent riots. California contends the deployment disrupts critical state work and defies state sovereignty, while the judges seemed skeptical of the clarity of requirements for gubernatorial consultation.

A study mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, finding that many could find new homes in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis should guide the government in ensuring Marine Protected Areas continue to protect species as they change habitat, considering the UK seas are warming faster than most globally.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, the Trump administration is weighing diplomatic and military options, signaling that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical. Despite saber-rattling rhetoric, U.S. negotiators believe Iran is in a weak position and may be forced to negotiate a deal to abandon nuclear enrichment. The U.S. military is sending assets to the region, adopting a defensive posture while keeping options open for assisting Israel. A key question is whether the U.S. will deploy B-2 stealth bombers capable of destroying Iran's underground nuclear facility at Fordo.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell 1.7% year-over-year in May, marking the sharpest decline in eight months, attributed to ongoing trade uncertainties and declining shipments to the U.S. and China. Automobile exports to the U.S. plummeted by 24.7%, raising concerns about the impact of potential tariffs. The Bank of Japan acknowledged that trade factors are likely to moderate growth, leading to a slowdown in overseas economies and reduced domestic corporate profits. Falling exports have contributed to a contraction in Japan's GDP, with the country's economy shrinking 0.2% in the quarter ending March. (not investment advice)</p>
