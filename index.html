          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers staged a dramatic four-run rally in the seventh inning to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3, taking a commanding 2-0 lead in the National League Division Series. Phillies pitcher Jesús Luzardo had dominated, retiring 17 consecutive batters, until Freddie Freeman's hustle double sparked the decisive inning, leading to his exit. Key plays included aggressive baserunning and crucial two-out RBIs from Will Smith and Shohei Ohtani, silencing the previously raucous home crowd. Despite a late scare in the ninth inning, the Dodgers closed out the game, leaving them one victory away from advancing to the NL Championship Series.</p>

Universities across the UK, including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Bristol, are preparing for these rallies. Starmer emphasized the importance of standing united against hatred and respecting the solemn anniversary, stating the day has been used as a "despicable excuse to attack British Jews."</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying over the Pacific Ocean off southwest Mexico, with forecasts predicting it could reach Category 2 and potentially major hurricane status within the next couple of days before weakening. The Mexican government has issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Sur, stretching from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lozaro. Although expected to remain several hundred miles offshore, the storm is projected to bring heavy rains of 2-6 inches to parts of southwestern Mexico, posing a risk of flash flooding, especially in higher terrain. Swells generated by Priscilla are also expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast, urging caution for residents.</p>

          <p>Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 plummeted to nearly 238,000 apprehensions, marking the lowest annual level since 1970, according to internal federal statistics. This dramatic reduction, almost ten times lower than the record highs under the Biden administration, is attributed to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies. These measures include sealing and militarizing the border, closing the asylum system using emergency powers, and conducting highly publicized operations targeting those living in the U.S. illegally. While hailed by the White House as a success in border security, these policies have drawn significant backlash from civil liberties groups and Democrats who decry them as inhumane and unconstitutional.

Governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill, inspired by a legislative aide whose newborn was disturbed by blaring ads, aiming to bring "peace and quiet" to California households.

          <p>The FBI analyzed the phone records of more than half a dozen Republican lawmakers in 2023 as part of its investigation into efforts by President Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results, according to information released by GOP senators. The scrutinized data, authorized by a grand jury, included call dates and times but not content, spanning several days around January 6, 2021. Senators, including Chuck Grassley, expressed "grave concerns" about this "violation of personal property" and "weaponization of the government," calling for accountability. The special counsel's investigation, later abandoned due to Trump's re-election, had delved into calls between lawmakers and the president on January 6, alleging attempts to delay certification.</p>

          <p>Bill Nye, "the Science Guy" and CEO of The Planetary Society, joined hundreds on Capitol Hill to protest the Trump administration's proposed 25% budget cuts to NASA for fiscal year 2026. Nye warned that such cuts, reducing funding from $24 billion to $18.8 billion, would cause the U.S. to "cede leadership to other countries," particularly China, in space exploration. He emphasized NASA's vital role, arguing its budget is a small fraction of federal spending with an extraordinary return on investment, citing GPS and mobile phones as examples of cosmic exploration benefits. Nye stressed the "priceless" value of discovering extraterrestrial life and the economic benefits of space exploration, urging Congress to promote scientific progress.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would consider pardons for both Sean "Diddy" Combs, recently sentenced to over four years for prostitution-related charges, and Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted of sexual assault trafficking. Trump, who referred to Combs as "Puff Daddy," confirmed Combs had requested a pardon. Regarding Maxwell, he bafflingly claimed he hadn't "heard the name in so long" despite her high-profile case and the Supreme Court's recent denial of her appeal hours earlier. Trump's comments come amidst renewed scrutiny of his connections to Maxwell and the late Jeffrey Epstein, with critics urging the release of "Epstein files" and warning that public statements might incentivize Maxwell.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a financial aid package exceeding $10 billion for U.S. farmers, particularly soybean farmers, who have been severely impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans. Discussions involving the Treasury and Agriculture Departments are in early stages, with top economic adviser Kevin Hassett promising "big measures" soon to address the overflowing silos of soybeans. President Trump previously suggested using tariff revenue to support farmers, stating, "We're going to make sure that our farmers are in great shape." The aid aims to mitigate the economic effects of China's lack of U.S. soybean purchases, which totaled $12.6 billion in the previous year, as harvest season gets underway. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Renewable energy sources, including nuclear power, collectively surpassed coal as the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year, a historic first according to Ember, a global energy think tank. Growth in solar and wind power met 100% of the increased electricity demand, even contributing to a slight decline in fossil fuel use globally. While developing countries, especially China, led this clean energy charge with massive capacity additions, some richer nations like the US and EU saw increased reliance on fossil fuels due to demand growth outpacing clean energy or weak performance. This moment is deemed a "crucial turning point," with solar power driving the largest share of growth globally due to dramatic cost reductions.</p>

          <p>Job center work coaches in England report significant struggles in finding employers willing to accommodate disabled people and those with long-term health conditions, hindering their entry into the workforce. New data indicates a falling "into-work rate" for benefits claimants, reaching 7.6% in the year to April 2025, below pre-pandemic levels, with disabled people facing the most difficulty. Work coaches, facing increased caseloads and shortened appointment times, feel "fighting with one arm behind your back," with a declining number of staff. The Department for Work & Pensions acknowledges the issue, promising reforms and increased employment support funding, but the disability employment rate has not improved since 2019, reflecting persistent challenges in the system.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's Kano state has enacted a sweeping ban on chainsaw usage for cutting, felling, or trimming trees, aiming to protect natural resources and combat deforestation. The new law imposes strict fines of 250,000 Nigerian naira ($168), escalating to 500,000 naira and potential imprisonment for consistent violations. Enforcement will be a collaborative effort involving security agencies, local government authorities, traditional institutions, and community forest monitors. Commercial chainsaw operators can apply for annual licenses under the Chainsaw Usage Permit Framework, with a key condition requiring two to three new saplings for every tree removed as part of a reforestation plan. This initiative reflects a growing global trend towards criminalizing environmental destruction.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities, detailing the legal challenges and protests that have ensued. A federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked deployments to Portland, citing "resistance to government overreach" and rejecting the administration's circumvention attempts. Illinois also filed a lawsuit, though a judge declined an immediate restraining order, with Texas National Guard troops reportedly en route. Governors in affected states, like Illinois' JB Pritzker, have accused the Trump administration of a "military-style invasion" and fueling crises, while Trump characterized cities as "war zones" to justify his actions, highlighting a significant constitutional debate over federal intervention in local affairs.</p>

          <p>UK pharmacies are experiencing "major issues" and patient anger due to widespread confusion over tightened Covid jab eligibility criteria. Many patients are booking appointments only to discover they are no longer eligible, as free boosters are now restricted to those 75 and older or younger patients with weakened immune systems. Community Pharmacy England reports that between a third and half of patients are being turned away, leading to upset, concern, and even abusive behavior towards staff. NHS England has since updated its website to clarify the new criteria, but pharmacists believe more proactive communication was needed to prevent the distress and manage public expectations, especially given last year's broader program.</p>

          <p>New research has found a link between long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO2), a major pollutant from mining fossil fuels and combustion, and an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study, prompted by a higher incidence of ALS cases in New Brunswick, Canada, compared 304 ALS patients to 1,207 healthy individuals, correlating their exposure to environmental records from their home addresses. Researchers found subjects had a 23% higher chance of an ALS diagnosis with increased SO2 exposure, even within Canada's clean air guidelines. While the study shows association, not causation, it underscores the need for further research and improved regulatory intervention on air pollution exposure levels for public health.</p>
