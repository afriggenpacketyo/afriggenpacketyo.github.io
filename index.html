          <p>Newly appointed German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made a swift inaugural visit to Brussels, engaging in high-level meetings with European leaders to emphasize Germany's commitment to addressing global challenges collaboratively. Merz prioritized supporting new trade agreements, de-escalating tariff disputes with the United States, curbing irregular migration, and strengthening Europe's defense posture. He stressed the need for a unified European voice, particularly on defense, and advocated for pragmatic approaches to joint procurement and arms development within the NATO framework. While his efforts were welcomed by international partners, critics in Germany expressed concerns about abandoning fiscal orthodoxy and the potential for political flashpoints surrounding migration policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is holding a bail hearing for Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate detained by ICE after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration, with Ozturk appearing remotely from Louisiana and testifying about her health risks. Her lawyers argued that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, as she was accused of criticizing Israel and participating in pro-Palestinian protests. Tufts president Sunil Kumar defended Ozturk, stating the university had no information to support the allegations against her. Ozturk's lawyers cited her suffering from multiple asthma attacks in ICE detention with limited medical attention, while prosecutors maintained she was a flight risk and a danger to the community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia after withdrawing Ed Martin's nomination. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and her history as a top District Attorney in New York. Pirro, a staunch Trump supporter who was previously the district attorney for Westchester County, New York, replaces Martin, who will now be the Director of the Weaponization Working Group, Associate Deputy Attorney General, and Pardon Attorney at the Department of Justice. Pirro's appointment has been met with mixed reactions, with some hoping she will focus on fighting violent crime while others fear she will focus on prosecuting the President's enemies.</p>

          <p>The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in San Francisco experienced a major shutdown during the Friday morning commute due to a computer networking problem, causing significant disruptions for over 170,000 passengers. The outage affected all 50 stations, forcing commuters to seek alternative transportation such as carpools, buses, and ferries. While train service resumed after several hours, major delays were expected throughout the day. This incident compounds BART's ongoing challenges in attracting riders post-pandemic, as passenger traffic remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels due to remote work trends.</p>

Experts emphasize that even for those not joining the military, the test can be an excellent way to gauge overall fitness.

This follows a similar outage last week that led to flight delays and cancellations.

The cultural nostalgia for factory work often overlooks the violent struggles for union activity and fair wages. While politicians on both sides of the aisle have focused on bringing back manufacturing jobs, the reality of American manufacturing today involves highly automated processes that require fewer human workers. President Trump's policies, including import tariffs and immigration policies, may have limited impact on bringing factory jobs back.</p>

          <p>Lyft shares climbed 23% Friday after the ride-sharing company upped its share buyback plan and posted better-than-expected gross bookings. CEO David Risher stated that Lyft is not seeing "anything to worry about" despite widespread concerns of a slowing consumer amid ongoing economic uncertainty. Gross bookings grew 13% from a year ago to $4.16 billion, and rides increased 16% to 218.4 million. The board also authorized boosting Lyft's share repurchase plan to $750 million from $500 million. The company said it aims to use $500 million over the next year.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport suffered another brief air traffic control outage Friday, capping another week full of problems for travelers heading to and from New Jersey.

Competing companies like OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying Chrome if it were put up for sale. Judge Amit P.

The sycamore, planted in the 1800s and featured in "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," was a beloved symbol of the area and a popular site for tourists. Adam Carruthers and Daniel Graham, who face up to 10 years in prison, provided no explanation for their actions.
