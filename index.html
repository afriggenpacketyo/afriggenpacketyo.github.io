          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing stockpiled rice directly to retailers, resulting in cheaper prices for consumers. Ito-Yokado and Iris Ohyama were the first to sell the rice at approximately $15 for a 5-kilogram bag, with some stores selling out within minutes. Consumers have expressed relief at the lower prices, noting little difference in taste from newly harvested rice. This effort aims to combat soaring rice prices affecting households, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 harvests being made available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's ambitious plan to impose tariffs on major trading partners faces significant hurdles, including legal challenges and market resistance. An obscure New York court blocked his signature trade policy, leading to a potential Supreme Court battle. Despite Trump's claim that "tariffs are easy," his administration has encountered delays, exemptions, and market panic, forcing them to backtrack on numerous occasions. A federal court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize blanket tariffs, causing further confusion for businesses navigating the global economy under Trump.</p>

          <p>Brazil's environmental movement is under threat as President Lula appears to be siding with the oil industry over environmental concerns. Environment Minister Marina Silva was publicly attacked in a senate meeting for her efforts to protect Brazil's natural resources. Lula's administration has shown support for oil exploration in the Amazon, undermining Silva's efforts and leading to legislative defeats for environmental protections. This shift raises concerns about Brazil's commitment to achieving zero deforestation by 2030.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax bill includes a 3.5% tax on remittances made by non-US citizens, which could significantly impact African economies. Remittances are a crucial source of income for many African families, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. Experts warn that the tax could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to avoid the levy, reducing the flow of recorded financial transfers. The policy is viewed as part of the Trump administration's efforts to curb illegal migration, potentially harming low-income migrants and their families.</p>
