          <p>Three former Memphis police officers convicted in the Tyre Nichols case are set to receive a new trial after a judge's remarks raised concerns about potential bias. U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman cited comments made by Judge Mark S. Norris regarding possible gang affiliation within the police department as creating a risk of bias. This decision forces the officers, prosecutors, and the Nichols family to revisit the traumatic events surrounding Nichols' death and the subsequent legal proceedings. The case, which involves charges of obstruction of justice and civil rights violations, has sparked national protests and calls for police reform, thrusting Memphis into the spotlight once again. The article reflects the complexities and continued legal battles surrounding the Tyre Nichols case. </p>

Before this move, she was an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a member of the NIH climate and health scholars cohort. Her move to Smart as a senior research fellow at the Institute of Human Immunology was announced on Smart's social media. The US medical research agency Wang Leyao was previously a part of has faced controversy since the start of President Donald Trump's second term, resulting in funding cuts and policy shifts.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to expand fast-track deportations nationwide, citing due process concerns for migrants. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb halted a directive that broadened the expedited removal policy to apply anywhere in the country to those who arrived within the past two years. This policy had allowed immigration officials to quickly deport migrants without allowing them to see an immigration judge, unless they claimed asylum. Cobb emphasized that the government must afford due process when applying the statute to a large group of people living in the interior of the country. The ruling marks a setback for the administration's mass deportation efforts, though the Department of Homeland Security has stated they will continue to exercise their authority under federal law. </p>

          <p>The ongoing equity rally in China has caught the attention of retail and overseas investors, who are seeking better investment alternatives. Chinese stocks recently hit a 10-year high, signaling that the rally could continue as overseas investors return to the nation’s onshore and offshore equities. Domestic investors are also rotating out of fixed-income products due to record-low yields, and Beijing is pushing for technological innovation. The article suggests that Chinese equities offer undervalued innovation, including advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics, making them attractive to global asset managers.

          <p>Live-fire military training has caused hundreds of wildfires across the UK countryside since 2023, with unexploded shells making it difficult to tackle them. Figures show that 385 out of 439 wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land were caused by present-day army maneuvers. The MoD states it has a robust wildfire policy and monitors risk levels. However, locals feel the MoD needs to do more to prevent fires, including banning live fire training in the driest months. The article highlights the environmental and health risks posed by these wildfires. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked Donald Trump’s plans to end protections for 600,000 people from Venezuela who have permission to live and work in the U.S., citing that the plaintiffs are likely to win their claim that the president’s administration’s actions were unlawful. The court upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status for Venezuelans. The judges found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior extension of TPS. The article notes that the Trump administration's move was part of a broader effort to reduce the number of immigrants in the country. </p>

          <p>Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has criticized the Trump administration's reported plan to send military troops to Chicago, calling it an "invasion." Pritzker stated that the administration has not communicated with his state about the plan and argued that President Trump has ulterior motives beyond cracking down on crime. He suggested that the deployment could be part of a plan to interfere with elections. The White House has rejected Pritzker's accusations and criticized the city's crime rate. </p>

          <p>Millions of dollars in political TV ads are expected to start airing in California to influence voters on a November ballot measure concerning congressional redistricting.

Opposition to the measure has booked more than $10 million in airtime, while supporters have booked at least $2 million. The campaign is expected to be expensive and will focus on the special election in November. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled $4.9 billion of congressionally approved foreign aid funding, announcing that he would "put AMERICA FIRST!" The move involves withholding funding for 15 international programs and has been met with opposition from Democratic lawmakers. Trump bypassed Congress using a "pocket rescission," a procedure that has not been used in nearly 50 years. Democrats argue that the cuts increase the likelihood of a federal shutdown later in the year. </p>
