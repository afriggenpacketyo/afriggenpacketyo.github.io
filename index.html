          <p>Across the United States, activists and advocacy groups organized "No Kings" protests to voice opposition to President Trump's administration policies, including immigration enforcement and militarization of cities. Millions participated, expressing concerns about authoritarianism and abuses of power. Speakers like Bill Nye and Senator Adam Schiff addressed crowds, emphasizing the importance of speaking out against perceived injustices. Republicans criticized the protests, framing them as anti-American and blaming them for prolonging the government shutdown. The protests were organized by a coalition of groups, with celebrities like Jane Fonda and John Legend slated to participate, advocating for immigrant rights and against government overreach. The protests were a demonstration of dissent against the current administration. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and the White House engaged in a heated dispute over the 250th-anniversary celebration of the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton. Newsom criticized the event, particularly the live-fire demonstration, as a "dangerous" show of force, and announced the temporary closure of a section of Interstate 5. The White House accused Newsom of distorting the facts, stating that the highway closure was his decision and that the Marine Corps had not requested it. The exchange highlighted ongoing tensions between Newsom and the Trump administration, with each side accusing the other of endangering public safety and misrepresenting the situation. The political conflict underscores the deep divisions between state and federal authorities. </p>

          <p>A major Southern California freeway, the 5 Freeway, was temporarily closed for a live-fire exercise at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance, despite initial assurances from the Marine Corps that no public highways would be affected. The closure caused significant disruptions for commuters, affecting tens of thousands of drivers and Amtrak train service. The Marine Corps later stated that it did not request the closure, while Governor Gavin Newsom's office cited safety concerns related to live munitions being fired over the freeway as the reason for the decision. The event, marking the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, sparked controversy over public safety and political motivations. The incident highlights the complexities of coordinating military exercises with civilian infrastructure. </p>

          <p>Democrats in Congress have criticized the Trump administration's decision to purchase two Gulfstream G700 jets for $172 million for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during the government shutdown. The U.S. Coast Guard entered into a sole-source contract for the jets, citing the need to replace an aging aircraft. Democrats argue that the priority should be on equipping the Coast Guard to meet mission requirements, not on executive comfort. Representative Bennie Thompson called for an investigation into the purchase, noting that Congress had previously rejected a similar request.

          <p>Moldova has made strides in LGBTQ+ equality, but discrimination remains a major issue. The Queer Cafe in Chisinau provides a welcoming space for the community, offering a choir, movie nights, and workshops. Despite legalizing homosexuality in 1995, societal attitudes lag, particularly in rural areas. Pro-Russia parties have used anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, leading to increased hate messages and violence. The Queer Cafe has faced threats and vandalism, highlighting the ongoing challenges to visibility and safety. </p>

          <p>Popular food trends like Dubai chocolate, matcha tea, and quinoa are having negative environmental impacts. The demand for pistachios, a key ingredient in Dubai chocolate, is draining water resources in producing countries. Matcha mania is leading to shortages and price increases, affecting traditional tea ceremonies in Japan. The quinoa craze has resulted in over-cultivation and soil degradation in the Andes. Fair trade organizations advise producers to diversify crops and avoid dependence on single commodities. There needs to be more sustainable thinking. </p>

          <p>After a 2-2 draw with Dundee United, Rangers' dismal start to the season continues, prompting questions about the team's mentality. Interim manager Steven Smith lamented repeated problems and a lack of consistency. The team's inability to maintain momentum and match the opposition's aggression has been a recurring issue. This is not the first time Rangers' mentality has been questioned. Repairing Rangers' vulnerability poses a significant challenge to whoever is the next permanent head coach. </p>

          <p>Tia Levings recounts her experience escaping Christian Patriarchy and church-sanctioned abuse within the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC). Her husband, influenced by Doug Wilson's teachings, sought to enforce dominion theology and federalism, leading to a chilling conflation of theology and control. She was expected to submit to her husband in all aspects of life, and was subjected to marital discipline. The author emphasizes the dangers of Christian Patriarchy and its thirst for dominion, warning that these once-private abuses matter to mainstream America. The author now speaks out against these practices and their impact on women's lives. </p>
