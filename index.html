          <p>The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is facing a critical challenge: achieving fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel problems without extensive prior training.

However, a new, more challenging version of the test, ARC-AGI-2, highlights the ongoing need for advancements in AI reasoning capabilities.</p>
