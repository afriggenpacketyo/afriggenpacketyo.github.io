          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a nationwide injunction, blocking the Trump administration's policy to expand fast-track deportations across the country. The ruling cites significant due process concerns, stating that the government's current procedures for removing migrants living in the interior of the U.S. are insufficient. While the judge did not question the constitutionality of expedited removal at the border, she found its application to a much larger group of people who have been in the country for up to two years requires greater legal protections. The Department of Homeland Security has stated its intent to appeal the decision, asserting it falls within the president's legal authority.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic advanced to the fourth round of the U.S. Open after defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match. Despite struggling with a lower back injury that required a medical timeout, the 24-time Grand Slam champion fought back to secure a 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 victory. The win ends British singles participation in the tournament. Norrie expressed that he may have become 'a little overconfident' after breaking Djokovic early in the third set. Djokovic, who served 18 aces, continues his quest for a record 25th major title and becomes the oldest man to reach the fourth round since 1991.</p>

          <p>South Korean authorities have indicted former first lady Kim Keon Hee on multiple charges, including bribery and stock market manipulation. She is accused of accumulating over $720,000 in criminal proceeds through an illicit stock scheme and accepting bribes in exchange for political support. Kim is the wife of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was recently impeached and arrested over his attempt to declare martial law. The indictment is part of a broader investigation into Yoon's administration, which he had previously sought to block while in office. The probes have reportedly caused friction with the U.S., which expressed concern over raids on a joint military base.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have reported a 'massive attack' by Russian forces on the central Dnipropetrovsk region early Saturday morning. The regional governor confirmed that explosions were heard in the cities of Dnipro and Pavlograd, urging residents to take shelter. This assault represents an escalation in a region that has, until recently, largely avoided the heaviest fighting since Russia's full-scale invasion began. The attack comes as Kyiv confirmed that Russian troops had entered the region earlier in the week, signaling a new focus for Moscow's offensive operations. The White House continues to express hope for peace negotiations between the two nations.</p>

Analysts view the move as a strategic signal from the U.S. and Japan directed at China, particularly concerning a potential conflict over Taiwan. According to Japanese media, the ground-based missile system will be stationed at a U.S. base in Yamaguchi prefecture for the duration of the exercises before being withdrawn.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has fired a Justice Department paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making a vulgar gesture and uttering obscenities at National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. In the termination memo, Bondi cited the employee's 'inappropriate conduct' as the reason for her immediate removal from federal service. A department spokesperson reinforced the decision, stating that those who do not support law enforcement may not be a good fit for the agency. The incident occurred amid the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to the capital to address what the president has declared a 'crime emergency,' a move contested by local officials.</p>

          <p>An intense political battle over congressional redistricting is escalating, with California and Texas at the forefront of a national partisan arms race. After Texas Republicans passed a new map to create five more GOP-favored seats, California Democrats countered with a proposal to add five Democratic seats, aiming to neutralize the move. The conflict, which has now drawn in Missouri, involves the unusual step of redrawing congressional districts mid-decade to gain a partisan advantage ahead of the midterm elections. This struggle highlights the contentious practice of gerrymandering and its significant impact on the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

However, the court has paused the immediate effect of its ruling to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.

          <p>Investigators in Tennessee have concluded that the late Sheriff Buford Pusser, whose anti-crime crusade inspired the movie 'Walking Tall,' murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. A cold case review by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found major inconsistencies between Pusser's account of an ambush and the physical evidence. Authorities now believe Pusser shot his wife outside their car, staged the scene, and inflicted a wound on himself to support his story. The district attorney stated that if Pusser were alive today, he would face an indictment, bringing a shocking conclusion to a case that shaped a law enforcement legend.</p>

          <p>Major pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens are now limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines in certain states, requiring prescriptions for some patients or not offering the shots at all. This change is in response to varying state guidelines following the FDA's approval of the 2025-2026 vaccines for seniors but only for younger individuals with specific health conditions. For example, CVS stated it cannot vaccinate patients even with a prescription in states like Massachusetts and Nevada due to local laws. The shifting regulatory landscape creates a complex patchwork of vaccine availability across the country, with policies subject to change at any time.</p>

The simple, positive gesture has been warmly received, with his parents expressing surprise at the strong and heartwarming reaction from the public.

          <p>Julia Roberts' new film, 'After The Hunt,' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to a divided reception from critics. The movie follows a college professor, played by Roberts, caught between a student who accuses a fellow professor of sexual assault and the accused colleague. The film deliberately avoids presenting a clear victim or perpetrator, casting doubt on both accounts to provoke debate. Roberts defended the film's ambiguity, stating the goal is to challenge audiences and encourage conversation about complex issues. While Roberts' performance has been praised, some critics found the film's messaging on its sensitive subject matter to be troubling and outdated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open suggests that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication too rapidly, counter to clinical guidelines. Researchers from Stanford Medicine examined the health records of nearly 10,000 children and found that 68% received medication before age 7, with 42% being prescribed drugs within just 30 days of their diagnosis. Experts emphasize that behavioral intervention should be the first line of treatment for young children, as medication can have side effects like irritability and emotional problems. The study highlights a need to investigate the appropriateness of early medication for this age group.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol will assume protection duties for former Vice President Kamala Harris after the Trump administration revoked her Secret Service detail. The decision to end the federally provided security, which was set to expire on Monday, prompted California officials to arrange for state-level dignitary protection. Former vice presidents typically receive six months of protection, but Harris's detail had been extended by the previous administration. Critics, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, have condemned the move as a vindictive political act that puts the former Vice President in danger, especially as she is about to begin a multi-city book tour.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is reportedly considering measures to speed up the reinstatement process for service members who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Sources indicate that officials are also weighing whether to grant honorable discharges to those whose only infraction was vaccine refusal, which would make their return to service easier. The move comes amid frustration from veterans over the slow and difficult process to rejoin the military after the Biden-era mandate was rescinded in 2023. A listening session with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to address the delays and concerns from the approximately 8,700 troops who left the military over the mandate.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson offered a response after California Governor Gavin Newsom suggested that if President Trump wants to deploy troops to address crime, he should consider states like Louisiana with higher murder rates. Appearing on Fox News, Johnson deflected by calling Newsom an attention-seeker and stated that his hometown of Shreveport has made gradual progress in reducing crime. The exchange highlights the politicization of crime rates, as Newsom used the comparison to criticize Trump's focus on deploying federal forces to predominantly Democratic-led cities. Johnson reiterated that crime is an issue in cities across America that his party intends to address.</p>

Critics and former officials have expressed grave concerns over Kennedy's leadership and vaccine policies, which they argue lack scientific integrity and could undermine public health.

          <p>Missouri's Republican governor has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts, aiming to create a map more favorable to the GOP. The proposed changes specifically target a Kansas City-area district currently held by a Democrat, extending it into more conservative rural areas. This move makes Missouri the third state, following Texas and California, to engage in a mid-decade redistricting battle for partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The action aligns with former President Trump's call for Republican-led states to reshape district lines to help the party maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and approximately 80 other officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to their efforts to seek unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and for undermining peace efforts. The move, praised by Israel, is highly unusual as the U.S. is generally obligated to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters. The Palestinian Authority condemned the ban as a violation of international law and urged the U.S. to reverse its decision.</p>
