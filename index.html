          <p>Universal has submitted planning documents for a new theme park in Bedford, UK, that could include rides up to 115 meters (377ft) high, potentially making them the tallest in Europe. The company is seeking a special development order to bypass local planning procedures and aims to compete with other major European attractions by building taller rides on a constrained land area. The proposal includes hotels, extensive parking, and significant transport infrastructure upgrades, such as a new A421 junction and an expanded Wixams train station, with a target opening date of 2031. The park anticipates 8.5 million annual visitors and the creation of 8,500 local jobs upon opening.</p>

          <p>An American novelist, Eleonor "Gay" Courter, and her husband may face trial in France for their alleged involvement in selling gold bars stolen from an 18th-century shipwreck. French prosecutors claim the couple helped a French diver illegally sell bullion plundered from the 'Le Prince de Conty,' which sank in 1746. The case emerged after French authorities spotted a suspicious auction in the U.S. and traced the gold back to the couple, who deny knowing the items were illicitly obtained. Investigators allege the couple handled at least 23 gold bars, selling 18 for over $192,000, though their lawyer maintains they did not profit from the sales.</p>

          <p>A drive-by shooting outside the Artis Lounge nightclub in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and fourteen others wounded. The incident occurred late Wednesday as patrons were leaving an album release party for local rapper Mello Buckzz, who stated many victims were her friends. Police are currently searching for three suspects who fired from a dark SUV into the crowd, and no arrests have been made. This same location was also the site of a mass shooting in November 2022 when it operated under a different name, prompting renewed concerns about violence in the area.</p>

          <p>According to senior United Nations officials, criminal gangs now have nearly total control over Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, pushing the nation closer to collapse. The U.N. reports that gangs control an estimated 90% of the city and are expanding their influence into previously peaceful regions, exploiting political instability since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Officials warn that without increased international action, a complete breakdown of state authority is a real possibility. The situation has prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a travel advisory and designate two of Haiti's most powerful gang networks as foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

Key evidence included DNA from a Q-tip retrieved from his family's trash, which matched DNA found on a knife sheath left at the crime scene. Cell phone data placed Kohberger near the victims' home 23 times before the murders, and surveillance footage tracked his car fleeing the scene. The summary revealed new insights into the investigation but left questions about the motive unanswered, as families of the victims remain divided over the plea deal.</p>

          <p>The band Wet Leg is preparing to release their sophomore album, "Moisturizer," marking a significant evolution in both their sound and visual style since their Grammy-winning debut. Lead singer Rhian Teasdale discusses her shift away from a more covered-up, bohemian look, reflecting a newfound comfort and a desire for more authentic self-expression. The new album is described as more sonically expressive and raw, heavily influenced by Teasdale's experience of falling deeply in love and moving beyond heteronormative songwriting themes. The band, which rose meteorically from the Isle of Wight, is excited to tour the new material, which they feel was made to be played live.</p>

The U.S. Attorney has vowed to aggressively prosecute interference with law enforcement, but activist groups argue the charges are an attempt to stifle pro-immigrant activism.

          <p>The U.S. dollar's sharp decline in 2025, coupled with President Trump's aggressive tariff policies, has caused the euro to strengthen, creating a difficult environment for European exporters. The combination of a stronger euro and a baseline 10% tariff on EU goods makes European products more expensive and less competitive in the U.S. market. As a July 9 deadline approaches to avoid even higher tariffs, sectors like pharmaceuticals and automotive manufacturing face significant potential losses in market share. Analysts warn this dynamic could also lead to increased inflation and slower growth within the U.S. itself. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 90-day pause on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for consumers and businesses. If new bilateral trade deals are not finalized, sharply higher import duties could take effect, potentially triggering inflation and harming financial markets. The Trump administration has announced new agreements with China, the U.K., and Vietnam, but the status of deals with dozens of other nations remains unclear. Experts believe the administration may extend the deadline for some countries while allowing tariffs to rise for others, prolonging the uncertainty that can stifle investment and economic growth.

Although Russell's contract is up at the end of the season, he expressed that the likelihood of him not being at Mercedes next year is "exceptionally low." Team boss Toto Wolff has acknowledged speaking with Verstappen's representatives but indicated Russell's return is more probable. Russell emphasized his strong performance, including a recent win and his record against former teammate Lewis Hamilton, as the basis for his security in his position.</p>

          <p>The Northern Irish hip-hop group Kneecap, known for rapping predominantly in the Irish language, has become a global lightning rod for its political statements and controversial performances. The trio, who grew up after the Good Friday Agreement, uses their music to explore youth culture, advocate for Irish language rights, and express a desire for a united Ireland. Their vocal support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel have drawn both praise and condemnation, leading to a terrorism charge against one member in the U.K. and calls for their shows to be canceled. Despite the controversy, the band continues to draw massive crowds, using their platform to champion international solidarity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear cases concerning state laws in Idaho and West Virginia that prohibit transgender girls and women from competing in female school sports. The justices will decide whether these bans violate the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Title IX, a federal law against sex-based discrimination in education. The issue has become a major political flashpoint, with two dozen states enacting similar laws. The court's decision will have significant implications for transgender rights and school athletics nationwide, following a recent ruling that upheld a ban on gender-affirming care for minors.</p>

          <p>The Senate confirmation hearing for Emil Bove, Donald Trump's nominee for a federal judgeship, was highly contentious, with Democrats accusing the Republican-led committee of shielding the witness. Chairman Charles Grassley invoked privileges to limit questioning about Bove's controversial past, including allegations of abusive behavior as a prosecutor and his role in politically charged actions at the Department of Justice. A whistleblower also claimed Bove suggested the DOJ should defy court orders. The presence of Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy was seen by Democrats as an intimidation tactic to ensure Republican senators supported the nominee, raising serious ethical concerns.</p>

          <p>J. Michael Luttig, a respected conservative former federal judge, has publicly criticized U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts for his "unforgivable reticence" regarding Donald Trump's attacks on the judiciary. Luttig expressed disappointment that Roberts has not spoken out more directly against Trump's denigration of judges and threats of violence. While Roberts has occasionally defended the judiciary in broad terms, Luttig argues that his failure to condemn the former president by name is a dereliction of his duty to protect federal judges. Luttig believes this silence damages the court's reputation and that Roberts has prioritized institutional caution over his profound obligation to speak out.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is advocating for direct talks with the Taliban to establish an agreement for deporting convicted Afghan criminals from Germany. Since the Taliban's takeover in 2021, Germany has not had official diplomatic ties and has relied on mediators like Qatar for previous deportations. The push for a direct agreement comes amid a charged political climate around migration in Germany, with the conservative government vowing to take a harder line on deportations to countries like Afghanistan and Syria. Dobrindt argues that relying on third parties for these negotiations is not a sustainable long-term solution for repatriation.</p>

The firearm, which lacked a serial number and was fully functional, was detected by security as the man's bag passed through an X-ray machine. The suspect, who is not licensed to carry a gun in Washington, D.C., told officers he had forgotten the weapon was in his bag.

Over the past decade, many major retailers like Nike and Gap have shifted production from China to Vietnam to avoid high tariffs.

          <p>Germany experienced a record year for shoplifting in 2024, with retailers losing an estimated €4.95 billion, a 3% increase from the previous year. A study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) attributes most of these losses to theft by customers, employees, and delivery workers, with a notable 5% rise in organized shoplifting. The EHI suggests that retailers are forced to raise prices to cover these losses and increased security costs. While some criminologists argue that shoplifting is primarily a "poverty crime," the EHI study suggests that opportunistic theft by non-poor individuals also plays a significant role in the trend.</p>

However, this calculation assumes that the variable rate on the savings account remains constant. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates soon, the fixed rate of a CD could prove more profitable in the long run.

          <h2>A Breakdown of Key Provisions in the Major Republican Spending and Tax Bill</h2>

          <p>A comprehensive Republican bill, nearing a final vote, proposes to make most of the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent while increasing spending on defense and border security. The legislation is funded in part by significant cuts to social programs, including new work requirements for Medicaid and changes to the SNAP food assistance program. The bill also raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 and terminates many green energy tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add trillions to the national deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Altadena Residents Hesitate to Sue County Over Botched Wildfire Evacuations</h2>

          <p>Residents of west Altadena, California, are reluctant to sue Los Angeles County, despite anger over delayed evacuation alerts during the deadly Eaton fire that they believe contributed to 17 of the 18 fatalities. Many fear a lawsuit against the county could jeopardize potential settlements from their separate legal battle against Southern California Edison, whom they allege started the fire. Legal experts note that suing a government entity for insufficient fire protection is extremely difficult due to broad immunity laws. Without legal pressure, residents worry they may never get answers or see the systemic changes needed to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, was subjected to "severe beatings" and "torture" in the country's notorious CECOT mega-prison, according to new court documents. His lawyers allege that guards assaulted him upon arrival, forced him to kneel for hours, and confined him in an overcrowded cell with 24-hour lighting, causing him to lose 30 pounds in two weeks. Initially accused of MS-13 gang ties, which he denies, Ábrego García was later extradited back to the U.S. to face separate charges. The allegations are part of a lawsuit his wife filed against the Trump administration over the wrongful deportation.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Views Strong Jobs Report as a Win for Federal Reserve's Cautious Stance</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer views the strong June jobs report as a validation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's decision to hold off on interest rate cuts, despite pressure from President Trump. With better-than-expected payroll growth and a lower unemployment rate, Cramer argues there is no data to justify an immediate rate cut. He also noted that the stock market has become overbought, suggesting it may be a good time for investors to consider trimming profits from high-performing stocks. Cramer specifically mentioned Broadcom and some bank stocks like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo as potential candidates for profit-taking. (not investment advice)</p>
