          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both countries seeking closer economic cooperation. The agreement, teased by Trump on social media, would be the first since the U.S. imposed tariffs on trading partners. Details remain unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. The agreement could offer vindication for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of Trump and offset weaker relations with Europe after Brexit.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but warned that U.S.-China trade tariffs could restrict global container market volumes. The company revised its 2025 global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4% due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the trade issues are primarily between China and the U.S. and have not yet significantly affected other trade lanes. The company's current policy includes 145% import duties on products from China, prompting Beijing to hit back with tariffs on U.S. goods.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the current business year, attributing the decline to U.S. President Trump's tariffs creating global uncertainty. The Japanese automaker estimates that U.S. trade policies will reduce operating profit by 180 billion yen, factoring in the impact for two months. As the United States remains Toyota's largest market, the tariffs could significantly affect the company's performance.

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. The forecast comes as the company reported a drop in revenue and profit for its fiscal fourth quarter, largely expected as fans await the new console. Investors are hopeful that Nintendo can maintain its popularity, with shares up 33% this year. However, the company delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries where Nintendo's consoles are manufactured.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of climate scientists has determined that the historic four-day storm that caused widespread death and destruction across the central Mississippi valley in early April was made significantly more likely and severe by burning fossil fuels. The study found that the record rainfall was about 9% more intense and 40% more likely due to human-caused climate change. Researchers also noted that staff layoffs at the National Weather Service, thanks to Donald Trump and his billionaire donor Elon Musk, will put lives at risk. The study warns that four-day spells of rainfall will be twice as likely and 7% more intense by 2100 if the transition to renewable energy sources continues at the current pace.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that climate change significantly worsened the deadly storms that struck the Midwest and South in early April, making record-breaking downpours about 9% heavier. The storms were fueled by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by climate change. Researchers worry about the impact of ongoing staff shortages at the National Weather Service, which is responsible for issuing real-time warnings. Without a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, extreme weather is expected to become more common and intense, with potential consequences for insurance markets and community resilience.</p>

          <p>As tensions rise between India and Pakistan, a comparison of their military capabilities reveals India's larger active service personnel and significantly higher defense spending. Pakistan, however, has become heavily militarized, with a defense posture focused almost entirely on India. While India's military is increasingly deployed to face China, Pakistan relies heavily on China for its arms. Both countries possess significant air forces and are believed to have a similar number of nuclear warheads, raising concerns about the potential consequences of even a small nuclear exchange.</p>
