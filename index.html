        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of Jimmy Kimmel's suspension from ABC, President Donald Trump has suggested that television networks he perceives as being against him should potentially have their broadcast licenses revoked. Speaking to reporters, Trump cited unsubstantiated claims of overwhelmingly negative coverage and questioned why such networks are allowed to operate. The comments came after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman threatened action against ABC over Kimmel's monologue. Legal scholars maintain that revoking licenses based on political disagreement would violate the First Amendment's protection of free speech.</p>

          <p>According to a source familiar with a House Oversight Committee interview, Hunter Biden was involved in discussions regarding presidential pardons during the latter part of his father's term. The information emerged from a closed-door testimony by Jeff Zients, a former Biden administration official, as part of an investigation into the use of the autopen for executive orders. The source claims Hunter attended several meetings on the subject with White House aides. It is not specified whether he was involved in discussions about his own controversial pardon, which former President Joe Biden granted in the final months of his presidency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Late-night television icon David Letterman has strongly condemned ABC's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!", calling the move "ridiculous" and a form of "managed media." Speaking at The Atlantic Festival, Letterman expressed concern about the direction of media freedom, suggesting the network was acting out of fear or an attempt to appease an "authoritarian criminal administration." He compared the situation to the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show on CBS, framing both incidents as politically motivated actions that undermine free speech. Letterman confirmed he had been in touch with Kimmel, who he said is fine.</p>

          <p>A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 has struck in the Pacific Ocean near the east coast of Russia's remote Kamchatka region. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake's epicenter was located about 79 miles east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System issued a brief tsunami threat for the area, which was later lifted. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties from the powerful tremor, which was followed by a series of aftershocks. The region is seismically active and has experienced several strong earthquakes in recent months.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan House committee has passed an amendment requiring greater congressional oversight of the U.S. government's efforts to combat human trafficking. The move came in response to an investigation revealing that the Trump administration had significantly reduced the workforce at the State Department's anti-trafficking office by over 70%. Lawmakers are also concerned that the administration has failed to publish a legally mandated annual report that assesses global anti-trafficking efforts. The amendment directs the State Department to report on the impact of these staff reductions and reorganization.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to "call out the military" to control the country's borders and stop illegal migration.

The term refers to government officials coercing private entities to suppress speech, a practice Republicans previously criticized the Biden administration for. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr publicly stated that ABC and its parent company Disney could face consequences if they didn't take action against Kimmel for his remarks.

The debate centered on the MMRV vaccine's slightly elevated risk of causing febrile seizures, though some members argued that separating the shots could decrease overall vaccination compliance.

The team has consistently led Major League Baseball in attendance since 2013 but had never previously reached the 4-million mark. No MLB team has hit this figure since 2008, partly due to the construction of smaller modern stadiums. The Dodgers' sustained on-field success, combined with a roster of popular superstars including Shohei Ohtani, has fueled their dominance at the box office.</p>

          <p>Oversight officials and civil rights advocates in Los Angeles County are criticizing a new policy that they claim is an attempt to muzzle their independent voices. The rule requires watchdog commissions, such as those overseeing the county jails and the Sheriff's Department, to get prior approval from a county executive office before issuing press releases or social media posts. While the county claims the policy is meant to ensure unified messaging, critics call it a "chilling" effort to control oversight and limit criticism, particularly concerning ongoing issues like poor jail conditions and deputy gangs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's economic policies in his second term represent a significant departure from traditional Republican pro-market principles, moving toward a form of "state capitalism." This approach combines conventional tax cuts and deregulation with unconventional interventions like tariffs, protectionism, and the government taking equity stakes in private companies such as Intel. Unlike a coherent strategy, this "Trumponomics" is described as transactional, ad hoc, and erratic, prioritizing deal-making over predictable rules. This creates profound market uncertainty and risks shifting corporate focus from innovation to lobbying for political favor, potentially undermining long-term growth.</p>

          <p>One of Big Sur's most beloved hiking trails, the Pfeiffer Falls Trail, has reopened to the public after being closed for over a year. The trail's signature pedestrian bridge was destroyed in a 2023 storm when a massive redwood tree collapsed on it. This was a significant setback, as the trail had only recently reopened in 2021 after a 13-year closure due to a wildfire. Crews have now rebuilt the damaged section of the bridge using more resilient materials, hoping to better withstand the region's notoriously fragile and unforgiving environment.</p>
