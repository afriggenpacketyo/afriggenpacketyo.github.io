          <p>British Petroleum reported second-quarter profits of $2.35 billion, significantly surpassing analyst forecasts amid volatile energy prices. The strong performance is attributed to record operating efficiency and the startup of five new major projects. CEO Murray Auchincloss also highlighted significant exploration success, including the Bumerangue discovery off the coast of Brazil, which is the company's largest oil and gas find in 25 years. These results are part of an effort to rebuild investor confidence after a period of underperformance.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a decline in second-quarter net income to $24.5 billion, citing lower crude oil and refined chemical products prices. Despite the drop, the result still exceeded analyst expectations, and the company projects a significant increase in oil demand for the second half of 2025. CEO Amin Nasser expressed confidence in strong market fundamentals, even as the company's dividend policy and rising debt remain key points of focus for investors. The company's income is expected to be boosted as OPEC+ partners complete the unwinding of voluntary production cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cleanup efforts are underway across Scotland following Storm Floris, which caused widespread power outages and travel chaos. The storm, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, left about 50,000 homes without electricity and led to numerous cancellations of trains and flights. While a yellow weather warning remains in effect, authorities and utility companies are working to restore services and clear debris from transport routes.

          <p>Tennessee is scheduled to execute Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate convicted of a 1988 triple murder, in what may be the first-ever execution of a person with a working implantable defibrillator. Black's attorneys have argued unsuccessfully that the device could repeatedly shock his heart during the lethal injection, causing unnecessary pain and a prolonged death. Despite legal challenges and concerns from medical ethics experts, Governor Bill Lee has declined to grant a reprieve, and the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the appeals. The state disputes the claims of potential suffering, stating Black would be unresponsive.</p>

          <p>Following a narrow series loss to India, analysis suggests England's chances of winning the upcoming Ashes series in Australia depend almost entirely on captain Ben Stokes. The article highlights England's vulnerability without its all-rounder, noting that no current squad members have won a Test in Australia. Stokes' leadership, batting, and bowling are deemed crucial for a team that has lost 13 of its last 15 Tests down under. If Stokes can overcome recent injuries and lead his team to victory, it would be considered one of the greatest achievements of his career.</p>

The case has gained international attention, particularly as U.S. President Trump has criticized the trial and linked it to trade tariffs.

Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic pogrom that led to the mass expulsion and murder of approximately 200,000 ethnic Serbs. The anniversary highlights the deep-seated, unresolved tensions between the two nations, with both sides holding large military parades and delivering speeches that reinforce their conflicting historical interpretations of the 1995 offensive.</p>

The new liberal government, led by Donald Tusk, has struggled to maintain momentum, facing legal minefields left by its predecessors and failing to present a compelling future vision. This article argues that Tusk's strategy of adopting some populist policies and rhetoric has backfired, leading to a collapse in his approval ratings.

          <p>The Gifford fire in central California has burned more than 72,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest, threatening hundreds of homes and injuring at least three people. The blaze, which is only 5% contained, is burning across Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames in extremely difficult terrain, with their efforts hampered by heavy smoke and the threat of strong evening winds. A forecast of hotter, drier weather is expected to create conditions for rapid fire growth in the coming days.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly directed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. This move follows the declassification of a report by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who accused the Obama administration of politicizing intelligence to create a false narrative. President Trump has long claimed the probe was a politically motivated conspiracy, while Democrats maintain that Russian interference in the 2016 election is well-documented. It remains unclear what specific charges might be considered or who could be targeted.</p>

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has escalated, with Governor Greg Abbott ordering the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional map. By leaving, the Democrats broke the legislative quorum, preventing the House from conducting business. House Speaker Dustin Burrows issued warrants to compel the members' return, a move supported by the governor. The Democrats, who went to Illinois and New York, are protesting a redistricting plan they call a "racist scheme" designed to add five GOP-leaning seats to the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is threatening the safety of smaller communities and could lead to higher taxes. Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews, saving taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually, but their numbers have dropped by over 20% since 1985 while emergency calls have tripled. This burnout is forcing some towns to switch to paid fire departments, a costly alternative. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment and address the critical decline in this essential civil service.</p>
