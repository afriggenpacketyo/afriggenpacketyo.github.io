          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a controversial "revenge tax" provision from former President Trump's major legislative package at the request of the Treasury Secretary. The provision would have allowed the U.S. to tax companies from countries deemed to have unfair foreign tax policies, a measure critics warned would deter foreign investment. The removal, prompted by progress on a global tax deal, complicates Republican efforts to offset the cost of the bill as they rush to meet a July 4th deadline.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Expected to Make Concessions on Welfare Bill to Avoid Defeat</h2>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly set to announce a significant climbdown on its proposed welfare reforms to avoid a rebellion from its own backbench MPs. The expected deal will protect existing disability benefit claimants from cuts, with the new, stricter rules only applying to future applicants. This marks a major concession from the government, which was facing a potential defeat on its flagship bill aimed at reducing welfare spending, and it is the third major policy U-turn in a month.</p>
