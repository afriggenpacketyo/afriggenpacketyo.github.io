          <p>India announced it conducted military strikes targeting what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir in response to a recent militant attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people. The Indian Ministry of Defence emphasized the actions were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, with no Pakistani military facilities targeted, labeling the operation "Operation Sindoor". This operation follows a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed last month. The Defence Ministry plans to provide a detailed briefing on the strikes later in the day, marking a significant escalation in tensions between the two nations. The Indian government has long accused Pakistan of supporting separatist violence in Kashmir, a claim Pakistan denies.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta is opposing the Menendez brothers' request to remove the Los Angeles District Attorney's office from their resentencing case, arguing that the defense has not provided sufficient evidence of bias. The brothers' attorneys claim the DA's office has shown bias and violated Marsy's Law against their family. Bonta's office asserts that the defense's claims do not meet the "stringent standards" required for an office-wide recusal, emphasizing that any potential conflicts have been addressed, such as the DA walling off an attorney who previously represented Kitty Menendez's brother. A hearing is scheduled to address the recusal motion and the possibility of resentencing.</p>

          <p>India conducted strikes on Pakistan in response to a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing 26 people and injuring others, escalating the conflict between the two nuclear powers.

Pakistan condemned the strikes as an unprovoked act of war, vowing to respond, while President Trump expressed hope for a quick resolution.

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to an air traffic controller shortage and recent equipment failures, leading to trauma leave for some controllers. An equipment issue caused controllers to temporarily lose radar and communication with pilots, exacerbating existing staffing challenges. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to announce an overhaul of the nation's air traffic control system to address these issues, while Sen. Chuck Schumer is calling for an investigation. The FAA is slowing the rate of arrivals to ensure safety, but travelers are expressing frustration over the ongoing disruptions.</p>

          <p>Street sex workers in Bristol are working with police and a charity to protect at-risk children by providing vital information on child exploitation. The Night Light initiative, started in 2020, relies on the women's insights to identify and prosecute child sex offenders and help underage girls leave the streets. In one case, a sex worker helped convict a man who was abusing his daughter, and in another, a man showing child abuse photos was reported to the authorities. This unique project highlights the crucial role these women play in safeguarding vulnerable children and bringing perpetrators to justice.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency ventures is generating controversy due to potential conflicts of interest and constitutional violations, as highlighted by experts and legal scholars. Trump's promotion of meme coins and his family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial Inc., raise concerns about profiteering from his presidential position. The FBI has reported that cryptocurrency exploitation is most pervasive in investment scams, losses accounting for almost 71 percent of all losses related to cryptocurrency. Critics argue that Trump's actions blur the lines between private enterprise and government policy, potentially violating emoluments clauses and raising bribery concerns, particularly with foreign investments in his crypto ventures.</p>

This decision aims to shield East and Southeast Asian countries from financial volatility caused by US President Donald Trump's global tariff war. The move could lead to a longer-term shift towards a regional monetary system less reliant on the dollar, potentially giving China a more significant role in the region's financial landscape.

          <p>Pakistan has responded to Indian missile strikes, labeling them an "act of war" after India targeted sites of alleged "terrorist infrastructure" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The strikes resulted in casualties, and Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stated that his country has the right to respond forcefully. India blamed Pakistan for a deadly attack in the disputed Kashmir region that occurred in April. President Trump called the strikes "a shame" and expressed hope for a quick resolution, while the State Department said it is closely monitoring developments.</p>

          <p>India fired missiles into Pakistani-administered territory, resulting in at least one child's death and injuries, escalating tensions between the two nations following a militant attack on tourists in Kashmir. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of aggression, asserting its right to respond, while India claimed it targeted infrastructure used by militants, with no Pakistani military facilities targeted. President Trump called the situation "a shame" and expressed hope for a swift resolution. The strikes have led to diplomatic expulsions, airspace suspensions, and the halting of a key water-sharing treaty, further straining relations between the nuclear-armed neighbors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's ongoing assault on elite universities, initially justified by concerns over anti-Semitism, has now shifted to a broader attack on liberal institutions. A recent letter from Education Secretary Linda McMahon to Harvard leadership omits any mention of anti-Semitism, instead focusing on a range of grievances, including the admission of students critical of America and the hiring of former Democratic mayors. This shift reveals the administration's true aim: to punish liberal institutions for their political leanings, moving away from the pretext of addressing civil rights issues.</p>

CEO Charles Liang mentioned a delayed commitment from a customer evaluating AI platforms and noted the company is not providing fiscal 2026 guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty.

The U.S. will cease its aerial war on the Houthis, who have agreed to stop targeting American ships, but the Houthis have not committed to ending their war with Israel. Some analysts suggest the agreement may be linked to a new deal to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions, with Oman mediating the truce. The move follows unsuccessful attempts to "completely annihilate" the militia, and comes ahead of Trump's upcoming trip to the Gulf.</p>
