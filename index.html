          <p>China's drug development capabilities were prominently featured at the world's largest cancer research conference, with Chinese firms accounting for nearly one-third of presentations. A report by Jefferies highlights that global pharmaceutical companies are increasingly looking to China for innovative and cost-efficient drug candidates. These partnerships typically involve foreign companies acquiring rights to develop and market promising Chinese drugs globally, while the Chinese firms retain rights for their domestic market. The trend underscores a significant shift in the global biotech landscape.</p>

          <p>More than 50 million people across the U.S. Northeast are under flood watches due to slow-moving storms expected to produce intense rainfall. The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Newark, and Washington, D.C., cautioning of potentially life-threatening conditions. Rainfall rates could reach up to four inches per hour, creating a significant risk of flash flooding throughout the region. Reports of flooding have already emerged from southern Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>For the second year in a row, homelessness in Los Angeles County has decreased, with the latest count showing a 4% drop to an estimated 72,308 people. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass highlighted this as a significant turning point, attributing the progress to new city and county initiatives aimed at resolving encampments and providing housing. Despite the positive trend, people of color remain disproportionately affected, and the crisis persists due to a severe lack of affordable housing. Officials caution that the work is far from over but view the results as a sign of momentum.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict China's economic growth cooled in the second quarter, following a strong start to the year, with GDP expected to grow 5.1% year-on-year. This slowdown is attributed to persistent pressure from U.S. trade tariffs, a downturn in the property sector, and weak consumer demand, which are expected to intensify in the second half of the year. While exports saw a temporary boost, falling prices and low consumer confidence suggest a challenging outlook, increasing pressure on policymakers to implement further stimulus measures. The forecast puts the government's annual growth target of around 5% at risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent shift to a tougher policy on Russia, including authorizing more weapons for Ukraine, is reportedly driven by personal frustration rather than a strategic change. According to White House sources, Trump feels personally insulted and humiliated by Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to heed his calls for a ceasefire, making him appear weak. After months of deferring to Putin and hoping for a quick peace deal, Trump has grown angry at being repeatedly ignored. This has led him to authorize new defensive aid for Ukraine and threaten tariffs, signaling a significant, if personally motivated, change in his approach.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to move forward with plans to fire more than half of the Department of Education's workforce while a legal challenge is ongoing. The decision, issued through the Court's "shadow docket," allows for the termination of over 2,000 employees, a move Education Secretary Linda McMahon has called a step toward a "total shutdown" of the department. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the firings would effectively dismantle programs mandated by Congress, such as those for bilingual education and civil rights enforcement, raising constitutional questions about presidential power.</p>

          <p>Several prominent Los Angeles restaurants are closing their doors, signaling ongoing challenges for the city's hospitality industry. Among the closures is Shibumi, a downtown izakaya that earned a Michelin star in 2019, with its chef-owner citing a significant drop in business. Other notable closures include chef Stephanie Izard's Peruvian restaurant Cabra and Michael Mina's health-focused Mother Tongue. The trend extends to cafes as well, with Verve Coffee Roasters shutting down its first L.A. location on Spring Street due to a lasting decline in foot traffic, reflecting the difficult landscape for businesses in downtown Los Angeles.</p>

The termination letter did not provide a reason for the dismissal, which comes amid a series of firings of career employees, particularly those connected to investigations into former President Trump.

          <p>President Trump's attempt to calm a growing revolt within his MAGA base over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files appears to have backfired. In a social media post, Trump defended Attorney General Pam Bondi, but the message was met with widespread disapproval from his own supporters, who continue to criticize the Justice Department for a lack of transparency. Prominent conservative figures have warned that the controversy is damaging the administration's credibility and could have political consequences. The internal firestorm was ignited by a DOJ memo concluding there was no "client list" and that Epstein died by suicide.</p>

The case will scrutinize whether defects in the driver-assistance technology contributed to the fatal accident. Tesla argues that the driver was distracted and responsible for the crash, stating that he was searching for a dropped cell phone at the time.</p>

Becker finished the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a "score" after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. Having started running marathons at age 60, Becker's achievement serves as an inspiring example of endurance and determination at any age.</p>

In a meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte, Trump also issued an ultimatum to Russia, threatening severe secondary tariffs on its trade partners if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. The announcement marks a significant escalation in Trump's rhetoric and policy toward Russia, which he attributed to frustration with Vladimir Putin's continued aggression.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that over 40 ice cream companies have agreed to the change, which aligns with the administration's focus on eliminating certain chemicals from food. The move continues a pattern of pursuing voluntary agreements with industries rather than imposing regulations. The FDA also announced the approval of a new plant-based blue dye derived from gardenias, providing a natural alternative for manufacturers.</p>

          <p>In a recent social media post, President Trump stated he was giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of comedian Rosie O'Donnell, a frequent and long-time critic. The threat, which legal experts note has no constitutional basis for a native-born citizen, is being seen as another attack on free speech and political opponents. This follows other instances where Trump has suggested using denaturalization as a tool against critics. The article frames the comment as part of a disturbing pattern where the president appears to view fundamental rights like speech and citizenship as conditional upon his approval.</p>

          <p>The rising cost of renovations at the Federal Reserve's Washington, D.C. headquarters, now estimated at $2.5 billion, has become a point of contention with the White House. The Trump administration is using the cost overruns to attack the central bank, with which it is already at odds over interest rate policy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has defended the project, stating that claims of luxury upgrades are exaggerated and that costs have been driven by unexpected issues and inflation. In response to the criticism, Powell has asked the Fed's inspector general to review the project. (not investment advice)</p>
