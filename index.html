Meanwhile, "From the World of John Wick: Ballerina" opened with $25 million, falling short of expectations despite positive reviews. The first place film, "Lilo & Stitch," grossed $32.5 million domestically and $772.6 million globally, surpassing the domestic total of the live-action version of "The Little Mermaid." The box office results highlight the continued success of "Lilo & Stitch" and the somewhat disappointing debut of "Ballerina."</p>

The deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops is seen as an attempt to militarize the situation and goad Americans into taking to the streets, enabling attacks on constitutional freedoms. Trump is believed to be hoping to create a national emergency to exercise authoritarian control, while also testing the loyalty of military leaders.
