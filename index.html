          <p>Two five-year-old European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in England. The bears did not pose a threat to the public, who were moved to a secure building as a precaution. The animals were found in a staff food storage area, where they had feasted on a week's worth of honey and other snacks before being safely guided back to their enclosure. The park attributed the escape to an operational error and is conducting a full internal investigation to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Japan's professional women's football league, the WE League, concluded its fourth season with a record-breaking total attendance of over 337,000. This success is attributed to innovative promotional strategies, including a doubleheader with the men's J2-League that drew over 26,000 fans to a single match. The league, which now works in tandem with the men's J-League, is also empowering clubs with data and marketing tools to further grow their fanbases.

          <p>The U.S. Senate held a critical test vote on a sweeping Republican tax and spending package championed by President Trump. The bill, which extends tax cuts and boosts defense and immigration funding, faces an uncertain path due to internal party disputes over its impact on the national deficit and cuts to programs like Medicaid. Despite some Republican senators expressing opposition, leadership pushed for the vote to meet a July 4th deadline set by the White House. The bill's passage remains tenuous, with Democrats unified in opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

Human rights activists express grave concern, stating the accused were denied due process and that the regime is using the post-war climate to suppress dissent and instill fear. The government has also announced new surveillance measures to monitor citizens' online activities.

          <p>Counter-terrorism police have arrested two more men in connection with a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, where military planes were spray-painted. This brings the total number of arrests to six. The activist group Palestine Action posted footage of the incident, claiming it was an act to "decommission" planes involved in crimes against Palestinians. The two London men, aged 22 and 24, were arrested on suspicion of committing, preparing, or instigating acts of terrorism. The UK government intends to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization.</p>
