          <p>The Armenian village of Kirants now finds itself physically bisected by a new, three-meter-tall concrete border wall with Azerbaijan, a consequence of the ongoing border demarcation process based on Soviet maps. This development has transferred 15 hectares of land, previously part of Armenia, to Azerbaijani control, causing significant economic hardship for local farmers and sparking a political crisis within Armenia. While some residents lament the loss of their homeland, others, including a school principal, cautiously welcome the wall as a means to maintain peace and prevent the border skirmishes that plagued the area previously. Despite an apparent reduction in tensions and high-level discussions aimed at accelerating a peace agreement, a deep sense of doubt persists among the villagers regarding the long-term security and permanence of this fragile calm.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo began under grueling conditions, with temperatures reaching 30C and over 90% humidity, forcing early start times for road events. Despite the challenging environment, Japan celebrated its first medal in the 35km race walk, delighting home crowds eager to compensate for the spectator-less 2020 Olympics. Many athletes struggled, with one British competitor describing it as his hardest race ever, and a Japanese medallist collapsing after finishing. Organizers anticipate even tougher heat later in the week, prompting further schedule adjustments for athlete safety, highlighting the extreme physical demands of competing in Tokyo's summer.</p>

          <p>Corona Centennial achieved a historic 43-36 victory over top-ranked Mater Dei in a high school football game marked by dramatic swings. Centennial initially dominated, leading 28-0 after the first quarter, fueled by defensive end Jonathan McKinley's sacks and a pick-six. Mater Dei staged a furious 29-0 comeback in the third quarter to take the lead, but Centennial rallied in the fourth, capitalizing on Mater Dei's seven turnovers. This marks Mater Dei's first loss to a Southern Section team other than St. John Bosco in a decade, signaling a significant shift in Southern California high school football dynamics.</p>

          <p>Golf icon John Daly made an unwanted entry into the PGA Tour Champions record book by scoring a 19 on the par-5 12th hole at the Sanford International, the highest single-hole score in the tour's history. This marked a personal record for Daly, exceeding his previous high of 18 from 1998, and involved hitting seven consecutive shots into a water hazard. Despite this disastrous hole, which contributed to an overall round of 88, Daly showed resilience by managing to achieve a par on the very next hole. The incident highlights the unpredictable nature of golf, even for seasoned professionals.</p>

The dance's low-impact nature, lack of a required partner, and diverse music routines contribute to its widespread appeal, fostering a strong community and offering an enjoyable way to stay fit.</p>

          <h2>Rebecca Solnit Reflects on Historical Normalization of Sexual Exploitation, Pre-Feminist Culture</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rebecca Solnit's article reflects on the disturbing normalization of sexual exploitation of teenage girls and children by adult men in mainstream and counterculture before the rise of feminism, contextualizing the recently released Jeffrey Epstein birthday album. She cites examples from 1970s movies, rock star "groupie" culture, and photography, highlighting how figures like Woody Allen and Roman Polanski operated within a permissive societal framework. Solnit argues that the prevailing culture often blamed victims and dismissed abuses, with institutions like NAMBLA openly campaigning for sex with male children. Feminism is credited with exposing these widespread abuses, asserting women's rights, and establishing the necessity of active consent, fundamentally altering societal attitudes towards power differentials and child sexual assault.</p>

The standard iPhone 17 with 256GB storage proved most popular, and overwhelming demand caused difficulties accessing Apple's website and saw in-person pickup slots in Shanghai fully booked within minutes.

This plan aims to end the deadly conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has caused tens of thousands of deaths and millions of displacements. The Quad nations, who hold significant influence with the warring parties, emphasized that Sudan's future governance is for its people to decide, rejecting any military solution and imposing sanctions on key figures.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez in Franklin Park, Illinois, after authorities stated the undocumented man attempted to drive his vehicle into agents during an arrest. One agent was struck and dragged, suffering severe injuries, leading the officer to discharge his firearm. Villegas-Gonzalez, who had a history of reckless driving, later crashed and died at a hospital. The incident, part of "Operation Midway Blitz," has sparked calls for a full investigation and release of surveillance footage from local officials and the suspect's girlfriend, who disputes the official account.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is facing increasing pressure after it emerged he initially defended Lord Mandelson as US ambassador, despite officials at No 10 and the Foreign Office being aware of supportive emails between Mandelson and paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer's office stated he was unaware of the emails' content during his defense. Mandelson was subsequently sacked after the emails, which included expressions of support for Epstein, were published, revealing a deeper relationship than previously known. This incident has led to calls for an investigation into the vetting process and has fueled criticism of Starmer's leadership from within his own party.</p>

          <p>Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a leader of the Belarusian opposition, has alleged that dozens of political prisoners released by Belarus as part of a US-brokered deal were, in fact, forcibly deported to Lithuania. While acknowledging happiness for their freedom, Tsikhanouskaya criticized the arrangement as "not real freedom," noting that many were nearing the end of their sentences and wished to remain in Belarus. The release of 52 prisoners came after White House envoy John Coale met with authoritarian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko, leading to the lifting of sanctions on Belarus' national airline. The opposition urges Western governments to demand that Lukashenko allow political prisoners to stay in their home country.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a Republican-backed plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, which aims to create an additional GOP-leaning House seat and was championed by former President Trump. The new map would split the Kansas City area, making a long-held Democratic district more conservative, potentially shifting the state's delegation to seven Republicans and one Democrat. This move is part of a broader nationwide redistricting effort by Republicans to secure their House majority. Opponents, including the ACLU of Missouri, have already filed a legal challenge, arguing the plan is unconstitutional and an attempt to rig midterm elections by racially dividing voters.</p>

          <p>A recent Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health study found a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women who have experienced stalking or obtained restraining orders. Analyzing data from over 66,000 American nurses over 20 years, researchers observed a 41% increased CVD risk for stalking victims and a 70% increase for those with restraining orders, even after adjusting for other health factors. This groundbreaking research suggests that common experiences of violence among women profoundly affect cardiovascular health, advocating for doctors to incorporate questions about such experiences into future heart health screenings to improve women's overall well-being.</p>

This "opposition" makes Saturn visible to the naked eye as a non-twinkling star in Pisces, though a telescope is needed to view its rings. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will peak around October 22, offering fast-moving meteors with long light streaks. Ideal viewing conditions are expected for the Orionids due to the coinciding new moon, minimizing light pollution and enhancing visibility for these natural wonders.</p>

          <p>Keith Rabois, the newly appointed chairman of Opendoor Technologies, has controversially stated that the real estate company's workforce is "bloated," claiming only 200 of its 1,400 employees are truly necessary. Rabois attributed the "broken" company culture to remote work and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, announcing a return to "merit and excellence." These comments come as Opendoor's stock has surged, becoming a meme stock, following the rejoining of co-founders to the board and a new CEO appointment. Rabois's remarks align with a broader tech trend of leaders criticizing remote work and rolling back DEI initiatives, often as a means to reduce headcount.</p>
