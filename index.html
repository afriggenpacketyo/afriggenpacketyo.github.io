          <p>A 25-year-old American tourist from New York, Kevin Mares, was shot and killed in the La Perla area of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Mares, who was visiting for a Bad Bunny concert, was an unintended victim caught in the crossfire of an argument at a local hangout spot. The incident, which also left two other people hospitalized, has drawn attention to the area's history of violence, while the victim's family remembers him as a kind and family-oriented person with a bright future.</p>

This move follows the controversial firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, whom Trump accused of manipulating jobs data after a weaker-than-expected report. The nomination is presented as a step to ensure the honesty and accuracy of the nation's economic figures, though it has sparked debate about the politicization of the independent statistical agency.

          <p>England footballer Jess Carter has revealed her fear that teammate Lauren James would have faced "astronomical" racist abuse if she had been the only player to miss a penalty in a crucial Euro 2025 shootout. Carter expressed a sense of relief when other non-black players also missed, highlighting the immense pressure and psychological burden that racial abuse places on black athletes. She also spoke about the personal impact of the racism she endured during the tournament, which made her feel small and scared to play.</p>

          <p>Colorado is confronting one of its largest wildfires in history, with over a thousand firefighters deployed to combat two significant blazes under difficult conditions. The Lee fire has burned over 130,000 acres and remains largely uncontained, driven by gusty winds and extreme drought. This event is part of a broader, explosive fire season across North America, which experts link to the worsening climate crisis that creates ideal conditions for more frequent and intense wildfires.</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the quick thinking of a woman whose boyfriend confessed to killing him. After Alexander McKellar admitted to a hit-and-run, he took his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, to the remote burial site, where she secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker for police. This crucial clue led to the recovery of Parsons' body and brought a long-awaited, albeit tragic, resolution for his family.</p>

The killings highlight the extreme dangers faced by Palestinian journalists, who are among the few sources of on-the-ground information from within Gaza during the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, directly overturning a recent ruling by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The customs ruling had stated that certain gold bars from Switzerland would face a 39% tariff, which caused the price of the precious metal to spike to a record high. Trump's intervention quickly reversed the policy, with gold futures falling after his announcement on social media. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed the idea of renovating the White House press quarters to create a larger, more comfortable space for reporters. When asked about the possibility during a press conference, Trump responded with a laugh, stating, "I don’t want you to be comfortable." The exchange confirms that the press corps will remain in the current James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, which is known for being cramped but is prized for its close proximity to the Oval Office.</p>

          <p>The cause of death for talent agent Brandon Blackstock, the ex-husband of singer Kelly Clarkson, has been confirmed as melanoma. The county coroner stated that Blackstock died from the skin cancer at his home in Montana while under hospice care, following a battle of more than three years. This official confirmation provides clarity after Clarkson recently postponed several shows for personal reasons, stating that she needed to be present for their two children during their father's illness.</p>

          <p>Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has commented that individuals who commit heinous crimes like sexual assault "probably" forfeit the right to choose their gender. Her statement addresses the intense controversy surrounding Scotland's gender recognition laws, which was inflamed by the case of a transgender offender convicted of two sexual assaults being housed in a women's prison. In her reflection, Sturgeon admitted that the debate had lost rationality and that she was partly responsible for that outcome.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Federal Crackdown in D.C. is a Farcical Show of Force</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police is more a performative act of strength than a genuine response to an emergency. The analysis argues that because D.C. is a federal enclave with limited legal protections, it serves as a uniquely soft target for a president to assert authority. This move is framed as the behavior of a bully, creating a spectacle of power that capitalizes on the city's vulnerable legal status.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 16:51:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European leaders are expressing significant anxiety over their exclusion from the planned bilateral summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine. The meeting, set to take place in Alaska, will proceed in a one-on-one format, raising fears in Brussels that a deal affecting European security could be negotiated without their input. While there is a possibility that Ukrainian President Zelensky may be invited, Europe's role in the peace process remains uncertain.</p>
