          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to headline a fundraiser for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where the top sponsorship costs $2 million and includes a photo opportunity with the former president. Trump, who chairs the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, has recently overhauled the center's leadership, appointing allies to key positions. This management shift has sparked controversy, with some performances being canceled in protest. Trump has stated that the Kennedy Center was in disrepair due to poor management and that he intends to restore it to its former glory.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly told Donald Trump that Canada is "not for sale" and has no intention of becoming the 51st U.S. state. Despite Trump's insistence that such a merger would be a "wonderful marriage," Carney emphasized the importance of the existing partnership between the two countries. The leaders also discussed trade, with Trump suggesting a possible renegotiation of the USMCA agreement and expressing concerns about Canadian economic self-sufficiency. Carney's Liberal Party recently won the Canadian election on a platform of resisting Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Retired Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, nominated for a senior Pentagon role, faced intense scrutiny during his Senate confirmation hearing due to past inflammatory remarks, including calling former President Barack Obama a "terrorist leader." Senators questioned Tata about his loyalty to the Constitution versus the administration's political agenda, and his more recent social media posts criticizing military officers. Tata expressed regret for his past comments and pledged to be an apolitical leader if confirmed, emphasizing his commitment to upholding the Constitution. The nomination of Katherine Sutton for a top Pentagon technology role drew little opposition.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would cease attacking the Houthis in Yemen, claiming the group had "capitulated" and promised to stop attacking ships. Oman's foreign minister confirmed a ceasefire agreement, mediated by Oman, ensuring freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. The Houthis began attacking shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, disrupting global trade. The Houthis also continued firing missiles towards Israel, with one missile landing near Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv. Israel responded with a large-scale attack on Yemen's main international airport in the capital Sanaa, which left it "completely destroyed."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration may enforce its ban on transgender troops serving in the military while legal challenges continue in lower courts. This decision reverses rulings by lower courts that had blocked the policy, with the court's liberal members dissenting without providing reasoning. The case involves an executive order that revoked a previous policy allowing transgender service members to serve openly, citing concerns about military readiness and cohesion. One plaintiff, Cmdr. Emily Shilling, a Navy pilot with 19 years of service, faces discharge solely because she is transgender.</p>

          <p>Thirty-five Democrats joined Republicans in the House to repeal California’s requirement that all new vehicles sold in the state be electric or nonpolluting by 2035. Representative Lou Correa, a Democrat from California, said electric vehicles remain expensive and impractical in his district. The vote stunned environmentalists, who said they were struggling to understand why nearly three dozen Democrats voted to kill one of the most ambitious climate policies in the country. The ban is set to begin phasing in next year, mandating that 35 percent of new vehicle sales be emissions-free by 2026.</p>

          <p>Critics argue that Donald Trump’s walkaway diplomacy has enabled Israel’s worst impulses, particularly regarding plans to occupy and depopulate Gaza. Trump’s offhand proposals for turning Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East” have provided cover for rightwing Israeli politicians to enthusiastically support the forced resettlement of the Palestinian population. The White House now appears uninterested and overstretched as Israel signals an offensive and occupation that critics have said will amount to a state policy of ethnic cleansing. The state department was reportedly ready to cut the role of the security coordinator role for the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
