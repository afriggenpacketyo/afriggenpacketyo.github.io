          <p>Britain's Lerone Murphy has positioned himself as a top contender for the featherweight title after a dramatic first-round knockout of Aaron Pico at UFC 319 in Chicago. Murphy, who accepted the fight on short notice, delivered a stunning spinning back elbow to secure the victory and extend his undefeated record to 17 wins. The event also saw Khamzat Chimaev claim the middleweight title in a historically dominant performance against Dricus du Plessis, landing a record number of strikes. Murphy's decisive win earned him a performance-of-the-night bonus and strong calls for a championship bout.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has compelled striking Air Canada flight attendants to return to work, ordering both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to resolve their contract dispute. The intervention came less than 12 hours after the strike began, a move Minister Patty Hajdu justified by citing risks to the economy during the peak travel season. The work stoppage had already caused hundreds of flight cancellations, stranding thousands of travelers globally. While business groups praised the decision, the flight attendants' union accused the government of undermining their constitutional right to strike.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a ban on certain AI chip exports, announcing a deal that allows companies like Nvidia and AMD to sell to China in exchange for sharing 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This move, brokered after meetings with tech CEOs, has sparked criticism from trade experts who warn it sets a "dangerous precedent" by making national security-based export controls appear to be for sale. The legality of the arrangement, which critics liken to an unconstitutional export tax, is reportedly still under review by the Commerce Department, reflecting a transactional approach to trade.

          <p>Beijing's National Museum of China is currently hosting an exhibition of works by the 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, with a focus on emphasizing the artist's "Russianness." The collection, provided by Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, includes dozens of oil paintings and sketches from various periods of his life. The exhibition's framing comes as Ukraine also claims Repin as part of its national cultural heritage, referring to him by his Ukrainian name, Illia Riepin. This event highlights the ongoing cultural and historical disputes between Russia and Ukraine, now playing out in international artistic venues.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has returned to social media after a three-week silence following the mixed public reaction to her "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans" ad campaign with American Eagle. She posted a series of photos from a night out with friends, making no direct comment on the controversy. The ad campaign had drawn criticism from some who perceived racial undertones in its "great genes" wordplay, while others defended it as a rejection of "woke" advertising. Public relations experts cited in the article offer differing opinions on the long-term career impact, with some suggesting the controversy could increase her marketability.</p>

          <p>An incident involving federal immigration agents in San Bernardino resulted in an officer discharging a firearm at a vehicle with people inside. According to the Department of Homeland Security, agents were conducting a targeted operation when a subject allegedly refused to exit his vehicle and drove at them, injuring two officers. However, the driver contacted police claiming masked men shot at him after breaking his car window, and video from a community group appears to show agents smashing the window before shots are fired. The San Bernardino Police Department responded but cited a state law prohibiting assistance with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the legendary West Hollywood Italian restaurant that has been a favored spot for celebrities for six decades, has died at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia.

Known for its classic red-sauce Italian-American fare, checkered tablecloths, and discreet service, the establishment became an enduring L.A. institution.

India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, pointing out that the U.S. and European nations also continue to trade with Russia. The U.S. is India's largest single export partner, making the stalled negotiations a significant concern for the Indian economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified to become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, reaching Category 4 strength and bringing heavy rain to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. While current meteorological models predict the storm will remain several hundred miles off the U.S. East Coast, it is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from August 20 to 27. Coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are on alert for significant coastal erosion.

          <p>A long-standing principle in U.S. traffic engineering, known as the "85th percentile rule," is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies. This rule suggests that speed limits should be set based on the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel at, assuming most drivers choose a safe speed. However, critics argue this creates a feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, compromising safety for pedestrians and cyclists, especially in urban areas. Amid a rise in traffic fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors like road use and crash frequency should also be considered.</p>

The technique involves preparing the tissue into an "ionic glassy" state, which makes it highly transparent while preserving its original structure and morphology. This process enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules, offering an unprecedented view of an organ's inner workings. The method also allows for the long-term storage of the preserved tissues at low temperatures without degradation, aiding future research.</p>

During the trial, his defense admitted his guilt but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia.

As the aircraft accelerates, the wing pivots, eventually aligning parallel to the fuselage at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5. This allows the entire vehicle to function as a highly efficient "waverider," solving the aerodynamic challenges of balancing low-speed lift with high-speed drag.</p>
