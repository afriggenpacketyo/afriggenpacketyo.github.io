          <p>Left-wing influencer Hasan Piker, a U.S. citizen, stated that he was detained and questioned by border officials at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport upon returning from a family trip to France. Piker, known for his criticism of Israel, said officials inquired about his views on Trump and any connections to Hamas and Hezbollah. While Piker described the exchanges as cordial, he believes the questioning was intended to create fear and silence dissenting voices. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson denied that Piker's political beliefs were the reason for the screening, asserting that officers were following the law, not agendas.</p>

          <p>President Trump has begun a four-day tour of the Middle East, starting in Saudi Arabia, with subsequent stops planned in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The New York Times article notes that Trump aims to secure deals worth over $1 trillion, focusing on investments in artificial intelligence, energy production, and arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers. He was greeted warmly in Saudi Arabia, in contrast to President Biden's visit in 2022. The visit closely aligns with the Trump family's financial interests, given their pending deals with Saudi-owned firms and projects backed by the governments of Qatar and the UAE.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market continues to weaken, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls falling in recent months. Wage growth has slowed, but pay is still rising faster than inflation. The number of job vacancies has also declined, indicating a cooling labor market. Increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage, which came into effect in April, may have contributed to businesses reducing headcount.</p>

          <p>The recent agreement between the U.S. and China to pause high tariffs is creating pressure on manufacturing hubs like Vietnam and Mexico. These countries had previously benefited from a "China-plus-one" strategy, attracting companies seeking alternatives to China due to high tariffs. With the U.S. and China agreeing to reduce tariffs, these manufacturing hubs are now pressured to secure better deals with the U.S. to maintain their competitive advantage. Experts suggest that companies may delay investment decisions due to the uncertainty surrounding trade policies.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent new tariffs and suspend part of the so-called reciprocal duties for 90 days. The United States will cut its tariffs on China to 30 percent from 145 percent, while China will lower its retaliatory tariffs on the United States to 10 percent from 125 percent. Japan's ruling coalition has also agreed that the government should draw up a fiscal 2025 supplementary budget this fall to fund measures to support an economy hit by inflation and higher U.S. tariffs.</p>
