          <p>Germany is in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the deportation of Afghan nationals convicted of crimes in Germany, as confirmed by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt. These discussions, described as "technical contacts," are aimed at establishing a regular deportation process, despite Germany not recognizing the Taliban government, which took power in Afghanistan in 2021. The move has sparked controversy, with critics raising concerns about legitimizing the Islamist group and the potential implications for security. The German government defends the decision as necessary to address migration concerns amid the rise of the far right. </p>

          <p>Data from China's central bank indicates a surge of household savings flowing into the mainland stock market, suggesting a potential continuation of the current rally. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions increased significantly in August, following a similar trend in July, while M1, a money-supply gauge, rose at its fastest pace since January 2023. Analysts attribute this shift to low-interest-rate policies that are diminishing returns from traditional banking deposits, driving investors to seek better returns in the capital market. The earnings yield of China's listed companies currently surpasses yields on government bonds and deposit rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 23rd series of Strictly Come Dancing, contestants like Dani Dyer, Vicky Pattison, and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink shared their thoughts on various aspects of the show. Dyer expressed excitement about the glamorous costumes, while Pattison spoke candidly about her anxiety and how she's managing her nerves. The contestants also addressed the so-called 'Strictly curse,' with most dismissing concerns about finding romance with fellow participants, and former Apprentice star Thomas Skinner apologized for his behavior at the press event. The contestants also discussed previous dance experience with varying levels of formal training, and soap stars noted the opportunity to show the public who they are in real life as opposed to their television personas. </p>

          <p>The UK and US are poised to sign a significant agreement aimed at accelerating nuclear power development, with the goal of creating jobs and enhancing Britain's energy security. The Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy seeks to expedite the construction of new nuclear power stations by streamlining regulatory approvals and fostering commercial partnerships. Key proposals include X-Energy and Centrica's plan to build advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, potentially powering 1.5 million homes and creating thousands of jobs. The partnership also aims to end reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028 and includes collaboration on fusion energy research. </p>

          <p>Nate Bargatze's attempt to keep the Emmy Awards within a three-hour timeslot by deducting money from a charity donation for every second a winner went over their speech time backfired. The bit led to rushed speeches and undermined the emotional impact of the winners' moments, making the Boys & Girls Club seem like a punchline. The focus shifted from celebrating achievements to the financial stakes of running overtime, while the scripted presenter speeches, which also ran long, went unpunished. Despite Bargatze's intentions, the awards show felt less fun, and the promised donation was ultimately made regardless of the speeches' length. </p>

          <p>Aldi's UK chief executive, Giles Hurley, cautioned that any measures in the upcoming budget that increase costs for employers could lead to higher food prices. He noted that previous policies like the National Insurance rise and new packaging rules have already impacted supermarket prices. Hurley stated that Aldi has invested over £300m to offset rising costs, but global factors and domestic policy decisions have contributed to a more stubborn inflation situation in the UK compared to other developed countries. The Food and Drink Federation predicts food inflation could reach 5.7% by the end of the year, driven by rising minimum wage, employer National Insurance contributions, and new packaging rules.

China has over 1.19 terawatts of coal-fired power capacity, with approximately 100 gigawatts expected to retire by 2030.

The island faces a shortage of mental health specialists, exacerbating the problem, and many students have disengaged from school due to instability and lack of resources.

Hochul noted that while they have disagreements, she believes Mamdani will stand firm against Donald Trump's agenda. The endorsement comes as Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has distanced himself from some past positions, including calling the NYPD "racist." Mamdani's main opponents are incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both running as independents. </p>

          <p>The Conservative Party is demanding answers from Prime Minister Starmer regarding his knowledge of Lord Mandelson's links to Jeffrey Epstein, including the release of related documents. This follows Mandelson's sacking after emails revealed his supportive messages following Epstein's guilty plea to sex offenses. Tory MP Alex Burghart questioned what Starmer knew before defending Mandelson and called for the release of the "Mandelson-Epstein Files." The scandal has prompted some Labour MPs to criticize Starmer, with concerns raised about its potential impact on upcoming local elections. </p>
