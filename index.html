            <h2>Trump's Trade Policies Could Open Door for China in Asia-Pacific Trade</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's recent imposition of steep tariffs on imports from numerous countries, styled as America's “Liberation Day,” could inadvertently aid China's bid to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Trump's protectionist measures have sparked fears of a global recession and may encourage other nations to align against the US, strengthening China's position. The CPTPP, a trade bloc of 12 members including Australia, Canada, Japan, and the UK, has a pending application from China, which could benefit from the shifting global trade landscape. This could reshape the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

            <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have reached an agreement allowing ICE to access taxpayer information to locate illegal immigrants subject to deportation. This memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishes a process for ICE requests to the IRS to further investigations of criminal illegal immigrants who have failed to leave the United States after a removal order. The Treasury Department asserts that the MOU protects the privacy of law-abiding Americans while enabling law enforcement to pursue criminals, citing longstanding authorities granted by Congress. Some IRS officials have expressed concerns that the policy could hinder tax collection from illegal immigrants.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced volatility as economists raised concerns about a potential U.S. recession and President Trump threatened to escalate tariffs against China. Leading indexes initially fell, briefly rebounded, and then declined again in the afternoon. Investors are reacting to the uncertainty surrounding trade policies, with Goldman Sachs economists increasing the odds of a recession to 45%. Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the country doesn't withdraw its retaliatory tariffs, exacerbating market anxieties. (not investment advice)</p>

Several papers also highlight a British woman who gave birth to a healthy baby girl after receiving a womb transplant from her sister, a medical breakthrough.

China views the U.S. threat as a mistake and has declared its readiness to 'fight to the end' if the U.S. persists with its tariff policies.

            <p>Defense stocks in Europe and Asia are outperforming their U.S. counterparts, driven by a lack of trust in the U.S. as a reliable ally. Countries are increasing their defense spending, and European nations are inclined to purchase from European firms or allies like South Korea. This shift is due to concerns about the U.S. commitment to its alliances, leading countries to seek autonomous defense policies and military industrial complexes. Increased defense spending is benefiting companies like ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and Rheinmetall, with Asian arms suppliers also receiving orders from European countries.

Concerns range from sector-specific issues driving up costs to fears of boycotts of American brands and anti-American sentiment.

The ACLU claimed the ruling as a 'huge victory' because the Supreme Court said individuals must be given due process to challenge their removal.

            <p>The article suggests that increased engagement between Europe and China could offer a contingency plan for an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship due to US President Donald Trump's trade policies. The author argues that tariffs are essentially a sales tax on local consumers and can spark further inflation. They also suggest that reciprocal tariffs go against the idea of comparative advantage in trade. The article emphasizes that political strategy is currently overriding economic principles in trade relations.</p>

            <p>Defensive miscues and missed opportunities plagued the Dodgers in their 6-4 loss to the Washington Nationals. Errors by Mookie Betts and Miguel Rojas contributed to unearned runs, while stellar defense from the Nationals prevented potential rallies. The team's struggles with fundamentals, which also contributed to a series defeat to the Phillies, are becoming a concerning trend. Despite a strong offensive performance from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers were unable to overcome their defensive shortcomings.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has issued a 5-4 decision in Trump v. J.G.G., tossing out a district court decision blocking President Trump’s attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport individuals without due process. The Court ruled that anyone targeted must bring a habeas proceeding, a process that can only be used by an individual to challenge their detention. As Justice Sotomayor warns in dissent, individuals who are unable to secure counsel, or who cannot timely appeal an adverse judgment, face the prospect of removal directly into the perilous conditions of El Salvador’s [Center for Terrorism Confinement].</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering changes to the nation's fluoride guidance, with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. planning to assemble a task force to stop recommending adding fluoride. Utah recently became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the EPA is also reviewing 'new science' on fluoride. The American Dental Association said fluoride in water was necessary for good oral health and at U.S.-recommended levels 'does not negatively impact IQ levels'.</p>

            <p>China has vowed to take countermeasures against any further tariff increases by the United States, following President Trump's threat to impose an additional 50 per cent duty on Chinese imports. The Ministry of Commerce stated that China 'firmly opposes' any moves to increase tariffs and will 'resolutely respond' if the US proceeds. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has also pledged to 'provide relending support if necessary to resolutely defend the stability of the capital market', as officials attempt to mitigate the impact of the escalating trade war.</p>

The Group of Seven (G7) nations issued a tough statement accusing China of 'illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions'. Wang labeled Manila’s frequent maritime frictions with Beijing 'a shadow play' controlled by the US and other Western powers.</p>

            <p>U.S. officials report that Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO’s military committee, was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration. While no specific reason was given, officials believe it was connected to her supportive comments regarding diversity in the force. The decision was reportedly made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, following a campaign to remove leaders who promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion. Chatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by a conservative foundation.</p>
