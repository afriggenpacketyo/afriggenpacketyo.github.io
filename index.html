          <h2>Mike Waltz's Signal Use During Cabinet Meeting Sparks Controversy Before UN Ambassadorship Nomination</h2>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal app during a Cabinet meeting, showing chats with figures like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This incident occurred a day before President Trump announced Waltz's replacement and nomination as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended Waltz's use of Signal, stating it's an approved app. However, this follows previous scrutiny over Waltz's Signal communications, including an incident where a journalist was inadvertently invited to a group chat discussing a U.S. attack in Yemen. The Pentagon's watchdog also criticized a former official's Signal use in 2021, citing breaches of record retention policies.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment, citing double jeopardy and constitutional rights violations due to concurrent state and federal prosecutions. The defense argues that Mangione faces charges in New York and Pennsylvania, resulting from "prosecutorial one-upmanship." They also challenge the terrorism upgrade, arguing a lack of intent to coerce a civilian population. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both the state charges and federal charges, which could carry the death penalty, and his attorneys are seeking to suppress statements made during his arrest in Pennsylvania, alleging Miranda rights were not provided.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio has taken on four significant government positions, including Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of USAID, Acting Archivist, and Interim National Security Advisor, leading to questions about his capacity to effectively manage these roles. Trump announced Rubio's new position following the ousting of Michael Waltz as National Security Advisor. The article notes the unprecedented nature of holding so many titles simultaneously and raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the archivist role overseeing record preservation for agencies Rubio also leads. The article highlights the close relationship between Rubio and Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, as a factor in his accumulation of roles.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Title IX investigative team is launching an investigation into Washington Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal's office over its policy allowing biologically male trans athletes on girls' sports teams. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon accused Washington state of coercing districts into hiding 'gender identity' information from parents and smuggling gender ideology into classrooms. Reykdal defended his office's enforcement of state laws regarding transgender athletes and stated it was inaccurate to say there are only two genders. The Kennewick School Board filed a Title IX complaint against Reykdal's office in March, and other districts have taken stands against the policy.</p>

Jordan kidnapped Marter, shot her, and then demanded ransom from her husband. Mississippi law permits executions via lethal injection, nitrogen gas, electrocution, or firing squad; the method for Jordan's execution was not specified in the order.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is facing criticism after his department reduced guaranteed funding for maternity safety improvements. Following a report on poor maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, nearly £100m was invested annually into improving maternity safety. However, changes by the Department of Health mean that only £2m of the funding is guaranteed to be spent on maternity care this year. Campaigners and the Royal College of Midwives have condemned the decision, fearing it will undermine efforts to improve maternity safety.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border unlawfully remained at historically low levels in April, marking three months since President Trump implemented aggressive immigration policies. Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, a slight increase from March but consistent with February's figures. These numbers contrast sharply with the high levels of illegal crossings during the Biden administration. The Trump administration attributes the decrease to its stringent immigration measures, including rapid deportations, increased troop deployment, and the dismantling of Biden-era programs.</p>

          <p>President Trump is closing a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, potentially increasing prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. The "de minimis" exemption, which applied to parcels worth less than $800, allowed these companies to ship goods directly to the US without paying duties or import taxes. Trump's administration stated that the loophole was being exploited to smuggle illegal goods, including fentanyl. The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China, and could lead to similar reviews of low-value imports in the UK and EU.</p>

In response, Apple is shifting production of iPhones bound for the American market away from China, with the majority now being made in India. The company said revenues for the first three months of the year rose 5% to $95.4bn. Amazon, another tech giant, likewise said sales were holding up, rising 8% year-on-year in its North America e-commerce business.</p>

          <p>Australia's federal election is being influenced by the looming presence of Donald Trump and his trade policies, forcing candidates to address international issues rather than focusing solely on domestic concerns. Trump's tariffs and unpredictable approach to global alliances have raised questions about Australia's relationship with the US. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has criticized Trump's tariffs as "not the act of a friend." Some analysts suggest that Trump's actions may be helping Albanese, with voters rallying around him during what feels like a crisis.</p>
