          <p>Starbucks is piloting a banana-flavored protein cold foam at five U.S. locations, paired with their iced latte. This move reflects the growing popularity of protein-enhanced foods and beverages, exemplified by celebrity-endorsed products and a $6 billion protein shake sector. As part of its "Back to Starbucks" restructuring plan, the company aims to simplify its menu by 30% by the end of fiscal year 2025 to boost sales, which have remained relatively flat. The new protein beverage is part of a larger initiative to reimagine its menu and create a more intentional customer experience, focusing on handcrafted drinks. The company hopes the new initiative will bring the company back to its glory days.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley but was acquitted of a similar charge involving Kaja Sokola in his New York retrial. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a third charge of raping Jessica Mann in 2013, leading to a partial verdict after days of tense deliberations. The retrial stemmed from the overturning of Weinstein's 2020 conviction, with the defense arguing the alleged assaults were transactional exchanges, while the prosecution maintained they constituted sexual assault. The case has been a focal point of the #MeToo movement, highlighting issues of power and consent within the entertainment industry. The outcome has led to mixed reactions, with some viewing the conviction as a victory for survivors, while others express disappointment over the hung jury on the rape charge.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly regretted some of his recent social media posts concerning President Donald Trump, stating that they "went too far." This follows a public dispute between Musk and Trump over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, which Musk opposed, leading to market concerns about Tesla and SpaceX. The feud had dissolved a tight partnership that had propelled Musk to spearhead the budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under Trump's second administration. Trump had previously indicated potential consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates challenging the bill, but later softened his stance, indicating he would be open to speaking with Musk. Musk's expression of regret signals a potential attempt to mend relations amid the fallout from their disagreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times article discusses how the tariffs imposed by President Trump are generating significant revenue for the government, with the Treasury collecting a record $22 billion in tariff payments in May. These figures provide concrete evidence of the costs associated with Trump's trade policies, which may soon translate into higher prices for consumers or narrower profit margins for companies. While Trump argues that tariffs can generate income and encourage domestic manufacturing, the revenue remains a small fraction of the federal government's overall income. House Republicans are considering using tariff revenue to offset projected losses from their tax and spending bill, though the Tax Foundation estimates that tariffs would only begin to offset the tax cuts in 2029.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to revoke a Biden-era rule limiting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin argued the Trump administration can protect the environment while growing the economy, claiming the Biden-era rules would suffocate the economy. The agency also intends to repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, despite data showing the original rule significantly reduced mercury emissions. Critics, including former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, argue the rollbacks are illogical and indefensible, prioritizing politics over science and public health. Environmental groups are preparing to sue the EPA over the proposed changes, citing potential health and economic impacts.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article argues that Donald Trump's trade war is turning into a "fiasco," as the U.S. economy slows while China's thrives. The article criticizes Trump's approach of alienating allies and imposing tariffs without a clear strategy or domestic support. It suggests that Trump's trade war is subordinate to his domestic culture war, and he may blame fellow Americans for its failure. The author contends that the only way to win is to end the trade war as quickly as possible and limit the unilateral trade powers of the president. The article also highlights the lack of broad support and the alienation of allies as key factors contributing to the trade war's struggles.</p>

          <p>A severe winter storm in South Africa's Eastern Cape province has resulted in the deaths of at least 49 people due to heavy rains and flooding. Among the victims were four schoolchildren on a minibus swept away by floodwaters. The region has experienced a combination of heavy rain and snow, leading to significant infrastructure damage and the displacement of hundreds of families. The South African government is responding to the crisis, and President Cyril Ramaphosa has warned that harsh winter conditions remain life-threatening. The storm highlights the increasing impact of climate change and global warming on extreme weather events.</p>

Teams including the Houston Rockets, Miami Heat, Minnesota Timberwolves, New York Knicks, and San Antonio Spurs have expressed interest in the 36-year-old forward. Durant is due to earn $54.7 million in 2025-26, and a trade would make him eligible for a two-year extension worth up to $112 million. The Suns finished the season with a disappointing record, leading to changes in coaching and management. The potential trade signals a significant shift in the Suns' roster strategy.</p>

Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, praised the rule for reducing the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly after the procedure.

Some left-wing critics argue that liberals, by denouncing left-wing cancel culture, have helped lay the groundwork for Trump's actions. The author contends that it was the left's tactics and rhetoric that enabled Trump's return to power and his abuse of it. The article draws parallels to the McCarthyism of the 1950s, where liberals opposed both McCarthyism and communism simultaneously. The author argues that the liberal answer is to resist pressure from both the far right and far left.</p>
