        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump has linked the brutal killing of a Dallas motel manager to the Biden administration's immigration policies, asserting the suspect, a Cuban national, should have been deported. The individual in custody has an extensive arrest history, though not all resulted in convictions. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed the suspect was under a final deportation order, but Cuba refused to accept him, leading to his supervised release. This incident has intensified the political debate over immigration enforcement and border security, with both past and present administrations assigning blame for the suspect's presence in the country.</p>

          <p>Social justice activist Reverend William Barber has strongly condemned the murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, while also using the moment to critique what he describes as "religious nationalism." Speaking at an event, Barber denounced all forms of political violence and cautioned against using religion to justify injustice or immoral public policy. He argued that true faith must challenge a nation's sins rather than provide cover for them. The reverend's comments position the tragedy within a broader moral and historical context, urging a rejection of violence from all sides.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread criticism from its customer base, Cracker Barrel is halting its restaurant rebranding and restoring its traditional "Old Country Store" aesthetic. The company acknowledged customer feedback after its new, modern logo and brighter store interiors were met with disapproval on social media. The chain will be bringing back its classic "Old Timer" signage and removing the updated decorations in remodeled locations. This decision marks a significant reversal, prioritizing the brand's nostalgic appeal and the preferences of its loyal patrons over its recent modernization strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, primarily driven by voters' deep concerns over the city's unaffordability. The survey reveals that a desire for change is outweighing the importance of political experience for many New Yorkers. Mamdani performs particularly well among those who prioritize the cost of living and want a mayor who will oppose former President Trump. In contrast, former Governor Andrew Cuomo shows more competitive support among voters for whom crime is the top issue.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Federal Crackdown in Washington D.C. May Be Counterproductive to Safety</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 16:47:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis argues that the deployment of federal forces in Washington, D.C., to combat crime may have long-term negative consequences that outweigh short-term statistical gains. While crime rates appear to have declined, the article suggests the crackdown is harming the local economy, as immigrant workers stay home and tourism dips. Furthermore, the strategy has diverted funds from community-based violence prevention programs and is reportedly eroding the crucial trust between residents and local law enforcement, potentially making the city less safe in the long run.</p>

          <p>After a challenging first quarter, Tesla's stock has experienced a dramatic turnaround, erasing all its losses for the year and soaring 85% from its low point in April. The rebound is attributed to renewed Wall Street confidence, bolstered by factors such as CEO Elon Musk's recent $1 billion share purchase and positive reception for its MegaBlocks battery storage systems. This recovery demonstrates investor optimism despite the company facing ongoing challenges, including an aging electric vehicle lineup and increased competition from Chinese manufacturers.

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, has laid off 500 workers from its data annotation team, a group responsible for training its Grok chatbot. The company stated the move was a "strategic pivot" to shift focus from generalist AI tutors to more specialized ones, suggesting a change in its approach to AI development. This reorganization comes as xAI aims to compete with established industry leaders like OpenAI and Google DeepMind in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence. The layoffs affect a significant portion of the team.</p>

          <p>Two separate sailing crews, totaling nine people, were rescued off the coast of Portugal after their vessels were attacked by orcas. No injuries were reported in the incidents, which occurred near Lisbon and the Bay of Cascais. These encounters are the latest in a growing number of documented interactions where orcas have aggressively engaged with boats in the waters around the Iberian Peninsula.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary has announced that a "framework" deal has been reached with China regarding the future ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations. This agreement, forged during trade talks in Madrid, aims to resolve national security concerns that led to a law requiring the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest or face a ban. While the deal still needs final approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping, it marks a significant step toward a resolution in the long-running, high-stakes dispute over the popular social media platform.</p>

          <p>Several individuals across different industries, including a sports reporter, a political pundit, and a university employee, have been fired or suspended over public comments made following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. These incidents underscore the broad legal authority of private employers to terminate staff for speech deemed harmful to the company's reputation or in violation of workplace policies. Legal experts affirm that First Amendment free speech protections are generally not applicable to private-sector employment, allowing companies to take action against what they consider disruptive or inappropriate public statements.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve poised to cut interest rates, savers are advised to strategically reposition their funds to maximize returns. For those with a significant sum like $10,000, moving money out of traditional low-yield savings accounts is recommended. Top alternatives include locking in a high, fixed rate with a certificate of deposit (CD) before rates fall further. Other options are high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts, which currently offer competitive, though variable, rates while maintaining greater liquidity for the depositor.

          <p>The deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, a key date for self-employed individuals, freelancers, and investors. Tax experts are advising that calculating these payments could be more complex this year due to recent tax changes enacted under the Trump administration. To avoid potential underpayment penalties, filers are encouraged to use the IRS's "safe harbor" rules, which generally require paying at least 90% of the current year's tax liability or 100% to 110% of the previous year's, depending on income level.

Sneed allegedly told investigators he brought the gun to work for protection and that he has no formal firearms training or concealed carry permit. The tourist was shot in the hip and hospitalized, while Sneed faces multiple charges, including battery with a deadly weapon.</p>
