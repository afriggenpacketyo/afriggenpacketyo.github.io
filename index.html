          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its policy interest rate steady at 2.5%, prioritizing financial stability amid concerns over Seoul's rapidly rising housing prices and household debt. This move comes after a rate cut in May and despite a first-quarter economic contraction, signaling the bank's focus on mitigating risks from the housing market. The decision is influenced by South Korea's unique "jeonse" rental system, where large deposits funded by loans contribute to high household debt levels. Authorities are now assessing the impact of recent measures intended to cool the overheated property market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA. This appointment follows the withdrawal of billionaire Jared Isaacman's nomination, which Trump stated was due to Isaacman's Democratic political donations and his close professional ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX. Duffy takes leadership at a critical time for the space agency, which is focused on lunar missions and future human exploration of Mars. Duffy is the latest official in the administration to hold dual roles, highlighting a trend of consolidating responsibilities within the government.</p>

          <p>Chinese exporters who have relocated manufacturing to Southeast Asian nations are now facing significant uncertainty due to the Trump administration's ambiguous but threatening tariff policies. The U.S. has signaled intentions to target goods transshipped through the region to circumvent duties on Chinese products, but a lack of clear implementation details has stalled business decisions. This dynamic is disrupting supply chains and forcing many Chinese companies to adopt a cautious "wait-and-see" approach. The policy aims to prevent Southeast Asia from becoming a simple workaround for avoiding U.S. tariffs on China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a recent pause in some shipments. President Trump stated the move is necessary for Ukraine to defend itself against ongoing Russian attacks, particularly those targeting civilian areas in major cities. The Pentagon confirmed the decision, emphasizing the goal of securing a lasting peace. This policy shift occurred after the White House had halted some arms transfers to review U.S. military stockpile levels, a decision that reportedly caused confusion and was not fully communicated to the State Department.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, effective August 1, is expected to increase costs for a wide range of consumer goods. Economists and industry experts warn that because copper is essential for products like appliances, electronics, EVs, and home construction materials, the tariff will likely lead to higher prices for consumers. The administration justifies the tariff on national security grounds, noting copper's importance for military and defense systems. However, critics argue it will fuel inflation and negatively impact industries reliant on the metal, which makes up a significant portion of U.S. imports. (not investment advice)</p>

The disciplinary actions, ranging from 10 to 42-day suspensions, affect both supervisory and line agents.

The recovery has been uneven, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a slower return to pre-pandemic life expectancy levels compared to white and Asian residents.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, explicitly linking the economic penalty to the ongoing prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. President Trump called the trial a "witch-hunt" and demanded it end immediately, a move that Brazil's President Lula da Silva rejected as an unacceptable threat to his country's sovereignty. The tariff on Brazil is the highest among a new wave of duties announced against various nations. Unlike most other targeted countries, the U.S. actually runs a trade surplus with Brazil, suggesting the move is primarily political rather than economic.</p>

          <p>The United States has confirmed 1,288 cases of measles so far this year, marking the highest number of infections recorded since 1992. According to the CDC, this total surpasses the significant outbreak of 2019, with the majority of current cases linked to an outbreak in West Texas that has resulted in two pediatric deaths. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the once-eliminated virus to declining vaccination rates in certain communities. The MMR vaccine is considered safe and highly effective, and officials continue to recommend it as the best protection against the highly contagious disease.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs of federal workers. The decision allows the administration to resume its efforts to reduce the size of the federal government, which had been blocked by a judge who ruled the president needed congressional approval. In its unsigned opinion, the court stated the government was likely to succeed on the merits of the case. This ruling is a significant victory for the administration's government reorganization agenda but a blow to federal employee unions.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia's blue-collar city workers have reached a tentative three-year contract agreement with the city, ending an eight-day strike that disrupted services like trash collection. The union, which represents 9,000 workers including sanitation staff and 911 dispatchers, settled for a 3% annual raise and a one-time bonus, significantly less than their initial demands. Mayor Cherelle Parker stood firm on the city's budget constraints throughout the negotiations. Workers have returned to their jobs, and sanitation services are expected to be back to normal by the weekend.</p>

This article suggests the movie's themes of alienation and searching for a home resonate deeply with the experiences of Latino children and immigrant communities facing fear and uncertainty. The film's production was also marked by controversy over the alleged removal of a queer storyline. Despite its box office struggles, the film is seen as a relevant story about a Latino hero who ultimately redefines home on his own terms.</p>
