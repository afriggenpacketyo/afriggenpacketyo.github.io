          <p>Protests erupted in downtown Los Angeles over the weekend in response to federal immigration enforcement operations, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. The Trump administration deployed the California National Guard to address the unrest, which included demonstrators halting traffic on the 101 Freeway. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and requested its rescission, fearing it would escalate tensions. The White House maintained the deployment was necessary to address lawlessness, while protesters voiced strong opposition to the immigration sweeps. The situation remains tense as authorities work to maintain order amidst ongoing demonstrations.</p>

          <p>A new travel ban, signed by President Trump, restricting entry to the U.S. for citizens of a dozen countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, has gone into effect. The ban fully restricts nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while partially restricting entry for citizens of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Unlike the 2017 ban, this one is broader and expected to withstand legal challenges, although it has sparked criticism for being discriminatory. The ban is based on national security concerns, visa overstay rates, and alleged lack of reliable screening processes in the targeted countries.</p>

          <p>China's export growth in May fell short of expectations, primarily due to a significant drop in shipments to the United States, despite a temporary trade truce.

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticized President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles amidst immigration protests. The board argued that the deployment was ahistoric, based on false pretenses, and likely to escalate tensions, especially since Governor Newsom did not request the troops. Trump invoked a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, claiming a rebellion against the U.S. government, a claim the board disputes. The editorial draws parallels to historical instances of federal intervention over state objections, such as John F. Kennedy's deployment of troops to desegregate the University of Alabama.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles following rumors of an immigration raid at a hardware store in Paramount, California. The unrest was sparked by claims that day laborers, many of whom are undocumented immigrants, had been rounded up and arrested. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denied the rumors of a raid at the store, the protests turned violent, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump deployed the California National Guard in response to the unrest, prompting criticism from Governor Newsom.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's decision to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, likening his actions to those of a “dictator.” Newsom accused Trump of inciting violence, creating chaos, and militarizing cities, demanding the order be rescinded. The deployment follows clashes between National Guard troops and demonstrators protesting Trump’s anti-immigration program. Newsom shared a rebuke signed by Democratic governors, describing the deployment as “an alarming abuse of power.”</p>

          <p>The Posse Comitatus Act, which generally bars the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, is at the center of a dispute between President Trump and California Governor Newsom over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. Trump deployed the National Guard after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were reportedly attacked, while Newsom objected, calling the deployment unlawful and inflammatory. The law has exceptions, including congressional decree, the Insurrection Act, or when state governments are unable or unwilling to impose law and order.
