          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, aiming to mend strained ties with President Xi Jinping. Both nations are grappling with the economic impact of US tariffs, which have recently increased on Indian goods. Despite a history of border disputes and mistrust, including the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, a stronger relationship could offer mutual economic benefits and present a united front in a multipolar world. The article highlights that India's attendance at the SCO reflects a strategic shift following a downturn in relations with Washington, signaling Delhi's diverse foreign policy options. This visit could mark a turning point in managing expectations of other global powers regarding Asia's stability.</p>

          <p>Canadian tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime, the 25th seed, defeated world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in a four-set comeback at the US Open, securing his spot in the last 16. This victory marks Auger-Aliassime's first Grand Slam win against a top-five opponent and his return to the second week in New York since 2021. The three-hour, 48-minute match concluded late, highlighting ongoing debates about Grand Slam scheduling and late-night finishes. Zverev's early US Open exit since 2018 signals a faltering hard-court season for the German, while Auger-Aliassime's performance offers a significant boost after a period of uneven seasons and injuries. He will next face Russia’s Andrey Rublev.</p>

The next drawing is scheduled for Monday at 11 p.m. ET, with an estimated cash value of $498.4 million. This marks the sixth time the top prize has crossed the billion-dollar threshold in Powerball's 33-year history. No one has claimed the jackpot since May 31, contributing to the massive rollover. The article notes that four of the five previous billion-plus jackpots were won in California, including the record-setting $2.04 billion prize in 2022.</p>

These drones are used to broadcast loud sounds like AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck,' movie clips, and live human voices to scare the predators away. This experiment is a response to increasing conflicts between recovering wolf populations and ranchers, with nonlethal deterrence methods being crucial. The article notes that while the technology shows promise in reducing livestock deaths and promoting coexistence, its high cost and limitations in wooded areas pose challenges for widespread adoption. Scientists are still assessing whether wolves might eventually habituate to these novel deterrents. One notable success involved a drone pilot directly telling a wolf to 'get out of here,' prompting its immediate retreat.</p>

          <p>The No. 9 LSU Tigers earned a hard-fought 17-10 road victory against the No. 4 Clemson Tigers in a defensive battle. Offense was scarce early on, with the game seeing multiple punts and field goals before the first touchdown late in the second half. LSU's quarterback Garrett Nussmeier impressed in his second year as a starter, completing 28 of 38 passes for 230 yards. Despite some missed opportunities, including a lost fumble and a pull-hooked field goal, LSU capitalized on a forced three-and-out to score the decisive touchdown in the fourth quarter.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' lead in the National League West has narrowed to one game after a 6-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite a stellar performance from pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Glasnow, who hasn't secured a win in 152 days, pitched a no-hitter into the sixth inning and a shutout into the seventh, throwing a season-high 100 pitches. However, the Dodgers' offense struggled, scoring only one run and leaving eight runners on base, failing to provide their ace with run support. The article highlights the team's difficulty against pitchers with ERAs over 5.00, having lost all four such games recently.

Guglielmelli, driven by a desire to avoid alimony and regain control, attempted to hire his business associate, Rick Fuhrmann, to carry out the murder. Fuhrmann, instead of complying, secretly recorded Guglielmelli discussing the plot and then reported him to authorities. The recordings captured Guglielmelli's explicit instructions, including his desire for Olsen to be sexually assaulted and decapitated. Despite Fuhrmann's own credibility issues as an alleged conman, the audio evidence led to Guglielmelli's arrest and a plea deal for attempted murder, resulting in a nine-year prison sentence. Olsen, who survived the plot, continues to fear for her safety following his parole release in 2019, highlighting the lasting trauma of his vengeful intentions.</p>

Daly questions Tichelman's initial actions, such as her 'glacial' demeanor on surveillance video, but also highlights Hayes's role in arranging the encounter and asking for the drug injection. The article suggests that while Tichelman broke the law by providing heroin and not calling for help, Hayes contributed to his own demise.

          <p>President Trump, in a recent interview, expressed less confidence in arranging a one-on-one meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite his earlier efforts. He suggested that trilateral talks involving himself, Putin, and Zelenskyy were more likely to occur. Zelenskyy, for his part, voiced frustration over Russia's perceived lack of constructive engagement and its delays in direct leader-level negotiations, accusing Moscow of using these tactics to appear cooperative to the U.S. while continuing its offensive. The article highlights the ongoing military conflict, with Russia claiming significant territorial gains and launching aerial attacks on Ukraine, underscoring the urgency and complexity of peace efforts.

          <p>More than 500 employees at the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA) and other US government-funded international broadcasters, are slated to lose their jobs. This 'reduction in force' follows President Trump's directive to reduce federal bureaucracy and pare down VOA's operations. The article notes that this move comes despite a federal judge previously blocking the acting CEO, Kari Lake, from firing VOA's director and ruling that the administration had not complied with orders to restore VOA's operations. Employees have condemned these actions, viewing them as continued attacks on the agency and its mission to project America's voice abroad. The layoffs are intended to streamline the agency and save taxpayer money, according to a Trump administration official.</p>

          <p>The Stringfellow family, traditional showpeople, are engaged in a high-stakes legal battle to prevent their eviction from a yard in Govan, near Glasgow, where they have lived for over 40 years. Glasgow City Council seeks to redevelop the area as part of a multi-million-pound regeneration plan, arguing the family has no right to occupy the land. The case, heading to Scotland's highest court, is significant as it could test the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, incorporated into Scots law last year. The family's legal team will argue that the eviction would breach the five-year-old granddaughter's right to a secure home and that showpeople should have similar eviction protections as social housing tenants.

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in its beer consumption habits, with overall beer sales plummeting to their lowest in over 30 years, while non-alcoholic varieties surge in popularity. Sales of alcohol-free beer have more than doubled since 2013, even as traditional beer sales fell by 6.3% in the first half of 2025. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting, with non-alcoholic options now making up a quarter of their production and being promoted at sporting events as a healthy alternative. The article notes a growing health consciousness among younger Germans, who are consuming alcohol more mindfully. Despite this trend, traditional beer remains deeply embedded in German culture, particularly at folk festivals.</p>

          <p>The iconic Metal Gear Solid series is making a comeback with a remake of its third installment, 'Metal Gear Solid Delta,' a decade after its acclaimed creator, Hideo Kojima, had an acrimonious split with publisher Konami. The article explores the reasons behind Kojima's departure, widely believed to be due to the spiraling costs of 'Metal Gear Solid V.' Despite the series' significant impact on cinematic gaming and its exploration of complex themes, Konami shifted focus away from console games after Kojima left. The decision to remake 'Metal Gear Solid 3' is attributed to its strong fan base, its position as a prequel, and the current trend of successful video game remakes. Early reviews suggest the remake is a faithful recreation, preserving the original's essence while updating graphics and audio.</p>

The article highlights the emotional toll on learners like Teddy, who described shaking during a lesson due to aggressive drivers. In response, instructors are increasingly installing dashcams, with footage leading to action in 7 out of 10 cases, as inconsiderate driving is an offense. Police emphasize that such behavior can result in warnings, vehicle impoundment, and increased insurance costs. This situation underscores a need for greater empathy and kindness on the roads.</p>

The premise involves couples meeting briefly, having a fake wedding, and then being stranded on a remote tropical island to test if love can thrive under challenging, isolated conditions. Contestants describe the experience as 'hell,' citing issues like mosquitoes, extreme heat, lack of personal hygiene products, and basic toilet facilities. However, participants appreciate the show's focus on authenticity and stripping away superficiality, believing it allows for deeper connections. The article suggests that the show's slightly older contestant demographic reflects a trend of people settling down later and seeking more meaningful relationships. The show aims to challenge typical dating formats by forcing genuine interaction and trust-building.</p>

A petition against the 'cultural crime' has garnered 60,000 signatures, highlighting resentment over Macron's decision to override specialist advice regarding potential irreparable damage from vibrations during transit. The article notes that while a French official defended the move, details of supporting studies remain undisclosed.

          <p>UK government scientists are deploying an unusual arsenal, including drones and sniffer dogs, to combat the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, a major threat to the country's forests. This tiny but destructive beetle has ravaged European spruce trees, and after discovering a breeding population in Kent, the UK realized the pests were arriving via wind, not just imported wood. Drones survey vast forest areas for signs of infestation, while sniffer dogs are being trialed to detect the beetles' pheromones and frass, particularly in hard-to-inspect timber stacks. The article highlights that these high-tech and natural methods have led to the UK becoming the first country to eradicate Ips Typographus from its controlled risk areas. However, rising beetle populations in Europe, exacerbated by climate change, pose ongoing incursion risks, necessitating continued vigilance and advanced modeling to predict their spread.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the controversial and largely unregulated trade in human body parts in the US, highlighting ethical concerns and allegations of exploitation. Unlike many European countries, US law allows for-profit companies, known as 'body brokers,' to acquire, dissect, and sell human remains for medical research and product testing. Critics liken the industry to 'grave-robbing,' citing cases like Harold Dillard, whose family believed his body was 'mutilated' after donation. Investigations have revealed brokers intertwined with the funeral industry, earning millions, and instances of 'bodies of the state' donations without proper family notification. While body donation is crucial for science, the article calls for more robust regulation, potentially banning for-profit brokering or increasing altruistic donations, as current VR technology cannot fully replicate cadaver-based training. This situation underscores a deep ethical debate about dignity in death and the commercialization of human remains.</p>

          <p>New government data for England indicates that pupils who missed school during the first week of September 2024 were significantly more likely to become 'persistently absent' throughout the academic year. Over half of those partially absent in week one eventually missed at least 10% of school, compared to only 14% of full attendees. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize early attendance for the 2025 term, emphasizing that 'every day of school missed is a day stolen from a child's future.' While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains higher than pre-Covid levels. The article notes that despite incentives and support programs, unauthorized term-time holidays and medical treatments abroad continue to contribute to absence issues, highlighting the need for a more strategic approach beyond school gates.</p>
