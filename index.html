        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to royal experts, Prince William is reportedly unwilling to reconcile with Prince Harry due to Harry's public criticisms of the royal family. The experts suggest that the rift has widened over the years, exacerbated by Harry's recent interviews and his memoir 'Spare.' King Charles may need to intervene if Harry and Meghan wish to reconcile and return, but William's determination to protect the monarchy remains a significant obstacle. The situation highlights the ongoing tensions within the royal family and the challenges of reconciliation in the public eye.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent agreement with Washington, analysts say it will take years before Ukraine can rival China as a top source of critical minerals for US production of hi-tech gear, green energy and aerospace hardware. Most of Ukraine’s mineral stores are in parts of the country occupied by Russia, and the rest will take years to extract due to a lack of processing capacity. China controls a significant portion of the world's rare earth reserves and refining capabilities, making it difficult for Ukraine to compete in the near term.</p>

          <p>A new impact assessment suggests that assisted dying cases in England and Wales could exceed 4,000 per year within a decade if MPs vote to legalize it. The report estimates initial savings for the NHS but also substantial costs for staffing and training, with each case involving multiple healthcare professionals. The government remains neutral on the issue, while proponents emphasize the importance of choice and compassion, opponents raise concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals. The bill is set to return to the House of Commons for a crucial vote later this month.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the US economy is being tested as the first quarter saw a contraction in GDP, raising concerns about his administration's trade policies. While Trump blames the previous administration, analysts point to his tariffs and the resulting uncertainty as factors impacting economic activity. The erratic rollout of tariffs has created confusion for businesses and consumers, and polling suggests growing apprehension among rural and lower-income voters, who are concerned about the economy.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's efforts could lead to a universal antivenom. He endured over 200 bites and 700 injections of venom from some of the world's deadliest snakes, driven by a desire to develop better therapies for snakebite victims.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and consolidate power, officials say. The reforms include trimming bureaucracy, reorganizing the state, and eliminating public sector jobs. Changes to Vietnam's administrative map are allowing for these cuts. The shake-up also aims to address dysfunction created by the party's anti-corruption campaign, while Vietnam is watching regional trends.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Colorado, Denver, and local leaders over "sanctuary" policies, claiming they hinder federal immigration enforcement. The suit alleges that these policies interfere with the federal government's authority and violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Local officials have responded, defending their policies and vowing to protect their values. The lawsuit is part of a broader crackdown by the Trump administration on cities with sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions and other key car parts has come into force in the US, raising pressure on an industry finding its way through a thicket of policy changes. The new tariff comes days after Donald Trump eased the measure in response to business worries, but did not eliminate it. The US president has said the new tariff, along with a 25% import tax on cars that went into effect last month, is intended to push carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US.</p>
