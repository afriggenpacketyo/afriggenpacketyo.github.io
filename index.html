          <h2>China Considers Trade Talks with U.S., Demands Tariff Removal</h2>

          <p>China is evaluating the possibility of trade talks with the U.S. after multiple overtures from U.S. officials, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war. However, China insists that the U.S. must first remove all unilateral tariffs, viewing it as a matter of sincerity and mutual trust. Experts caution that reaching a comprehensive deal will be complex and time-consuming, given the unpredictability of Trump and strategic priorities of both sides. U.S. officials have indicated potential easing of tensions, but China emphasizes the need for concrete action rather than mere words. This comes after Trump imposed tariffs of 145% on imported Chinese goods this year, prompting China to impose retaliatory levies of 125%.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 00:55:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated the de minimis rule, a loophole allowing Americans to buy cheap Chinese goods tariff-free. This change, effective Friday, impacts goods from mainland China and Hong Kong, potentially raising prices for consumers and affecting online retailers like Shein and Temu. The administration cites concerns about fentanyl smuggling and harm to U.S. manufacturers as reasons for the change. The de minimis exception was created in the 1930s to ease the work of customs officials who were required to collect tariffs in cases where the revenue would be less than the cost of collecting the duties. The change is expected to weigh on airlines and private carriers like FedEx and UPS, which have had a steady business flying small-dollar goods across the world to the United States.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order seeking to cut funding for public broadcasting organizations NPR and PBS, labeling them as partisan and biased. The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to cease direct funding to these outlets, a move that NPR and PBS have previously warned would have a devastating impact on citizens who rely on them for reliable news, especially during emergencies. A White House statement accompanying the order asserts that the news outlets have fueled partisanship.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The elimination of the de minimis exception, which allowed tariff-free entry of goods under $800, is reshaping e-commerce between the U.S. and China. American shoppers now face higher prices on goods from platforms like Shein and Temu, while Chinese exporters are struggling to find new markets. Some factories in Guangzhou have already suspended operations, raising concerns about job losses. The change, driven by trade tensions and concerns over illegal goods, marks a significant shift after nearly a decade of booming e-commerce trade in small parcels. This trade had ballooned. Some four million packages a day entered the United States last year with no customs inspection and no duties paid.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military launched airstrikes near Syria's presidential palace in Damascus, following warnings from Prime Minister Netanyahu about protecting the Druze minority. The strikes come amid sectarian clashes between Sunni gunmen and the Druze community, triggered by an audio clip criticizing the Prophet Muhammad. Netanyahu stated that Israel will not allow Syrian forces to deploy south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community. This marks the second time Israel has struck Syria in recent days, reflecting concerns over the instability following the ouster of Bashar Assad.</p>

          <p>Standard Chartered has reported first-quarter profits exceeding expectations, driven by strong growth in wealth management, global markets, and global banking. The bank's profit before taxation rose to $2.103 billion, with Wealth Solutions being a standout performer, posting a 28% increase in operating income. While the bank booked a $219 million credit impairment charge, CEO Bill Winters expressed confidence in the bank's ability to improve returns despite global economic complexity. The earnings do not fully capture the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, as the "reciprocal" tariffs announced in April were put on hold.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to accelerate tariff talks, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal by June. After meetings in Washington, officials plan intensive ministerial discussions starting mid-May, focusing on non-tariff barriers and economic security cooperation. Japan is considering proposals to increase purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and expand tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice. The Trump administration's new 24 percent tariffs on goods imported from Japan have been paused until early July under a 90-day reprieve of its so-called reciprocal duties targeted at dozens of trading partners.</p>

          <p>The United States has secured a deal to share the rights to Ukraine's mineral reserves, including elements crucial for high-tech applications. However, extracting these resources faces formidable challenges, including the ongoing war with Russia and the need for extensive surveys and infrastructure upgrades. President Trump believes the U.S. stands to gain hundreds of billions of dollars from the deal, aiming to reduce reliance on China's dominance in mineral extraction and processing. This could be a good deal for both Ukraine and the United States.</p>

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance has said the war in Ukraine is "not going to end any time soon", in an interview with Fox News. His comments came shortly after Washington signed a deal with Kyiv to share the profits of Ukraine's rare earth minerals in return for future US security assistance. Vance said the question facing the US administration now was how it could help Russia and Ukraine "find middle ground" to end the conflict that has been raging for more than three years.</p>

The rule, tied to the Clean Air Act, required major sources of these pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount. Republican lawmakers argued that the rule disincentivized companies from deploying new technology to reduce pollution.
