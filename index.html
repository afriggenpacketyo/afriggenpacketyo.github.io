          <p>Reports indicate that a British passenger, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, miraculously survived the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad that killed at least 200 people. Ramesh, who was seated in 11A, contacted his family to inform them he was "fine," though he expressed concern for his brother, Ajay, who was also on the flight. Relatives described Ramesh as having injuries to his face and being covered in blood, but overall in stable condition. The flight, bound for London Gatwick, carried 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals, and one Canadian; the crash prompted statements of sympathy from King Charles and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with crisis teams mobilized in both India and the UK. The author's reflection on the events surrounding the crash is a somber reminder of the fragility of life. The survivor's resilience offers a glimmer of hope amid tragedy.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the charge of third-degree rape against Jessica Mann, following a deadlock among jurors. This development occurred a day after the jury foreperson reported feeling threatened by another juror, leading to heightened security measures. The jury had previously reached a partial verdict, finding Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley and not guilty of the same charge against Kaja Sokola. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg intends to retry the rape charge, emphasizing the power imbalance and misconceptions surrounding sexual assault. The accusers faced intense scrutiny during the trial, and the judge thanked them for their courage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold is anticipated to potentially reach a new high this week, surpassing the $3,400 per ounce mark, due to the recent uptick in inflation. The inflation report release indicated a 0.1% rise in May, deviating from the Federal Reserve's desired downward trend, which has historically driven investors to gold as a safe-haven asset. Geopolitical tensions also contribute to the potential price surge, and with the Federal Reserve expected to maintain current interest rates, a drop in gold prices is unlikely. While a price surge is possible, prospective investors should approach gold strategically, limiting it to a maximum of 10% of their portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

The United Steelworkers union has demanded details about the deal, expressing uncertainty about the nature of the partnership and whether it differs from Nippon's initial proposal to acquire U.S. Steel as a wholly-owned subsidiary.

          <p>A New York judge declared a mistrial on a rape charge in Harvey Weinstein's trial after a juror refused to continue deliberations over an alleged 2013 attack on Jessica Mann. The jury had previously found Weinstein guilty of one count of sexual assault and not guilty on another count, but remained deadlocked on the rape charge. The mistrial follows the overturning of Weinstein's earlier conviction, leading to new charges last September. The jury foreperson cited concerns about jurors "attacking" one another and making threatening comments, leading to the mistrial declaration.

Trump claimed that a 2 percentage point rate cut would save the U.S. $600 billion per year, but Powell has not taken such action. Trump stated that he might have to "force something" if the Fed does not lower rates, despite inflation being down.

          <p>The article argues that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the new head of the FDA, should ban ractopamine, a drug fed to pigs to accelerate muscle gain, citing animal welfare concerns. Ractopamine has been linked to adverse effects in pigs, including trembling, difficulty moving, and even death, and has been banned or restricted in over 165 countries. Despite these concerns, the FDA has denied petitions to ban the drug, arguing that current regulations ensure consumer safety, a stance the author criticizes. The author suggests that banning ractopamine would align with Kennedy's past criticism of factory farming and challenge a system that prioritizes industry profits over animal welfare.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they termed an "unlawful militarization." The request seeks to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and active-duty Marines beyond protecting federal buildings and property, arguing that there is no "rebellion" in Los Angeles that warrants such a deployment. The Department of Justice has argued against California's request, stating that it would amount to a "rioters' veto to enforcement of federal law."</p>

Democratic Representative Ro Khanna emphasized that the federal judiciary makes legal decisions in America, pressing Hegseth on whether he would abide by federal court rulings. Hegseth stated that his job is to ensure troops in Los Angeles are capable of supporting law enforcement and that local judges should not determine foreign or national security policy.

The decline followed Trump's renewed threat to impose country-specific tariff rates, further unsettling markets and prompting speculation about potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

          <p>The New York City mayoral race is unusually competitive, featuring former Governor Andrew Cuomo and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, amidst a field of a dozen candidates vying for the Democratic primary. The city employs ranked-choice voting, a system that allows voters to rank up to five candidates, which could lead to an unexpected outcome. Cuomo, despite his experience and financial backing, faces significant opposition due to past scandals, while Mamdani, a young progressive, has gained traction with his grassroots campaign and progressive policies.

Tony Robinson, the regional administrator for FEMA Region 6, also announced his intention to depart, further depleting the agency's experienced staff. These departures coincide with President Trump's stated desire to reduce FEMA's role and shift disaster response to the state level, as well as comments by acting FEMA administrator David Richardson who was unaware that the U.S. has a hurricane season.</p>

Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund's net investment income has not covered its distribution for the last seven years, leading to a decline in its net asset value.
