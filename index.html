          <h2>House Republicans Propose Changes to Student Loan Repayment Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 11:18:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have introduced the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan, which aims to overhaul the federal student loan system by consolidating repayment options. The proposal would reduce the current 12 repayment plans to just two: a fixed payment plan over 10 to 25 years and an income-driven repayment plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Under the RAP plan, monthly payments would be a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10% based on earnings. The GOP hopes these changes will generate savings to offset President Trump's tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Daniel Graham, one of the men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree, claims he was framed as part of a feud, according to court testimony. Graham and Adam Carruthers both deny charges of criminal damage related to the tree and Hadrian's Wall. The prosecution alleges that the pair drove from Cumbria to chop down the tree, filming the act and taking a wedge of the trunk as a trophy.

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration to implement a tariff exclusion process to prevent a recession and protect small businesses. In a letter to key trade officials, the Chamber CEO, Suzanne Clark, asked for automatic tariff exemptions for small business importers and products not produced in the U.S. She also proposed a process for businesses to quickly obtain tariff exclusions if import duties pose significant risks to U.S. employment. The White House has not signaled support for the request, suggesting tax cuts are the primary relief measure.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board has published a scathing critique of President Trump's first 100 days of his second term, arguing that he has attacked key pillars of American democracy. The editorial accuses Trump of undermining the separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, and freedom of speech. The board calls for a broad coalition to defend American democracy against what it sees as Trump's authoritarian tendencies, while acknowledging that some of his policies are legal and even effective.</p>

          <p>More than 100 children in India have fallen ill after a dead snake was reportedly found in their school lunch. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is investigating the incident, which occurred in a government-run school in Bihar. The commission has demanded a detailed report from local officials and police, including the health status of the children. Free lunches are offered to millions of children in Indian schools to encourage education, but complaints of poor food hygiene are frequent.</p>

          <p>Investors in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may be surprised by a higher tax bill on their profits, as the IRS considers gold and other precious metals to be "collectibles." This classification subjects long-term capital gains to a maximum federal tax rate of 28%, higher than the 20% rate for stocks and real estate. The collectibles rate applies to ETFs structured as trusts, potentially affecting investors in popular gold funds. President Trump's tariffs have fueled concerns about a trade war, driving investors to gold as a safe haven.</p>

Short-term CDs, ranging from six months to one year, currently provide competitive rates. The inverted yield curve phenomenon suggests that short-term CDs may be more advantageous than longer-term options, and a laddering approach is recommended for long-term savings.</p>
