          <p>Sir Tom Farmer, the Edinburgh-born founder of Kwik Fit, passed away peacefully at his home at the age of 84. He established Kwik Fit in 1971, building it into the world's largest independent tyre and automotive chain before selling it to Ford in 1999 for Â£1 billion. Beyond his business success, Sir Tom was known for his philanthropy, public roles, and commitment to the communities where he lived, also holding a majority stake in Hibernian FC for over two decades. He was knighted in 1997 and made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 2009, leaving a lasting impact on Scottish and UK life.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have initiated high-level discussions in Geneva aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, marking the first in-person contact between the two major economies since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on imports earlier in the year. The U.S. delegation includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, while China is represented by Vice Premier He Lifeng. Reflecting the impact of the tariffs, Chinese exports to the U.S. have significantly declined, prompting calls from China for the U.S. to lift unilateral tariffs and demonstrate sincerity in the talks.</p>

          <p>Representatives Titus and Omar have introduced the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025, seeking to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. The bill aims to repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that hinder federal funding for Schedule I substance research. Proponents argue that this legislation would enable policymakers to craft effective, evidence-based cannabis policies, addressing questions about medical use, dosage, and long-term impacts, while also allowing for research into other Schedule I substances like psilocybin and MDMA for therapeutic applications.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has launched an aggressive media strategy characterized by crass language, flashy tactics, and outrageous social media posts, bypassing traditional outlets to directly engage his base. This approach involves embracing viral far-right culture and nurturing a parallel information ecosystem through pro-Trump outlets, dominating the "attention economy" and reshaping narratives on key issues. While supporters see it as effective communication, critics warn that insults and lies are going unchecked, turning presidential methods into a form of WWE-style entertainment, prioritizing imagery and outrageousness over truth and respect for the office.</p>

          <p>Indian officials have stated that Pakistan has attacked 26 locations across India and is moving troops into forward areas, indicating a potential escalation of the conflict. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of provocations, while Army Col. Sofiya Qureshi noted the forward movements suggest offensive intent. India reiterated its commitment to non-escalation, provided Pakistan reciprocates, and denied Pakistan's claims of damaging Indian military infrastructure, amidst ongoing cross-border fire and rising tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Senior US and Chinese officials have met in Geneva seeking to defuse trade war tensions. Since President Donald Trump's tariff rollout, tariffs on goods imports between the world's two largest economies have soared. While a major breakthrough looks unlikely, hopes remain that the two sides will ease the punishing tariffs they have slapped on each other. Such a move would soothe troubled global markets and reassure companies reliant on US-China trade.</p>

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, told reporters on Friday that the US Constitution allowed for the legal liberty to be suspended in times of "rebellion or invasion".

          <p>Three Democratic U.S. representatives from California visited the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to express concerns over declining activity due to President Trump's tariffs. The representatives noted that the tariffs have resulted in fewer cargo containers moving through the ports, leading to potential job losses and higher prices for consumers.
