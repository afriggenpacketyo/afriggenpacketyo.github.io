          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia are set to meet in Malaysia for negotiations aimed at ending a severe border conflict. The talks, facilitated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, follow pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened trade repercussions if hostilities continued. The dispute, which has been ongoing for four days, has resulted in at least 34 deaths and displaced over 168,000 people. Despite diplomatic efforts and a mutual agreement to discuss a ceasefire, fighting has persisted, with both nations accusing each other of escalating the violence and violating humanitarian principles.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over a year ago. The company's aircraft production has increased, deliveries have hit an 18-month high, and its stock is up over 30% this year. Ortberg has focused on improving the company culture and addressing quality control issues, which were highlighted by incidents like the January 2024 door-plug blowout. While challenges remain, including FAA production caps and delays in certifying new models, major airline customers have expressed renewed confidence in Boeing's direction.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aborted its takeoff at Denver International Airport after a "possible landing gear incident," resulting in one minor injury. Passengers were evacuated via emergency slides following reports of a potential fire underneath the aircraft. According to a passenger, the plane began vibrating and shaking severely before tilting to one side on the runway. The airline has taken the aircraft out of service for inspection and apologized to customers for the experience. This marks the second major airline incident in the U.S. within a few days.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old woman has sustained potentially life-threatening head injuries following an incident on a ride at the Netley Marsh Steam and Craft Show in Hampshire. The event occurred late Saturday night, and the teenager was promptly transported to a hospital for treatment. Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary are investigating the incident in coordination with the Health and Safety Executive. A witness who provided first aid described the injury as a "degloving injury," a severe type of avulsion where the top layers of skin and tissue are torn away.</p>

          <p>A high-level European Union delegation, including President Ursula von der Leyen and Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to negotiate a trade deal and avert a potential trade war. The talks come ahead of a U.S. deadline to impose 30% tariffs on all EU imports. Trump has described the chances of a deal as "50/50," keeping global investors on edge. An agreement would center on a baseline tariff of 15% on EU goods, a compromise that Brussels may accept to restore stability for key industries like the European automotive sector.

These mechanics allegedly inflict further damage on the tires and then overcharge for the extensive repairs.

Placed near four specific hospitals in Missouri, Indiana, Oklahoma, and Montana, the signs directly link potential closures to the Trump administration's policies, particularly the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid. Rural hospitals, which heavily rely on Medicaid, are facing immense financial strain, with hundreds at risk of closure.

          <p>This article argues that the political and economic climate under President Donald Trump has led to a surprising resurgence of socialist ideas in the United States. The author posits that growing economic dissatisfaction and the perception that Trump's policies favor insiders have made once-fringe concepts more appealing, especially to younger Americans. The piece contrasts the historical failures of centrally planned economies with the modern appeal of socialism as a response to perceived capitalist excesses. It concludes that to counter this trend, market economics must be reformed to address the grievances that are fueling this revival.</p>

          <p>The near-disappearance of comprehensive event listings from publications like The New Yorker and The New York Times has fundamentally altered how people discover cultural events. The author reflects on how these listings were once a vital guide to a city's arts scene, but have been replaced by algorithm-driven social media feeds that reinforce mainstream tastes. This shift not only makes it harder for audiences to find new and niche art but also forces artists to prioritize content creation for algorithms over their craft.

          <p>The practice of tipping in the U.S. is rooted in the post-Civil War era, where it emerged as a way for employers to avoid paying wages to newly freed Black workers. This system was later codified with the creation of a "tipped minimum wage," currently $2.13 an hour at the federal level, with the expectation that customer tips make up the difference to the standard minimum wage. According to the Economic Policy Institute, this structure persists largely due to lobbying from groups like the National Restaurant Association. As a result, when customers tip, they are effectively paying the bulk of the server's wages.</p>

          <p>A Norwegian tourist alleged he was denied entry into the U.S. at Newark Liberty International Airport after border officials found a meme of Vice President JD Vance on his phone. While DHS officials claim the denial was due to admitted drug use, the incident raises questions about the scope of digital searches at the border. Legal experts confirm that under current policies, social media content and other digital files can be used as a basis for denying entry to non-citizens. U.S. citizens have more protections but can still face delays and device confiscation for refusing to comply with searches.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett has gained national attention for her sharp, confrontational style, embodying a "go low" strategy in response to Republican attacks. Known for viral clapbacks, such as her "bleach-blond, bad-built, butch body" comment aimed at Marjorie Taylor Greene, Crockett argues that Democrats need fiercer communicators to energize their base. However, her approach has caused friction within her own party, with some colleagues worrying it could alienate moderate voters. Her recent, unsuccessful bid for a House Oversight Committee leadership position highlights the ongoing debate within the Democratic party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are observing a rise in sinkhole occurrences globally, with climate change identified as a significant contributing factor. Sinkholes form when water erodes underlying bedrock, and this process is being accelerated by more frequent and intense extreme weather events. According to researchers, cycles of drought followed by heavy rainfall weaken the ground, making it more susceptible to collapse. Regions with soluble bedrock like limestone, such as Florida, parts of Turkey, and Brazil, are particularly vulnerable. Experts are using technologies like satellite sensing to monitor ground subsidence and mitigate risks.</p>

          <p>A study using GoPro cameras attached to polar bears in Canada's Hudson Bay reveals that the animals are losing significant weight as melting sea ice disrupts their ability to hunt seals. The loss of sea ice, their primary hunting platform for high-fat seals, forces the bears to spend more time on land searching for alternative food sources like bird carcasses and berries. However, these terrestrial foods are far less nutritious, leading to an average weight loss of 46 pounds over three weeks for the bears studied.

Migrant crossings have plummeted to their lowest levels in decades, leaving shelters in Mexican border cities like Ciudad Juárez largely empty. The crackdown has prompted some migrants already in the U.S. to "self-deport" out of fear. Concurrently, the administration's tariff threats have created economic uncertainty, causing factory layoffs in Juárez and stalling industrial projects on the U.S. side, profoundly altering life and commerce in the region.</p>
