          <p>Newly public court documents allege that convicted triple-murderer Erin Patterson made multiple attempts to poison her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, long before the fatal mushroom-laced meal. The allegations, which were suppressed during her trial, detail incidents involving tainted pasta, curry, and cookies that left him severely ill and, on one occasion, in a coma. These charges were ultimately dropped before the trial, but the revelations provide a disturbing context to the case where Patterson was found guilty of murdering three relatives.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying a unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers," who are 80 years or older but possess the memory capabilities of people decades younger. Research from Northwestern University's SuperAging Program aims to understand why their brains shrink more slowly and resist the cognitive decline typically associated with aging, including conditions like Alzheimer's. By examining the biological and lifestyle factors of this resilient group, researchers hope to uncover insights that could benefit the broader population in maintaining brain health into old age.</p>

          <p>An NPR discussion explores the pervasive issue of smartphone addiction, highlighting how the devices are engineered to capture and hold our attention. Cultural critics and producers note that a phone's mere proximity can diminish cognitive performance, even when it is silent, due to the mental energy spent anticipating notifications. The conversation covers the rise of "dumbphones" as a potential solution, ultimately suggesting that intentional time away from screens and fostering real-world connections are more effective than willpower alone in managing this modern challenge.</p>

          <p>The space industry is experiencing a renewed wave of companies going public, moving beyond the SPAC trend that dominated recent years. Firms like Karman Holdings and Firefly Aerospace have had successful market debuts, signaling growing investor confidence in the sector's long-term potential. This uptick is supported by increased private investment and government interest, such as the U.S. push for new defense systems. Analysts note that while geopolitical tensions pose risks, the alignment with national innovation priorities makes space-tech an attractive area for investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenya is facing potential diplomatic repercussions from the United States after strengthening its relationship with China. Washington has initiated a review of Kenya's Major Non-NATO Ally status, a designation that provides significant military and economic benefits, following President William Ruto's praise of China's role in a "new world order." The move highlights the geopolitical tug-of-war between the U.S. and China for influence in Africa, with the U.S. leveraging the special status to signal its displeasure with Kenya's growing alignment with its rival.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a steep 39% tariff on Swiss imports, citing a $48 billion trade deficit that Switzerland argues is misrepresented. A significant portion of this deficit is attributed to the high value of gold that is refined in Switzerland but not produced there, a point Swiss officials argue inflates the trade figures unfairly. The tariffs are expected to heavily impact Swiss luxury goods like watches and chocolates, and despite diplomatic efforts, Switzerland has so far failed to secure an exemption, leaving its export-oriented businesses to face significant economic pressure.
