        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report reveals that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) used journalists' phone numbers, provided to its press office, to check for unauthorized contact with its officers and staff. This practice of "defensive operations" against leaks occurred between 2011 and 2023 and at one point involved checking 65,000 calls against 383 journalists' numbers. The report by Angus McCullough KC also found 21 instances of unlawful use of covert powers to uncover reporters' sources, double the number previously known. While the review concluded that surveillance was not "widespread or systemic," it criticized specific instances and a lack of legal oversight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is aiming to become a global leader in autonomous driving technology but faces significant obstacles that are slowing its progress compared to the U.S. and China. High car ownership, a strong taxi lobby, and a well-developed public transit system create a challenging market for new mobility services. While German law permits Level 4 autonomy, deployments are limited to small, cautious shuttles on fixed routes, partly due to manufacturers' reluctance to release immature systems. Projects like NeMo in Paderborn are developing innovative concepts, but the industry is calling for nationwide government support to move beyond pilot projects.</p>

          <p>Reality television personality Gia Giudice revealed that she reached out to President Trump for assistance regarding her father, Joe Giudice, who was deported to Italy in 2019 and now resides in the Bahamas. She stated that her family was inspired to act after Trump granted a pardon to Todd and Julie Chrisley, giving them new hope for their own situation. Joe Giudice was deported after serving a 41-month prison sentence for fraud charges; though he moved to the U.S. as an infant, he never became a citizen. While Gia did not receive a response, her mother, Teresa Giudice, expressed pride in her daughter's effort to reunite their family.</p>

          <p>In his new book, psychotherapist Joe Nucci addresses and debunks several viral mental health myths and misuses of "therapy-speak" that have spread on social media. He argues that concepts like "people pleaser," "love bombing," and "narcissist" have been oversimplified, leading to harmful applications in daily life. Nucci cautions against using a diagnosis as a complete identity, which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and clarifies that therapy can provide tools for relationships but cannot replace the experience of dating itself. The article emphasizes the need for nuance and professional guidance over simplistic online advice.</p>

After the match, Boulter expressed her satisfaction with the win, noting that it comes after a "tough couple of months" that included early exits at Wimbledon and the US Open. She credited her mental strength for helping her navigate Baptiste's disruptive style of play and secure the win.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Guardians have erased a 10-game deficit in less than a month to tie the Detroit Tigers for first place in the American League Central division. Cleveland secured a 5-2 victory over Detroit, fueled by a career-high-tying 12 strikeouts from pitcher Gavin Williams. The Tigers' collapse includes a seven-game losing streak and 10 losses in their last 11 games, while the Guardians have MLB's best record in September. The game featured a shaky performance from Tigers ace Tarik Skubal, who hit a batter in the face and committed several uncharacteristic errors as Cleveland rallied to take the lead.</p>

          <p>In Oregon's oldest unidentified-person case, police have recovered the partial remains of a woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe," nearly 80 years after her murder. The woman's dismembered body was first found in burlap sacks in the Willamette River in 1946, with the cause of death determined to be blunt-force trauma. The case went cold after critical evidence, including the victim's remains, went missing from police custody in the 1950s. Investigators recently located the likely interment site at a local cemetery, and the exhumed remains will now undergo advanced forensic testing in hopes of finally identifying the victim.</p>

          <p>The North Carolina legislature has passed "Iryna's Law," a criminal justice bill created in response to the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail. The law aims to limit cashless bail and increase mental health evaluations for defendants, as the suspect in Zarutska's killing had numerous prior arrests. The bill also includes a controversial provision that could restart executions in the state for the first time since 2006. It directs the corrections department to find an alternative execution method if lethal injection is unavailable, a move Democrats have criticized as a cynical addition to the bill.</p>

          <p>After a significant weekly spike in refinancing activity, overall mortgage demand in the U.S. has stalled, with total application volume rising by a negligible 0.6%. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell slightly to 6.34%, its lowest since September 2024, but this was not enough to sustain momentum. Refinance demand, which had surged 58% the prior week, grew by only 1%, while applications for home purchases remained flat. This indicates that while lower rates have provided some incentive for refinancing, the broader housing market remains sluggish as homebuyers show little increased activity.

          <p>In a landmark medical achievement, doctors have successfully treated Huntington's disease for the first time using a novel gene therapy. The treatment, which involves a single, lengthy brain surgery, was shown to slow the clinical progression of the devastating neurodegenerative disease by 75% in a trial of 29 patients. This result could extend patients' quality of life by decades and potentially prevent symptoms if administered early. The therapy works by delivering a specially designed piece of DNA into brain cells to reduce levels of the toxic protein that causes the disease. Researchers at University College London described the results as "spectacular" and beyond their "wildest dreams."</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has ordered an urgent review into the cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments following a BBC investigation. The report found that asylum seekers were being taken on long-distance journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as a 250-mile trip to a GP appointment that reportedly cost the Home Office £600. While asylum seekers are given a weekly bus pass, taxis are booked for other necessary travel without public transport being offered as an alternative. The Home Office stated it does not keep figures on total taxi expenditures for asylum seekers, prompting criticism and calls for accountability.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent announcement suggesting a link between Tylenol (acetaminophen) and autism has provoked a furious backlash from medical professionals, scientists, and the public. Critics condemned the claim as unscientific, dangerous, and a bad-faith effort to distract from other political issues. Medical experts called the association "utterly spurious," while pregnant individuals highlighted that their options for pain management are already extremely limited. Many respondents also noted the harmful nature of framing autism as a condition to be avoided, with some suggesting the rhetoric aligns with a broader anti-science and authoritarian political agenda.</p>

          <p>This article details the challenges and indignities faced by incarcerated women managing their menstrual cycles in a system designed without their needs in mind. With a limited monthly supply of inadequate sanitary products and a rule restricting them to seven pairs of white underwear, women struggle to maintain basic hygiene and dignity. The lack of privacy, limited access to cleaning supplies like bleach, and the presence of male guards create an environment of public shame. The author, an incarcerated writer, describes how this constant struggle serves as a secondary punishment, suggesting a simple change to dark-colored underwear could restore a measure of dignity.</p>

          <p>The city of Portland, Oregon, has formally notified ICE that it is violating its local permit by illegally detaining immigrants overnight at its field office. An investigation found 25 instances since January where individuals were held for more than the 12-hour limit, with one group held for over 27 hours. The facility's permit explicitly bars housing anyone overnight, a condition set when it was approved in 2011. This standoff occurs amid ongoing local protests and threats from President Trump to deploy federal troops to the city. The building's landlord has 30 days to correct the violations before potential penalties are imposed.</p>

          <p>A trend of "job hugging" is emerging in the U.S. labor market, as anxious workers are choosing stability over seeking new opportunities, causing the quits rate to fall to its lowest level since 2016. While low turnover might seem positive for employers, experts warn it can mask rising employee disengagement and underutilization of skills, which costs companies billions in lost productivity. This reluctance to switch jobs is also slowing wage growth and could lead to broader economic stagnation. The trend reflects a significant shift from the "great resignation" era, with fear of the unknown now driving workforce behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the modern anti-vaccine movement, particularly on the political right, is fueled by a misplaced nostalgia for a past perceived as healthier and more natural. The author contends that this view ignores the grim reality of a pre-vaccine world, where diseases like smallpox, polio, and measles routinely killed thousands, especially children. While acknowledging the defects of the present, the piece criticizes figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for romanticizing an era with horrifying infant mortality rates and other serious health issues. The article concludes that this fantasy of a pristine past has potentially lethal consequences in the present.</p>

        </div>

          <p>This article presents a political analysis of the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, arguing that the MAGA movement is transforming him into its first martyr. The author draws parallels to the ancient Christian and Islamic use of martyr veneration to grow from localized movements into global religions. By blurring Kirk's specific Pentecostal faith into a generic "Christian" identity tied to nationalism, the movement is creating a powerful symbol that could help it evolve beyond its focus on Donald Trump. This strategy allows the language of mercy to coexist with calls for vengeance, creating a durable political faith.</p>

Goodell stated that the rapidly changing media landscape necessitates flexibility, and an earlier renegotiation could add billions to the league's revenue. This move could significantly impact team valuations and salary caps, but would require agreement from all current media partners to open discussions ahead of schedule.</p>
