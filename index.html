          <h2>Federal Reserve Maintains Interest Rates Amid Trump Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 20:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold steady its benchmark interest rate, currently ranging from 4.25% to 4.5%, despite pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs. The central bank is carefully evaluating the potential economic impact of Trump's trade policies, especially regarding inflation and unemployment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted rising risks but emphasized the need for a 'wait-and-see' approach given the uncertainty surrounding the economy's trajectory under the Trump administration's trade policies. Wall Street analysts interpreted Powell's statements as a sign of increasing stagflation risks, indicating a combination of slower economic growth and higher inflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom proposed a federal film tax credit to boost the American film industry. Trump, who recently announced 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., claimed Newsom's policies have 'decimated' the industry. The President also attacked California's High-Speed Rail project, calling it a 'stupid project' with massive cost overruns. Despite the criticism, Trump expressed a liking for Newsom and acknowledged his efforts during the January wildfires, stating he had provided water to California during the emergency.</p>

          <p>Another Maine school district, RSU No. 24, voted to rescind a policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports, joining MSAD No. 70 in amending gender eligibility policies. This decision aligns with a broader trend in the state where some residents and school districts are opposing Democratic leadership's efforts to protect transgender athletes' rights. The Department of Justice is suing Maine for not complying with Trump's 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports' executive order. The debate intensified after a trans athlete won multiple events at a girls' track meet, highlighting the ongoing controversy surrounding transgender athletes' participation in sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With traditional economic data slow to reflect the impact of tariffs and policy uncertainty, economists are turning to unconventional indicators to gauge the economy's direction. The article highlights how measures like McDonald's sales, container ship traffic, and hotel bookings are being analyzed for insights. This approach mirrors tactics used during the early days of the pandemic when alternative metrics were used to assess economic damage. Economists are divided on whether tariffs will primarily cause higher prices, product shortages, or layoffs, making the analysis of these 'anecdotes' crucial for anticipating economic shifts, as the Federal Reserve remains cautious about adjusting monetary policy amid conflicting signals.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Butler Library at Columbia University, reigniting campus protests. The protesters, renaming the library 'the Basel Al-Araj Popular University,' demanded Columbia divest from companies profiting from 'imperialist violence.' The Trump administration has been pressuring Columbia over its handling of anti-Semitism, leading to funding cuts. The university called in the NYPD to clear the library after protesters refused to disperse, resulting in arrests and injuries to public safety officers, further complicating negotiations to restore federal funding.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering eliminating its Energy Star offices, a move that would end the decades-old program that helps consumers choose energy-efficient products. The Trump administration views the program as an overreach of government authority. The Energy Star program has reduced energy costs by over $500 billion and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions since its inception. Consumer and environmental groups argue that cutting the program will make it harder for consumers to access trustworthy information about energy use, impacting both household budgets and environmental protection efforts.</p>

          <p>The Syrian Identification Centre is working to identify remains from mass graves, a task complicated by limited resources and sanctions. The centre relies on forensic odontology and DNA analysis to identify victims of the Syrian civil war. A former Syrian military driver, Abu Ali, revealed that he transported lorry-loads of civilian corpses to multiple sites under the Assad regime. Malak Aoude, a Syrian refugee, continues to seek answers about her two sons who disappeared in 2012.</p>

          <p>Three college presidents apologized for not acting more aggressively to curb antisemitism on their campuses during a House committee hearing focused on colleges beyond the Ivy League. The hearing echoed a previous one that led to resignations from the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard. Republican lawmakers threatened to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools, while Democratic lawmakers accused Republicans of using antisemitism as a political weapon. The hearing highlighted the intensified Republican scrutiny of universities and their handling of campus protests.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his plan to nominate Dr. Casey Means as Surgeon General, replacing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Dr. Means, a wellness influencer and co-author of 'Good Energy,' aligns with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 'Make America Healthy Again' movement. She has expressed skepticism about the American medical system and advocates for addressing the root causes of chronic diseases. Dr. Nesheiwat will reportedly work with Mr. Kennedy in another capacity within the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering $26 million in funding cuts for the National Park Service, targeting programs related to climate change, DEI, and LGBTQ issues. The proposed cuts include the elimination of programs like 'Scientists in Parks,' which provides opportunities for students and early-career scientists. Critics argue that these cuts risk the preservation of national parks and could negatively impact rural economies. Resistance to the cuts has emerged within the National Park Service, with protests and billboards erected across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cargo volume at the Port of Los Angeles has decreased by 35% following increased tariffs, affecting businesses connected to importing and exporting goods. The decline has led to reduced work for longshore workers and decreased sales for businesses that serve the port community. Port officials anticipate that consumers may start to see shortages and price hikes as stockpiled inventory runs out. The situation has raised concerns about the long-term economic impact of the tariffs on the region and the country.</p>

          <p>Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, is expected to crash back to Earth this week after being in orbit for over 50 years. Launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus, the spacecraft never escaped low Earth orbit and separated into pieces. Experts believe that at least part of the lander probe, built to withstand Venus's atmosphere, could survive re-entry. The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsule's projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7Â° north and south latitude.</p>
