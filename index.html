          <p>The U.S. Senate again failed to pass legislation to reopen the government, marking the eighth unsuccessful attempt. This ensures the shutdown will persist, with the White House Office of Management and Budget stating preparations to endure without caving to demands and confirming continued federal workforce reductions. Notably, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has already experienced significant layoffs, impacting crucial mental health and addiction initiatives, highlighting the shutdown's severe consequences.</p>

This policy targets improper commercial driver’s licenses issued to non-citizens, citing a California case where an Indian driver was banned for insufficient English.

His appeals, including arguments against execution due to age, were denied by state and U.S. Supreme Courts. This event highlights the ongoing use of capital punishment in Florida.</p>

          <p>The Republic of Ireland secured a vital 1-0 victory over Armenia in a World Cup qualifier, a win significantly influenced by a red card incident. Armenia captain Tigran Barseghyan was dismissed for headbutting Ireland midfielder Finn Azaz, who stated Barseghyan "lost his head." This numerical advantage allowed Ireland to break the deadlock with Evan Ferguson's header. The win moves Ireland to third in Group F, keeping their World Cup play-off hopes alive in a tightly contested group.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of Kaiser Permanente healthcare workers in California and Hawaii initiated a five-day strike, demanding increased salaries and improved staffing levels. The union, representing up to 31,000 professionals, seeks a 25% wage hike to combat inflation and address burnout, proposing an internal registry to reduce reliance on contract nurses. Kaiser Permanente deems the strike "unnecessary," offering a 21.5% raise and asserting that current staffing meets or exceeds mandates, while implementing plans to maintain care during the disruption.</p>

          <p>Ashley Tellis, a prominent Indian-American national security expert and long-time U.S. adviser, was arrested for allegedly hoarding over a thousand pages of classified materials, including "Top Secret" documents, at his Virginia home. The Justice Department states Tellis repeatedly removed these materials from secure government facilities and stored them unsecured. Concerns have also been raised regarding possible ties to Chinese officials, as he was scheduled to fly to Rome on the day of the FBI search. This high-profile arrest has sent shockwaves through Washington's foreign policy circles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump threatened to pressure FIFA to remove 2026 World Cup games from Boston and consider similar action for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, citing political disagreements and safety concerns. Trump specifically criticized Boston's "radical left" mayor and recent "street takeovers" that turned violent. Despite FIFA Vice-President Victor Montagliani's assertion that such decisions rest with FIFA, Trump indicated he would contact FIFA head Gianni Infantino. This marks a continuation of Trump's previous threats against other host cities, intertwining major sporting events with domestic political grievances.</p>

High-income respondents reported an average confidence of 6.2 out of 10, with over half feeling positive, while low-income earners averaged 4.4. This data supports the "K-shape" economy concept, where higher earners continue spending while lower earners struggle with inflation. The gap extends to covering monthly bills and plans for nonessential spending, indicating divergent economic realities and growing inequality across the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks the fifth such strike by the Trump administration since September, raising the total reported deaths to 27. The U.S. has provided no evidence or identities, leading some lawyers to accuse the U.S. of breaching international law. The strikes are framed as self-defense against drug cartels, but critics suggest they are part of a broader political campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.</p>

The Pentagon Press Association and five major broadcast networks issued a joint statement, asserting the policy "appears to violate the First Amendment" and threatens core journalistic protections. This unprecedented move by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth aims to control information flow, but media outlets vow to continue independent reporting, even if it means losing Pentagon access.

Speaking to business economists, Powell emphasized that while the government shutdown limits official data, the employment and inflation outlook remains consistent with earlier forecasts for rate reductions. Lower rates aim to reduce borrowing costs, stimulating business expansion and consumer spending. Powell also defended past Fed bond purchases and signaled a potential end to shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, impacting longer-term Treasury rates. (not investment advice)</p>
