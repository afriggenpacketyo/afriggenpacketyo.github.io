          <p>South Korea's presidential election campaign has officially commenced, following the ousting of President Yoon Suk Yeol.

Lee is focusing on economic recovery and national unity, while Kim aims to restore public trust in the government. The political landscape is further complicated by Lee Jun Seok, a former People Power Party leader, running as a candidate for the New Reform Party.

Mohanty aims to address the gap in mainstream banking services for immigrant communities, who often face discrimination and rely on community-led savings systems. Bloom Money facilitates these savings circles digitally, providing a regulated and secure platform for immigrants to pool resources and build wealth. The app aims to combat the suspicion and account closures that can occur when managing these systems through traditional banks.</p>

          <p>Zone 2 cardio is a fitness trend based on maintaining a heart rate between 60% and 70% of one's maximum heart rate during aerobic exercise. This type of exercise is considered light to moderate in intensity and can be sustained for a longer period. While it's known as the fat-burning zone, it primarily helps the body become more efficient at using fats for fuel rather than specifically targeting body fat loss. Zone 2 cardio has been shown to improve lipid levels, insulin sensitivity, and cardiovascular health. Experts recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise like Zone 2 cardio to achieve significant health benefits.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Senator Josh Hawley argues against proposed Medicaid cuts in the upcoming Republican bill. Hawley emphasizes that Medicaid provides healthcare to millions of low-income Americans, including many in his home state of Missouri, where voters mandated its expansion. He contends that cutting Medicaid would harm working families and lead to hospital closures, highlighting the program's importance for vulnerable populations. Hawley also points out that President Trump has repeatedly rejected calls for Medicaid cuts, aligning with the views of many Republican voters who support social insurance programs. He urges Republicans to focus on policies that improve the lives of working people, such as capping prescription drug costs and providing tax cuts for families.</p>

Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, is advocating for the removal of nine petroleum-based, synthetic food dyes from the U.S. food supply, citing concerns about their role in rising rates of obesity and chronic illnesses. Kennedy's stance highlights the ongoing debate about the safety and regulation of food additives in the United States. The U.S. allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without prior FDA approval, a process known as GRAS (generally recognized as safe). Research on these chemicals is often narrow in focus, failing to assess long-term health effects or interactions between multiple chemicals. The FDA does not routinely re-examine chemicals already on the market, unlike European regulators.</p>

These actions are raising concerns about potential political interference with the IRS and the erosion of safeguards put in place after Watergate. While the administration defends its actions as breaking down data silos, critics argue that they increase the risk of political targeting. At the same time, the administration has cut jobs at the IRS, limiting its ability to enforce tax laws.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food scientists have discovered a method to enhance the nutritional value of refined carbohydrates like white rice and pasta by creating resistant starch. Cooking and then chilling these foods transforms some of the digestible starch into resistant starch, which acts like fiber and offers various health benefits. Resistant starch improves gut health, lowers inflammation, enhances insulin sensitivity, and helps with blood sugar management. The process involves refrigerating the cooked rice or pasta for at least six to eight hours, allowing sugar chains to form twisted shapes that resist digestion. This simple kitchen trick turns fast carbs into slower carbs, making them healthier.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are working on a major overhaul of the federal student loan program, aiming to simplify repayment options for future borrowers. The proposed changes include a binary system: a standard plan with fixed monthly payments and a repayment assistance plan tied to income. The standard plan would offer repayment windows between 10 and 25 years based on debt size, while the repayment assistance plan would base payments on adjusted gross income. The proposal would eliminate President Biden's SAVE Plan and introduce a minimum monthly payment of $10. Any interest left after a borrower makes their payment would be waived, and the government would contribute to the principal balance.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets have surged following the announcement that the U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily suspend most tariffs on each other's goods. The agreement includes reducing the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent, and China lowering its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. The announcement has strengthened the U.S. dollar and increased U.S. Treasury yields. Economists have warned that trade tensions between the two countries have increased the possibility of an economic downturn. The World Trade Organization has forecast that the continuing division of the global economy into rival blocs could significantly cut global GDP.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has defended his administration's plan to accept a luxury Boeing aircraft as a gift, reportedly from Qatar, to replace Air Force One. Critics argue that accepting such a gift could violate rules on presents for U.S. presidents and raise concerns about conflicts of interest. Trump stated that the plane would be a temporary "gift" to the Defense Department, allowing Air Force One to be replaced "free of charge." However, critics have condemned the move as potentially illegal and unethical, while Qatar has stated that reports describing the jet as a gift are inaccurate.</p>

          <p>China and the US have agreed to a 90-day pause in the trade war, with reciprocal tariffs to be lowered by 115%. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both sides showed “great respect” in the negotiations, emphasizing that neither side wants a decoupling of their economies. The lowering of tariffs applies to the duties announced by Donald Trump on April 2, which escalated to 125% on Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with equivalent measures. Both countries expressed hope for continued progress and mutually beneficial cooperation. The agreement has been met with optimism in financial markets, with China's yuan jumping to a six-month high.</p>

The talks were led by Vice Premier He Lifeng and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. While welcome by importers, the tariff drops are temporary and could be pulled if talks between the two countries sour.

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has been engaged in a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced that it is laying down its arms and disbanding. This move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for the organization to dissolve itself. Ocalan stated that democratic consensus is the fundamental way forward. The decision to disband is seen as an important step towards a "terror-free Turkey," and the process will be monitored by state institutions.

The PKK began as a secessionist group but more recently has sought greater rights for Kurds inside Turkey. The group stated that it had carried the Kurdish issue to a level where it can be solved by democratic politics and has completed its mission. The move could end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.</p>

          <p>Sugar, ubiquitous in modern diets, can lead to addiction due to its impact on the brain's reward system. Studies show that chronic sugar overconsumption can alter neuronal pathways, affecting dopamine signaling and stress-related pathways. While it's debated whether sugar is truly addictive, its overconsumption is linked to numerous health problems, including tooth decay, fatigue, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Strategies to quit sugar addiction include behavioral interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy and nutritional changes, such as reducing added sugars and increasing protein and fiber intake. Governments can also play a role through sugar taxes and reducing publicity for ultra-processed foods.</p>
