        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is facing significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, compounded by CEO Elon Musk's public falling out with President Donald Trump. The conflict, stemming from policy disagreements over Trump's spending bill, escalated into a social media brawl, leading to a 14% drop in Tesla's shares and a $34 billion plunge in Musk's net worth. This rift jeopardizes Tesla's relationship with the administration, potentially affecting regulations, investigations, government support, and tariff exemptions. The company was already struggling with declining revenue and increased competition, further exacerbated by consumer backlash against Musk's political activities. This may prove detrimental to the company's future prospects.</p>

          <p>Slate Auto, an electric vehicle startup supported by Jeff Bezos, is developing a modular, stripped-down two-door electric pickup truck with a target starting price under $20,000. The company is currently producing beta vehicles at a facility near Detroit and plans to begin deliveries by the end of next year from a full production facility in Warsaw, Indiana, with a capacity of up to 150,000 vehicles annually. Slate emphasizes simplified manufacturing, use of off-the-shelf parts, and customer personalization through wraps and bolt-on accessories to lower costs. While the company has attracted significant reservations, it faces challenges in scaling production, establishing supply chains, and navigating regulatory uncertainty.</p>

This recovery comes after the bodies of two Israeli Americans were also found in Gaza earlier in the week.

More test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders will be sent directly to smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. The Department of Health and Social Care plans to send 270 million messages through the app this year, an increase of 70 million, and will provide text messages and letters as alternatives for those without app access.

          <p>The Russia-backed Wagner Group announced its departure from Mali after over three years of fighting Islamic extremists, though Russia's presence will continue via the Africa Corps. The Africa Corps, a state-controlled paramilitary force, stated that Wagner's exit would not change the Russian contingent's presence in Mali, where they have been battling an insurgency alongside the Malian army. This transition follows the death of Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin and Moscow's efforts to integrate Wagner into the Ministry of Defense. Despite their presence, the Malian army and Russian mercenaries have struggled to curb violence and face accusations of targeting civilians.</p>

          <p>The upcoming UK Spending Review is expected to reveal significant increases in overall government spending, with totals exceeding Â£650 billion by 2029-30, roughly Â£100 billion more than when Labour took office. While this reflects a considerable rise compared to previous years, much of the funding is earmarked for long-term projects and specific departments like the NHS. Short-term spending will remain tight, and internal disputes persist over budget allocations for different government areas. The government hopes to use the review to demonstrate its commitment to security, health, and investment.</p>

          <p>An article summarizing a decade of interviews with parents of highly successful children reveals five key strategies they employed. These include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to each child's unique interests, understanding that learning can occur anywhere, cultivating a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than acting as a coach. The research indicates that a supportive and encouraging environment, combined with personalized guidance, plays a crucial role in empowering children to achieve their full potential.</p>

          <p>Thomas Friedman discusses the current state of Donald Trump's administration, characterizing it as an "amplifier administration" where Trump is surrounded by individuals who echo and intensify his views. He contrasts this with Trump's first term, where buffers and filters were more prevalent. Friedman also comments on the chaotic nature of Trump's conflicts and the instability perceived by world leaders, as well as the end of the friendship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The current administration is being run like the Trump organization today, not like the United States of America.</p>

This initiative, known as Ripple, aims to increase the volume of opinion writing, potentially partnering with local news organizations and utilizing an AI writing coach called Ember. Concerns have been raised about the potential for AI to produce generic and predictable content, undermining the editorial judgment and originality that make opinion pieces valuable. The plan is to use AI to crawl, tag, and make discoverable the publication's large body of work.</p>
