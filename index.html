          <p>A new rail line to Kashmir, decades in the making, is nearing completion, with officials hoping it will aid the troubled region. While officials express optimism about the railway's potential to improve connectivity and boost the local economy, many Kashmiris view it with suspicion, seeing it as a tool to further entrench the Indian government's control over the area. The project represents a significant engineering achievement, but its reception highlights the complex political dynamics at play in the region. The railway is expected to facilitate transportation and trade, yet its impact on the local population remains a point of contention.</p>

          <p>A legal battle has erupted over Jimmy Buffett's $275 million estate, with his widow, Jane Buffett, seeking the removal of co-trustee Richard Mozenter. Jane alleges that Mozenter has been hostile and uncooperative, failing to provide her with necessary financial information and acting against her best interests regarding the marital trust established for her benefit. Mozenter has reportedly filed a counter-petition in Florida to have Jane removed as co-trustee and representative of the estate. The dispute centers around the management of the trust and the distribution of assets, with Jane claiming Mozenter's actions have left her in the dark about her own finances.</p>

          <p>A public feud has erupted between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk after Musk criticized Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" as a "disgusting abomination" that would increase the budget deficit. Musk's criticism followed his departure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). Trump responded by suggesting Musk was upset about the removal of electric vehicle mandates, which could negatively impact Tesla. The exchange highlights a growing rift between the two figures, who were once considered allies, and underscores the political complexities surrounding economic policy and the influence of powerful figures.</p>

          <p>The job market is proving to be more challenging for new college graduates in 2025, with the unemployment rate for recent graduates reaching 5.8 percent. Companies are pulling back on hiring due to economic uncertainty fueled by new tariffs and the potential impact of artificial intelligence on entry-level positions. While some sectors like healthcare and engineering are still actively hiring, the overall job search may take longer than expected for many graduates. Despite these challenges, a recent deal between President Trump and China could help prevent a full recession and improve hiring prospects for college graduates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds across 300 acres, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin to grow crops like corn, beans, and squash. The scale of the agriculture is surprising given the relatively poor growing conditions and the proximity of wild rice, raising questions about the community's motivations. The discovery highlights the extent of indigenous agriculture prior to European colonization and the sophisticated farming practices employed by Native American societies.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists has discovered evidence of the world's earliest known matrilineal society in what is now Shandong, eastern China, dating back around 4,500 years. The community, which farmed millet and raised animals, maintained a stable lineage through the female line for at least 10 generations over 250 years. Researchers analyzed ancient DNA from 60 individuals to confirm the existence of this Neolithic society that traced descent through the maternal line. The findings support the hypothesis that early matrilineal systems could emerge and persist in communities without strong mechanisms for wealth accumulation, shedding light on early human social structures.</p>

Zelenskyy called on America, Europe, and the rest of the world to jointly halt the conflict by exerting pressure on Russia, making a veiled reference to Trump's perceived reluctance to do so.

          <p>The public feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has drawn responses from various prominent figures, including billionaires, politicians, and pundits. Bill Ackman urged Trump and Musk to reconcile, while Steve Bannon suggested Trump seize SpaceX and strip Musk of his security clearance. Mark Cuban seemingly endorsed Musk's proposal for a new political party, and Andrew Yang pitched an "Independent '28 presidential primary." The conflict has created divisions within the Republican party and presents opportunities for Democrats to capitalize on the instability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia "fight for a while" before intervening to pursue peace. He likened the conflict to a fight between children, suggesting that sometimes it's best to let them resolve it themselves before stepping in. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, however, emphasized that the U.S. and Germany agree on the severity of the war and that Putin is to blame. Merz appealed to Trump to pressure Russia to halt the bloodshed, highlighting the differing perspectives on the approach to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing annually due to lost, damaged, or missing police evidence. Data from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reveals over 30,000 prosecutions collapsed between October 2020 and September 2024, including 70 homicides and over 550 sexual offences. The increase is largely attributed to resource issues resulting from cuts to police forces in the 2010s. The BBC study found around one in 20 prosecutions by the Met had been dropped as a result of missing evidence between 2020 and 2024. The results of a consultation by the Law Commission, which proposed re-establishing a national forensic service and making the mishandling of evidence a criminal offence in some circumstances, are set to go before Parliament next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The job market is expected to show a slowdown in job growth for May, influenced by fluctuations in President Donald Trump's tariffs. Economists predict the U.S. added 125,000 jobs in May, a decrease from the 177,000 jobs added in April. Uncertainty surrounding tariffs has caused some companies to warn of potential losses, though key economic measures have largely defied fears of a downturn. A trade agreement between the U.S. and China in May reduced tit-for-tat tariffs, leading to a stock market surge and softening of forecasts for an economic downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F.

Critics argue that these actions contradict the idea of "medical freedom" by restricting access to preventive medicine and healthy food options, shifting the focus from community health to individual decisions.</p>
