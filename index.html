            <p>President Trump has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from reciprocal tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports, following concerns from US tech companies about potential price increases. The exemptions, backdated to April 5th, also cover semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. The White House stated that this move aims to provide companies with additional time to relocate manufacturing to the United States. These electronic goods are still subject to the 20% tariff on China related to fentanyl.</p>

            <p>Rex Heuermann, a New York City architect, has been charged in connection with the Gilgo Beach serial killings, where the remains of four young women were discovered. A co-worker recounted an unsettling incident where Heuermann tracked her down on a cruise, stating, "I told you I could find you anywhere." Investigators connected Heuermann to the murders through a combination of witness descriptions, cell phone records, DNA evidence, and a vehicle matching the description provided by a witness.

            <p>Iran and the United States will hold further negotiations next week regarding Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, following initial talks facilitated by Omani mediation. The discussions, described as "very positive and constructive" by the White House, aim to address the differences between the two nations through dialogue and diplomacy. The negotiations center around sanctions relief for Iran and restrictions on uranium enrichment, with the U.S. seeking dismantlement of Iran's weaponization capabilities.

            <p>The UK government has assumed control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, after the Chinese-owned facility faced imminent closure. Emergency legislation was passed to ensure the continued operation of the plant's two blast furnaces, crucial for producing virgin steel used in major construction projects. The move follows financial instability and failed negotiations with Jingye, the Chinese steel-making firm that owns British Steel. While Jingye still owns the site, the government now has extensive powers to manage the plant, with public ownership being considered a likely option.</p>

Abdominal obesity is linked to chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, with nearly 40% of women and 12% of men in India affected.

            <p>The Trump administration informed a federal judge that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, is alive and detained in the country's Terrorism Confinement Center. This update follows a court order demanding daily updates on efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who has lived in Maryland for nearly 15 years, was deported despite a 2019 court order protecting him from deportation. The Justice Department has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake.</p>

            <p>Amanda Knox claims she was stopped and questioned by police at a Seattle airport while boarding a flight to Dublin to promote her new memoir. Knox says police inquired about her imprisonment and her current work, including her podcast about coercive police interview methods. Knox, who was acquitted of murder after spending four years in an Italian prison, says one officer commented that she probably doesn't like police much. She shared the details of the interaction on X, noting that she was given no reason for being stopped.</p>

Shriner's wife was involved in a bizarre episode in Los Angeles this week that ended with her being shot by police officers after they encountered her with a handgun in the backyard of a home in Eagle Rock. Walking onstage Saturday afternoon in the Mojave tent, Scott Shriner pumped his fist and drew a huge round of cheers from the overflow crowd of several thousands.

            <p>Emergency legislation regarding British Steel was expedited through Parliament in a single day, allowing the government to take control of the Chinese-owned company. The move was prompted by concerns that the company would unilaterally shut down primary steel making at British Steel. The government aims to secure necessary raw materials to keep the Scunthorpe blast furnaces operational. However, this action is considered a temporary solution, with nationalization becoming increasingly likely.</p>

McIlroy shot a six-under 66, featuring two eagles, to reach 12 under par. Bryson DeChambeau narrowed the gap with three late birdies, setting up a compelling final round. McIlroy has never won the Masters, with his most infamous instance coming in 2011 when he blew a four-shot lead.</p>

            <p>A study estimates that over three million children died in 2022 due to infections resistant to antibiotics, with children in Africa and South East Asia being most at risk. The report highlights a more than tenfold increase in AMR-related infections in children in just three years. The increased use of "watch antibiotics," drugs with a high risk of resistance, has grown significantly. The authors warn that if bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few alternatives for treating multidrug-resistant infections.</p>

            <p>Trump's current trade policies, including 145% tariffs on China and 10% on other countries, could potentially end trade between the world's two largest economies. This situation could lead to Western and Chinese companies accelerating their efforts to establish manufacturing hubs outside of China. Late Friday, the White House exempted electronic goods like smartphones, laptops and computer processors from U.S. tariffs, including some imposed on China. Economists largely agree a full decoupling between the U.S. and China would be extremely painful for both countries.</p>

            <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world’s No 1 golfer, is struggling at the Masters, scoring an even-par 72. Scheffler started the day as one of a group of four players tied on five under, three shots behind Justin Rose’s lead, but found himself having to work hard just to hang on to what he had. This year he’s in the unfamiliar position of trying to scrap his way up past McIlroy, and everyone else in his way, into first place. His steady-as-she-goes golf is all well and good when his nearest competitors are making mistakes, but less effective when they are running up the sort of low scores that they managed on Saturday.</p>
