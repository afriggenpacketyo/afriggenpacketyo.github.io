          <p>Lawyers claim that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported three American children, ages 2, 4, and 7, along with their Honduran-born mothers from Louisiana. The ACLU has described the deportations as illegal and inhumane, highlighting that one child has metastatic cancer and was deported without medication. A federal judge has expressed concern over the 2-year-old's deportation, noting the illegality of deporting a U.S. citizen and setting a hearing to investigate the matter, as the Trump administration faces criticism for its deportation policies.
