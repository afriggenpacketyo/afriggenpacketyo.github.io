            <p>In a surprise move, Turkey's central bank increased its key interest rate by 350 basis points, raising it from 42.5% to 46%. This decision marks the end of the easing cycle that began in December of the previous year. The bank cited economic disruption due to U.S. tariffs and political instability following the arrest of Istanbul's mayor as factors influencing the decision. The committee stated that the tight monetary stance will be maintained until price stability is achieved through a sustained decline in inflation, which currently stands at 38.1% annually.

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced new NIH studies to investigate environmental factors contributing to rising autism rates, challenging the notion that increased diagnoses are solely due to improved detection. Kennedy emphasized the need to identify environmental exposures, citing concerns about the impact of autism on families and children's futures. While acknowledging increased awareness may play a role, he argued it doesn't fully explain the surge in diagnoses. Experts agree on increasing rates but also highlight the expanding definition of autism, while Kennedy has pledged to follow the science regardless of the findings.</p>

Experts see thorium as a safer and more abundant alternative to uranium, potentially meeting China's energy needs for thousands of years while producing minimal radioactive waste. China's chief scientist on the project, Xu Hongjie, says that the country now leads the global frontier in this field.</p>

            <p>Kelley Heyer, the TikToker behind the viral Apple dance, has taken legal action against Roblox, claiming the company made $123,000 from selling the moves as an "emote" without her permission. Heyer had previously expressed frustration about brands capitalizing on the trend without crediting her. Roblox states that it takes intellectual property "very seriously" and is confident it hasn't done anything wrong. An estimated 80 million people play Roblox every day and it has more monthly users than the Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined.</p>

            <p>President Trump says his administration is exploring ways to detain U.S. citizens involved in criminal activity and send them to prisons in El Salvador. Some legal experts have informed NPR that they fear the White House is preparing to move ahead with that plan even though jailing Americans overseas is considered unconstitutional. Retail sales jumped sharply last month as people raced to buy stuff ahead of Trump's steep new tariffs kicking in. If people splurged last month to get ahead of the tariffs, we'll likely see a payback with reduced spending in the coming months.</p>

            <p>A colossal squid, the world's largest squid species, was filmed and photographed in its natural habitat for the first time since its discovery a century ago. The sighting occurred about 2,000 feet below the surface of waters around the South Sandwich Islands. The squid caught on video was a juvenile and much smaller than a full-grown adult, with the research team placing its size at around 11 inches long. The expedition occurred during a 35-day voyage where researchers sought to find new marine life.</p>

            <p>Elizabeth Hill-Brodigan, a Florida school principal, has been charged after around 100 children were found at a house party at her home where youths were drinking. Another teacher at the school, Karly Anderson, has also been charged with one count of disorderly conduct and one count of disorderly intoxication. Both were also suspended from their jobs after the incident. A lawyer representing Anderson told NBC's affiliate WESH of Orlando she had nothing to do with the party and had returned to Hill-Brodigan's home after dinner to find students leaving.</p>

The memo indicates that officials can send migrants with final deportation orders to Guantanamo if they have "a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity." The memo says the departments agreed to use the Guantanamo base to detain migrants with final deportation orders who have "a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity."</p>

            <p>Much of Puerto Rico is still without power after an island-wide pre-Easter blackout, impacting 1.4 million customers and affecting the main international airport, hospitals, and hotels. As of 6 a.m., some 609,000 customers had service, or 41% of homes and businesses, according to local utility Luma Energy. Gov. Jenniffer González cut her vacation short and returned to Puerto Rico Wednesday evening and called the blackout a shame for the people of Puerto Rico. The outage has sparked outrage and renewed calls for the government to cancel contracts with Luma Energy and Genera PR.</p>
