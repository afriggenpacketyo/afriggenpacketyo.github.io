          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and Sendai on the Tohoku shinkansen line were halted due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations. JR East, the operator, anticipates resuming operations around 7 p.m. after the inspection is complete. The affected train, which debuted last spring on the Yamagata shinkansen line, was en route from Ueno station to Morioka station when it experienced the issue. The incident also caused two other trains to halt between stations, disrupting travel for passengers. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases at a slower pace beyond April of the following year, while maintaining its current interest rate of 0.5%. This decision reflects the BOJ's cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amidst prevailing economic uncertainties, including potential impacts from U.S. trade policies. The central bank will decrease its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, a reduction from the current 400 billion yen, with total purchases expected to decline to approximately 2 trillion yen by early 2027. The BOJ's decision comes after yields on long-term government bonds increased due to concerns about Japan's fiscal stability, and the bank has emphasized the uncertainty surrounding international trade policies.

          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, some shipping groups are avoiding the Strait of Hormuz, a critical gateway for global oil and container trade. The conflict has prompted shipowners to exercise greater caution in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz, leading to a slight decrease in vessel traffic. Despite the increased risk, some shipowners are incentivized to navigate the area due to rising freight rates and crew wages during periods of heightened security threats. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital route for oil and container trade, connecting the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, and disruptions can significantly impact global energy prices and supply chains.</p>

His pitching debut was expedited due to the team's extensive list of injured pitchers, and he expressed gratitude for being back on the mound healthy.

          <p>President Donald Trump departed the G7 summit early, citing matters "much bigger" than a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, after urging Iranians to evacuate Tehran. G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel and condemning Iran as a source of regional instability, while calling for a resolution to escalating tensions. Trump's departure followed French President Emmanuel Macron's suggestion of a ceasefire offer, which Trump denied, and he emphasized that the situation was more significant. The G7 nations urged de-escalation and a ceasefire in Gaza, contrasting with China's condemnation of Israel's actions and its offer to mediate.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US, implementing parts of a tariff deal agreed upon last month. The agreement allows up to 100,000 UK cars to enter the US with a 10% tariff, replacing the previously imposed 25% import tax, and it also removes tariffs on specific aerospace products. While the order establishes a similar system for steel and aluminum, details remain unspecified, and the UK government aims to eliminate tariffs on core steel products. The UK government views this agreement as a sign of strength between the two nations, and it will take effect seven days after its official publication.</p>

Trump dismissed claims of focusing on ceasefire talks, asserting the issues at hand were "much bigger," and he urged Iranians to evacuate Tehran. The U.S. is not joining Israel's military offensive, but officials are on standby, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also returned to Washington.</p>

The U.S. has granted Japan a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but Ishiba did not confirm if an extension was discussed, though the U.S. hinted at extending the pause for partners negotiating in good faith.

Legal experts highlighted the importance of jurors adhering to court rules, including avoiding discussions about the case and exposure to media, to maintain the integrity of the trial.

          <p>Dr. Salvador Plasencia has agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine in connection with the overdose death of Matthew Perry. The plea agreement, filed in federal court, stipulates that prosecutors will drop additional counts of distribution and falsifying records in exchange for Plasencia's guilty plea. Plasencia allegedly referred to Perry as a "moron" in text messages and is accused of illegally supplying the actor with ketamine in the month leading up to his death. Perry's death was ruled to be primarily caused by ketamine, and Plasencia's actions contributed to the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Gold has surpassed traditional safe havens like Treasurys, yen, and Swiss franc, surging 30% in 2025, driven by fiscal sustainability concerns and geopolitical tensions. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference highlighted gold's appeal due to its independence from government liabilities, contrasting it with currencies and sovereign bonds. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys faced sell-offs after President Trump's tariffs and Moody's downgrade, heightening investor concerns about fiscal discipline. Demand for gold has been fueled by instability and uncertainty, especially in the Middle East, making it an attractive alternative safe haven.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that directives from the Trump administration, which led to the cancellation of research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), were "void" and "illegal". The judge stated that the cancellations, related to studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), violated federal law and constituted discrimination. The lawsuits, filed by the American Public Health Association and a group of 16 states, challenged the administration's decision to terminate the grants, estimated to be worth up to $1.8 billion.

The watchdog warns that without substantial action, England will experience a daily water shortage of over six billion liters by 2055. The EA advocates for increased use of hosepipe bans, smart water meters, and potential price increases during tight supplies to reduce customer demand by 2.5 billion liters per day by 2055. The agency emphasizes that future economic growth may be compromised as water becomes scarcer, and over-abstraction risks damaging fragile ecosystems.</p>
