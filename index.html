          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:07:43 EDT</div>

          <p>A Wisconsin mother, Nicole Vander Heyden, was murdered in 2016, initially leading investigators to suspect her boyfriend, Doug Detrie. However, data from Detrie's Fitbit device corroborated his alibi, providing crucial evidence that exonerated him from the crime. The investigation then pivoted, utilizing DNA evidence and Google Dashboard location data from another man's phone to identify and track the real killer, George Burch. This case highlights how modern consumer technology, often overlooked by users, can play a decisive role in both convicting the guilty and clearing the innocent in complex criminal investigations.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have announced a substantial reduction in the number of people considered missing following devastating floods earlier in July. Through extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies, the count of unaccounted-for individuals has dropped from a peak of over 160 to just three. The powerful floods resulted in over 130 fatalities across Texas, with 107 of those deaths occurring in Kerr County alone. Authorities expressed gratitude for the tireless efforts of over a thousand responders who helped verify the safety of many who were initially reported missing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Players from both teams at the WNBA All-Star Game wore warmup shirts with the message “Pay us what you owe us” to draw attention to stalled labor negotiations. The WNBA Players Association opted out of their last collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in October, seeking improved revenue sharing, higher salaries, and better benefits. After a recent in-person meeting failed to produce a new deal, players have voiced concerns about a significant gap between their demands and the league's offers. Prominent players have indicated that a walkout is possible if a new CBA is not finalized by October.</p>

          <p>England's national rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a one-off Test match in Washington D.C. that was significantly disrupted by weather. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to lightning strikes in the area, forcing players off the field and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, concluding their tour of Argentina and the United States with a perfect three-win record. The match also served as an opportunity for several players to make their England debuts as the team made numerous changes from their previous game.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home, authorities have charged two individuals with his murder. Moreno was playing video games in his bedroom in November 2021 when he was struck. The Los Angeles County District Attorney has charged Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, as the alleged shooter and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, as the accused getaway driver. A recent breakthrough in the case came from newly enhanced surveillance video, which helped police identify the suspects and led to their arrests in Florida and California.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans for a new criminal offense designed to target individuals who are preparing for mass casualty attacks but lack a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap highlighted by incidents like the Southport attack, where existing terrorism laws could not be applied to pre-crime plotting. This new power would allow police to intervene and apprehend suspects for preparatory actions, such as researching a target, mirroring the powers currently used against terror suspects. The goal is to treat the planning of such violent acts as seriously as terrorism, regardless of the motivation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar shortstop Mookie Betts an unplanned day off, citing the need for a mental reset amidst a persistent slump. Betts' performance has been uncharacteristically poor this season, with his batting average and other key metrics falling to career lows. Roberts made the decision after observing Betts' continued struggles following the All-Star break, hoping that watching a game without the pressure to perform could be beneficial.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch, seeking at least $20 billion in damages.

The lawsuit claims the paper's reporting was false and defamatory, representing clear journalistic failures.

Because they are not regulated like cigarettes or vapes, there is currently no minimum age for purchase, making them easily accessible to children.

Research shows that many major airports, such as Edinburgh, have raised their charges, with some now costing £6 for a brief 10-minute stay. This has led to drivers waiting in nearby lay-bys and side roads, coordinating pick-ups via phone to bypass the official zones. The practice highlights public frustration with the fees, which travelers and taxi drivers describe as extortionate, while airports maintain that free alternatives are available further from the terminals.</p>

          <p>The traditional six-week summer school holiday in the UK is facing scrutiny, with a growing debate over whether a shorter break would be more beneficial for students and families. Proponents argue that a shorter summer holiday could reduce learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for working parents, and potentially lower holiday travel prices. However, many teachers oppose the idea, viewing the long break as essential for rest and preparation. Some schools have already adopted a five-week summer break with a longer two-week half-term in October, but a nationwide change remains a divisive issue.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating the death of a 61-year-old man who died after being pulled into a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. The man was reportedly wearing a large metallic chain when he entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, drawing the man into the device and causing a fatal "medical episode." The FDA warns that the strong static magnetic fields of MRI machines pose significant physical hazards, making it critical to screen all people and objects for metallic items before they enter the environment.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who played for the Clippers from 2011 to 2017 during the "Lob City" era, would add significant playmaking depth to the roster alongside James Harden and Bradley Beal. Frank emphasized the team's desire to add more ball-handling and acknowledged Paul's history as a "great Clipper." If signed, the 40-year-old Paul would likely accept a reserve role as the team continues to build a roster capable of competing in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of rapid growth fueled by China's economic rise, the popularity of learning Mandarin is now waning in many Western nations, including the U.S., UK, and New Zealand. University enrollments for Chinese language studies in the U.S. and Britain have seen significant drops from their peaks a decade ago. This "huge shift" is attributed to a combination of factors, including geopolitical tensions, concerns over human rights, and the perceived difficulty of the language. The decline suggests a changing global perspective on China and a potential move away from the belief that Mandarin is the essential language of the future.</p>

The move is a response to actions by the Mexican government that forced airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport, which the U.S. claims violates a bilateral trade agreement. All Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. Delta and Aeromexico argue that ending their alliance would harm consumers and jeopardize numerous routes, causing significant economic damage to both countries. (not investment advice)</p>

This event highlights the Trump administration's strategy of deporting migrants to third countries, which has included sending individuals to nations like Eswatini and South Sudan.
