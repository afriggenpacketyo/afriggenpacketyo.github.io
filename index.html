          <p>The execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate, has been blocked by the Utah Supreme Court due to concerns about his severe dementia. His attorneys argue he is no longer competent to understand his punishment for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker, a standard required by U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The court ordered a new competency evaluation, acknowledging the prolonged suffering of the victim's family but emphasizing adherence to the rule of law.</p>

Rescue efforts in the hard-hit Kunar and Nangarhar provinces are severely hampered by the remote, rugged terrain, making it difficult to reach survivors trapped under rubble. Aid organizations and the United Nations are calling for urgent international assistance, stressing that the humanitarian situation is desperate with shortages of food and medical supplies.</p>

          <p>The interest rate on 30-year UK government bonds has surged to a 27-year high, increasing the cost of government borrowing and adding fiscal pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the upcoming Budget. This market reaction reflects growing investor concern over the state of the UK's public finances and the potential for tax increases to meet fiscal rules. The rising yields, influenced by both domestic and global factors, signal a lack of confidence and present difficult choices for the government regarding economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia's Gazprom and China have signed a binding agreement to construct the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, a major energy deal that deepens their economic ties amidst Western sanctions against Moscow. The pipeline will transport 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually from West Siberia to northern China via Mongolia, providing Russia with a crucial new market as its gas exports to Europe have collapsed. This long-term, 30-year agreement signals a strategic pivot by Russia towards Asia and reinforces the growing partnership between Moscow and Beijing.</p>

          <p>A satirical piece in The Atlantic humorously frames the current state of American democracy and civil services as a tech product whose 250-year "free trial" is expiring. The article imagines a notification to users that features like representative government and rule of law are becoming premium, paid services, while unwelcome new features like autocracy and ICE detention are being rolled out. This commentary uses the concept of "enshittification," where a useful service is gradually degraded for profit, to critique the erosion of democratic norms and institutions.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski has been elected as the new leader of the UK's Green Party, vowing to make the party a bolder, more radical alternative to Keir Starmer's Labour. Polanski, who ran on an "eco-populism" platform, aims to attract voters who feel "politically homeless" and has set a goal of winning at least 30 seats in the next general election. While open to collaborating with Jeremy Corbyn's new party on specific issues, Polanski ruled out a coalition with Labour, accusing Starmer of selling out left-wing principles.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields surged after a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal, raising the possibility that the government may have to refund billions of dollars. This prospect has created concern in the bond market, as a massive refund could worsen the U.S. budget deficit and necessitate a surge in Treasury issuance to cover the cost. The 30-year Treasury yield climbed above 4.98% amid the news, reflecting investor anxiety over the nation's fiscal stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Arkansas has found that State Farm unfairly underpaid customers for cars deemed a "total loss" by systematically factoring in a "haggling discount" during valuation. The class-action lawsuit, representing 37,000 plaintiffs, argued that the software used by the insurer assumed customers could negotiate a lower price from used car dealers, a practice no longer common. The lead plaintiff was found to have been underpaid by approximately $600 on a $4,700 vehicle, and similar lawsuits are now being pursued in other states.</p>

          <p>Following several recent deadly events, this article explains the science behind landslides, the world's most common geological hazard. Triggered by factors like excessive rainfall, earthquakes, or human activity, landslides occur when slope materials fail, leading to devastating falls, slides, or flows of rock and debris. While natural forces are a primary cause, human activity such as construction and mining often exacerbates the risk, and prevention methods focus on improving drainage and reinforcing slopes.</p>

          <p>Scientific research indicates that leaving plastic water bottles in hot environments, such as a car, can cause them to release billions of microplastic particles and other harmful chemicals into the water. Heat and UV exposure accelerate the breakdown of the plastic, whereas bottles stored in cool, dark places show minimal shedding of particles. To minimize health risks associated with ingesting microplastics, experts advise against this practice and recommend using reusable glass or stainless steel bottles instead.</p>

However, human rights advocates and former DHS officials are warning that this rapid expansion, reminiscent of a problematic hiring surge in the 2000s, could lead to increased misconduct, abuse, and a decline in accountability.</p>

Consequently, the availability rate for office space has fallen to its lowest point since January 2021, and average asking rents are beginning to rise. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece argues that these actions, which the scientific community has widely condemned, make it harder to combat the virus and represent a dangerous disregard for public health.</p>
