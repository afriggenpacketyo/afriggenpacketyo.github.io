          <p>A devastating flash flood in Texas Hill Country has resulted in at least 108 fatalities, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. The tragedy heavily impacted Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, where 27 campers and counselors are confirmed dead. The federal government has declared a major disaster, and search operations are ongoing along the Guadalupe River, which rose to unprecedented levels due to intense rainfall from a tropical storm remnant. The article details the widespread destruction and the massive, multi-agency rescue and recovery effort.</p>

          <p>The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that the annual cost of the state pension triple lock policy will be three times higher than original estimates, reaching £15.5 billion by 2030. The policy, which increases the state pension by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%, has contributed to rising government debt. The OBR's report describes the UK's public finances as being in a "vulnerable position" due to these age-related spending pressures and recent reversals of planned spending cuts.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at many major U.S. airports. A memo issued last week indicates the new procedure, which allows travelers in general security lines to keep their shoes on, will begin Sunday. The policy, in place since 2006 following a failed shoe-bombing attempt, is being changed to expedite screening processes. Passengers who trigger alarms will still need to remove their footwear for additional checks.</p>

          <p>The six-decade-old Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing agreement between India and Pakistan, is in jeopardy after India announced its suspension. The move followed a militant attack in Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan, leading to accusations of India "weaponizing water." This development threatens Pakistan's water security, as the Indus River system is vital for its agriculture and population. While experts believe a full-scale conflict is unlikely, the treaty's suspension creates significant regional instability and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Police in the eastern Indian state of Bihar have arrested three people in connection with the brutal murder of five members of a single family. A mob of villagers allegedly hacked the victims to death and burned their bodies after accusing them of witchcraft. The attack was reportedly triggered after a local boy's death was blamed on the family's supposed supernatural activities. This tragic incident highlights the persistent and deadly nature of superstition in some rural parts of India, where such violent attacks are not uncommon.</p>

          <p>A federal magistrate judge has recommended that the criminal case against Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan should proceed. Dugan was indicted on charges of obstruction and concealing a person from arrest after allegedly helping a man in the U.S. illegally evade immigration authorities at her courthouse. Her lawyers had sought to have the case dismissed based on judicial immunity, but the magistrate found that this protection does not extend to criminal prosecutions. The final decision on whether to dismiss the indictment rests with the district judge.</p>

          <p>German commercial vehicle maker Daimler Truck has announced a significant cost-cutting program that includes eliminating approximately 5,000 jobs in Germany by the end of the decade. The move follows a reported 5% drop in second-quarter sales and is intended to improve the profitability of its Mercedes-Benz Trucks division in Europe. The company plans to achieve the workforce reduction primarily through natural attrition and early retirement programs, stating it will avoid compulsory redundancies. The cuts are part of a broader plan to save over €1 billion in annual costs.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhunzada, and the head of its supreme court, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges relate to the persecution of women, girls, and other non-conforming individuals in Afghanistan since the group seized power nearly four years ago. The warrants accuse the leaders of crimes against humanity based on their policies restricting gender and political freedom. This action represents a significant step by the international legal body to hold the Taliban's leadership accountable for their actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish police have stated that evidence suggests Portuguese footballer Diogo Jota was likely speeding before the fatal car crash that killed him and his brother. The investigation into the accident, where their Lamborghini left the motorway and caught fire, indicates that Jota was driving at the time. While an expert report is still being prepared for the courts, initial analysis of tire marks points to "excessive speed" as a probable cause. The accident occurred as the brothers were traveling to Santander for Jota to return to pre-season training with Liverpool.</p>

          <p>A new interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, has been detected entering our solar system, marking the third such known object to visit from beyond. Discovered by a telescope in Chile, the comet is currently about 670 million kilometers from the sun and poses no threat to Earth. Scientists are working to determine its precise velocity and trajectory, but it is estimated to be about 20 kilometers wide. The object provides a rare opportunity for astronomers to study pristine material from another planetary system within our galaxy.</p>

          <p>A joint memo from the Department of Justice and the FBI has dismissed the existence of a so-called "client list" in the Jeffrey Epstein case, sparking outrage among rightwing influencers. The memo, obtained by Axios, states that a review of the evidence revealed no such list and no credible proof that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals. This finding contradicts long-running conspiracy theories and previous statements by political figures. Supporters of the theories have reacted with anger, suggesting a cover-up by the "deep state" to protect powerful people.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is facing criticism for issuing an unexplained order that allows the Trump administration to deport asylum-seekers to third countries without due process. The order lifted a lower court's injunction that had required the government to provide notice and a hearing for individuals who feared torture in their destination country. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor condemned the majority for rewarding the administration's "noncompliance" with court orders and for failing to provide any legal reasoning for its life-or-death decision, which she argued erodes respect for the law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the ongoing debate about a perceived literacy crisis among American students, from elementary school to college. It examines conflicting perspectives: one view, supported by declining national test scores, suggests a real drop in reading proficiency, while another argues that every generation worries about the intellectual decline of the next. The piece delves into potential causes for the decline, such as the "science of reading" debate and increased screen time, while also considering that standardized tests may not capture the full scope of modern literacy in a digital age.</p>
