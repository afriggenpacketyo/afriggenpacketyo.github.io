          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as vital "sinks" that store climate-warming greenhouse gases. The report calls for these muddy, tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Working with researchers, WWF installed greenhouse gas monitoring stations on a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that the plants absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in the winter. The UK has lost about 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, but there is growing recognition of their role in protecting homes from coastal flooding. </p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating an effort to impersonate White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, with an unknown person accessing her personal cellphone and using her contacts to reach out to other officials. Some recipients recognized the messages as suspicious because they came from an unknown number. The impersonator asked if the conversations could be continued on another platform, such as Telegram. Wiles explained to people that her phone had been hacked. </p>

          <p>Japan has stated it will not purchase defense equipment from the United States in exchange for easing tariff measures. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters. He stated that equipment purchases would be based on what is necessary for Japan's peace and defense. This statement came after Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit. (not investment advice)</p>
