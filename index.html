          <p>China's grand military parade, commemorating the end of World War Two, prominently displayed its growing might, catching the attention of President Trump who called it "very, very impressive." This demonstration, alongside a recent economic summit involving China, Russia, and India, signifies a notable shift in global power dynamics and presents a direct challenge to the established American-backed international order. Trump's "America First" trade policies, particularly his use of tariffs, are increasingly seen as inadvertently fostering new geopolitical alignments and facing significant legal hurdles domestically. An appellate court recently ruled many of his tariffs illegal, a decision Trump has vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A tragic boat accident in Nigeria's north-central Niger State resulted in at least 29 recovered bodies and 50 people rescued, with two individuals still unaccounted for, after a vessel carrying over 100 passengers capsized. The incident occurred when the boat, en route from Tungan Sule to Dugga, struck a submerged tree stump near the Gausawa community. Emergency services attributed the catastrophe primarily to overloading and the collision. This event underscores the persistent dangers on Nigeria's busy river networks, where poor vessel maintenance and non-compliance with safety regulations frequently lead to such devastating outcomes. Local government officials fear the death toll could tragically rise to 60.</p>

This substantial prize, the game's fourth-largest ever, holds an estimated cash value of $634.3 million before taxes, though it was not immediately confirmed if any winning tickets were sold. The jackpot's rapid growth is attributed to increased ticket sales as drawings approach, making it the sixth-largest lottery prize in history. Despite the slim odds of 1 in 292.2 million, the prospect of such a life-changing win generates immense public excitement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally petitioned the Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court decision that declared many of his tariffs illegal, arguing the ruling threatens to "unilaterally disarm the United States" in trade policy. The Justice Department is pushing for an expedited consideration of the case, which fundamentally questions the president's authority to impose such sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Opponents, including small businesses impacted by the duties, are confident the high court will uphold the lower court's decision, emphasizing the economic harm caused. This legal battle represents a critical test for presidential power and trade policy.</p>

          <p>Survivors and family members of the victims of the tragic 2023 Lewiston, Maine mass shooting are suing the US government, asserting that the Army failed to intervene despite possessing prior knowledge of the shooter's public-safety risk. The lawsuit alleges that the Army repeatedly violated its own policies concerning service members grappling with severe mental health issues, failing to disarm the reservist responsible for killing eighteen people. Multiple red flags, including targeted threats and warnings from peers and family, were reportedly ignored. This legal action seeks justice and accountability, aiming to prevent similar future tragedies and build upon previous settlements in other mass shooting cases.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled against the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, calling it an "ideologically-motivated assault." The judge found the freeze illegal, stating it violated Harvard's First Amendment and procedural rights, as well as academic freedom. While acknowledging Harvard's shortcomings in addressing antisemitism, the court concluded the administration used this issue as a pretext for broader ideological control over universities. The White House plans to appeal the decision, maintaining Harvard failed to protect students from harassment.</p>

          <p>A recently terminated California Legislature staff member has filed a lawsuit against Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and his brother, Rick, alleging retaliation after she reported sexual assault and ethics violations. Cynthia Moreno claims the speaker significantly reduced her job responsibilities following a sexual assault complaint against a colleague in May 2024. Furthermore, she alleges that Rick Rivas leveraged his influence to deny her a tenure-based pay raise and ultimately terminate her employment after she reported alleged "funneling money" to influence the speaker. The speaker's office vehemently denies these claims, asserting his brother had no involvement in Moreno's employment matters.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans continue to hold a negative perception of the U.S. economy, predominantly characterizing its current state as "uncertain" and "struggling." Only about a third of respondents describe the economy as "rebounding" or "expanding," with overall sentiment slightly declining over the past month. The primary driver of this negativity remains persistently rising prices, which two-thirds of those polled anticipate will continue to increase. Personal financial ratings are closely tied to these price perceptions, and a significant portion of the population still expects the economy to worsen or face a recession.</p>

          <p>Chinese smart electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, including prominent players like Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr, face immense pressure to significantly boost their deliveries in the coming quarters to achieve their crucial 2025 break-even targets. This challenge is exacerbated by a brutal and ongoing discount war within the world's largest vehicle market, which shows few signs of abating. While these companies reported narrowed losses in the second quarter, persistent industry overcapacity and fierce competition make it difficult to secure fresh funding. Nio's CEO, William Li, has set an ambitious goal to double monthly deliveries to 50,000 EVs by Q4, a critical benchmark for the company's long-term survival. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue this move deviates from the historical vision of the armed forces defending against external threats, not enforcing domestic law or conducting lethal strikes without public legal justification.
