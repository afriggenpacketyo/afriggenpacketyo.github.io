          <p>TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features for users of all ages, with a focus on young users, as it faces lawsuits and criticism regarding the app's effects on mental health. The meditation feature, which aims to improve sleep quality, will be triggered during "sleep hours" and automatically turned on for users under 18. This initiative comes amid public pressure and lawsuits alleging that TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to kids, leading to issues like depression, anxiety, sleep loss, and body dysmorphia. The company is also introducing educational feeds, online safety tools, and enhanced parental controls over screen time.</p>

          <p>The Polish government's approval ratings are declining due to President Andrzej Duda's obstruction of its reform plans, making the upcoming presidential election on May 18 crucial for the pro-European, center-left coalition led by Donald Tusk. Duda has been using his veto power and referring bills to the constitutional court, hindering the government's attempts to restore the rule of law, liberalize abortion legislation, and introduce LGBTQ+ rights. Tusk is backing Rafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, while Duda supports Karol Nawrocki, head of Poland's Institute of National Remembrance. The election's outcome will significantly impact the government's ability to fulfill its campaign promises.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.7 percent annualized real contraction in the January-March period, marking the first decline in a year due to sluggish domestic demand amid inflation and increased import costs. The GDP figure was weaker than economists' projections, and the contraction occurred before U.S. President Donald Trump began imposing heavy tariffs on Japanese products in April, raising concerns about a potential economic downturn. Private consumption rose slightly, but exports fell, while imports expanded due to aircraft and online advertising. Economists anticipate further slowdowns in the coming quarters, depending on negotiations with the United States to reduce the tariffs.</p>

          <p>MPs in England and Wales are debating a bill to legalize assisted dying, with significant changes made since its initial passage in November. The bill, which would allow some terminally ill adults to choose to end their lives, has undergone intense scrutiny and numerous amendments, including the removal of the need for a High Court judge to approve each request. The government has quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year. The debate has divided Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides, and a final vote is not expected until at least June 13.</p>

President Trump imposed tariffs on goods from numerous countries, claiming they took advantage of the United States, but later suspended them for 90 days to allow for negotiations. South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia, among others, are affected by the tariffs.

          <p>President Trump, during his second term's first major foreign trip, signaled a willingness to set aside past conflicts for peace and profit, even with former adversaries like Iran and Syria.

This contrasts sharply with Trump's domestic policy, where he continues to pursue investigations into political opponents and critics.

          <p>Following the deadly collapse of a Bangkok high-rise in the March 28 earthquake that hit Myanmar, Premchai Karnasuta, president of Italian-Thai Development Co, surrendered to police along with builders, designers, and engineers on criminal negligence charges. Ninety-two people died in the collapse of the building, which was to become a new State Audit Office. Evidence suggests the building plan did not meet standards and codes, with police determining the project showed structural flaws and substandard materials. This is not Premchai's first encounter with the law, as he was previously convicted of wildlife poaching in 2019.</p>

Syed Asim Munir, has seized the opportunity to rehabilitate its image and deflect attention from accusations of political repression. However, the support regained by the military could diminish if it is seen as overreaching in politics or failing to address internal security challenges.</p>

The efforts aim to abolish DEI offices and staff, end mandatory diversity training, ban compulsory diversity statements, and outlaw racial or sexual preferences in hiring and admissions.

          <p>Beijing is intensifying its efforts to create a stronger domestic market to reduce its vulnerability to external tariff shocks, even with a tentative ceasefire in the trade war with the United States. Premier Li Qiang stated that China would continue to bolster "domestic circulation" by creating a robust, unified domestic market. The confrontation with Washington has added urgency to China’s efforts to boost domestic demand and reduce the economy’s dependence on overseas trade. This strategy aims to harness the economy’s internal stability and long-term growth potential to offset rising global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 experienced historic volatility in April, including its fifth-largest two-day percentage decline since 1950. However, history suggests that such declines are often followed by significant gains, with the index averaging a 32.6% increase one year later, compared to its average annual return of 9.2%. This pattern underscores the disproportionate nature of stock market cycles, with bull markets typically lasting much longer than bear markets. Despite short-term fears, a long-term, optimistic approach to investing has historically proven to be a pathway to wealth creation.</p>
