          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 05:27:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed nearly tripling the fee for the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which is required for visa-exempt travelers visiting 30 European countries. The fee is set to increase from 7 euros to 20 euros, with the system expected to be implemented in late 2026. The commission cited inflation and operational costs for the price hike, aligning it with similar travel authorization fees in the U.S. and U.K. The proposal, which exempts travelers under 18 and over 70, is now under review by the European Council and Parliament.

          <p>The son of an elderly British couple detained by the Taliban for five months fears they may die in prison due to rapidly deteriorating health. Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who ran education projects in Afghanistan, are being held in harsh conditions without charge, despite a judge reportedly deeming them innocent. The son described his 80-year-old father suffering from serious convulsions and his 76-year-old mother from anaemia and malnutrition, highlighting the family's harrowing wait for their release. While British officials have visited the couple, securing their freedom remains frustratingly elusive for the family.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is facing significant domestic backlash after signing a law that brings key anti-corruption bodies under the control of the Prosecutor General's Office. Critics, including anti-corruption activists and the mayor of Kyiv, argue the move undermines democratic reforms and could jeopardize Ukraine's path to EU membership. Protests have erupted in major cities, with demonstrators accusing the government of an authoritarian power grab. Zelenskyy defended the measure as necessary to eliminate Russian influence within the agencies and ensure justice for long-stalled corruption cases.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has publicly addressed the detention of an elderly British couple, stating that efforts for their release are ongoing but not yet complete. Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi denied that the couple's rights were being violated, claiming they have consular access and are in contact with their family. This statement comes in response to growing concerns from the couple's family and the UN about their rapidly declining health in detention. The Taliban did not specify what charges the couple faces or provide a timeline for their potential release from the Kabul prison.</p>

This decision follows the overturning of all related US convictions in 2022, leaving the UK as the only country where the practice had been criminalized.

          <p>The prescription sleep medication Ambien is under renewed public scrutiny after Hunter Biden suggested it could have contributed to his father's cognitive difficulties during a presidential debate. Medical experts note that the drug, zolpidem, can cause side effects like confusion, memory problems, and grogginess, particularly in older adults. While some doctors stated that such effects are plausible, they also expressed caution, noting the lack of verification and that the drug's effects should have worn off if taken the night before.

          <p>A former late-night writer argues that CBS's cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is a significant blow to American comedy and political sanity. The author suggests the timing, just after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's payments to Donald Trump, makes the "purely financial" reasoning from the network appear politically motivated. The piece mourns the loss of late-night shows as a shared cultural space for processing bizarre political events and holding leaders accountable through humor. It contends that in an era of misinformation, such comedic truth-telling is a vital part of public discourse.</p>

          <p>As heat waves strain power grids, the strategy of "precooling"—significantly lowering a home's temperature during off-peak hours—is gaining attention, though its effectiveness is debated. Some researchers and utilities support the idea, suggesting it can save money if the home is well-insulated, while others warn it could lead to excessive energy use. Experts agree that maintaining a steady temperature is more efficient than frequently turning an AC unit on and off. Other proven energy-saving tips include using fans, closing curtains, and ensuring the AC system is well-maintained.</p>

          <p>Djelika "Mami" Tounkara, a 21-year-old Malian basketball player, is continuing her fight for justice after being ostracized from the sport for reporting sexual advances by a former coach in 2021. After she came forward, the coach was jailed, but she was dropped from the national team and received death threats, forcing her to leave Mali. Her case has been caught in a "maze of internal legal processes" within basketball's governing body, FIBA, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport recently ruled it lacked jurisdiction. Despite the setbacks and fear, Tounkara remains determined to seek change to protect future young athletes.</p>

It also consults a modern political editor to analyze what constitutes a "win" for today's protest movements.

          <p>A report from AI firm Anthropic suggests that China is pulling ahead of the United States in the artificial intelligence race, largely due to its significant advantage in power generation capacity. Last year, China added approximately ten times more power capacity than the U.S., a critical factor given the immense energy demands of AI data centers. The report notes this disparity is "concerning" as the U.S. AI sector's power requirements are projected to grow substantially by 2028. This highlights how foundational infrastructure, like energy, is becoming a key strategic element in the global technology competition. (not investment advice)</p>

From his working-class Birmingham roots, Osbourne's unique vocal style and dark lyrics helped define a new musical genre in the 1970s. After being fired from the band for his excessive substance abuse, he launched a highly successful solo career and later gained a new generation of fans through the reality TV show "The Osbournes."

The decline in the local primary school's enrollment and the prevalence of holiday lets are cited as further evidence of the negative impact.

This dynamic puts both sides in a difficult position, as the EU must navigate its own tense relationship with China while also managing economic pressure from its key transatlantic ally, making a significant breakthrough at the summit unlikely.</p>
