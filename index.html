          <p>Rapper Sean Kingston, legally Kisean Anderson, has been sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison for his involvement in a million-dollar fraud scheme. The scheme, which also involved his mother, Janice Turner, entailed obtaining over $1 million in luxury goods like vehicles and jewelry using fraudulent wire payments and fake receipts. Kingston and his mother were arrested following a SWAT raid on his rented Florida mansion in May 2024. Despite his attorney's portrayal of him as financially naive, a jury convicted him on conspiracy and wire fraud charges.</p>

          <p>A Department of Justice paralegal has been fired and charged with a felony after admitting to throwing a submarine-style sandwich at a Customs and Border Patrol officer in Washington, D.C. The staffer, Sean Dunn, allegedly yelled expletives at officers before throwing the sandwich and attempting to flee. Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the firing on social media, stating such disrespect for law enforcement would not be tolerated in the administration. The incident occurred amid the deployment of federal law enforcement to the capital to address crime, a move made despite data showing a recent decline.</p>

          <p>Actress Halle Berry has seemingly responded to recent comments made by her ex-husband, former MLB star David Justice, regarding their past marriage. During a podcast appearance, Justice suggested their marriage dissolved because Berry did not cook or clean and didn't seem "motherly." Shortly after, Berry posted photos on Instagram of herself laughing with her current partner, Van Hunt, with the caption, "Phew…! cooking, cleaning and mothering." The couple divorced in 1997 after a four-year marriage, and both have since remarried and have children from other relationships.</p>

Jota, age 28, and his brother, 25, died in a car crash in July. Before the match, fans in the Kop held up a mosaic reading 'DJ20' and a period of silence was observed, following a rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'

          <p>A new report from Deloitte indicates that the cost of school lunches is increasing, aligning with broader food inflation trends. The average price for a packed lunch has risen to $6.15, up nearly 3% from last year, with parents paying more for staples like milk and bananas. While some items like white bread and tomatoes have become cheaper, the overall rise in grocery prices is a significant stressor for families. To cope, caregivers are switching to store brands and cutting other expenses. The price of cafeteria lunches is also up 3.3% from last year.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell by approximately 14% after the company issued weak financial guidance for the upcoming quarter. The company cited increasing uncertainty and lower visibility, primarily due to demand pressures and trade issues within its China business, as well as reduced spending from leading-edge customers. The forecast for adjusted earnings per share and revenue fell significantly short of analyst expectations, overshadowing the fact that the company actually exceeded estimates for its most recent third-quarter results. This has led some analysts to downgrade the stock's rating. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts attribute this crisis to a nationwide shortage of pediatric inpatient psychiatric beds and inadequate outpatient mental health services.

          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Foundation suggests that residents in certain high-income states and counties will receive the largest benefits from President Trump's recently enacted tax breaks. In 2026, the average individual taxpayer is projected to save $3,752, with states like Wyoming, Washington, and Massachusetts seeing the highest average cuts. The report also highlights that resort areas such as Teton County, Wyoming, could see average tax cuts exceeding $37,000, skewed by top earners. In contrast, a separate Congressional Budget Office report warns the legislation could hurt lower-income Americans through cuts to social programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's decision that had temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting mass firings at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In a split decision, the court ruled that the lower court lacked jurisdiction, potentially clearing the way for the administration to proceed with plans to fire 1,500 of the agency's 1,700 employees. The ruling will not take immediate effect, allowing time for an appeal. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the decision as ignoring a "lawless attempt to destroy an agency" that has returned over $21 billion to consumers.</p>

          <p>Airlines are finding the summer travel season more challenging as demand patterns shift and costs rise. Carriers have reduced their August schedules as travelers increasingly fly earlier in the summer or shift European trips to the fall. This year, economic uncertainty and last-minute bookings forced many airlines to slash fares, leading several major carriers to lower their 2025 profit forecasts. In response, airlines are adjusting future schedules, with some moving their peak summer flying earlier to align with when schools let out, aiming for a better balance between capacity and demand.

          <p>A fact-check of President Trump's justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force finds his claims about crime levels to be misleading. While D.C.'s homicide rate was high in 2023 compared to states, it was lower than other major cities like New Orleans and St. Louis. More importantly, Trump's statement omits that violent crime in the capital has seen a significant decrease in 2024 and 2025, with murders down 32% in 2024. This downward trend aligns with national FBI data showing a reduction in violent crime across the U.S., contrary to the crisis narrative presented.</p>

The White House could potentially use funds from the CHIPS Act to structure such a deal, though no official plan has been announced. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." The story centers on a charismatic and unconventional teacher in 1930s Edinburgh and her profound influence on a select group of her students. While the narrative follows the girls' adolescence, its central concern is their moral education and relationship with their teacher, who they view as a deity-like figure. The article highlights Spark's realistic portrayal of how a magnetic personality can shape a young person's life, even long after they have grown up and forged their own path.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comprehensive ranking of the film and television adaptations of John Grisham's legal thrillers, from best to worst. The list evaluates each adaptation based on its quality and how well it captures the essence of Grisham's signature underdog stories. The 1993 film "The Pelican Brief," starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, is ranked as the best, praised for its charismatic leads and careful plotting. In contrast, the 2012 television series sequel to "The Firm" is placed at the bottom of the list, criticized for its slow, sputtering narrative that failed to translate Grisham's propulsive style.</p>
