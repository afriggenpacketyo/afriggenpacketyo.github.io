          <p>Google has agreed to pay Texas nearly $1.4 billion to settle allegations of violating state residents' data privacy rights, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The lawsuit, filed in 2022, accused Google of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. Google, however, did not admit any wrongdoing, stating that the settlement resolves old claims related to Chrome's incognito setting, location history disclosures, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. The company asserts that all policy changes related to these allegations were previously announced or implemented.</p>

Legal experts contend that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a unilateral suspension by the President would be unconstitutional. This consideration follows the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere this weekend after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in Earth orbit. The spacecraft, weighing roughly 1,050 pounds and equipped with a protective heat shield, is likely to survive its plunge through the atmosphere, although the exact landing location remains unknown. Experts believe the risk of injuries on the ground is low, and if any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>A proposed summit reminiscent of the Yalta Conference, involving President Trump, Xi Jinping, and Vladimir Putin, did not occur, highlighting persistent tensions among the US, China, and Russia. Xi and Putin met in Moscow, pledging to extend cooperation and counter what they view as Washington’s attempts at "dual containment." Trump's efforts to broker agreements with Beijing and Moscow have been largely unsuccessful, with neither side showing signs of backing down on core issues. The lack of cooperation raises concerns about solving global challenges like the Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>The Texas House of Representatives has advanced a Republican-backed bill to restrict property ownership by citizens of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The bill, known as SB17, includes a provision giving the state's governor broad powers to include more countries. Proponents argue it is crucial for protecting Texans from foreign adversaries, while critics denounce it as xenophobic and discriminatory. The bill now returns to the Senate for further consideration before potentially heading to the governor for approval.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A, a contagious liver infection, with cases unusually high in 2024 and 2025. The virus is spread through the oral-fecal route and is often associated with unhoused populations, travelers to areas with poor sanitation, and drug users. However, many recent cases have occurred in people without those risk factors, raising concerns about food contamination and community circulation. The best way to prevent infection is through vaccination, and officials are reassessing prevention efforts.</p>

The International Assn. of Fire Fighters (IAFF) suspended Escobar and two other union officers over the alleged financial improprieties and placed UFLAC under conservatorship.

          <p>The lack of murder convictions in the Tyre Nichols case, despite video evidence of a savage beating, highlights the limitations of police reform efforts. The case underscores the difficulty of securing convictions against officers, even in the face of egregious misconduct. The changing political climate and rising violent crime rates have stalled broader reform efforts, both locally in Memphis and nationally. The article argues that the failure to secure murder convictions and implement greater accountability means that Nichols will not be the last to suffer an unjust death.</p>
