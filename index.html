          <p>International tourism to the United States has slumped, while Americans are increasingly traveling overseas. Data reveals a nearly 10% drop in foreign visitors arriving by air in March compared to the previous year, and a 13% decrease from pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, U.S. citizens flying abroad have increased by 1.6% compared to last March and are up 22% from 2019. This imbalance could widen the gap between U.S. revenue from travel and tourism services and American spending abroad, raising concerns within the U.S. travel industry; potential factors include trade war tensions, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed over 11,500 acres and is approximately 30% contained, prompting a state of emergency declaration. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service credits heroic efforts for saving homes and lives, though 1,300 homes were threatened. While one business was destroyed, no injuries or loss of life have been reported. Officials expect the acreage to increase as they continue burnout operations to fully contain the fire, which could be the largest in New Jersey in 20 years; smoke is expected to drift into the New York City area. The fire started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, fueled by dry conditions and high winds, and the cause remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that incoming college freshmen are projected to accumulate $40,000 in student debt by graduation, highlighting the ongoing college affordability problem. Approximately 45% of 2025 high school graduates are expected to attend a four-year college, with over a third needing student loans to cover expenses. College tuition costs have risen significantly, outpacing inflation, and families now bear a larger portion of these expenses. With total outstanding student debt exceeding $1.6 trillion, concerns are growing about the long-term financial burden on students and the need for broader solutions to address college affordability.</p>

          <p>PayPal is introducing a 3.7% annual yield on stablecoin holdings for PayPal and Venmo users, aiming to boost payments activity within its ecosystem. The yield will be paid in PayPal USD (PYUSD), the company's U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin launched in 2023. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value against a non-crypto asset, making them attractive for payments and financial services. PayPal aims to incentivize users to adopt PYUSD for transactions within its platform, including international transfers and purchases with PayPal merchants, while other stablecoin issuers primarily earn revenue from interest on reserves.</p>

Businesses running Threads ads can also access Meta's inventory filter to manage ad placement near offensive content. This move marks Meta's initial foray into generating revenue for Threads, which debuted in July 2023. While executives don't anticipate significant revenue growth from Threads in 2025, analysts believe it could become a major revenue source for Meta, similar to Twitter's pre-Elon Musk sales figures.

The UK is seeking to reduce trade taxes imposed by President Trump, including tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. While food standards remain a sticking point, Reeves emphasized that the UK will not compromise on these standards to secure a deal.</p>

          <p>Senator Dick Durbin's announcement that he will not seek reelection in 2026 has set off a race for his Illinois seat and a broader shakeup in Senate Democratic leadership. Durbin, who has served as the Democratic whip since 2005, will vacate the second-ranking position in the Democratic leadership. Potential successors for the whip position include Senators Brian Schatz, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker. Durbin's retirement also opens up the top Democratic spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse expected to take his place. The announcement comes after Democrats lost power in the White House and Senate in the 2024 elections, prompting calls for a new generation of leadership.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has risen for a third consecutive day, approaching $95,000 and turning positive for the year, driven by a broad relief rally. The cryptocurrency's surge follows President Donald Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and reduced criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Bitcoin has recovered more than half of its losses since Inauguration Day and is now hovering above the flat line for the year. Analysts attribute the recent increase to market participants capitalizing on a dip in an asset that consistently demonstrates its value as a portfolio diversification option and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.</p>

The creek, a tributary of the Missouri River, was contaminated with waste from the Manhattan Project, leading to a slow and insidious process of illness in the surrounding community. A 2019 study found that people who lived and played near Coldwater Creek from the 1960s to 1990s "could be at an increased risk of developing lung cancer, bone cancer or leukemia." While experts cannot definitively link specific cancer cases to the radiation, the community is calling for closer examination of the issue.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered that blood tests could predict the return of skin cancer by examining levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients' blood. The study showed that approximately 80% of stage 3 melanoma patients with detectable ctDNA experienced a recurrence of cancer. Assessing ctDNA levels was as good or better at predicting recurrence than traditional methods. Early detection of recurrence through ctDNA analysis could save lives, as melanoma is difficult to treat once it has spread; persistent circulating tumor DNA after a curative surgery suggests a high risk for early recurrence.</p>

          <p>The European Union has fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros for violating the bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro fine on Apple for preventing app makers from directing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. Meta Platforms was fined 200 million euros for forcing Facebook and Instagram users to choose between personalized ads or paying to avoid them. The penalties were the first issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech companies from cornering digital markets; both companies indicated they would appeal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to overhaul US elections is facing lawsuits from voting rights groups and Democratic officials. The order directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to update the national voter registration form to include a proof of citizenship requirement and cease federal money for states that don't use the updated form. Lawsuits argue that the EAC is an independent agency and not subject to Trump's orders, with experts saying the changes are unrealistic given the process outlined in federal law. The EAC is tasked with distributing funds for new voting equipment and creating voluntary guidelines for voting systems.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has rejected claims of a rift with shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick over whether the party should form a pact with Reform UK. The story was seized on by Labour and the Lib Dems, who urged Badenoch to sack her former leadership rival from the Tory frontbench for contradicting her - but Badenoch's spokesman insisted there were no differences between them. In a leaked recording obtained by Sky News, Jenrick said he wanted the "fight" against Labour at the next general election to be "united" and he was "determined" to "bring this coalition together".</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, the owner of a paddleboard firm, has been sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison after four people died during a paddleboarding excursion on the Western Cleddau river in Wales in October 2021. Lloyd pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead such a tour in hazardous conditions. The court heard that the river was in flood conditions with a strong current, and the group attempted to navigate a weir with a dangerous hydraulic jump. The victims were not wearing wetsuits, and there was no safety briefing or appropriate leashes for the conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to a level of 50% to 65%, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Such cuts would substantially reduce the tariffs that Trump set at 145% earlier this month, part of the White House’s recalibrations of trade strategy that have roiled global markets for weeks. Stocks rallied on the report as well as on Trump’s backing away from reported threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Several options are under review, including a tiered system that would distinguish between strategic and non-strategic goods.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of lacking "moral courage" on transgender issues during heated exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions. Last week, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman should be based on biological sex under equalities law, meaning, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces. Starmer has said the court's ruling provided "clarity" and that it was now "time to lower the temperature" on the debate.</p>

          <p>Many corporations that donated millions to President Trump's inauguration are now facing business challenges due to his policies, particularly tariffs and regulatory uncertainty. Banks are grappling with skittish capital markets, airlines are cutting guidance due to reduced consumer travel, and tech companies are concerned about higher import costs and reduced business spending. While Trump has signaled a potential thaw in the trade war, there's no guarantee of a deal. The tech industry's biggest companies — and many of their CEOs — lined up to donate to Trump's inaugural fund as part of a targeted effort at creating a friendlier relationship with the White House after a tumultuous four years during Trump's first term.</p>

However, the entry of candidates like Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco has heightened a sense of opportunity for the party.
