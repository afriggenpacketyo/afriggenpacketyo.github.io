          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. This decision, revealed at the annual shareholder meeting, designates Abel, the current vice chairman of non-insurance operations, as Buffett's successor. Buffett reassured shareholders that he will continue to assist with significant acquisition opportunities, particularly during volatile markets, leveraging Berkshire's substantial cash reserves of over $347 billion. The article notes that Berkshire shares experienced a slight dip in premarket trading despite the CEO transition announcement and somewhat underwhelming earnings reports, but the shares had closed at a record high the prior Friday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's ongoing trade war, intended to revive American manufacturing, is instead causing job losses, as exemplified by recent layoffs at Mack Trucks' Lehigh Valley plant due to tariffs and economic uncertainty. While some union members support the tariffs for long-term gains, others express concern over the lack of a clear strategy. Economists generally agree that manufacturing will unlikely return to its mid-20th century prominence, with service industries and automation replacing jobs. Despite this, many in manufacturing-dependent communities hope tariffs will reverse the decline and restore the economic vitality of the past.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns over potential cuts to Medicaid and the dismantling of agencies supporting independent living for disabled Americans, disability rights advocate Ari Ne'eman reflects on historical strategies used to defend disability rights. Ne'eman highlights the importance of both massive mobilization and reframing disability rights priorities to appeal to a broader political spectrum. He emphasizes that disabled people are often devalued by the healthcare system yet have a significant need for healthcare and support services. Ne'eman expresses concern over potential rollbacks in services that enable disabled people to remain in their homes and communities, potentially leading to increased institutionalization and unmet healthcare needs.</p>

          <p>Five people, including a pilot and a 6-year-old boy, survived for 36 hours in a Bolivian swamp infested with alligators and anacondas after their small plane crashed. The survivors clung to the wreckage, enduring mosquito attacks and the presence of predatory reptiles, sustaining themselves with ground cassava flour. The pilot speculated that the stench of jet fuel kept the animals at bay. Rescuers found them after they used cell phone flashlights and shouted for help, and they were taken to a hospital for treatment of dehydration, minor chemical burns, infected cuts, bruises, and insect bites.</p>

Meanwhile, jury selection begins in New York City for Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial, where he faces charges including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.

Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed retaliation for a Houthi missile strike near Tel Aviv, attributing responsibility to Iran. Over the weekend, the Israeli Air Force targeted over 100 terror sites in Gaza, and IDF troops discovered weapons caches in the southern region.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures declined following OPEC+'s decision to boost production for the second consecutive month. The group agreed to increase output by 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' initial forecast. This decision, coupled with concerns about tariffs and a potential recession, has contributed to a more than 20% drop in oil prices this year. Oilfield service firms anticipate a decrease in exploration and production investments due to the current price environment, and Goldman Sachs predicts U.S. crude and Brent prices will average $59 and $63 per barrel this year, respectively.</p>

Cyber security experts recommend implementing additional security layers, such as code words, to verify the identity of staff members requesting credential changes.

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change comes shortly after announcing the 100% rate, sparking concerns about financial hardship for beneficiaries. While the 50% rate is an improvement, experts warn it can still be devastating for those relying on benefits to cover essential expenses. Beneficiaries have 90 days to request a lower withholding rate, reconsideration, or waiver of recovery, otherwise the agency will withhold up to 50% of their benefits until the overpayment is recovered.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariffs Highlight Changing Capitalism, Need for Democratizing Spirit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 06:00:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trump's tariffs, though economically unsound, signal a broader political vision of protectionism aimed at safeguarding a way of life, particularly for those who lost out from globalization. The author argues that capitalism requires a "spirit" to justify its pursuit of profit and that Trump's protectionist spirit, while appealing, risks creating new cycles of dismay. Instead, a democratizing spirit is needed, one that guides collective efforts to ensure decent lives for all, even in a chaotic world. The article suggests Democrats should emphasize the spirit of their vision, highlighting community and a version of America that works for everyone.</p>

          <p>Autism researchers and advocates are opposing the creation of a national autism database, citing concerns about potential misuse and privacy violations.

They criticize the lack of transparency regarding opt-out options, security measures, and data usage.
