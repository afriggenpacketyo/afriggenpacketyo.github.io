          <p>The Trump administration took action to prevent Harvard University from enrolling international students, citing concerns about violence, antisemitism, and coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. The Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, requiring existing foreign students to transfer or lose their legal status. Harvard responded by calling the action unlawful and affirming its commitment to its international students. This move follows previous actions by the administration, including freezing federal grants to Harvard, amid ongoing tensions over campus issues. Optimism regarding the situation is low given the strong stances from both sides.</p>

The researchers emphasized the importance of breakfast for children's energy and concentration and hope the findings spark a conversation about creating healthier options for kids.

          <p>The US Congress is moving to block a California law that would have banned the sale of petrol-only cars in the state by 2035. The Senate followed the House in voting to effectively kill the law, nullifying a waiver granted to the state that had allowed it to set stricter auto emissions standards than those set by the federal government. The vote is a win for Republicans, energy firms and carmakers. It's a blow to Democrats and environmental groups, which saw the rule as a key step to addressing pollution and climate change.

          <p>Annuities are often pitched as a way to ensure you won't outlive your money during retirement, but the reality is that these retirement products can also be quite confusing. Whether or not an annuity can run out of money depends heavily on the type of annuity you have. In general, immediate and lifetime annuities are designed not to run out of money as long as the issuing insurer remains solvent. However, fixed-term annuities, variable annuities, and annuities with withdrawal riders can run out of money under certain circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

In 2024, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives became “ground zero” for many of these groups, the report said, some using threats of violence and “creating chaos that opened the door for political strongmen and authoritarian measures”. These efforts built a foundation for nationwide policy actions to follow by Donald Trump, including legislative measures to restrict discussions of race and gender in classrooms, and cutting funding for programs that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>Two Israeli Embassy staff members, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were shot and killed outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC. Police say the victims were killed by a man who shouted "free, free Palestine". The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, is in custody. The event at the Capital Jewish Museum had been billed as a networking opportunity to bring Jewish young professionals and the diplomatic community together. The organiser, American Jewish Committee, said it was open to those in the DC diplomatic community.</p>

          <p>At least two people are dead and eight others were injured after a small plane crashed into the San Diego military housing neighborhood of Tierrasanta early Thursday morning. The crash, involving a Cessna 550 plane, occurred near Sculpin Street and Santo Road, close to the 15 Freeway. Capt. Bob Heely, Commanding Officer of the Naval base in San Diego, explained that the neighborhood where the crash occurred is Navy-owned housing. The San Diego Police Department has issued evacuations for Salmon, Sample and Sculpin streets.</p>

          <p>The Senate unanimously passed the No Tax on Tips Act, but experts say that the policy incentivizes businesses to lower workers’ wages and make them rely more on tips. The reality is that the problem for tipped workers isn’t that their taxes are too high — it’s that their wages are far too low. Congress can help low-wage workers by expanding the standard deduction or by finally getting rid of the subminimum wage.</p>

          <p>There is debate within the cricket community on whether injury replacements should be permitted in Test cricket, especially in the first innings of the game. Some argue that an independent doctor should be on site to determine if a player is unable to continue, and a substitute should be allowed. Others worry about the potential for abuse of the system. Some suggest substitutes should not be restricted to injuries, and the team should be able to strategically replace a player during the game.</p>

          <p>A new report led by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr lays out a dark vision of American children’s health and calls for agencies to examine vaccines, ultra-processed foods, environmental chemicals, lack of exercise and “overmedicalization”. Kennedy has made combatting the chronic disease “epidemic” a cornerstone of his vision for the US, even as he has ignored common causes of chronic conditions, such as smoking and alcohol use. Notably, the report reflects some of Kennedy’s bugbears where science is unsettled, but argues research “demonstrates the need for continued studies”, such as on fluoride in water and electromagnetic radiation.</p>
