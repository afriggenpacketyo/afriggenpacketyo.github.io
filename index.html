          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to anti-ICE protests has been criticized as an authoritarian overreach, with California Governor Gavin Newsom accusing Trump of intentionally causing chaos. Human rights lawyer Philippe Sands draws parallels to authoritarian regimes, suggesting Trump's actions are testing the limits of public tolerance. The protests erupted after ICE conducted immigration raids in Los Angeles, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Sands warns that these actions, combined with other measures like banning books and deporting without due process, represent a slow creep towards normalizing authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Detectives in Derbyshire, UK, uncovered a makeshift factory producing lethal "assassination kits" for organized crime groups, leading to the arrest of Ronald Knowles. Knowles converted replica pistols and manufactured bullets, packaging them with silencers and latex gloves, which were then sold by Gary Hardy. The discovery was part of an investigation into Hardy's activities by Nottinghamshire Police and the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, revealing a significant firearms manufacturing operation. Hardy, along with Knowles and two others, will be sentenced for serious firearms offenses, highlighting the dismantling of a dangerous supply chain to the criminal underworld.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven leaders' meeting in Canada in mid-June, with the aim of resolving trade differences.

Japan has been pushing for the removal of U.S. tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced tariff rates as a compromise.

Cans labeled as "zero sugar" were found to contain the full amount of sugar present in regular Dr Pepper, approximately 39 grams. The affected cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and have a "best by" date of February 16, 2026. Customers who purchased the mislabeled product are advised to return it for a full refund or discard it, ensuring those who need to avoid sugar are protected.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in European drug classifications to smuggle ketamine, often swapping it for harmless substances like salt during transit. Ketamine, legally used as an anesthetic in some countries, is diverted into the black market, with consumption in the UK rising significantly. The BBC investigation highlights how organized crime groups profit more from ketamine than other illegal drugs, leading to increased deaths and health issues. European police forces are planning to collaborate with Indian authorities to address the problem, as the drug is often shipped from India through countries with varying regulations.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, aiming to lower the elevated prices of the country's staple food. The released rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, is expected to be sold at around 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to approximately 100,000 tons, addressing public frustration over soaring rice prices that have doubled compared to the previous year.

The response from senior civil servants emphasized the civil service's commitment to delivering government policies, but acknowledged resignation as an option for those with fundamental disagreements. This has sparked outrage among officials, who feel the space for challenging policy is being further restricted.</p>

          <p>A new UN report reveals a significant decline in world fertility rates, with millions unable to have their desired number of children due to financial constraints and lack of suitable partners. The report, based on a survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries, indicates that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their ideal number of children. The UN agency has taken a strong stance, warning of a "real crisis" as prohibitive costs and other factors prevent people from starting families. This shift in fertility trends underscores the growing challenges individuals face in achieving their family goals.</p>

Despite Hunt's claims that he did not sexually assault Lane, his final request for a stay of execution was denied.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a significant decline, particularly due to a decrease in fentanyl-related fatalities. Data from the CDC shows a massive reduction in fatal overdose risk among Gen Z, with ages 20 to 29 experiencing a 47% decrease. This shift is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, and increased caution among young people regarding drug use. While the trend is promising, experts caution that sustaining progress may be difficult, especially as the Trump administration seeks to cut funding for addiction services.</p>
