          <p>AlphaSense CEO Jack Kokko, a former Wall Street analyst, discusses Deep Research, an AI tool designed to function like a team of analysts operating at superhuman speed, generating research and market insights from over 500 million business and financial documents. The tool taps into filings, press releases, content about public and private companies, and expert insights based on call transcripts. Kokko argues that this AI will augment analysts' capabilities by rapidly processing vast amounts of information, enabling them to ask and answer questions more efficiently. The tool can offer both pro and con positions, providing internal and external perspectives in record time, a task that would have taken human analysts days or weeks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Law enforcement is concentrating its search on the Ingalls Creek and Valley High areas for Travis Decker, the Washington father suspected of killing his three daughters. The Chelan County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) has urged residents to secure their homes and report any suspicious activity, as the area is located approximately 30 miles from where the girls' bodies were discovered. Federal authorities have taken over the manhunt, with the CCSO remaining in command of the criminal investigation. Evidence, including blood samples tracing back to Decker, was found in his abandoned GMC pickup truck, and the coroner's office confirmed the girls died of suffocation. </p>

The talks are an attempt to defuse tensions between the world’s two largest economies over trade and technology, despite a temporary deal to scale back tariffs last month. This meeting follows a recent phone call between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump, where they agreed to push forward with negotiations to resolve ongoing economic disputes.

          <p>Disney CEO Bob Iger believes that taking full control of Hulu will unlock new growth opportunities for the company, with Disney set to finalize its acquisition of NBCUniversal's stake in Hulu by July 24. Iger stated that this acquisition is the first big step in turning Hulu into a real growth business for Disney, allowing for better bundling capabilities with Disney+ and ESPN+. Integrating the apps fully will create a seamless experience for consumers, save operational costs, and reduce customer churn. Disney's streaming business achieved profitability in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which further improved in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and Hulu's full integration strengthens Disney's direct-to-consumer business.</p>

          <p>A large international study of nearly 300,000 children reveals a two-way link between screen time and emotional well-being, finding that increased screen time is associated with aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The study, published in Psychological Bulletin, also found that children with pre-existing social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. Gaming consoles were particularly linked to a greater chance of developing issues, regardless of the specific type of game. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting recreational screen time for children between 2 and 5 years old, emphasizing that screen time should not interfere with sleep and physical activity.</p>

          <p>Yale University is reportedly accelerating the sale of billions of dollars in private equity investments. This move comes as the private equity industry faces challenges and President Trump targets Ivy League institutions. The university's decision to sell these stakes reflects broader concerns about the performance and regulatory environment surrounding private equity, as well as potential pressures from the federal government.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) has reportedly used a Lockheed Martin F-16 to shoot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-35S fighter-bomber, marking the F-16's first air-to-air kill in the conflict. The incident occurred near Korenevo in the Kursk region of Russia, with alleged support from a Saab 340 airborne early warning and control plane. The F-16AM involved was originally from the Netherlands, which has provided 24 such planes to Ukraine. This success suggests that the introduction of F-16s is altering the balance of power in the air, making it more challenging for Russia to deploy its air assets.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asserted that he and President Trump have the authority to deploy National Guard and active-duty troops anywhere in the country to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. This claim, if enacted, could lead to a significant conflict between Trump and Democratic governors. Hegseth's testimony came as approximately 4,800 National Guard and Marines were deployed to Los Angeles following clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Critics argue that active-duty military personnel are not trained for domestic law enforcement and that the deployment could escalate tensions.</p>

          <p>The film *Ballerina*, a spin-off from the *John Wick* franchise, initially struggles to capture the stylistic flair of its source material, focusing on a generic revenge plot. However, it eventually succeeds by expanding the *Wick* universe with inventive stunts and bizarre scenarios, such as a cultish mountain town where every inhabitant is an assassin. Ana de Armas delivers a charming performance in action sequences that recall the mayhem of Buster Keaton and Looney Tunes. While *Ballerina* opened below expectations, it ultimately attempts to expand the *Wick* canon rather than deepen its titular protagonist, contributing to the franchise's world-building.</p>

Experts warn that this move could increase public distrust in vaccinations and federal health agencies, potentially threatening public health by eroding immunization rates. The concern is that Kennedy might appoint members sympathetic to anti-vaccine views, leading to biased recommendations and deterring Americans from getting vaccinated. The potential impact on vaccine manufacturers remains uncertain, but some analysts suggest it introduces more regulatory uncertainty.</p>
