        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment" in the U.S. following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. While there are no specific, credible threats at this time, the bulletin cautions about potential low-level cyberattacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and possible attacks by Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem highlighted the possibility of increased threats to the homeland, including cyberattacks, acts of violence, and antisemitic hate crimes, stemming from the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. The bulletin also warns of the potential for violent extremists in the U.S. to mobilize in response to the conflict, especially if Iranian leadership calls for retaliatory violence. The advisory is designed to inform the public about potential threats and provide resources for staying safe. The optimism score is based on the potential for violence and cyberattacks in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Six people died and two are missing after a 27-foot boat capsized on Lake Tahoe due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park.

          <p>UFC star Jon "Bones" Jones was accused of leaving the scene of an automobile accident in February, with a criminal complaint filed just days before his retirement announcement.

Jones later confirmed the woman left his house intoxicated and called him after the crash. UFC CEO Dana White announced Jones's retirement, relinquishing his heavyweight championship belt. Jones confirmed his retirement on social media, expressing gratitude for his UFC journey, which creates a mixed optimism score.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Washington is preparing for a potential response from Iran, as the Islamic Republic weighs its options. While the Iranian government downplays the impact of the U.S. attack, U.S. military officials claim the strikes caused "extremely severe damage and destruction". Tehran's allies, Russia and North Korea, have criticized the military campaign. Despite the dramatic nature of the U.S. air raid, few in Washington want a prolonged war with Iran and are open to a truce. The situation remains tense as the world awaits Iran's next move, influencing the optimism score.</p>

          <p>The U.S. carried out a bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, claiming they have been "obliterated," according to President Donald Trump. The Pentagon said that it will take time to fully assess the effect of the attack though it appears all the sites sustained "extremely severe damage". Israel stated they were in "full co-ordination" with the U.S. in planning the strikes, while Iranian officials confirmed the facilities were struck but denied it had suffered a major blow. The strikes mark a significant escalation in the ongoing war between Iran and Israel. The optimism score is influenced by the escalation of conflict.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital oil "chokepoint" that facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products per day. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that an Iranian effort to block the strait "would be a suicidal move," likely driving backlash from a sizable group of powerful countries. The U.S. has long pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait, and the risk of disruption to global oil flows affects the optimism score.</p>

          <h2>Iran Says U.S. Must 'Receive a Response' to Strikes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites, Iran has indicated that the U.S. must "receive a response," raising concerns about potential retaliation. The conflict has put renewed focus on security in the Strait of Hormuz, with Iran reportedly considering blocking it after the US strikes on its nuclear sites. The key waterway lies between Oman and Iran, and connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. The potential for escalation and disruption to global oil flows impacts the optimism score.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Aims for 'One-and-Done' Approach After Strikes on Iranian Nuclear Sites</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 15:07:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon briefing following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites was heavy on what happened but short on detail of what happens next, with the U.S. wanting this attack to have been a "one-and-done". While the U.S. wants Iran to negotiate peace, it also threatens further aggression if it doesn't. The U.S. has made it clear it is open to dialogue, and has not targeted Iranian troops or civilians, which could limit response and leave open a door. However, Iran is talking of a diplomatic door closed and sending its foreign minister travelling to Moscow to meet Vladimir Putin. The cautious approach and potential for de-escalation influence the optimism score.</p>

          <h2>JD Vance Claims U.S. at War with Iran's Nuclear Program, Not Iran</h2>

          <p>JD Vance has said the U.S. is “not at war” with Iran but with its nuclear weapons program, holding out a position that the White House hopes to maintain. Vance declined to confirm with absolute certainty that Iran’s nuclear sites were completely destroyed, but believes the U.S. has “substantially delayed” Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon. Nuclear non-proliferation analysts are conflicted on whether the strikes will be effective in bringing Iran to the negotiating table or convince them to move more decisively toward enriching uranium stockpiles to weapons-grade. The nuanced stance and uncertain outcomes influence the optimism score.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites. Rubio urged Iran to pursue diplomacy and warned that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move for the regime. President Trump continues to prefer the path of diplomacy, and the U.S. is prepared to meet if Iran wants to discuss the situation. The potential for diplomatic resolution influences the optimism score.</p>

          <p>A massive data breach has exposed 16 billion login credentials, including usernames, emails, and passwords for various online services, raising significant cybersecurity concerns. The compromised data, likely stemming from malicious "infostealer" software, spans nearly every type of online service imaginable, including government officials' credentials. Experts warn that cybercriminals can use the stolen credentials to launch various attacks, including credential stuffing, phishing, and identity theft. Individuals are urged to change their passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and monitor their financial accounts closely. The sheer scale of the breach significantly reduces the optimism score.</p>

          <p>A suicide bombing at a church on the outskirts of Damascus, Syria, has killed at least 20 people and wounded 52 others. The attacker entered Mar Elias Church in Dweila during a service and opened fire before detonating an explosive vest, according to the interior ministry. Authorities have linked the attacker to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS), though there was no immediate claim from the group itself. The tragic loss of life and the act of violence significantly lower the optimism score.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that immigration agents wearing masks undermine authority and endanger public safety. The author notes that masked ICE agents are becoming a routine sight, including at protests and during law enforcement actions, and that the government does not have a policy prohibiting the wearing of masks. The author argues that the practice is not acceptable, that it may contradict Department of Homeland Security rules, and that it gives agents impunity to make illegal arrests. The article also mentions an increase in people impersonating agents, which impacts the optimism score.</p>

          <p>In the hours after its military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. officials suggested Iran ought to embrace a diplomatic off-ramp rather than choosing to retaliate. President Donald Trump said Iran must now make peace, and Vance suggested the U.S. was not interested in a broader war or a conflict beyond its strikes on the Iranian nuclear program. The defense secretary did not clarify any potential parameters for negotiations but said the U.S. was sending messages directly to Iran and “giving them every opportunity to come to the table.” The focus on diplomacy influences the optimism score.</p>
