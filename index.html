          <p>President Trump has signed into law a significant legislative package that makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent while also enacting substantial spending cuts to federal safety-net programs. The bill, narrowly passed by Congress, also allocates major funding increases for border security and defense. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation will add over $3 trillion to the national debt. Democrats have strongly criticized the bill, arguing it benefits the wealthy at the expense of working families and will be a key issue in upcoming elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White received a technical foul for yelling at officials during a recent game, and she has suggested that star player Caitlin Clark offered to pay the resulting fine. The incident occurred during a decisive win over the Las Vegas Aces, even while Clark was sidelined with an injury. The article notes this event as part of a more defiant team culture developing around the Fever, citing recent on-court altercations and post-game celebrations. This evolving team dynamic comes during Clark's second year in the WNBA and White's first as head coach.</p>

          <h2>New Legislation Offers Senior Tax Deduction, Not Elimination of Social Security Tax</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 20:17:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's newly signed legislative package does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the bill introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older who fall within certain income thresholds. Policy experts clarify this provides some tax relief but is not a repeal of the tax on benefits, and it primarily benefits higher-income seniors. Critics also raise concerns that the measure could increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund, which is already facing a long-term shortfall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains at the site of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics left seven people unaccounted for, and positive identification of the remains is still pending. The facility, located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, was reportedly operating without the necessary local licenses for fireworks storage. The investigation, now led by Cal Fire with assistance from the ATF, is ongoing as crews work to manage the hazardous scene.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared a path for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records currently being held at a U.S. base in Djibouti. The court's order effectively pauses a lower court's injunction that had blocked their removal to a third country, in this case South Sudan, without a chance to contest it. The administration argued the lower court's ruling was a "lawless act of defiance," while dissenting justices expressed grave concerns for the migrants' safety, suggesting they could face torture or death. This decision is a significant development in the administration's policy of third-country removals.</p>

          <p>The massive tax and spending bill recently passed by Congress and signed by the President introduces sweeping changes to U.S. domestic policy. Key provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increasing the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, and providing over $46 billion for border wall construction. The legislation is funded in part by significant cuts and new restrictions on programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which could impact millions of Americans. The bill also terminates many clean energy tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton play a surprisingly large role in combating global warming through an annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to burn this fat, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists estimate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously thought. This discovery highlights the critical but often overlooked importance of these organisms in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has uncovered evidence of a criminal network in the UK systematically using fraudulent wills to steal millions of pounds from the estates of deceased individuals. The fraudsters appear to exploit weaknesses in the probate system by monitoring a public list of unclaimed estates and quickly producing fake documents naming them as heirs. The report details several cases where rightful heirs were cheated out of their inheritance. Experts suggest the move to an online, trust-based probate application process has made it easier for criminals to commit this fraud and evade inheritance tax.</p>

          <p>A prosecutor for the Hillsborough County Attorney's Office special victims unit in New Hampshire was arrested twice in one morning for a domestic violence incident. Thomas Rogers, 35, was first charged with simple assault against a woman he knew and released on orders not to return to the residence. A few hours later, police responded to another call at the same address and arrested him again for breach of bail and stalking. The County Attorney's Office has acknowledged the "serious matter" and stated it will cooperate fully with the law enforcement investigation.</p>

The Gallagher brothers, after a 16-year break, played a set packed with classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Live Forever" to a fervent crowd of 70,000. Despite a lack of direct interaction on stage, their musical chemistry was evident, with Liam Gallagher's vocals sounding particularly strong.

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's immigration raids and the newly approved federal budget bill. Many attendees said they were forgoing traditional holiday celebrations to voice their opposition to the policies, which they argue are creating a climate of fear. The "Big Beautiful Bill" allocates billions in new funding for mass deportations and border enforcement. The protest, which included a march to the federal building, highlighted the ongoing tensions between local California leaders and the federal government over immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Germany began its Euro 2025 campaign with a victory over Poland, but the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. The key player, who has a history of two previous ACL injuries, left the field in tears during the first half. While goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller secured the win, the team's performance was at times unconvincing. The focus now shifts to the extent of Gwinn's injury, which could significantly impact Germany's chances in the tournament as they prepare to face tougher opponents in their group.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease has outlined five types of "toxic" foods he avoids giving his own children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs because of nitrates and sodium. He also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor advocates for alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run victory in a match at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but England's Lauren Bell secured the win by dismissing India's captain. The game featured a stunning momentum shift, as England recovered from a major batting collapse where they lost nine wickets for just 31 runs. Earlier, half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge had put England in a strong position before the late-inning drama unfolded, setting up a crucial fourth match in the series.</p>

He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division and civil war, arguing that today's political polarization is not unprecedented. Burns advocates for telling a complex, inclusive history that acknowledges the founders' flaws, such as slavery, alongside their brilliant ideas. He believes this fuller, more truthful narrative makes the founding story more powerful and accessible, providing a "lifeline" to navigate current challenges.</p>
