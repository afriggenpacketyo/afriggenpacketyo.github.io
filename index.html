          <p>Treasury yields decreased as President Trump suggested implementing a 50% tariff on the European Union, citing stalled negotiations and trade imbalances. Trump also mentioned a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., causing Apple's stock to fall. Investors sought safety in bonds due to these trade war concerns. Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group noted the importance of capitalism operating without top-down intervention.

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted lower court orders requiring the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to hand over information to a government watchdog group. The dispute stems from a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) seeking information about DOGE's operations and personnel. CREW argues DOGE wields substantial independent authority, making it subject to FOIA, while the Justice Department asserts DOGE is a presidential advisory body. The temporary stay allows the Supreme Court more time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief.</p>

It's crucial to view gold as a long-term hedge rather than a quick profit source and to be wary of scams and high premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ETF market is poised for unprecedented growth, potentially doubling in size due to SEC changes allowing mutual fund managers to offer ETF share classes. Dave Nadig, an ETF expert, predicts up to 3,000 new ETF launches soon, adding to the existing 4,000. While this offers investors more choices, it also creates a challenge in navigating the market. Nadig advises investors to research thoroughly, noting that many new ETFs will be traditional asset allocation products. He also cautions about the historical performance of active managers and the potential mismatch of illiquid assets in fast-trading ETFs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several people sustained life-threatening injuries in a knife attack at the main railway station in Hamburg, Germany. Police arrested a 39-year-old woman and are conducting a major operation. Initial reports from the fire department indicated 12 people were injured, but police later stated that there were no reliable figures. Police believe the suspect acted alone in the attack, which occurred at the city's Central Station around 18:00 local time.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has cancelled his upcoming concerts due to a brain disorder called normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), which affects hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing symptoms including difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition is rare but risk increases with age, and symptoms can be dismissed as normal effects of aging. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt to drain excess fluid, and physical therapy may also be used.</p>
