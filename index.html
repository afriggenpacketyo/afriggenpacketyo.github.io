          <h2>British MPs Denied Entry to Israel Amidst Security Concerns</h2>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were denied entry to Israel and subsequently left the country after being detained upon arrival. Israeli authorities accused them of intending to "spread hate speech" against Israel, a claim the MPs vehemently denied. The UK Foreign Office expressed concern over the incident, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy calling the move "unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning." The MPs stated that it was "vital" for parliamentarians to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory firsthand and criticized the targeting of truthful speech in the House of Commons.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 05:00:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Laryngologist Dr. Inna Husain explains that chronic throat clearing can be caused by various factors, including laryngeal pharyngeal reflux (LPR), allergies, and vocal cord issues. She notes that throat clearing can damage vocal folds, leading to lesions and sensitivity. Dr. Husain recommends identifying the root cause through an ENT exam and addressing it with hydration, avoiding irritants, and alternative behaviors like swallowing or humming. The goal is to break the cycle of irritation and reduce the urge to clear the throat.</p>

The book explores the diversity within the white working class, highlighting the influence of age on attitudes towards immigration.

          <p>Sales of Hudson's Bay Company's (HBC) striped merchandise have surged as the company liquidates its department stores nationwide. The iconic stripes have become a symbol of Canadian identity, driving up prices on items like wool blankets. The phenomenon reflects a growing movement to "buy Canadian" amidst trade tensions with the US. HBC, founded in 1670, played a significant role in Canada's history, trading woolen blankets with indigenous communities before expanding into retail.</p>

While insisting that at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, the IDF acknowledged that the medics were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. The IDF claimed that the soldiers had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members, and when the ambulances approached, they assumed they were under threat.

          <p>Mark Cuban warned that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs, combined with DOGE cuts, could cause long-term economic harm "far worse" than the 2008 financial crisis. He suggests the tariffs, combined with cuts to the federal workforce, could result in a worse financial crisis than the Great Recession of 2008. Cuban did not expand on why he sees the sweeping cuts to the federal workforce as related to the nation's economic health. During the 2008 financial crisis, the country's GDP declined by more than 4%, the unemployment rate reached 10%, and the housing market crashed.</p>
