          <p>An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, carrying 242 passengers and crew, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, on Thursday. According to Air India Chairman N Chandrasekaran, the flight AI 171 was en route to London Gatwick Airport when the tragic accident occurred, and the cause of the crash is currently unknown and under investigation. Rescue teams have been mobilized to provide medical aid and relief support, while flights at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport were temporarily suspended following the incident. Initial flight data suggests the aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 625 feet before descending rapidly, and Gujarat's Chief Minister has ordered immediate rescue and relief operations. Optimism surrounding the event is low, as the crash resulted in numerous casualties and significant damage to surrounding infrastructure.</p>

          <p>India's consumer price index (CPI) eased to 2.82% in May, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, marking the lowest level since February 2019. The year-on-year inflation rate fell below Reuters' median poll estimate of 3% and was lower than April's 3.16% print, with food inflation significantly dropping to 0.99% from 1.78% in April. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been relaxing monetary policy, recently cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%, in response to the easing inflationary pressures. Nomura economists predict a subdued CPI of 3.3% for fiscal year 2026, with expectations of further rate cuts by the RBI, but these are just predictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A skier, Nicholas Vizzini, died in an avalanche on Alaska's Mount McKinley, also known as Denali, just days after another climber, Alex Chiu, died from a 3,000-foot fall on the same peak. Vizzini and his snowboarding partner triggered the avalanche at approximately 16,600 feet while descending a slope, and mountaineering rangers responded quickly but were unable to revive him. Vizzini's body has been recovered, and his partner sustained minor injuries, highlighting the dangers of climbing North America's tallest peak. This incident follows the earlier death of Alex Chiu, and the climbing season typically runs from early May to early July, with approximately 500 climbers currently on the mountain.</p>

          <p>Some parents are actively trying to delay their daughters' first period due to concerns about the trend of earlier menarche and its potential health risks. Experts say that the average age of menarche in the US has shifted earlier, from 12.5 between 1950 and 1969 to 11.9 between 2000 and 2005, with some researchers concerned about the impact of endocrine disruptors. Parents are implementing strategies like altering diet, personal care products, and screen time to limit exposure to these chemicals. However, some experts caution against hypervigilance and potential risks of eating disorders, emphasizing the need for more research and public policy changes to address environmental factors influencing puberty.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have been informed that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, prompting the U.S. to advise some Americans to leave the region and authorize voluntary departures for military family members. Despite these tensions, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff plans to continue nuclear program talks with Iran, while Iran's Defense Minister warned of targeting U.S. bases if conflict arises. The U.S. is considering options to support Israeli military action without directly leading it, possibly including aerial refueling or intelligence sharing, but direct involvement by U.S. B-2 bombers is unlikely. The U.K. Maritime Trade Organization has advised ships to exercise caution in key waterways due to increased regional tensions.</p>

Rapid population growth in the region has offset gains, with younger children aged 5 to 11 making up the largest share of child laborers, and UNICEF emphasizes the need to address poverty and improve access to quality education. Climate change, particularly in Madagascar, exacerbates the issue, pushing families into hazardous labor such as mica mining, and researchers note that cultural norms and weak enforcement of laws contribute to the perpetuation of child labor.</p>

          <p>Aviation expert Julian Bray described the Air India crash as a "major, catastrophic disaster," noting that initial footage showed a puff of smoke near the engine area followed by a fireball. Bray noted that emergency teams are on-site, and the pilot was able to send out a mayday call, indicating awareness of a problem. He mentioned that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner reportedly crashed into a building next to a hospital, and the current operation is focused on search and rescue. Bray stated that while there have been survivors in similar incidents, the initial videos are not promising.</p>

          <p>China's state media, specifically Qiushi, the Communist Party's top theoretical journal, has praised Pop Mart's Labubu toy for its creativity and global success. The commentary suggests Labubu's popularity demonstrates China's shift from low-value goods production to innovation, and Qiushi likened the toy's success to other globally acclaimed Chinese products. Pop Mart collaborates with artists to produce toy characters, and its overseas revenue has significantly increased, with Labubu being its most popular product designed by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung. The toy's popularity has also led to a wave of counterfeit products, highlighting its widespread appeal.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with Representative Melanie Stansbury, urged President Trump to reverse course on the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut government spending. Warren recommended implementing her policy proposals, which she claims would save the U.S. more than $2 trillion over 10 years, and she criticized DOGE's failures and outlined recommendations to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending. The letter follows opposition from Elon Musk to a budget bill central to enacting the president's agenda, leading to a public feud between Musk and Trump, but Musk later expressed remorse for his posts about Trump.</p>

          <p>The backlog in routine hospital treatments in England has decreased to its lowest level in two years, with the waiting list dropping to 7.39 million at the end of April, according to recent data. However, the NHS has not met its target of 92% of patients being seen in 18 weeks for nine years, with the current rate just below 60%, and the government has made meeting this target a key mission. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting stated that the NHS is on the road to recovery, with a 3% annual budget increase and upcoming reforms planned to build on these achievements. The peak of the waiting list occurred in September 2023, reaching nearly 7.8 million.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of buy-now, pay-later (BNPL) services is raising concerns about rising consumer debt, with credit card debt exceeding $1 trillion in the US. Consumer advocates worry that BNPL leads people to overspend and take on more debt than they can afford, with multiple loans and varying repayment schedules creating financial distress. While BNPL companies claim to offer a healthier alternative to credit cards, data shows that many users, particularly those with lower incomes and credit scores, rely on these services for necessities. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has recently pulled back on regulating BNPL services, and self-education is key to avoiding debt traps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans suggests that pre-match rituals can be more emotionally intense than the game itself, but the author argues that a sociological perspective is essential for understanding the full fan experience. Football elicits a wide range of emotions, and simply measuring heart rates doesn't capture the cultural significance and diverse interpretations of the game. Football offers a sense of community and identity in an increasingly individualistic world, and it generates comprehensible narratives, and it occasionally offers moments of scintillating drama.</p>

          <p>A group of Jewish scholars argues that Harvard University's approach to addressing antisemitism on campus perpetuates harmful stereotypes and violates civil rights law. The scholars reject the assumption that being Jewish necessitates supporting Israel, or that criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza constitutes antisemitism, and they argue that Harvard's claims about campus antisemitism misrepresent Jewish diversity. By adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which conflates criticism of Israel with prejudice against Jewish people, Harvard is said to be discriminating against Jewish students and faculty who don't conform to expected political views.</p>

          <p>Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's historical opposition to nuclear deals with Iran, an analyst suggests that Israel should welcome a potential agreement between President Trump and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The analyst argues that among bad options, a nuclear agreement could be the least bad, as it could lead to a more regionally integrated Iran with a stake in regional peace and stability. A diplomatic deal would curtail Iran's nuclear program and put the country on a path defined by its economic and pragmatic interests, potentially leading to a less belligerent foreign policy.</p>
