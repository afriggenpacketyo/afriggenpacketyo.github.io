          <p>The Trump administration has released its "AI Action Plan," a roadmap with over 90 policy actions designed to accelerate artificial intelligence development in the United States. The plan aims to bolster US innovation by building data center infrastructure, promoting American technology, and removing what it calls "bureaucratic red tape." It also includes measures to counter "ideological bias" in AI systems and positions the initiative as crucial for competing with China. Critics argue the plan heavily favors corporate interests and dismantles important safety guardrails.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media indicates a significant number of teenagers are now using AI chatbots not just for schoolwork, but as personal companions for advice and emotional support. Over 70% of teens have used AI companions, with many finding the interactions as or more satisfying than talking to human friends. While some see benefits, like building confidence, researchers and teens themselves express concern about the long-term impact. They worry it could hinder the development of real-world social skills, exacerbate loneliness, and redefine human relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has declared President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. The policy, which sought to end automatic citizenship for many children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants, has been on hold amid legal challenges. In their ruling, the panel of judges stated the order is invalid because it directly contradicts the clear language of the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision marks a significant legal development, as it is the first time an appellate court has ruled on the merits of the controversial executive action.</p>

          <p>Internal government data shows that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a year since the Obama administration. In the first six months of President Trump's second term, ICE recorded nearly 150,000 removals, projecting a total of over 300,000 for the year. This surge is part of a broad crackdown on illegal immigration, supported by unprecedented funding and a mandate to deport one million people annually. While the current pace falls short of that target, it reflects a significant escalation in enforcement, including expanded detention and pressure on individuals to self-deport.</p>

          <p>Public health officials have confirmed that a man in Riverside died from an overdose of carfentanil, a synthetic opioid approximately 100 times stronger than fentanyl. Originally developed as an anesthetic for large animals like elephants, carfentanil has been appearing in illicit drug markets, posing a significant threat due to its extreme potency. A tiny fraction of the amount of fentanyl that is lethal can be fatal with carfentanil, and it may not be detected by standard test strips. Health officials warn that the reemergence of this drug could undermine progress made in reducing overall opioid overdoses.</p>

Reese, who leads the league in technicals, picked up her latest during a game against the Lynx. The high number of fouls in just 22 games puts her at risk of losing a game check, a sensitive issue for the star who has been vocal about WNBA salaries and recently criticized the league's contract negotiation proposals.</p>

          <p>An exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument has been altered to comply with a Trump administration executive order to remove signage deemed "unpatriotic." The original exhibit, installed in 2021, added context to an existing timeline, including the role of Indigenous peoples and the complex, sometimes racist, legacies of figures like John Muir. Following the order, this additional information was removed, restoring the sign to its previous, less complete version. Former park staff criticized the move as censorship, arguing it erases a more robust and inclusive telling of American history from public view.</p>

          <p>Alphabet reported strong second-quarter results, beating Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings, driven by growth in its search, advertising, and cloud divisions. Despite the positive performance, the company announced it will increase its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion, to a total of $85 billion, to meet the growing demand for its AI and cloud services. The significant investment in AI infrastructure, including a new partnership with OpenAI, signals Alphabet's commitment to competing aggressively in the artificial intelligence space, even as it increases overall operating expenses.

          <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report, Attorney General Pam Bondi informed President Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times in Department of Justice files concerning Jeffrey Epstein. This briefing allegedly occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not release the files to the public. The report claims Trump was told the documents contained unverified hearsay about many prominent figures. The White House has dismissed the story as fake news, while the DOJ stated the briefing was routine and that nothing in the files warranted further investigation, a stance that has fueled criticism from some of Trump's supporters.</p>

          <p>In a move to preempt lengthy legal battles, Southern California Edison has announced it will create a program to directly compensate victims of the devastating Eaton fire. The program, open to those who lost property, were injured, or lost family members, will launch this fall, even as the official cause of the fire remains under investigation. While the utility presents this as an expedited way for the community to recover, some attorneys for fire victims are skeptical, suggesting it could be a tactic to underpay claimants. The offer comes amid concerns that the state's wildfire fund may be insufficient.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has rejected the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from a 2006 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the government's argument for release, based on public interest and transparency, did not meet the high legal standard required to bypass federal rules on grand jury secrecy. The decision is a setback for President Trump's effort to release more information on the case, which he initiated following pressure from his supporters. Similar requests to unseal grand jury materials in New York are still pending before different judges.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. against right-wing influencer Candace Owens. The suit addresses Owens' repeated promotion of a conspiracy theory that claims Brigitte Macron was born male. The legal action, filed in Delaware, states that Owens has spread "outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions" despite requests for a retraction. Owens has stood by her claims, which have circulated for years in fringe online communities but were amplified to her large audience, taunting the lawsuit as a "desperate public relations strategy."</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not about monetary policy but a push for "fiscal dominance." The author contends that with surging budget deficits, the administration wants lower interest rates to make its own spending agenda appear more affordable, effectively subordinating the central bank to political needs. While acknowledging Powell's past policy missteps, the piece warns that pressuring the Fed to cut rates now could erode confidence in U.S. Treasuries and mask the real problem: excessive government spending that risks long-term inflation and instability.

          <p>IBM's shares dropped in after-hours trading despite the company reporting second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's overall revenue and earnings projections. The decline was attributed to the company's software revenue, which, despite growing 10%, fell just short of analyst consensus estimates. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients reprioritized spending toward hardware and that geopolitical tensions caused cautious behavior. The company maintained its full-year guidance for revenue growth and free cash flow, and reported a significant increase in its generative AI book of business. (not investment advice)</p>
