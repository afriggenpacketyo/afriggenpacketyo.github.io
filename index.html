          <p>President Trump engaged in a tense exchange with South African President Ramaphosa at the White House, pushing false claims of "genocide" against white South African farmers, showing videos and articles to support his allegations. Ramaphosa disputed Trump's claims, stating that the violence affects all South Africans, not just white farmers, and that the speakers in the videos represent extremist fringe groups. Elon Musk, a South African native and Trump's adviser, was present during the meeting, and Trump has issued an executive order to fast-track Afrikaner refugees into the U.S., which has drawn scrutiny due to prioritizing Afrikaners while restricting immigration from other countries. The South African government disputes accusations of genocide and maintains that land expropriation is in the public interest and subject to compensation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston found the Trump administration violated an order barring deportations to countries not of the deportees' origin without sufficient notice, after eight migrants were deported on a flight that landed in Djibouti. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, raised the possibility of criminal contempt penalties and requested a list of everyone involved in the operation. The flight originated in Texas, stopped in Ireland, and eventually landed in Djibouti, with U.S. military personnel on standby. The deportees were citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma, and Vietnam, with convictions for crimes including murder and sexual assault. The judge expressed concern that the men had not been given adequate time to challenge their removal, which needed to be based on ‚Äúcredible‚Äù fears that the immigrants would face danger if they were sent to a third country.</p>

Advocates criticized the L.A. Zoo for its small enclosure and past health challenges among its elephants, prompting the zoo to transfer Billy and Tina to comply with AZA standards. The Tulsa Zoo was chosen for its larger enclosure, existing elephant herd, and the ability to keep Billy and Tina together. The transfer cost $44,000, split between the zoos, and the L.A.

While PSA tests can help detect aggressive cancers, they also carry the risk of false positives and overtreatment. Experts emphasize the importance of targeting aggressive cancers and monitoring slow-growing cancers that may never cause harm. A new approach involves using MRI scans and active surveillance before resorting to biopsies, aiming to reduce unnecessary treatments and improve patient outcomes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's condemnation of South Africa's land seizures from white farmers contrasts sharply with his own use of eminent domain to build the border wall. Trump has falsely accused South Africa of "confiscating land" and persecuting white farmers, while he has used government-sanctioned land grabs in the U.S. for his border wall. This highlights a contradiction in Trump's policies, as he has long been quick to embrace similar tools at home despite railing against the state's power to seize land overseas. The article includes an interview with a Texas farmer who had his land taken for the border wall.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett believes the stock market offers more opportunities than real estate, despite real estate being a popular investment choice for many Americans. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett noted that while his long-time partner Charlie Munger enjoyed real estate deals, he would have chosen stocks if forced to pick one asset class early in life. Buffett's argument is supported by the stock market's superior performance over the past four decades compared to residential real estate values.</p>

          <p>Liam O'Hanna, a member of the Irish language hip-hop group Kneecap, has been charged with a terror offense for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah. The charge stems from an incident at a London venue in November 2024. The Metropolitan Police's counter terrorism command investigated an online video from the event, leading to the Crown Prosecution Service authorizing the charge. Kneecap denies supporting Hamas or Hezbollah and asserts that the video was taken out of context. Several of the band's gigs have been canceled since the video surfaced.</p>
