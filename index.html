          <p>Keegan Bradley won the Travelers Championship by a single shot, denying Tommy Fleetwood his first PGA Tour title. Fleetwood, who held a three-shot lead going into the final round, struggled on the 18th hole, missing a crucial putt for par after a decent tee shot. Bradley capitalized, sinking his birdie putt to clinch the victory and adding to Fleetwood's wait for a PGA Tour win after numerous top-10 finishes. The tournament concluded with Bradley's triumph and Fleetwood's near miss, highlighting the competitive nature of professional golf. The final score reflects a moment of both triumph and disappointment in the world of professional golf.</p>

          <p>The United States conducted military strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, with President Donald Trump announcing the operation. B-2 bombers dropped Massive Ordnance Penetrators, also known as "bunker busters," while a U.S. Navy submarine launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at targets inside Iran. Trump addressed the nation following the strikes, calling it a "spectacular military success." Trump also hinted at a hope for regime change in Iran, using the slogan "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN," adding a political dimension to the military action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida Republican Representative Kat Cammack experienced delays in receiving treatment for an ectopic pregnancy due to concerns among hospital staff about Florida's six-week abortion ban. Cammack, who opposes abortion, blamed fearmongering from pro-abortion groups for the reluctance of medical staff to administer methotrexate, a drug needed to expel the pregnancy. Despite the state's healthcare agency issuing guidance clarifying that ectopic pregnancies are exempt from abortion restrictions, medical professionals remained worried about potential legal repercussions. Cammack hopes her experience will foster common ground between opposing political groups, emphasizing the need for women to receive proper care during miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, experts analyzing satellite imagery suggest that while damage was inflicted, Iran's nuclear program is not entirely destroyed. Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies notes that key elements, such as Iran's stocks of highly enriched uranium, appear untouched. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, agrees that significant amounts of enriched uranium likely still exist, possibly moved before the strikes. While the U.S. military claims to have obliterated Iran's nuclear ambitions, these independent assessments suggest a more nuanced reality, emphasizing the need for further inspections and diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>Following military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. officials, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth, urged Iran to pursue diplomacy rather than retaliation. Vance clarified that the U.S. is "at war with Iran's nuclear program," not Iran itself, while Hegseth emphasized that the strikes were intentionally limited. The U.S. is sending messages to Iran, offering opportunities for peace, but is also prepared for potential retaliation. Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi criticized the U.S. for undermining diplomatic efforts, stating that Iran was engaged in talks before the strikes.</p>

With the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei facing a critical decision on how to respond, the stakes are high for both Iran and the broader region. While Iran warns of retaliation, it also faces the challenge of avoiding calamitous miscalculation, given the weakened state of its military and regional proxies.

          <p>An article analyzes potential escalation pathways following the U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, highlighting three key scenarios. These include the possibility of needing to "finish the job" if initial strikes were insufficient, a U.S.-Iran cycle of violence stemming from retaliation, and the risk of unintended consequences akin to the Iraq War. The article emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for unforeseen events to drive further escalation. It also questions the Trump administration's preparedness for all possible contingencies.</p>

          <p>Six people died and two others are missing after a 27-foot boat capsized on Lake Tahoe on Saturday afternoon. The U.S. Coast Guard reported the incident occurred near D.L.

          <p>A bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System warns of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following the U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While there are no current specific threats, the bulletin notes the possibility of low-level cyber attacks and potential attacks by cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government. The Department of Homeland Security is sharing the bulletin with the public to provide information about threats and resources for staying safe. The bulletin also notes the potential for violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to attack targets in response to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Washington is bracing for a response from Iran, with 40,000 troops stationed in the region. While the Iranian government downplayed the impact, U.S. military officials claimed the strikes caused "extremely severe damage and destruction." Vice President Vance denied that the U.S. is "at war" with Iran, but Democrats in Congress are pushing for a vote to restrict Trump under the War Powers Act. Experts suggest Iran's response could involve disruptions to shipping lanes or leveraging its control of the Strait of Hormuz.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated the U.S. carried out a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, which have been "obliterated." The Pentagon said it will take time to fully assess the effect of the attack, though it appears all the sites sustained "extremely severe damage." The strikes mark a significant escalation in the ongoing war between Iran and Israel. The operation, named Operation Midnight Hammer, involved 125 U.S. military aircraft, including seven B-2 stealth bombers, with the U.S. deploying deception tactics, including decoys, with fighter jets clearing the airspace ahead of them.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending a precision strike on Iranian nuclear sites, asserting it was a limited engagement to disrupt nuclear capabilities. The administration claims the president has clear authority to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. However, some lawmakers, like Rep.

Top Democrats were kept in the dark about the mission until after U.S. forces left Iranian airspace, raising concerns about the legality of the strike without Congressional approval.</p>
