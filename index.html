          <p>President Trump responded to the attack on pro-Israel demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, stating that such acts of terrorism will not be tolerated. He emphasized the suspect's illegal immigration status, calling for secure borders and deportation of radical elements. The FBI is investigating the incident, where the suspect allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower while yelling "Free Palestine." While Trump highlighted the immigration aspect, he did not mention antisemitism in his statement, which came nearly 24 hours after the attack. The event injured eight people, prompting a swift response from law enforcement and political figures. </p>

The attack involved a makeshift flamethrower, resulting in injuries to eight people who were participating in a Run for Their Lives walk to raise awareness about hostages held in Gaza.

          <p>The Trump administration's 2026 budget request proposes a 90% funding cut to the Ecosystems Mission Area (EMA) of the U.S. Geological Survey, a program that monitors environmental contaminants, invasive species, and wildlife health. EMA's North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) has been crucial in studying white-nose syndrome in bats and the impact of wind turbines on these animals. Critics argue that eliminating this biological research will have severe consequences for human populations and the economy, as bats play a vital role in controlling insect pests and reducing the need for pesticides. Interior Department employees express concern that these cuts stem from EMA's climate science research and data indicating the need for species protection. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to proceed with mass layoffs of federal workers across multiple agencies, despite a preliminary injunction blocking the reductions-in-force. The administration argues that the president has the authority to oversee personnel decisions and that the injunction interferes with the Executive Branch's operations. Lower courts have sided with labor unions and nonprofit groups, arguing that the executive order exceeds presidential authority and violates the separation of powers. The case revolves around the president's creation of DOGE, a cost-cutting task force, and efforts to dismantle agencies, leading to legal challenges. </p>

          <p>South Koreans are heading to the polls to elect a new president following the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol for declaring martial law.

The new president will face a deeply polarized country, intensified tariff threats from the Trump administration, and a closer relationship between North Korea and Russia. The public is emotionally divided, and trust in democracy has declined, making uniting the nation a significant challenge for the incoming leader. </p>

The airport processed an average of 550 foreign arrivals every hour, making it the busiest international terminal. Wait times for non-citizens peaked at an average of 113 minutes during Labor Day weekend, with one passenger waiting over four hours. Customs and Border Protection attributes the delays to exponential growth in arrivals post-COVID and overlapping long-haul flights. </p>

          <p>The U.S. office market has reached an inflection point, with more office space being removed through demolitions and conversions than added through new construction for the first time in at least 25 years. CBRE Group data indicates that 23.3 million square feet of office space is slated for demolition or conversion, while only 12.7 million square feet of new space is projected to be completed. This net reduction is expected to lower the vacancy rate and benefit building owners. The shift is driven by the rise in remote work, but the market is starting to recover with increased office-leasing activity and stabilizing rents. (not investment advice)</p>
