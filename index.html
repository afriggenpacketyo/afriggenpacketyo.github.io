          <p>Acclaimed German filmmaker Werner Herzog, now 82, reflects on his six-decade career, known for its exploration of extreme subjects and dream-like visuals.

          <p>In the week following the U.S. military strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, the Trump administration has provided shifting descriptions of the mission's success. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the sites were "obliterated," a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report suggested the attack only set back Iran's program by a matter of months. Officials also appeared to shift the primary goal, later emphasizing that achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel was a key victory.</p>
