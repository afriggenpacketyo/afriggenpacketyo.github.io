          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating earnings, falling to $9.64 billion due to a significant decrease in insurance-underwriting profit, which was impacted by Southern California wildfires. The conglomerate also cited a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange as the dollar weakened. Warren Buffett warned that tariffs may further impact profits, adding uncertainty to the company's outlook. Despite these challenges, Berkshire's cash pile grew to a record $347 billion as the company continued its defensive strategy of selling stocks, reducing its holdings in Apple and Bank of America.

          <p>Several German states are considering banning smartphones in schools, with one high school in North Rhine-Westphalia already trialing the initiative. The pilot program, called "Smart without your phone," requires students to keep their smartphones turned off and stored away during the school day, including recess. Teachers have reported that students are more relaxed and less distracted during lessons. Research suggests that smartphone bans can also reduce cyberbullying and increase social wellbeing among students.</p>

          <p>Arwa Mahdawi discusses the tragic death of Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, and the conspiracy theories that have emerged.

The article critiques society's attitudes toward women and the protection of powerful predators. Mahdawi notes that five years after Epstein's death, only Ghislaine Maxwell has faced real consequences, blaming misogyny for the lack of justice.</p>
