          <h2>India Becomes Top Smartphone Exporter to U.S., Surpassing China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 02:12:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the United States, accounting for 44% of U.S. imports in the second quarter, a significant jump from 13% the previous year. This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. While Apple has increased production in India, it still relies on China's established infrastructure for its premium models. The trend reflects a broader move by global manufacturers to diversify supply chains, with Vietnam also exporting more smartphones to the U.S. than China in the same period.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old gunman from Las Vegas opened fire in a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, killing four people, including an NYPD officer, before taking his own life. The attacker, identified as Shane Tamura, used an assault-style rifle in the lobby and on the 33rd floor of the building on Park Avenue, which houses the NFL headquarters. The slain officer, Didarul Islam, was praised as a hero for his sacrifice while working a security detail. A fifth person was critically injured, and police are investigating the motive, noting the suspect had a history of mental health issues.</p>

          <p>Ryne Sandberg, the Hall of Fame second baseman for the Chicago Cubs, has passed away at the age of 65 following a battle with metastatic prostate cancer. Remembered as one of the best all-around players of his era, Sandberg was a 10-time All-Star, a nine-time Gold Glove winner, and the 1984 National League MVP. He spent 15 years with the Cubs, where his number 23 was retired and a statue was erected in his honor outside Wrigley Field. The baseball community is mourning the loss of a player celebrated for his integrity, grit, and dedication to the game.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire outside the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada, killing three people and wounding three others before being shot and arrested by police. The shooting occurred in the morning at the casino's valet parking area, where the suspect, who had no known connection to the victims, began firing a handgun. The swift response from a casino security guard and police officers is credited with preventing the gunman from entering the hotel and causing further harm.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines fell by over 8% after the company announced a 59% decline in its first-quarter net profit, attributing the drop to lower interest income and losses from its associates. A significant factor in the poor performance was the financial drag from Air India, in which SIA holds a 25.1% stake. Analysts note that Air India's losses were deeper than expected and are likely to continue affecting SIA's bottom line in the near term. While demand for air travel remains strong, the airline faces normalizing profit margins and weaker cargo demand amid a volatile operating environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and bribery, marking the first time a former head of state in the country has been convicted of a crime. The case stemmed from an investigation into Uribe's alleged links to right-wing paramilitary groups, during which he was found to have conspired to influence the testimony of imprisoned former fighters. Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, remains a polarizing figure credited by some for stabilizing the country but accused by others of human rights abuses. He faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate and looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy for parents. The policy will provide families with 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three. This move follows various local initiatives and comes as China faces a shrinking and rapidly aging population, despite abolishing its one-child policy nearly a decade ago. The high cost of raising children is considered a major deterrent for many couples, and this nationwide handout aims to alleviate some of that financial pressure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued new guidance affirming that federal employees have the right to religious expression in the workplace, including attempting to persuade colleagues about their religious beliefs. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can display religious items, hold communal prayers, and engage in polite religious discussions. However, it also notes that employees must stop if a colleague requests them to do so and that such expression cannot be harassing. The policy has drawn criticism from groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who argue it unconstitutionally encourages workplace evangelizing.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan and humanitarian aid efforts for Gaza. The move follows Starmer's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, where he presented the proposal developed with France and Germany. The plan aims to provide immediate relief and create a pathway toward a two-state solution. This comes amid growing domestic pressure on the UK government, with over 140 Labour MPs signing a letter urging the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a formal misconduct complaint against federal Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the Trump administration's deportation policies. The complaint alleges that Judge Boasberg made improper public comments suggesting the administration would disregard court rulings, thereby undermining judicial integrity. This action follows Boasberg's order to block deportation flights to a controversial prison in El Salvador, an order the administration allegedly ignored. The complaint seeks an investigation and the reassignment of the case, highlighting a significant clash between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <p>School districts nationwide are facing the potential loss of crucial mental health resources due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of millions of dollars in federal grants. The Department of Education cited concerns that the funds were used for 'race-based actions,' a claim disputed by service providers who now face laying off counselors and social workers. With a severe shortage of child mental health professionals, particularly in rural areas, these cuts could leave many students without access to necessary support. Sixteen states are now suing the administration over the funding cuts.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after video of his violent arrest by immigration agents in Florida went public, during which an officer told him, 'You got no rights here.' Kenny Laynez, who was born and raised in the U.S., was detained during a traffic stop while with his mother and undocumented co-workers. The incident has drawn heavy scrutiny, with advocates linking it to Florida's expansion of state and local law enforcement's role in immigration crackdowns. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated the individuals resisted arrest but did not mention that a citizen had been detained.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is drawing mixed reactions, with some experts arguing it is an 'unbalanced deal' that will harm the EU's economy. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports while eliminating tariffs on American goods exported to the EU. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for U.S. manufacturers and farmers, some analysts predict it will reduce the EU's GDP. Despite the new tariffs, the pact provides some relief from uncertainty, as the alternative could have been even higher levies threatened by the president. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland provided invaluable, direct access to the American leader, though it came with political risks. The meeting, which included a freewheeling, hour-long press Q&A, saw the two leaders discuss topics ranging from Gaza to Scottish independence. For Starmer, the face time helps solidify a key international relationship, but it also requires careful navigation of Trump's unpredictable style. Downing Street views the access as crucial and is pleased with what it sees as an alignment of views on the urgent need for humanitarian aid in Gaza.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking to play this season after the organization denied his waiver request for a final year of eligibility. Wingfield, a transfer player, is challenging the NCAA's 'Five-Year Rule,' arguing its denial is anticompetitive and robs him of a significant NIL opportunity and career enhancement. His collegiate career was disrupted by the pandemic and a season-ending injury. The lawsuit follows similar successful legal challenges by other athletes and puts Wingfield's future, as well as the stability of USC's thin offensive line, in the hands of a federal judge.</p>
