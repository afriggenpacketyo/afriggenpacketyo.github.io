          <p>Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is responding to President Trump's demand for his resignation over alleged conflicts of interest related to his business ties in China. In a public letter, Tan stated he is engaging with the administration to correct misinformation and defended his record, asserting he has always operated with the highest legal and ethical standards. The accusations were amplified by Senator Tom Cotton, but Tan affirmed he has the full support of Intel's board and remains committed to advancing U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has issued a 14-day temporary restraining order, pausing construction at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention center. The order responds to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, which argues the project violates federal environmental laws by threatening sensitive wetlands without proper review. This legal challenge is separate from another lawsuit by civil rights groups concerning the violation of detainees' constitutional rights. The ruling temporarily stops activities like paving and fencing but does not affect detainees currently held at the facility.</p>

The strategy also includes offering alternative assets like private credit in retirement plans, aiming to capture more market share in a fragmented but growing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revoking a 2009 "endangerment finding" that underpins greenhouse gas regulations for vehicles. If enacted, this change would ease emissions standards, reducing the regulatory pressure on automakers to produce electric vehicles. Experts suggest this would give manufacturers more flexibility to align their vehicle production with actual consumer demand, which has recently slowed for EVs. However, the move is likely to face legal challenges, and carmakers' long-term product plans, which involve significant EV investment, would not change overnight.</p>

CEO Jonathan Neman described the past quarter as "really, really rough," acknowledging that both external economic pressures and internal execution problems contributed to the poor performance and missed earnings estimates.

          <p>Footwear company Crocs announced it will reduce orders for the second half of the year, as its CEO described the consumer spending environment as "concerning." The company noted that consumers are behaving cautiously with discretionary purchases and that retail partners are reducing their future orders in response. This warning, coupled with a weaker-than-expected forecast, caused Crocs' shares to drop nearly 30%, marking the stock's worst day in over a decade. The company is now implementing cost-saving measures to protect its profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's ambitious "Golden Dome" missile defense plan, envisioned as a successor to Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, remains shrouded in secrecy. Despite a major space and missile defense symposium, the Pentagon has barred officials from publicly discussing the project, leading to questions about its scope, cost, and feasibility. Critics in the article argue that the concept may be flawed, as it appears to misunderstand the vast difference between a regional system like Israel's Iron Dome and a continental shield against intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>

          <p>A High Court in Pretoria, South Africa, has ordered that the body of former Zambian President Edgar Lungu be repatriated to Zambia for a state funeral. Lungu's family had opposed the move, wishing for him to be buried in South Africa due to political tensions between the former president and his successor, Hakainde Hichilema. However, the court ruled that the state's right to honor a former head of state with a state funeral takes precedence over the personal wishes of the family.</p>

The company stated that the measures were necessary to address multi-million pound losses caused by a customer shift to online shopping and rising operational costs. The restructuring will also result in approximately 110 job losses at its head office.</p>

This move distances the club from promoting tourism for the Rwandan government while maintaining a presence in the country.</p>
