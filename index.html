          <h2>Trump Announces Plans for "Golden Dome" Missile Defense System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 17:06:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump unveiled plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, allocating an initial $25 billion towards the project with an estimated total cost of $175 billion. The system aims to protect the United States from foreign missile threats using next-generation technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. Trump stated that the system should be fully operational before the end of his term, with involvement from multiple American defense and technology companies in states like Alaska, Florida, Georgia, and Indiana. The system is inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, but is designed to combat a wider range of threats, including hypersonic weapons and fractional orbital bombardment systems.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court temporarily lifted sanctions against Maine Republican Rep. Laurel Libby, who was sanctioned for posting an unblurred picture of a transgender high school athlete on Facebook. The sanction stripped Libby of her right to vote on legislation, effectively disenfranchising her constituents. The court's decision, with Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissenting, emphasized the importance of legislators' freedom of speech, drawing parallels to a 1966 case involving a Georgia lawmaker sanctioned for opposing the Vietnam War. The ruling underscores the protection of offensive speech under the First Amendment, though the case originated from Libby's decision to target a high school student.</p>

          <p>Ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas in Qatar have reached a standstill due to a "fundamental gap" in their objectives, according to the Qatari prime minister. Hamas seeks a comprehensive deal to end the war and release all hostages, while Israel is pursuing a partial agreement that could lead to a broader resolution. Amid the stalled talks, the Israel Defense Forces have initiated a new "extensive ground operation" in northern and southern Gaza. This escalation has drawn condemnation from international leaders, including those of the United Kingdom, France, and Canada, who urge Israel to halt military operations and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus during a Senate hearing, stating that it is a constitutional right for the president to remove people from the country. This statement was made during a hearing where Noem was questioned about the agency's campaign of detentions and deportations. Noem's remarks drew criticism, with Senator Maggie Hassan clarifying that habeas corpus is a foundational right distinguishing free societies from police states. The White House previously suggested suspending habeas corpus for migrants, claiming it can be suspended during an invasion.</p>

          <p>Former President Biden's recent diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer has raised questions about the effectiveness of current screening guidelines. Experts note that even with regular PSA testing, aggressive prostate cancers can develop rapidly and go undetected. Guidelines recommend against screening for men over 70, but many continue testing in consultation with their doctors. The PSA test is not foolproof, and some fast-growing cancers may not release the protein it detects. Overestimation of the PSA's power as a diagnostic tool and potential side effects of treatment contribute to cautious screening recommendations.</p>

The settlement totals £200 million, with £100 million earmarked for consumers who have until the end of the year to claim.

          <p>An unlikely coalition, including the Trump administration, environmental groups, and men's rights influencers, is coalescing around efforts to restrict the weedkiller atrazine, which has been linked to cancer, birth defects, and low sperm counts. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. aims to highlight the harms of pesticides like atrazine in an upcoming report. This coalition faces opposition from the agricultural and chemicals lobby, which has historically resisted attempts to strengthen restrictions on atrazine. The showdown is part of a broader battle over pesticide regulation.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for Syria's transitional authorities to be supported, warning that the country could be only weeks away from "potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions". At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he defended President Donald Trump's decision last week to lift sanctions on Syria before meeting President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December. Trump's rationale was that other countries wanted to help Sharaa's administration and send aid but were afraid of the sanctions, Rubio explained.</p>

However, the FDA will now require vaccine manufacturers to conduct additional large studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines for children and younger healthy adults.

          <p>Google is taking a significant step in artificial intelligence by introducing interactive capabilities to its flagship search engine. The new feature, called A.I. Mode, functions like a chatbot, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and receive comprehensive answers. This move is part of a broader effort to integrate A.I. into Google's products, including personalized email replies and automated shopping tools. With A.I. Mode, Google is attempting to disrupt its traditional search business before competitors can, while also navigating antitrust pressures and concerns from web publishers.</p>
