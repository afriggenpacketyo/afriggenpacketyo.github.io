          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is facing criticism after informing its regional children’s health coordinators that they will be fired or reassigned. These coordinators, who work closely with schools and institutions to address environmental hazards affecting young people, are being targeted because their job descriptions include work on environmental justice and diversity, equity, and inclusion. This decision has sparked concern among former EPA officials and public health experts, who worry about the impact on children's health protection efforts, particularly regarding issues like wildfire smoke, lead abatement, and pesticide use in schools.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv that resulted in at least 12 deaths and 90 injuries, former President Trump issued a public statement urging Russian President Putin to stop the attacks. The assault, the deadliest on the Ukrainian capital since last summer, caused widespread damage and forced thousands to seek shelter in the city's subway system. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy reported that nearly 70 missiles and 150 attack drones targeted cities across the country, with Kyiv bearing the brunt of the assault.</p>

          <p>Executives from Amazon and Nvidia have stated that the demand for artificial intelligence data centers remains strong, dismissing concerns about a potential slowdown due to recession fears. Amazon's VP of global data centers, Kevin Miller, noted that they are seeing very strong demand and expect the numbers to continue increasing. Nvidia's senior director of corporate sustainability, Josh Parker, echoed this sentiment, stating that they haven't seen a pullback. The executives were speaking at a conference in Oklahoma City focused on addressing the growing energy needs of AI, with a consensus forming around the need for natural gas to meet these demands.</p>

          <p>This article explores the growing trend of mental health days for students and the debate surrounding their effectiveness. While proponents argue that these days can destigmatize mental illness and provide necessary breaks for stressed students, some school officials worry that they may encourage absenteeism and hinder academic progress. Experts suggest that mental health days should be used as preventative tools, planned in advance, and incorporated with calming activities, rather than as a means of avoiding anxiety-inducing situations. The article also highlights the importance of addressing underlying issues contributing to student stress and creating supportive school environments.</p>

          <p>March saw a significant drop in home sales, reaching the slowest pace since 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Despite a rise in available listings, the market remains lean, with a 4-month supply.

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, revealed that saying 'please' and 'thank you' to AI chatbots costs the company millions of dollars in electricity. Every request made to a chatbot incurs costs in terms of energy and server usage, with additional words increasing the expense. While it may seem trivial, the cumulative effect of polite prompts adds up, highlighting the resource-intensive nature of AI interactions. Despite the cost, Altman suggests the expenditure is worthwhile, perhaps indicating an investment in user experience or future AI behavior.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man, Joseph Kling, is facing arson charges in connection to a wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, that has consumed over 15,000 acres. Authorities allege that Kling started a bonfire that was not properly extinguished, leading to the blaze. The fire, which started in Waretown, spread into Lacey Township and destroyed a commercial building. The wildfire is approximately 50% contained and is expected to burn for several days, prompting air quality concerns in New York City.</p>

          <p>The China Coast Guard (CCG) reportedly landed on Sandy Cay, a disputed reef in the South China Sea also claimed by the Philippines, to assert sovereignty. According to Chinese media, CCG officers unfurled a Chinese flag on the uninhabited sand bank and conducted inspections, collecting video evidence of alleged illegal activities by the Philippines. China asserts its "indisputable sovereignty" over the Spratly Islands, including Sandy Cay, and its adjacent waters. This action escalates tensions in the region, where China has been building artificial islands and military bases.</p>

          <p>As extreme weather events increase, home batteries are becoming more popular, offering backup power during outages and potential savings on utility bills. Companies like BioLite and Copper are developing user-friendly home battery solutions and appliances with built-in batteries that can store energy when it's cheap and discharge it when it's expensive. Connecting solar panels to these batteries allows for even greater energy independence and the opportunity to sell excess energy back to the grid. While the initial investment can be significant, the benefits of backup power and potential cost savings are driving the home battery revolution.</p>
