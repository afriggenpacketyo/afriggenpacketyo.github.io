          <p>The article analyzes Israel's attacks on Iran, suggesting that beyond the stated goal of neutralizing Iran's nuclear program, a broader aim of regime change in Tehran exists.  The unprecedented strikes are seen as potentially triggering a chain reaction leading to unrest and the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. However, this is considered a gamble, as there's no guarantee of a popular uprising, and potential outcomes range from increased Iranian confrontation to chaotic regime collapse. The article discusses the fragmented Iranian opposition and the uncertainty surrounding potential alternative leadership.</p>
