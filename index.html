          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, fulfilling a campaign promise to provide school choice for Texas families. The program allows parents to use public funds to pay for private school tuition, home-schooling, and virtual learning programs, with families receiving up to $10,000 per year, and children with disabilities qualifying for as much as $30,000. Supporters argue that it will give parents more options, while critics contend that it will pull resources from public schools and subsidize private education for wealthier families. The program is capped at $1 billion for the first year and could cost up to $4.5 billion per year by 2030.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has outlawed Malta's 'golden passport' scheme, the last of its kind in the EU, deeming it a mere 'commercial transaction' that undermines EU solidarity. The court ruled that granting citizenship based on investment, rather than a genuine link to the country, is unacceptable. While Malta claims the scheme generated significant revenue for charitable causes, critics argue that citizenship should not have a price tag. Despite the ban, 'golden visa' programs offering residence permits for investment remain prevalent in the EU, raising concerns about security and money laundering risks.</p>

          <p>For Vietnam's legion of factory workers, the mathematics of making a living was complicated enough before President Trump announced a whopping tariff on the goods they make. Fear is reverberating on her factory floor, alive with the hum of sewing machines stitching the fabric for shoes that are shipped to the United States. Mr. Trump paused the tariff on Vietnam, and similar levies on dozens of other countries, for 90 days. But it hardly matters here. The destabilizing prospect that the tariffs will be reinstated is already chipping away at Vietnam’s economic growth, which hinges on making things for American consumers.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's manufacturing sector, heavily reliant on U.S. demand, faces uncertainty as President Trump considers imposing a 46% tariff on imports from the country. The potential tariff has created anxiety among factory workers and managers, with some factories already cutting jobs or freezing hiring due to canceled orders from American retailers. Vietnamese leaders have offered to reduce tariffs on American imports to zero and requested a meeting with Trump to negotiate a deal. The situation is particularly precarious for textile and garment factories, which operate on thin profit margins and face pressure from U.S. customers to lower prices.</p>
