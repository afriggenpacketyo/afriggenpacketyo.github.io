            <p>Following a major cyberattack on UnitedHealth Group's Change Healthcare unit in 2024, the company offered no-interest loans to medical practices to help with cash flow. Now, UnitedHealth is aggressively seeking repayment, demanding some practices return hundreds of thousands of dollars within days. Doctors say they are unable to meet these demands, especially after suffering revenue losses due to the cyberattack. UnitedHealth defends its actions, stating that services have been restored and they are following a similar approach to a HHS cyber-attack lending program, while doctors feel betrayed after the initial promise that repayment would only be required once their cash flow normalized.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Maryland has ordered the Department of Justice to provide daily updates on its efforts to secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The Supreme Court upheld the judge's directive to "facilitate and effectuate the return" of Abrego Garcia after the DOJ admitted the deportation was an administrative error. The judge expressed frustration with the DOJ's lack of information and transparency regarding Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and the steps being taken to bring him back. The DOJ claims that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, which his lawyers deny.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that his agency will determine the cause of the rising autism rates by September, launching a research effort involving scientists worldwide. President Trump supports this initiative, speculating that the cause could be linked to something people are consuming or being exposed to. Experts emphasize that rising rates are likely due to better awareness and broader diagnostic criteria, while cautioning against focusing solely on debunked theories like vaccine links, especially as measles outbreaks occur in unvaccinated communities. Despite past comments, Kennedy now encourages vaccination but believes it shouldn't be mandated.</p>

            <p>Shakira's hit song "La Tortura," featuring Alejandro Sanz, recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. Released in 2005, the song marked a return to Spanish-language music for Shakira after her successful English crossover. The song's infectious rhythm and music video, which was one of the first Spanish-language videos to air on U.S. channels, helped solidify its place as a Latin pop classic. The song's themes of betrayal and revenge continue to resonate with audiences, especially in light of Shakira's recent personal experiences, and she is currently performing the song on her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran world tour.</p>

            <p>The IRS is urging taxpayers to file returns on time and pay as much as they can, even if they cannot cover the total tax balance by the April 15 deadline. Options are available for the remaining taxes owed, including payment plans and extensions. Tax filers can file a tax extension by April 15, which pushes the federal filing deadline to Oct. 15, but it's an extension to file, not an extension to pay. Military personnel stationed abroad or in combat zones may qualify for certain automatic extensions.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is dismantling the legacy of HIV prevention by cutting funding and programs, reversing previous progress toward ending the epidemic. Researchers and activists describe the actions as vindictive and damaging to public health principles. The cuts affect research grants, clinical trials, and support for LGBTQ populations, and they threaten the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Experts fear that these cuts could lead to millions of new infections and deaths globally and compromise the U.S.'s ability to track and contain outbreaks domestically.</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent tariff actions and comments from economic advisor Stephen Miran suggest a potential strategy to reshape the global economic order. Miran has criticized the U.S. dollar's role as the international reserve currency, arguing it strengthens the dollar and hurts American exports. He has proposed a "Mar-A-Lago Accord" to reform the international economic system and compensate the U.S. for the dollar's special role. Economists debate whether the dollar's reserve status is a privilege or a burden, and some believe Trump's tariffs are a bargaining chip for a new global economic order.</p>

            <p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 4.5% after a steep weekly rise, driven by President Trump's trade moves causing investors to sell U.S. assets. This marks a reversal from the traditional safe-haven status of Treasurys, with speculation that China and Japan are selling them amid trade tensions. The White House is monitoring the bond market closely, with officials suggesting that the yield spike contributed to the decision to pause tariffs on most countries. (not investment advice)</p>
