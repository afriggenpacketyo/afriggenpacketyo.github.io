          <p>The U.S. government has lifted its export controls on chip-design software for China, a move communicated to major industry players including Siemens EDA, Synopsys, and Cadence. These companies, which dominate the electronic design automation (EDA) market, had been required to obtain licenses for such exports since May. Following the reversal, the firms announced they are resuming full access, sales, and support to their Chinese customers. This decision is viewed as a sign of a potential trade truce, coming after China also signaled progress in resuming some technology and rare earth exchanges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated surprising strength in June, adding 147,000 nonfarm payrolls, surpassing the forecast of 110,000. This resilience was largely driven by a significant increase in government hiring, particularly at the state and local levels. The unemployment rate also unexpectedly fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, although this was partly due to a decrease in the labor force participation rate. These robust figures have led market analysts to conclude that a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July is now highly unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and fourteen others wounded. The incident occurred late Wednesday night when occupants of a dark SUV opened fire on a crowd outside the Artis Lounge nightclub. The crowd was reportedly leaving an album release party for a local rapper at the time of the attack. Police are investigating the drive-by shooting and are searching for three suspects, with no arrests made yet. This location was also the site of a previous mass shooting in November 2022 when it operated under a different name.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid shifting economic conditions, including higher interest rates and healthcare costs, financial experts advise seniors to re-evaluate their life insurance policies. Key questions to consider include whether coverage is still necessary, what type of policy is most suitable, and if current plans align with estate goals. Professionals suggest that while needs may change from income replacement to covering final expenses or legacy planning, life insurance remains a crucial tool. They recommend reviewing beneficiaries, considering trust structures, and comparing different policy types like term and whole life to ensure adequate and appropriate financial protection for their families.

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries conducted a marathon speech on the House floor, speaking for over four hours to delay a vote on President Trump's major tax and spending bill. Using a procedural tactic known as the "magic minute," Jeffries vehemently criticized the legislation, calling it an "immoral document" and an "assault on healthcare." He focused on the bill's projected negative impact on programs like Medicaid and SNAP, sharing personal stories of constituents who would be affected. His protest highlighted the deep partisan divide over the bill, which Democrats argue will harm vulnerable Americans while benefiting the wealthy.</p>

          <p>A new survey by Generation Lab for CNBC indicates that young Americans are surprisingly open to working in the office, with a majority preferring at least three days a week on-site. The study of nearly 18,000 young adults found that after compensation, career development and company culture are more important than remote work flexibility. While not committed to long-term company loyalty, they value regular, in-person feedback from managers. The survey also revealed negative perceptions of major tech companies like Tesla and Meta, and strong support for DEI initiatives, though most prefer to avoid discussing politics at work.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market remained solid in June with the addition of 147,000 jobs, a figure that suggests the Federal Reserve will not be rushed into cutting interest rates. While overall hiring was strong, driven by healthcare and government, the manufacturing sector showed notable weakness, shedding 7,000 jobs for the second consecutive month. A recent Institute for Supply Management report indicates that factory activity has been shrinking, with many factory managers blaming President Trump's import tariffs for a collapse in orders.

          <p>The cost of U.K. government borrowing has fallen, partially reversing a spike that occurred after Chancellor Rachel Reeves became emotional during a parliamentary session. The yield on 10-year government bonds decreased after Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly backed the chancellor, stating they work "in lockstep." The initial market panic, which saw bond yields rise and the pound fall, was driven by fears that Reeves might resign, potentially leading to a loss of fiscal discipline. The subsequent market stabilization suggests investors were reassured by the demonstration of political stability and support for the chancellor's fiscal policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the American tradition of setting off fireworks for the Fourth of July, blending personal memories with a humorous exploration of the modern pyrotechnics industry. The author recounts past experiences with his father and embarks on a quest to legally set off a large cache of consumer-grade fireworks on a beach in Maine. The journey reveals a complex web of state and local regulations that complicates this seemingly simple goal. The article humorously catalogues the vast, patriotically and pop-culture-themed fireworks available, ultimately celebrating the simple, chaotic joy of the holiday.</p>

          <p>A congressional analysis by the Joint Economic Committee's Democratic arm suggests that Americans are paying more for their Fourth of July cookouts due to President Trump's tariffs. The report found that the cost of a typical barbeque has increased at a 12.7% annualized rate since the tariffs were announced in April. Prices for items like beer, both domestic and imported, have seen significant increases, which the report links to tariffs on aluminum. The analysis also tracked price hikes on popular cookout gear like folding chairs and grill accessories sold on Amazon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite deciding a historically low number of merits cases, the Supreme Court has been exceptionally busy with its emergency docket, a trend that has largely benefited President Donald Trump. An analysis shows that the president has frequently used this "shadow docket" to seek review of lower court decisions on an accelerated timeline, with the majority of rulings going in his favor. This practice allows for significant assertions of executive power to be approved without the full briefing and argumentation of a regular case. The article suggests this has become a key mechanism for expanding presidential power.</p>

The council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing laws and the risk of jeopardizing prosecutions.

The new laws streamline the construction of multifamily housing in urban areas by exempting them from parts of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). This move represents a philosophical shift away from an anti-development stance that has historically constrained building and driven up costs. By prioritizing material abundance over the objections of some allied interest groups, California Democrats have shown a willingness to tackle a major crisis directly.</p>
