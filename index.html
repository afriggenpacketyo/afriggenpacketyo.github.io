          <p>President Trump has signed an order to deploy 2,000 National Guard members in response to protests in Los Angeles over federal immigration enforcement. The White House stated that the move is necessary due to violent clashes between protesters and ICE officers during deportation operations. Vice President JD Vance described the protesters as "insurrectionists" carrying foreign flags. Trump spent Saturday night attending an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in New Jersey, while the situation in Los Angeles continues to unfold.</p>

The removals came hours after Musk made other posts critical of the president. Trump dismissed Musk's claims in an interview, calling them "old news." Vice President JD Vance said Musk's accusation is "absolutely not" true, and added that he hopes Musk "comes back into the fold."</p>
