          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth test flight of the Starship megarocket, aiming to achieve orbit and test payload deployment. While the launch and initial ascent were successful, an apparent propellant leak led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin. This resulted in an uncontrolled reentry, with SpaceX expecting the vehicle to mostly burn up over the Indian Ocean. Despite the setback, SpaceX considers the test valuable for gathering data to improve Starship's reliability for future missions to Mars and beyond.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a full pardon for Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of "Chrisley Knows Best," who were convicted three years ago of evading taxes and defrauding banks of over $30 million. The pardon follows their daughter Savannah Chrisley's public support of Trump and claims that her parents were victims of a weaponized justice system, similar to the former president's own grievances. The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 of financial fraud and tax evasion, with Todd receiving a 12-year sentence and Julie a seven-year sentence. Their lawyer argued that their conviction exemplified the weaponization of justice against conservatives.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk voiced his disappointment with the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" supported by President Trump, stating it increases the budget deficit and undermines efforts to improve government efficiency. Musk, who previously stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), criticized the bill's $3.8 trillion deficit increase by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The legislation includes extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, border security spending, and changes to Medicaid and clean energy tax credits. Musk suggests the bill cannot be both "big" and "beautiful."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed US embassies to halt scheduling new student visa appointments while preparing to expand social media screening for applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a memo stating the pause would last until further guidance is provided, citing significant implications for embassies and consulates due to increased vetting. This action comes amid Trump's criticism of elite colleges, accusing them of left-wing bias and enabling antisemitism, leading to frozen funding and potential deportation of students. A federal judge has blocked a measure that revoked Harvard's ability to enroll international students, a policy that could severely impact the university's funding.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The percentage of mothers rating their mental health as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù decreased, while those reporting ‚Äúpoor‚Äù or ‚Äúfair‚Äù mental health increased, particularly among single parents and those with uninsured children. Experts attribute this decline to factors like high housing and childcare costs, soaring food prices, and the disproportionate burden women carry at home. While the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issue, the decline predates it, highlighting broader systemic challenges.</p>

This decision has faced criticism from public health experts who argue that infants and pregnant women are at high risk of severe COVID-19 complications.

          <p>Six Flags Entertainment Corp. will eliminate approximately 135 positions across its California parks, including the president roles at Knott's Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain. This cost-cutting measure follows the $8 billion merger of Six Flags with Cedar Fair, aiming to streamline operations and reduce expenses by $120 million by year's end. The move reflects a shift towards a regional operating structure, impacting parks in Buena Park, Valencia, Vallejo, and Santa Clara. The company cited weather variability and economic uncertainty as factors contributing to a net loss in the first quarter.</p>

          <p>Nitrous oxide, commonly known as "laughing gas," is increasingly misused due to its euphoric effects and the rise of vaping, creating a dangerous addiction.

Meg Caldwell's death, attributed to a suspected nitrous overdose, highlights the dangers of its accessibility and legal status as a culinary product. While many states have outlawed recreational use, flavored nitrous oxide is still sold legally in smoke shops, packaged in colorful canisters, contributing to the rise in misuse.</p>

          <p>Tesco's introduction of AI-powered cameras at self-checkouts, designed to reduce shoplifting, has been met with mockery from shoppers who compare it to VAR technology in football. The cameras aim to detect unscanned items, showing a replay to customers, but some shoppers find the technology intrusive. This move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK in 2024. Some shoppers said they would not use self-checkouts anymore after the technology was introduced.</p>
