          <p>Jill Lepore's new book, "We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution," delves into the continuous struggle to amend and preserve America's foundational document as a dynamic framework for an evolving nation. The article highlights the Constitution as an "explosion of ideas" that, despite its origins on parchment and ink from natural sources, endures and changes over time, ingeniously accounting for the passage of time. Lepore argues that the document attempts to solve ancient problems related to the people and their rulers, governmental structure, and the nature of rights. This historical perspective underscores the Constitution's role as a living framework, adapting to societal needs while remaining the world's most influential and one of its oldest. The book emphasizes the ongoing dialogue and reinterpretation necessary for its survival.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University, with authorities identifying Tyler Robinson, 22, as the suspect now in custody. The article details the incident, where Kirk was shot in the neck while answering a question about mass shootings, and how Robinson's family friend ultimately alerted authorities. Evidence found near the scene included a high-powered rifle engraved with slogans, and a family member indicated Robinson believed Kirk was "full of hate and spreading hate." The shooting has triggered widespread shock and grief, with President Trump ordering flags flown at half-mast, and the event has laid bare deep polarizations within American politics, sparking debates over political violence.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound is significantly impacting the apparel industry, creating what some are calling the "Ozempic effect." Resale stores are reporting a surge in larger sizes and increased demand for smaller garments, prompting retailers to adjust inventory and even farm out plus-sized clothing production. The article notes that while the size curve is shifting, demand for inclusive sizing within the larger range remains, as these drugs reduce weight but not height. Fashion experts warn against prematurely scaling back plus-size offerings, emphasizing that a large segment of consumers remains underserved, and widespread drug adoption hinges on greater price accessibility.</p>

Apple's new AirPods Pro 3 feature Live Translation for several languages, enabling seamless, simultaneous two-way conversations, though it won't initially be available in the EU. Google's Pixel 10 offers Voice Translate for phone calls, uniquely preserving speaker voice inflections, while Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses provide transcribed translations on a user's phone. These innovations, driven by generative AI, are poised to reshape communication and industries, with the article noting that translation jobs are among the most threatened by AI advancements.</p>

Sociologists argue that urban planners often overlook the importance of informal public spaces, like street markets, which provide "eyes on the streets" and deter crime.
