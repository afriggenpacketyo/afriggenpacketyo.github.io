          <p>President Trump defended his decision to accept a $400 million jumbo Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar, citing delays in Boeing's production of the new Air Force One fleet. Trump stated that the U.S. should have the most impressive plane, especially since other countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have more luxurious aircraft. He clarified that the jet is a gift to the Department of Defense for defending Qatar and will be retired to the presidential library once the new AF1 fleet is delivered. Trump emphasized that accepting the gift would save taxpayers money. The president was scheduled to visit Qatar as part of his Middle East trip.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were defeated 11-1 by the Oakland Athletics, despite extra-base hits from Michael Conforto and Chris Taylor. Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman struggled at the plate, going 0-for-9 combined. Starting pitcher Landon Knack failed to finish the fifth inning, allowing two home runs to Jacob Wilson. The Dodgers' rotation is currently plagued by injuries, with Roki Sasaki joining Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow on the injured list, making Clayton Kershaw's return on Saturday against the Angels highly anticipated. Kershaw's debut marks his 18th season with the Dodgers, tying a franchise record.</p>

          <p>Dr. Rosemary Coogan, a British astronaut with the European Space Agency (ESA), is undergoing rigorous training at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, to prepare for potential missions, including a possible lunar excursion. Her training involves simulated spacewalks in a giant pool containing a replica of the International Space Station (ISS), mimicking weightlessness. Coogan's journey to becoming an astronaut involved studying astrophysics after realizing that meeting astronauts at school career days was rare. ESA aims to send Coogan to the ISS by 2030, and with NASA's Artemis program planning a return to the Moon, she may have the opportunity to become the first Briton to walk on the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian refugees in Poland are reporting a rise in anti-Ukrainian sentiment, including abuse on public transport, bullying in schools, and online xenophobia. A 31-year-old Ukrainian mother shared how her daughter was told to "go back to Ukraine" and mocked for speaking Ukrainian at school. Activist Natalia Panchenko notes an increase in online abuse translating to real-life incidents, with Ukrainians facing xenophobic remarks in shops and hotels. A recent poll indicates a decline in Polish support for accepting Ukrainian refugees, falling from 81% to 50% in two years. This shift has become a political issue in Poland's presidential election campaign, with some candidates expressing anti-Ukrainian views.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reduced most of their recently imposed tariffs on each other's imports, suspending a portion of the reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade discussions in Switzerland. The U.S. lowered tariffs imposed under President Trump's second presidency to 30% from 145%, while China reduced retaliatory tariffs to 10% from 125%. Both countries will retain some tariffs and continue negotiations during the 90-day pause. China has agreed to suspend non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals.

          <p>Scientists have observed wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants to treat wounds and injuries, both on themselves and others. Researchers from the University of Oxford, working in the Budongo Forest, documented instances of chimps dabbing plants on wounds or chewing them and applying the material to injuries. This research builds on previous discoveries of chimps self-medicating with specific plants. The scientists also compiled decades of observations to create a catalog of how chimpanzees use forest plants for first aid. This study adds to growing evidence that primates use natural medicines to maintain health in the wild and demonstrates empathy among chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>Family offices are struggling to find qualified money managers despite rapid growth in the sector as ultra-rich individuals seek personalized wealth management services. By 2030, the number of family offices is expected to grow significantly, but a shortage of qualified advisors is anticipated. Trust is a key criterion for family offices, often prioritizing long-term relationships over expertise. Family offices also face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent. To attract and retain talent, some family offices are offering higher compensation packages, including bonuses and co-investment opportunities.</p>

Trump said the policy change would give Syria "a chance at greatness," while Syria's Foreign Minister hailed it as a "pivotal turning point." Al-Sharaa has called for the lifting of sanctions and the de-listing of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist organization.

This plan, which would be permanent, aims to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program and provide a more lasting solution than the 2015 nuclear deal.

China presents itself as a friendly alternative to the U.S. but continues to flex its power, warning other governments not to expect it to hold back on regional ambitions. The Chinese government remains on edge over Taiwan and sees no contradiction in its mix of economic incentives and territorial assertiveness.

          <p>In the recent Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan, weapons from China played a crucial role in Pakistan's defenses. China is Pakistan's biggest weapons supplier, accounting for 81% of its arms imports from 2020 to 2024. Key Chinese weapons used by Pakistan include the Chengdu J-10C Vigorous Dragon fighter jet, considered the most upgraded version of the J-10 series, equipped with advanced radar and compatible with Chinese missiles. The J-10C is a 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, indicating advanced capabilities but not quite as modern as fifth-generation fighters.</p>

          <p>Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary under President Biden, suggested that Biden's decision to run for a second term in 2024 might have been a mistake. When asked if the Democratic party would have been better off without Biden as the nominee, Buttigieg responded, "Maybe, you know, right now, with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that is the case." Buttigieg addressed concerns about Biden's cognitive decline, stating that he found Biden to be sharp and engaged during their time working together. This visit to Iowa fuels speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run for Buttigieg.</p>

          <p>As President Trump cuts funding for American research institutions and restricts immigration, other countries are actively seeking to attract disenchanted U.S. researchers. Countries like Australia and those within the European Union are offering financial incentives and promoting their social safety nets to lure talent. While salaries in Europe may be lower, factors like free healthcare and education can compensate. A poll indicated that a significant number of Ph.D. and postdoctoral students in the U.S. are considering leaving due to the Trump administration's policies. These countries see this as a unique opportunity to reverse the brain drain and strengthen their own research sectors.</p>

The decision was influenced by their work in prison, including educational courses and programs to improve inmates' lives.

          <p>President Trump's repeated descriptions of U.S. mediation efforts between India and Pakistan have strained relations with India, particularly regarding his claims about trade incentives and threats. India directly contradicted Trump's assertions, stating that trade was not discussed during the negotiations. India is concerned about being perceived as halting the conflict under outside pressure. The U.S. messaging, which equated India and Pakistan and offered to mediate on Kashmir, was seen as problematic. The situation has led some to question India's closer relationship with the U.S.</p>
