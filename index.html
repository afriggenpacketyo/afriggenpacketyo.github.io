        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Initially, Donald Trump offered a compassionate response to Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis, but he quickly reverted to his typical behavior, promoting a conspiracy theory about Biden's health and comparing him to a corpse. Trump attacked Biden's time in office and falsely suggested that Biden hid the diagnosis while in office, conflating the Gleason score with Biden's stage four cancer. Others in Trump's circle made unsavory comments, mocking Jill Biden and combining the autopen theory with Republican criticisms of her. Trump reposted a message that used disparaging language and accused Biden of being cognitively impaired. </p>

          <p>A recent survey by Morning Consult indicates that favorable views of China have surpassed those of the United States globally between January and late April, a shift that marks a contrast from the previous year. The US's standing has diminished in 38 of the 41 markets tracked, with China's improving in 34, except for Russia, where the US saw a significant improvement since Trump's return to office. Sixteen countries switched from pro-US to pro-China during the surveyed period, and the report attributes the shift to damage to America's reputation over the past few months. The survey included around 4,900 adults in 41 countries, excluding views from US and Chinese respondents about their own countries.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's move to legalise stablecoins is garnering attention from mainland institutions, with Citic Securities predicting a boom in tokenised real-world assets (RWA) in the city. Analysts suggest that stablecoins could help mainland companies roll out their RWA projects in Hong Kong by serving as stabilising tools to increase market liquidity. Citic Securities analysts believe the new law will also help Hong Kong develop interfaces for digital currency payment and settlement. The US Senate has also advanced its own bill called the Genius Act, which focuses on these assets.</p>

          <p>Washington's recent ban on Chinese labs testing consumer electronics bound for the US, deemed security risks, has raised concerns about law enforcement and potential price increases for American consumers. Analysts suggest that the impact on Chinese makers of phones and PCs could be limited, despite the US FCC's attempt to curtail China, which it considers an adversary. The FCC justified the move by citing Chinese labs' deep connections with the Communist Party and military, stating that these labs provide a gateway into the US telecommunications infrastructure. Some observers find enforcement difficult given the global nature of electronics component testing.</p>

The plant will continue to provide power to the regional grid while contributing to Meta's goal of 100% clean electricity, and the deal will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pared-down National Weather Service is grappling with severe staffing shortages as the Atlantic hurricane season begins, raising concerns among meteorologists that forecasts could suffer. Cuts stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending have led to the departure of about 550 workers from the Weather Service, including its National Hurricane Center and local forecast offices. NOAA plans to rehire about 100 employees, but understaffed local forecast offices are a major cause for alarm, as they may struggle to provide urgent messages about incoming storms. The Weather Service has updated service level standards to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources, but some fear burnout may be unavoidable.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine and Russia exchanged intensifying attacks and held a second round of negotiations, the Trump administration has remained notably quiet, signaling a shift in the U.S. approach toward mediating the conflict. President Trump had no immediate public reaction to Ukraine's drone strikes deep inside Russia just before Ukrainian and Russian delegations met in Istanbul. After the talks concluded without any major breakthrough, U.S. officials expressed disappointment but noted that President Trump's frustration with the lack of progress toward peace has been building. Ukraine has claimed that more than a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet was damaged or destroyed in the attacks, proving it can still inflict pain on Moscow despite being outgunned.</p>

Adams was disqualified after she sprayed her shoes with a fire extinguisher, alluding to her being on fire, after winning the 400 finals. Greene, who performed a similar celebration after winning the 100-meter dash at the 2004 Home Depot Invitational, stated that he would reinstate her if the celebration did not interfere with anyone. Adams' father believes the decision was racially motivated, as the celebration occurred away from her opponents, but the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) upheld the disqualification.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts a sharp economic slowdown in the U.S., with GDP growth sliding to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year, citing the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. The report states that new tariffs have hiked the effective tariff rate to 15.4% from 2% last year, the highest rate since 1938. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, these costs are expected to be passed onto consumers, leading the OECD to forecast that inflation in the U.S. will spike in mid-2025, reaching 3.9% by the end of 2025. The OECD also noted risks skewed to the downside, including a more substantial slowing of economic activity in the face of policy uncertainty.</p>

A recent report estimates that the protest has resulted in economic losses of over $4.79 billion, with key sectors like transportation, trade, and micro businesses taking the biggest hit.

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security announced the cancellation of Harvard’s eligibility to enroll international students, citing “fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus”. This action is seen as the latest salvo in Trump's long-standing animosity towards the university, stemming back to incidents such as Harvard's criticism of his travel ban in 2017. Harvard has responded with legal action, accusing the administration of violating the First Amendment with devastating effects on the university and its international students.</p>

          <p>Luang Prabang in northern Laos has seen economic success through tourism, becoming virtually free of poverty. The city attracted over 2 million visitors last year, generating some $560 million in revenue, and officials say that over 16,000 families have moved out of poverty. However, Laos still struggles to raise living standards, with nearly 17% of its families living in poverty as of 2023. Analysts warn that not all visitors bring new business to the local population, such as "zero-dollar" tour groups that only spend money in Chinese-associated businesses.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned that Donald Trump's tariffs are forecast to hurt global growth, including in the UK, which has had its growth forecasts trimmed.

Worldwide growth is now expected to slow to a "modest" 2.9%, down from a previous forecast of 3.1%. The group also slashed the outlook for the US economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and predicted growth would slow again in 2026.</p>

Mount Etna and its surroundings are home to a variety of animals, and volcanic soil is good for agriculture, with vineyards, olive groves, orchards, hazelnut and pistachio groves flourishing in the area.

          <p>Wildlife advocates are criticizing a Florida proposal for a three-week bear hunt in December that could result in the slaughter of almost 200 black bears. Opponents are calling it a trophy hunt based on bloodlust, not science, that would reintroduce outlawed practices including bear baiting, chasing, and cornering the animals with dogs. Critics argue that the FWC is using outdated data of bear numbers to justify the hunt and falsely insist the killings are necessary as a conservation measure. They also point to the debacle of the 2015 Florida hunt, where hunters massacred almost 10% of the state’s bear population within two days.</p>

Unlike the fossil-fuel problem, the land problem is worsening due to population growth and increased meat consumption. Producing enough calories to nourish the growing population without destroying carbon sinks will require new crops, new foods, new policies, and new behaviors, and it will be as monumental a challenge as ending oil.</p>
