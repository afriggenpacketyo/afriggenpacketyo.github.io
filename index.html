          <p>ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, disclosed internal data showing the median service length for its current employees is approximately three years. This revelation came during a company town hall meeting and appears to counter online speculation of much shorter employee retention periods. With a workforce of around 120,000, the figures suggest a relatively stable employment environment compared to the high turnover often associated with China's tech industry. The company notably shifted away from the demanding "996" work culture in 2021.</p>

          <p>President Trump ordered the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of a disappointing jobs report. The report indicated that only 73,000 jobs were added in the previous month and included significant downward revisions for May and June. Trump, without evidence, accused the commissioner of rigging the numbers for political reasons, a move that drew sharp criticism from economists and Democratic leaders. They warned that politicizing the agency undermines the credibility of crucial U.S. economic data.</p>

In a social media post, the secretary indicated a belief that a beneficial deal for both nations is achievable, attributing the positive direction to the relationship between the U.S. and Chinese presidents. While China's vice-minister of commerce suggested an extension of the current pause on new tariffs, the Trump administration has not yet confirmed this. The U.S. side appears to be taking a measured approach before announcing any new agreements.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, whose legal status and protection from deportation were set to expire. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the administration's decision was "preordained" and possibly motivated by racial animus, citing controversial statements by the President. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and has stated its intention to appeal.</p>

Compounding the weak number, the Labor Department substantially revised down job growth for May and June by a combined 258,000, indicating that hiring was much weaker than initially reported. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%.

This follows a similar ruling from the Ninth Circuit and multiple lower courts that have found the order unconstitutional.

However, the ruling did find one specific finance agreement to be "unfair" under the Consumer Credit Act due to a very large, undisclosed commission, which may set a precedent for similar cases.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner as a foolish, impulsive act rather than a calculated power grab. The author argues that Trump's lashing out at the unfavorable jobs report is rooted in a long-held, baseless conservative belief that economic data is manipulated for political purposes. The move is seen as illogical, as Trump simultaneously claims the economy is strong while demanding the Federal Reserve act as if it's weak. Ultimately, the piece concludes that such actions cannot fool voters, who judge the economy on their personal reality, but can dangerously undermine the institutions that guide policy.</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Use of Expedited Deportation for Legal Parolees</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who were legally paroled into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. The ruling could hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts, particularly an operation that involves arresting migrants at their court hearings for expedited removal. The judge noted the plaintiffs had "played by the rules" by entering with government permission and attending hearings, only to be targeted. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants, including many who entered under Biden-era policies, though the Justice Department is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karacsony, was questioned by police as a suspect for his role in organizing an LGBTQ pride march that the national government had banned. Despite the ban, which is part of a series of anti-LGBTQ measures by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, a record number of people attended the June event. Mayor Karacsony, a political opponent of Orban, defied the ban by organizing the march as a municipal event. He maintains his actions were justified, stating that "neither freedom nor love can be banned in Budapest," and plans to file a complaint against the accusation.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, this article suggests several strategic moves for savers considering long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). It advises savers to determine the maximum amount they can lock away for an extended period to take advantage of currently high, fixed rates. The piece also recommends using this period of rate stability to shop around for the best offers, particularly from online banks which often provide higher returns. Finally, it encourages a re-evaluation of where other savings are held, as moving funds from low-yield traditional accounts into higher-earning CDs could be beneficial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein have fiercely criticized the Trump administration following Ghislaine Maxwell's transfer to a less restrictive, minimum-security prison. In a joint statement, they described the move as "preferential treatment" and a "cover up," highlighting that it occurred after Maxwell met with a top Justice Department official who is also a former Trump lawyer. The victims expressed horror and outrage, stating the transfer sends a message that "pedophiles deserve preferential treatment." The move is particularly controversial as Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, is typically ineligible for a minimum-security facility without a special waiver.</p>

          <p>The article forecasts a period of relative stability for gold prices in August, after a year of significant increases. It suggests that several factors are contributing to a potential plateau around the current $3,300 per ounce mark. The Federal Reserve's decision to pause interest rate changes removes a major catalyst for price movement in either direction. Furthermore, with inflation readings and stock market performance sending mixed signals, the immediate demand for gold as a safe-haven asset may level off, leading to a period of price stagnation for the precious metal.

          <p>Businesses around the world are reacting with a mix of shock, uncertainty, and reluctant acceptance to the Trump administration's newly imposed tariffs on over 90 countries. While Mexico received a temporary reprieve, Canadian businesses expect costs to rise due to integrated supply chains. European leaders struck a deal for a 15% rate, but Italian farmers feel it's a "surrender," while Switzerland was unexpectedly hit with a 39% tariff. Brazil faces a steep 50% rate on many goods, and exporters in India and Laos are bracing for significant impacts, with many believing the ultimate cost will be passed to U.S. consumers.</p>

          <p>The European Union's highest court has dealt a significant blow to Italy's plan to process asylum seekers in offshore centers in Albania. The European Court of Justice ruled that Italy's method for designating a migrant's home country as "safe" for return violates EU law. This "safe country" concept is central to the fast-track processing system Italy intended to implement. The court stated that a country can only be deemed safe if protection is guaranteed for its entire population, a standard Italy's current list does not meet. This decision effectively halts the controversial plan until Italy revises its laws to comply.</p>
