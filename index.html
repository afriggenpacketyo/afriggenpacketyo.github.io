          <p>China has criticized President Trump's proposed Golden Dome missile defense system, arguing that it would escalate the risk of an arms race and potentially transform outer space into a battlefield. According to the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, the system would involve significant increases in outer space combat capabilities, violating the principle of peaceful use of outer space and undermining global strategic stability. Trump's plan involves a US$175 billion investment and aims to protect the United States from foreign attacks, including those from China and Russia. The US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has defended the plan as a necessary measure to safeguard national security.</p>

          <p>Target has revised its sales outlook for the year, citing weaker discretionary spending, uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and negative reactions to the company's reduction in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. First-quarter sales fell nearly 3%, missing Wall Street's expectations, with transactions and average customer spending also declining. CEO Brian Cornell acknowledged the company's struggles and committed to improving the shopping environment to regain market share, as Target gained or held market share in only 15 of the 35 merchandise categories it tracks. The retailer is also undergoing leadership changes and establishing an Enterprise Acceleration Office to streamline operations and boost growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the presence of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, marking the first such detection in the country. Fragments of the virus were found in Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023 as part of a research program. While the virus is widespread in Europe, officials emphasize that the risk to the general public is very low, with no evidence of spread in mosquitoes or people in the UK. Experts suggest that climate change is contributing to the expansion of mosquito-borne diseases into new areas, emphasizing the importance of mosquito control measures and personal protection.</p>

          <p>Americans with defaulted student loans are now subject to wage garnishment and other financial penalties as the Trump administration has restarted collections after a five-year pause. Over 5 million borrowers are in default, and an additional 4 million are delinquent, with the DOE projecting that 25% of student borrowers could default in the coming months. Lenders can garnish up to 15% of disposable pay without a court order, provided they give 60 days' notice, and can also seize tax refunds and Social Security benefits. Borrowers can avoid garnishment by enrolling in income-driven repayment plans or seeking loan rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced that Tesla plans to deploy robotaxis on the streets of Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with intentions to expand the service to Los Angeles and San Francisco thereafter. The Tesla robotaxi service will initially consist of approximately 10 vehicles in Austin, with potential for rapid expansion if the launch proceeds smoothly. These robotaxis will be Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, known as FSD Unsupervised. Musk has been promising fully self-driving cars for years, though Tesla's current vehicles still require human supervision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed tax cuts are intensifying concerns among bond investors regarding the national debt and deficit, potentially leading to higher interest rates on various types of debt. Investors were already wary of Trump's tariff policies, and the new tax cuts have heightened anxieties, causing the 10-year Treasury yield to rise above 4.5% and the 30-year yield to exceed 5%. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, cautioned that volatility in the Treasury market could increase economic uncertainty. The bond market's reaction could influence Washington's decisions, but analysts suggest a significant spike in yields would be needed to impose fiscal discipline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Official data reveals that the UK inflation rate has climbed to 3.5% in April, the highest in over a year, primarily driven by increases in household bills such as water, gas, and electricity. The rise in inflation exceeds economists' expectations and is now further above the Bank of England's 2% target. The Office for National Statistics noted that housing, household services, transport, recreation, and culture were the largest contributors to the increase. This inflation data casts doubt on previous predictions of additional interest rate cuts this year, with some economists suggesting there may only be one cut.</p>

          <p>A 2015 book by Charles Murray, "By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission," argued for wealthy donors to fund civil disobedience against the regulatory state, prefiguring the Trump administration's approach to government. The article argues that Murray's extreme hostility to liberal governance, skepticism of democracy, and faith in the primacy of the wealthy over the law all foreshadowed Trump's attacks on government functions. This helps explain why mainstream conservatives have been comfortable with Trump's actions, sharing his belief that the American government is no longer worthy of respect. The article draws a line between Murray's ideas and Trump's efforts to gut federal agencies, supported by figures like Elon Musk.</p>

The company's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, though sales slightly missed estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison attributed the company's resilience to investments in stores, technology, and customer service. Lowe's expects total sales for the year to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to be flat to up 1% year over year. The company is also acquiring Artisan Design Group to further boost its professional customer base.</p>

          <p>NestlÃ©, the parent company of Perrier, faces accusations of concealing the use of filters and ultraviolet sterilizers to treat Perrier water, which violates French and E.U. regulations for "natural mineral water." A French Senate investigation accused NestlÃ© of colluding with the French government to cover up these practices. The scandal raises questions about the feasibility of sourcing truly "natural" water amid increasing environmental degradation and contamination of groundwater. NestlÃ©'s CEO suggested that the concept of natural mineral water is becoming unrealistic, while consumer groups accuse the company of defrauding consumers by marketing treated water as natural.</p>

          <p>Despite being term-limited, President Trump's actions suggest he remains influenced by public opinion, contrary to fears of an emboldened second term. While some policies, such as those on immigration, seem impervious to public outcry, Trump has shown responsiveness in areas like court rulings, where he has largely complied to avoid backlash, and tariffs, which he scaled back after widespread opposition. The article suggests that public anger can still sway the administration, particularly on issues that could haunt the GOP in future elections, and that expressing discontent can prompt institutions to fight back against Trump's agenda.</p>

According to an article in the PLA Daily, the military needs to find ways to undermine the data and computing capacity of its opponents, focusing on targeting data, algorithms, and computing resources. One tactic involves "polluting" data to reduce the accuracy of an adversary's language models, while another involves "logical deception" of algorithms through irregular maneuvers.

The Trump administration released a drug policy blueprint that makes no mention of marijuana and nominated a critic of cannabis legalization to run the DEA.

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor National Park in England, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission should be required. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public a right of access for open-air recreation. Campaigners celebrated the decision, while landowners expressed disappointment. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the ruling and emphasized the importance of responsible access, calling on the government to consider lessons from the case in forthcoming legislation.</p>
