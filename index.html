          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. ceasefire proposal, suggesting amendments while reiterating demands for a permanent truce and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group also seeks guarantees for continuous humanitarian aid, none of which are currently part of the proposed deal. Hamas has offered to release 10 living and 18 dead Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. However, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff deemed Hamas's response "totally unacceptable," while Israel insists on the right to resume hostilities after a temporary ceasefire. The situation places Hamas in a complex position, caught between intense pressure and limited military capacity, as Israel prepares to escalate its ground offensive.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), an ambitious reforestation effort, faces questions regarding its effectiveness due to satellite data and field reports. Launched in 2011, the NGP aimed to combat deforestation by planting 1.8 billion seedlings across 2 million hectares. However, analysis suggests that some NGP sites experienced deforestation, with native trees cleared for cash crops. The program also struggles with short-term land access for communities and a focus on monoculture, undermining sustainable livelihoods. Independent audits reveal issues like poor site selection and limited community support, raising concerns about greenwashing.</p>

          <p>The United States has rejected Hamas's response to the Gaza cease-fire proposal, stating that it "only takes us backward." Officials indicated that Hamas is seeking changes related to guarantees for a permanent end to the conflict, a long-standing point of contention with Israel. The U.S. maintains that the current proposal, which has been endorsed by Israel, is the most viable path towards a temporary cessation of hostilities and the release of hostages. This development underscores the ongoing difficulties in reaching a resolution to the conflict and the divergent positions of the involved parties.

          <p>Germany is facing severe drought conditions due to an exceptionally dry spring, impacting agriculture, groundwater, and retail prices. The period from February to mid-April saw the least rainfall in 100 years, with March experiencing 70% less precipitation than usual. This has led to increased wildfire risk, low levels in the Rhine River affecting cargo transport, and concerns about rising consumer prices. Experts warn that the dry soil is hindering water absorption, exacerbating the groundwater shortage, and stressing plants.

China has accused the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace.

          <p>The price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has increased at a bodega in East Flatbush due to rising costs. Freddy and Yovanna Melo, owners of El Vacilon Grocery, raised the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019. The decision was driven by soaring egg prices, along with higher costs for bacon, cheese, and bread. The Melos, who own their building, rely on the sandwich, known as "bandera," to attract customers and maintain their business. This price increase reflects the broader impact of inflation on everyday items in the city.</p>

This has left the city to manage the crisis independently, without federal expertise. The situation highlights the challenges faced by cities dealing with public health emergencies amid federal government restructuring.

The humanitarian organisation said it had brought 77 trucks loaded with flour into Gaza overnight and early on Saturday. "All trucks were stopped along the way, with food taken mainly by hungry people trying to feed their families," WFP said. Due to a "very high" chance convoys would not reach their warehouse, a decision was taken to let people take aid in the event of crowds, WFP spokeswoman Abeer Etefa told the BBC. Israel eased an 11-week aid blockade on 19 May, but the UN says the amount sent in the last week amounts to just over 10% of people's needs.</p>
