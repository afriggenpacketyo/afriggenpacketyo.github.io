This escalation follows Petro's accusation that a U.S. military strike in Colombian waters, which killed a fisherman, constituted "murder" and a violation of sovereignty. The remarks highlight growing tensions between the two countries, despite Colombia's historical status as a key U.S. ally in Latin America. The dispute is set against a backdrop of ongoing U.S. military operations against alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Biblio Diet," suggests that the Bible can serve as a guide for physical health, advocating for a dietary plan based on ancient foods. Co-authors Dr. Josh Axe and Jordan Rubin argue that consuming foods mentioned in scripture, such as red meat, olive oil, and properly prepared whole grains, can enhance wellness and even help reverse serious health conditions. The diet also advises avoiding "unclean" foods like pork and shellfish, as well as modern processed ingredients. The authors emphasize that spiritual practices like fasting and prayer are integral components of this holistic health approach.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams concluded their extended road trip with a decisive 35-7 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars at London's Wembley Stadium. Quarterback Matthew Stafford was exceptional, throwing for five touchdowns, including three to receiver Davante Adams, even without the injured Puka Nacua. The Rams' defense was equally dominant, recording seven sacks on Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and stifling their offense throughout the game. This victory improves the Rams' record to 5-2, sending them into their bye week with strong momentum and an undefeated record in London games under coach Sean McVay.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its 19th day, Democratic and Republican senators remain at an impasse over how to reopen it. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly stated that a resolution could be reached this week if Republicans would negotiate on extending expiring health insurance tax credits. Conversely, Republican Senator Katie Britt urged Democrats to "do the right thing" by agreeing to fund the government first, with a promise to discuss the healthcare issue afterward.

Lagarde also noted "intriguing signs" that the U.S. dollar's status as the ultimate safe haven currency is eroding, pointing to the rise of cryptocurrencies and a more than 50% increase in the price of gold this year.

The vote takes place as the country grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a severe U.S. dollar shortage and soaring inflation.

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he declined to speculate ahead of the November Budget, Miliband acknowledged the affordability challenges facing the country and stated that "we're looking at all of these issues." This potential move comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, which recently rose by 2% for millions under the latest price cap. The long-term solution, Miliband argued, remains a transition to home-grown clean energy to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets.</p>

In a BBC interview, Polanski argued that the primary goal is not just to raise funds for public services but to create a fairer society by focusing on the "super wealthy."

          <h2>J.D. Power Ranks Top North American 'Mega-Airports' for Passenger Satisfaction in 2025</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual J.D. Power North American Airport Satisfaction Study for 2025 has identified the best "mega-airports," defined as those serving 33 million or more passengers per year. The study measures overall satisfaction based on factors like ease of travel, terminal facilities, and food and retail options. For the second consecutive year, the top three airports remained the same, a result attributed to their strong performance in fundamental areas such as cleanliness and TSA efficiency. An expert noted that while the ongoing government shutdown is affecting air travel, it has not yet had a "huge impact" on these satisfaction rankings.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military launched air and artillery strikes in southern Gaza, stating it was a response to Hamas firing on its soldiers, including with a rocket-propelled grenade. The action represents a significant test of the fragile U.S.-brokered ceasefire established earlier this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the military to take "strong action," though he did not explicitly threaten a return to full-scale war. Hamas denied involvement in any clashes in the area, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire and stating it had lost contact with its remaining groups in that Israeli-controlled zone.</p>

          <p>A seventh victim has died following a mass shooting that occurred after a high school football game in Leland, Mississippi, earlier this month. Medical officials confirmed that a 25-year-old woman succumbed to her injuries about a week after the incident, which wounded over a dozen people. The shooting broke out during homecoming celebrations in the small town of fewer than 4,000 residents. While a motive has not been officially disclosed, the FBI suggests it may have been "sparked by a disagreement." At least nine people have been arrested in connection with the violence, with several facing capital murder charges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip. The U.S. stated that such an act would be a "direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement" and would undermine recent progress made through mediation. In response, Hamas dismissed the claims as "false allegations" and accused Israel of supporting armed gangs in Israeli-controlled areas of Gaza. The warning comes after a video surfaced showing Hamas fighters executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, highlighting internal power struggles.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Highlights Stock Market's Historical 'Asymmetric Upside' in Recovering from Losses</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial analysis illustrates the concept of "asymmetric upside" in the stock market, emphasizing its historical ability to recover from significant downturns. While a 20% loss requires a 25% gain to break even, and a 50% loss needs a 100% gain, history shows the S&P 500 has consistently surpassed these recovery hurdles. For example, after the 55% decline during the 2007 financial crisis, the market delivered a 527% return over the subsequent 11-year bull run. This pattern demonstrates that for diversified indexes, the potential for gains has historically far outweighed the impact of losses over the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

The team, comprised of players now living in Australia, the UK, and Europe, will participate in the FIFA Unites: Women's Series in the UAE. For the players, the matches represent more than just a game; they are a chance to represent Afghan women who have been silenced and stripped of their basic human rights.

          <p>The streets of Madrid were filled with the sounds of bleating and bells as thousands of sheep and goats were herded through the city for the annual Transhumance Festival. The event celebrates the ancient pastoral tradition of moving livestock between seasonal grazing grounds and highlights its modern environmental benefits, such as using livestock to clear flammable undergrowth and reduce wildfire risk. As part of the tradition, organizers pay a symbolic fee of 50 medieval coins to city officials for the animals' safe passage, honoring a 1418 agreement. The parade drew large crowds of locals and tourists, enjoying the unique rural spectacle in the urban capital.</p>

          <p>Following over a week of deadly fighting along their shared border, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The deal was mediated by Qatar and Turkey, with both sides committing to end "hostile actions" and establish mechanisms for lasting peace. The clashes, the worst since the Taliban's 2021 takeover, were fueled by Pakistan's accusations that the Taliban harbors militant groups that attack its territory. The agreement includes a pledge from the Taliban not to support such groups, and further talks are scheduled to take place in Istanbul next week.</p>

These include the limited paid time off, car dependency, and the stressful, unpredictable healthcare system.

Other points of contrast are the absence of "tipping guilt," less extreme political polarization, and reduced societal pressure to follow a traditional life timeline of marriage and children, which she found liberating.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a plan to create 400,000 additional jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, aiming to double the workforce to 860,000 within five years. The strategy focuses on training and recruiting workers for 31 priority occupations, including plumbers, electricians, and welders, to support renewable energy industries like wind, solar, and nuclear. To facilitate this, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to match veterans and others with careers in the sector. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative is essential for developing Britain's clean energy capacity and lowering household bills.</p>
