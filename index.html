          <p>The entire Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board resigned, alleging that the Trump administration interfered with their authority to award scholarships. The board stated that the State Department denied Fulbright awards to a significant number of selected individuals for the 2025-2026 academic year. They also claimed that an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients are subject to an unauthorized review process, potentially leading to further rejections. The board members, all appointed by former President Biden, expressed their belief that these actions contradict the Fulbright mission and its values of free speech and academic freedom. The State Department has been contacted for comment regarding the situation.</p>

          <p>Following ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles, protests have broken out, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines has sparked conflict with local and state leaders, who argue that it escalates the situation. Protesters have blocked freeways, set vehicles ablaze, and hurled projectiles at police, while law enforcement has responded with less-lethal projectiles and tear gas. The timeline of events includes ICE raids, escalating protests, and the deployment of federal forces, raising concerns about state sovereignty and the rights of immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has echoed President Trump's call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, describing the Fed's reluctance as "monetary malpractice." Vance's statement followed a report indicating that tariffs have not significantly impacted inflation. The president has been urging Chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee to cut rates by a full percentage point from the current target level of 4.25%-4.5%. Market expectations currently assign zero probability of a rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting, anticipating potential easing in September (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May indicates that the annual inflation rate rose to 2.4%, slightly higher than April's 2.3%. This increase reflects a cooler-than-expected rise last month, suggesting that the impact of President Trump's tariffs has not yet fully affected consumer prices. The inflation rate was influenced by a decline in gasoline prices, while other items like clothing and airline fares also saw price decreases. Economists anticipate that the Federal Reserve will likely hold off on cutting rates until later in the year, while closely monitoring when Mr. Trump's tariffs will show up in the inflation data (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following two days of violence in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, a significant police presence will continue in the town. The unrest, which resulted in injuries to 32 officers and six arrests, began after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault. Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson described the violence as "racist thuggery targeted at ethnic minorities and police officers." Police are reviewing footage of the incidents and plan to increase resources to the area, with officers also requesting mutual aid from colleagues in Great Britain.</p>

The hole has been a talking point for decades, with its length exceeding the average drive of a PGA Tour player in past years.
