          <p>Starbucks has launched new protein-enhanced lattes and cold foam, aligning with the growing trend of increased protein consumption. Registered dietitians acknowledge the potential benefits for individuals who often skip breakfast, as the added protein can promote feelings of fullness. However, experts caution that these beverages should not be considered meal replacements, as they lack essential nutrients like fiber and can contain significant amounts of sugar. They emphasize a food-first approach, recommending lean meats, eggs, and plant-based sources for a more balanced nutritional intake.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has ordered the dismissal of diplomats at the country's embassy in Beijing, accusing them of sabotaging relations with China. Petro claimed that the staff altered his schedule and canceled meetings without authorization during a recent state visit, describing their actions as a form of colonialism. This move comes after Colombia formally joined China's Belt and Road Initiative in May, signaling a significant foreign policy shift away from its traditional alignment with the United States. The purge underscores Petro's commitment to strengthening ties with Beijing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government plans to begin processing new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which has been closed to first-time applicants for four years due to legal challenges. A Justice Department proposal would reopen the program in all states except Texas, where a lawsuit is ongoing. Under the proposal, current DACA recipients in Texas could maintain deportation protection but would lose their work permits, creating uncertainty for the state's large DACA population. Advocacy groups are clarifying that applications will not start immediately, as the proposal awaits a final decision from a federal judge.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is poised for a shutdown as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked over a funding deal. Democrats are insisting that any short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, must include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, which help lower insurance premiums for millions. Republicans, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, are demanding a "clean" bill without these policy additions, accusing Democrats of manufacturing a crisis. With the midnight deadline approaching, both parties are engaged in a public blame game, making a lapse in government funding increasingly likely.</p>

          <p>In a speech to top military commanders, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a major cultural shift in the U.S. military, declaring an end to what he termed "woke" policies. He introduced new directives that include raising physical fitness standards to a single "male level," toughening grooming rules, and ending racial quotas and restrictions on hazing in boot camp. Hegseth justified the recent firing of senior leaders, stating it is necessary to change a culture he claims has been weakened by political correctness. President Trump, also speaking at the event, endorsed the changes and suggested using some cities as military training grounds.</p>

The author of this article reflects on the tragedy through the lens of Nelson's teachings, which in his final years focused intensely on the need for peacemaking and rejecting contention in a divided world. While political discourse quickly polarized around the shooter's motives, the author suggests Nelson would have emphasized Christ's teaching to love one's enemy.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. For an $80,000 HELOC, the monthly payment is now approximately $966 for a 10-year term and $759 for a 15-year term, based on current average rates. These costs are lower than they were earlier in the year and significantly cheaper than a year ago. The article notes that HELOCs feature variable rates, which means payments could decrease further with future Fed cuts, but also advises borrowers to calculate costs against various rate scenarios to ensure long-term affordability.

          <p>Employees at the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy have reportedly been told to avoid using terms like "climate change," "decarbonization," and "emissions." An internal email suggests the directive is intended to align language with the administration's priorities and perspectives. This move is seen as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to minimize discussions about the climate crisis within the government. While the Energy Department's press secretary has denied any formal directive, the report aligns with the administration's previous actions, such as removing climate change information from government websites.</p>

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues the Republican bill is partisan and refuses to negotiate without addressing expiring Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid cuts.

This performance comes as a response to internal critics within the Labour party who have been urging a more aggressive stance.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "7-year rule" for credit card debt is often misunderstood but has significant implications for consumers. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, most negative information, such as unpaid debts and late payments, must be removed from a credit report after seven years from the first delinquency. Separately, each state has a statute of limitations, often around seven years, which limits the time a creditor can sue to collect a debt. However, the debt itself does not disappear and collectors may still attempt to contact you. Making a payment on old debt can sometimes restart the statute of limitations, so understanding these distinctions is crucial for managing long-term debt.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a warning to congressional Democrats, stating that a government shutdown would permit his administration to take "irreversible" actions that are "bad for them." Speaking from the Oval Office, he suggested this could include cutting programs and laying off a vast number of federal employees, referencing the budget-trimming capabilities of OMB Director Russell Vought. This threat adds a new layer of tension to the budget standoff, as previous shutdowns have not typically involved permanent program or personnel cuts. With no deal in sight, a shutdown at midnight appears increasingly probable.</p>

He projects that the EV market share, which is expected to hit a record of around 10-12% this month, could drop to as low as 5% once the $7,500 consumer credit ends. Farley noted that the industry is learning that customers find expensive EVs interesting but are more readily accepting "partial electrification" like hybrid vehicles. The policy change will force Ford and other automakers to reassess their EV capacity and battery plant strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of House Democrats has raised concerns that the Trump administration is "improperly" seizing tax refunds from student loan borrowers in default. In a letter to the Education Secretary, they argue that the government is failing to provide the legally required 60-day notice before resuming garnishments, which were paused during the pandemic. The lawmakers contend that without proper recent notification, borrowers are not being given the opportunity to prevent the seizures, which have reportedly already led to evictions.
