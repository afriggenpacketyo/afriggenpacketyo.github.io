          <p>The United Kingdom's third heatwave of the year is now affecting Scotland and Northern Ireland, with temperatures predicted to reach their highest levels of the year. In England and Wales, amber heat health alerts remain active, warning of risks to the entire population, while less severe yellow warnings are in place for northern England. The extreme heat has impacted events like Wimbledon, where play was halted due to spectators needing medical attention. Officials are also warning of increased wildfire risks and potential travel disruptions, with hosepipe bans already affecting millions.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This arrangement involves licensing fees and compensation, but not a direct investment in Windsurf, allowing the startup to remain independent. The move is a significant development in the escalating competition for top AI talent among tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI. Windsurf specializes in AI tools for writing code, a rapidly growing sector that has attracted high valuations and strategic interest from major industry players.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing criticism for selling sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased the design at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, sparking a social media outcry. Following the backlash, Prada engaged in discussions with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans. This move is seen as a positive step towards respectful collaboration between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing federal immigration agents in seven Southern California counties from conducting stops based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or language. The ruling responds to a lawsuit by the ACLU and immigrant rights groups, which alleged that agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on their appearance. The judge cited a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims of constitutional violations. This order provides a temporary halt to these practices while the broader lawsuit against the administration's enforcement tactics proceeds.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has permitted a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. to move forward on claims of breach of contract and deceptive business practices. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices to create AI clones for its text-to-speech platform without their consent, after initially hiring them for work described as for internal or academic use only. While a federal copyright claim on their voices was dismissed, the case will continue, marking a notable development in the legal battles between creators and AI companies over the use of personal data for training models.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing a global presence, driven by demand from Chinese companies expanding abroad and encouragement from Beijing. These firms find that Chinese businesses often prefer legal support from compatriots they trust.

While serving Chinese clients is the primary focus, attracting international clients remains a challenge, particularly amid current geopolitical tensions, representing a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has revealed a baffling detail: both engine fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so, deepening the mystery. Experts note that these switches have safety features to prevent accidental activation, making the event highly unusual. Investigators are now focused on analyzing the full cockpit voice recording to determine who manipulated the switches and why, as mechanical failure has been provisionally ruled out.</p>

This marks the first recorded death from this form of the plague in the county since 2007. While plague is known for its historical devastation, it is now treatable with antibiotics, and human cases are infrequent in the U.S. The bacteria is typically transmitted through bites from infected fleas carried by rodents. Pneumonic plague is the most dangerous form as it infects the lungs and can spread between people.</p>

          <p>A plan to dismantle Prague's iconic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge has ignited a fierce debate between heritage advocates and the national Railway Authority. The authority argues that the corroded steel bridge cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic and must be replaced with a new, three-track structure. However, a coalition of architects and engineers, supported by a public petition and UNESCO, insists the historic landmark can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. The conflict highlights the classic urban dilemma of balancing the needs of modern infrastructure with the preservation of cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 employees, including 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff, as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The cuts are aimed at streamlining the department by eliminating what it calls redundant offices and focusing on core responsibilities. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the move undermines U.S. national security and diplomatic capabilities. The layoffs heavily impacted bureaus focused on human rights, refugee resettlement, and foreign assistance, sparking concern among advocates and remaining staff.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma beach resort, a large-scale tourist development, welcoming its first group of Russian tourists. The project, championed by leader Kim Jong Un, was reportedly inspired by Spanish resorts like Benidorm and is part of a strategy to boost the nation's sanctioned economy and strengthen ties with Russia. However, the resort's construction has drawn criticism from human rights groups, who cite reports of forced labor and harsh working conditions for the "shock brigades" used to build it. Experts remain skeptical about its potential to attract a significant number of foreign visitors.</p>

          <p>An intense and prolonged marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea has scientists concerned about potentially devastating impacts on marine life. In late June and early July, sea surface temperatures off the coast of Majorca and other areas surpassed 30°C, up to seven degrees above normal for the time of year. While the heat is now subsiding, experts warn that such extreme conditions, driven by climate change, can cause mass mortality events for species like seagrasses and have knock-on effects on fish stocks. The Mediterranean is considered a climate change hotspot due to its enclosed nature.</p>

Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will enact its reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war.
