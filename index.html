          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analyst expectations and indicating ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. While industrial output exceeded forecasts, the property sector continues to struggle, with fixed-asset investment growth slightly below expectations. The urban unemployment rate saw a slight decrease, but the National Bureau of Statistics cautioned about unstable external factors and the need for further economic recovery consolidation. Despite trade war fears receding due to recent negotiations, the article suggests China's economic recovery remains fragile. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting house, built in 1842, serves as a space for community gatherings and artistic events, inspiring a greater appreciation for public art.

          <p>Donald Trump is facing increased scrutiny for accepting a $400 million luxury plane from Qatar, with prominent Democrats and even some Republicans criticizing the gift. Critics argue that the acceptance of the plane contradicts Trump's promise to "drain the swamp" and represents a form of corruption. Trump defended the gift, claiming it was for the United States and not for personal use, but this assertion has been challenged. Meanwhile, lawyers are challenging the Trump administration's efforts to cut funding and punish civil servants.</p>

Governor Murphy announced the agreement, expressing relief for commuters and urging them to work from home on Monday to facilitate the transition. The engineers' union had been seeking pay parity with other passenger railroads, and the agreement involves concessions on work rules.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones at the age of 82. His cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, which places him in the most severe category. The article discusses prostate cancer symptoms, Gleason scores, and treatment options, emphasizing that while prostate cancer is often curable if treated early, the goal for Biden is to control the disease, slow progression, and preserve quality of life. Treatment will likely involve blocking testosterone and bone-targeted therapies.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, which resulted in one death and several injuries.

Investigators are examining Bartkus' writings and social media posts, believing he attempted to livestream the bombing. The blast shattered windows and scattered debris, but officials have confirmed that the clinic's staff, eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials were unharmed.</p>

The Trump administration aims to strike deals with key trading partners on its reciprocal tariffs imposed in April. Bessent stated that the administration expects to "do a lot of regional deals," setting different rates for regions like Central America and Africa.

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China's yuan has the potential to rival the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners. The yuan already works effectively in cross-border purchase settlements, but China needs to deepen its financial markets to allow greater foreign access to yuan-denominated assets. Convertibility remains a concern among investors outside the mainland, but increased accessibility could position the yuan as a viable alternative to the dollar.</p>
