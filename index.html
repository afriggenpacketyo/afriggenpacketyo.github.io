          <p>An early morning fire and explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood led to the collapse of three rowhome buildings. At least two women, aged 82 and 62, were hospitalized, with one in critical condition. Officials have evacuated adjacent buildings due to the risk of further collapses and have launched a comprehensive search and rescue operation. The cause of the explosion is under investigation by multiple agencies, including the ATF, in what is expected to be an all-day operation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that a significant portion of liberal discourse on youth gender medicine is based on unsubstantiated claims, particularly the idea that medical transition is necessary to prevent suicide. It points to legal admissions by ACLU lawyers and findings from the Cass report in England, which found no strong evidence that puberty blockers or hormones reduce suicide rates. The piece contends that advocacy groups and medical associations have suppressed internal doubts and weak evidence for political reasons, creating a "misinformation bubble" around the topic.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will consider the "most appropriate" framework for governing following the crucial House of Councillors election in July. Securing a majority for his ruling coalition is a "must-attain" goal, though he acknowledged it will be a difficult task. This election is the first nationwide parliamentary test since his coalition lost its majority in the lower house last October.

          <p>The UK government has made significant concessions on its planned welfare reforms to avert a major rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that the government is now in a "better position" to pass the bill. The changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants and abandoning a freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit. A review of the Pip assessment process, co-produced with disabled people, has also been announced.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services is being analyzed as a symptom of a precarious economy, particularly for Gen Z and millennials. Economic commentator Kyla Scanlon argues that while these services offer convenience, they also encourage impulsive spending on non-essential items. The article suggests that for many young people facing stagnant wages, high rent, and the unlikelihood of homeownership, BNPL provides a psychological buffer and an act of agency in an economy that feels inaccessible.

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capability to restart uranium enrichment within "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi said caused "severe damage" but were not total. The statement appears to contradict claims by President Trump that the program was "obliterated," suggesting Iran's nuclear knowhow and industrial capabilities remain intact and could be reactivated if desired.</p>

The firing has sparked outrage in the school community, with a parent-led petition calling the decision "unjust" and demanding changes to the archdiocese's policy.</p>

          <p>The practice of dimming cabin lights during takeoff and landing is a standard safety procedure, according to pilots and flight attendants. The primary reason is to allow the eyes of passengers and crew to pre-adjust to darkness. This significantly reduces the time needed to adapt and see emergency exit paths in the event of a sudden power loss or an evacuation. Takeoff and landing are statistically the most critical phases of a flight, and this simple measure helps prepare everyone onboard for a potential emergency situation.</p>
