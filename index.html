          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures due to sluggish demand and trade tensions with the United States, which are straining manufacturers. The national consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, surpassing market expectations. While China aims to boost consumption with more precise measures and growing new quality productive forces, a contraction from April was mainly caused by declining energy prices. Despite a preliminary trade deal with the U.S., tensions remain, prompting speculation about further monetary easing by Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in Paramount, a Los Angeles suburb, following rumors of an immigration raid at a local hardware store, although the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denies these reports. The unrest led to clashes between protesters and authorities, with reports of property damage and injuries. President Trump deployed the California National Guard in response to the protests, a move typically decided by a state's governor. The community, which is predominantly Hispanic, expressed fear and panic due to the increased immigration enforcement activity in the area.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles, likening his actions to those of a dictator. National Guard troops clashed with demonstrators protesting Trump's anti-immigration program, leading to police using tear gas and rubber bullets.

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in conflict over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, leading to different interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump deployed the National Guard after reported attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, while Newsom argues the deployment is unlawful and inflames tensions. The Posse Comitatus Act generally restricts the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, but exceptions exist, such as when state governments are unable or unwilling to impose law and order.</p>

          <p>Nurses in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, with the possibility of strike action looming. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has already dismissed the award as "grotesque" and says the vote will be crucial in determining the next steps. Almost 350,000 nursing staff will be asked to vote on the pay increase, which follows review body recommendations. The RCN argues that nursing staff have endured over a decade of pay erosion, resulting in nurses quitting in large numbers.</p>

          <p>The UK is grappling with rising energy bills and is considering a radical overhaul of its electricity market, potentially moving from a national market to smaller regional markets. The current system often requires compensation payments to wind farms when the grid can't take their power, while gas-fired plants are paid to provide more electricity. The government's net-zero policy is under attack, with critics arguing it isn't delivering cheaper electricity. The proposed changes have sparked a bitter debate, with supporters arguing it could lower bills and attract energy-intensive businesses, while opponents worry about undermining renewable energy investments.</p>
