          <h2>Glacier Collapse in Switzerland Causes Devastating Landslide</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A partial glacier collapse in the Swiss Alps triggered a significant landslide that severely impacted the village of Blatten, destroying approximately 90% of it. The event, which followed the evacuation of around 300 residents and livestock, left one man missing and prompted a large-scale search and rescue operation. Authorities are concerned about the potential for an ice jam and subsequent flooding due to the landslide burying the Lonza River bed. Swiss glaciologists have repeatedly voiced concerns about the accelerated retreat of glaciers, attributing it largely to global warming, as the country has seen a significant decrease in glacier volume in recent years.</p>

          <p>A US federal court blocked the Trump administration's plan to impose sweeping tariffs on key trading partners, leading to cautious reactions worldwide. While international stock markets responded positively, trade experts warn that the ruling may only provide a temporary reprieve, as the administration is expected to appeal the decision and explore other legal avenues. The court's decision does not affect existing sector-specific tariffs, leaving important economic sectors open for negotiation. The situation guarantees continued chaos and uncertainty for businesses trying to plan and invest confidently in the global market.</p>

          <p>A recent US court ruling blocking some of President Trump's tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US.

Although the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, the agreement is yet to be implemented. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs of 10% on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, creating uncertainty for businesses.</p>

Online banks often provide more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and short-term CDs may offer the best rates currently.

          <p>Savings accounts, particularly high-yield savings accounts, are offering competitive interest rates, making them a strong option for emergency funds. While the national average savings account interest rate is 0.42%, high-yield savings accounts offer rates between 4.10% and 4.40%. Online banks often provide the best rates due to lower overhead costs, with many top accounts starting with a minimal deposit. Choosing a high-yield savings account from an online bank and comparing different options can maximize savings potential (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Harvard University reports that many of its international students are seeking to transfer due to the Trump administration's efforts to block them from enrolling.

Despite achieving its greatest progress to date, the unmanned spacecraft began spinning out of control minutes after separating from its booster. While SpaceX operates on a "fail fast, learn fast" principle, the repeated costly failures have led some experts to question whether this approach will pay off. The company hopes to use Starship to send humans to Mars and support NASA's Artemis program, but time is running out to meet scheduled timelines.</p>

The editorial board suggests Trump should increase pressure on both sides to reach a deal, leveraging potential economic sanctions and military support for Ukraine.
