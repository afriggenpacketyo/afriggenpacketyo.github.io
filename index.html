          <p>Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country over alleged pro-American influence operations in Greenland. This action follows a report by Danish public broadcaster DR, which detailed that three Americans with ties to President Donald Trump were conducting such operations in the semi-autonomous territory. Rasmussen stated that any interference in the kingdom's internal affairs is unacceptable, underscoring the close and trusting cooperation between the Danish and Greenlandic governments. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service also confirmed awareness of various influence campaigns aimed at creating discord in the relationship.</p>

          <p>Democrats gathered for their DNC summer meeting in Minneapolis, aiming to overcome fundraising and voter registration lags against Republicans and define their platform more clearly. Members expressed eagerness to fight back aggressively against President Donald Trump, attributing some party challenges to compounding factors. The party plans to leverage outrage over Republican redistricting efforts and push back on the impacts of Trump's spending and policy bill on healthcare costs. Despite internal concerns about the party's direction, there is a growing consensus to focus on core issues like affordability and voter registration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reportedly suspended over 20 staff members who signed an open letter criticizing President Donald Trump's leadership and cuts to the agency. The letter, known as the "Katrina Declaration," warned of potential national catastrophes due to alleged interference and underfunding. FEMA defended its reforms, stating its commitment to efficiency, while the suspended employees were placed on paid administrative leave without explicit reasons. This move raises concerns about disaster readiness, especially amid the ongoing North Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook upward, indicating progress against its 2025 initiatives. Interim CEO Michael Bender highlighted reduced inventory, lower expenses, and improved customer traction as key factors. This performance offers a positive turn for Kohl's, which has faced leadership turmoil and three consecutive years of declining annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Russian climber, Natalia Nagovitsyna, is presumed dead after being stranded for over two weeks on Kyrgyzstan's 24,406-foot Victory Peak with a broken leg. Despite several failed rescue attempts and extreme weather conditions, a thermal-imaging drone survey found no signs of life at her location. This tragic event follows the death of an Italian climber during a rescue effort and a helicopter crash, underscoring the mountain's perilous nature. Nagovitsyna's husband also died during a climb in 2021, adding a poignant layer to this story.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand in the fiscal second quarter, with sales falling 5% and comparable sales dropping 11%. However, the company's overall sales climbed 7%, largely due to a robust 19% growth from its teen-focused Hollister brand, marking its best-ever second-quarter net sales growth. Abercrombie narrowly beat Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year outlook, indicating a strategic shift towards new categories and partnerships, including becoming the NFL's first "official fashion partner," to stimulate continued growth.

          <p>Human smuggling networks are increasingly sophisticated along the U.S. northern border, adapting to enforcement changes and exploiting sanctuary city policies, according to immigration attorney Peter Lumaj. A recent incident involved Canadian authorities intercepting a U-Haul with 44 migrants near Vermont. Lumaj warned that sanctuary policies create "shopping grounds" for migrants, undermining federal law enforcement. Smugglers often target single men, using GPS and social media, and can lead to human trafficking, including the exploitation of underage girls, making the situation deeply concerning.</p>

          <p>U.S. mortgage demand saw minimal movement last week, with total application volume falling 0.5% and interest rates remaining largely unchanged. While applications to refinance a home loan decreased, applications for home purchases rose slightly by 2%, marking the strongest week for purchase demand in a month. This small gain suggests prospective buyers are becoming less sensitive to current rates, potentially encouraged by more inventory and cooling home-price growth.

This disparity is attributed to lower tax rates on capital gains and business income compared to earned income, allowing the wealthiest to avoid higher individual income taxes.

          <p>Reform UK's proposed migration plan, aiming to deport 500,000-600,000 people within five years, faces significant questions regarding its achievability and legality. The plan includes building secure facilities for 24,000 deportees monthly and making human rights law changes, which would cost an estimated £12bn and require new, potentially controversial, legislation. Experts highlight the logistical challenges, the vast increase in current deportation rates, and conflicts with data protection and privacy laws. Pulling out of the ECHR, as suggested, could also breach the Good Friday Agreement and impact trade relations.</p>

          <p>This article delves into "chiro bash," or ultimogeniture, an unusual inheritance practice in Pakistan's mountainous Chitral district where the youngest son inherits the family home. This custom ensures parents are cared for in old age and promotes family continuity, contrasting with the Western practice of primogeniture. While it can cause friction among siblings, it also encourages older children to seek independence. However, the practice is facing pressure from formal Shariah-based inheritance laws and cultural shifts as more young adults leave for urban education and work, making its long-term survival uncertain.</p>

Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun emphasized that China's nuclear capabilities are not on the same level as the U.S. and Russia, who possess nearly 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. China maintains its nuclear forces at a minimum level for national security and does not engage in an arms race. This refusal underscores the ongoing diplomatic challenges in global arms control, especially after Russia withdrew from its last remaining arms control agreement with Washington.</p>

          <p>Ofgem, the UK energy regulator, announced a 2% increase in the energy price cap, leading to a £35 annual rise for typical households, bringing the average bill to £1,755 starting in October. This increase, slightly higher than anticipated, is partly due to increased costs for energy transmission and extra government support measures funded by all billpayers. Campaigners warn of another winter of high energy bills, with many households still struggling with energy debt. Consumers are advised to consider fixed-price deals and direct debit payments to mitigate the impact.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency review into the Ammanford school stabbing found that the teenage girl, who was 13 at the time and later convicted of attempted murder, had a fascination with weapons and war memorabilia. The report highlighted missed opportunities for "targeted help" due to incomplete information sharing and declined support offers. Incidents, including the discovery of a knife and BB gun in her bag, were noted, alongside her troubled childhood and potential mental health challenges. While the review concluded the attack was unforeseeable, it emphasized the need for strengthened information sharing and early intervention for vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Meituan reported a significant drop in net profit for the period, falling to 365.3 million yuan from 11.4 billion yuan a year ago. The company attributed this sharp decline to an "irrational competition" in the delivery market, leading to a 75.6% decrease in operating profit for its local commerce segment. Increased courier incentives, a jump in selling and marketing expenses, and higher research and development spending also contributed to the profit slump. This financial performance reflects the intense competitive pressures and rising operational costs within the instant delivery sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Domestic violence is the primary cause of homicide in Utah, accounting for over a third of all homicides between July 2023 and January 2025, according to a local news analysis.

Advocates express alarm, noting increased referrals to already strained service providers following a new lethality assessment law. Compounding the crisis are deep cuts to federal funding for crime victims by the Trump administration and a lack of state funding, severely impacting rural and underserved communities.</p>
