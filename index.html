        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global economy is bracing for a potential 'China shock' as overcapacity in Chinese manufacturing leads to deflationary pressures worldwide. Chinese producers are offering steep discounts to destock inventories due to weak domestic demand and intense competition. This influx of low-cost goods could provide some relief to inflation-hit economies by lowering consumer costs. However, concerns are rising among Asian economies about being overwhelmed by cheap Chinese imports, prompting discussions about trade barriers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market forecasts by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower-than-expected growth as reasons for the cut. While the RBI held its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it revised its inflation outlook downward to 3.7%. The central bank also shifted its monetary policy stance to neutral, signaling limited room for further rate cuts to support growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a legal challenge against the Trump administration's move to block international students from entering the U.S. to attend the college. Harvard argues the action is illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against Trump's proclamation, stating Harvard would sustain immediate and irreparable injury. The legal battle unfolds amid increasing scrutiny of student visas nationwide, causing uncertainty for international students and potentially affecting interest in studying in the U.S.</p>

The report suggests AI enriches jobs by freeing employees from tedious tasks, enabling them to focus on complex skills and decision-making, and that AI is creating new jobs.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing annually due to lost, damaged, or missing evidence. Data from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) shows over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offences. The increase is attributed to resourcing issues resulting from cuts to police forces. Cases collapse when the CPS cannot proceed to trial due to the lack of necessary evidence from the police. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's new travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries, has come as little surprise amid a barrage of immigration restrictions implemented during his second term. The administration has ended temporary legal residency for various groups, restricted student visas, and increased scrutiny of international scholars. Experts say the new ban is likely to face legal challenges and will disproportionately affect those seeking refuge. Critics argue that these actions normalize racism and xenophobia, further disrupting the immigration system.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are standing firm against Elon Musk's "Kill the Bill" campaign targeting President Trump's agenda. Musk's criticism of the "Big, Beautiful Bill" has created a challenge for Republicans, but they remain committed to the legislation. While some Republicans acknowledge Musk's influence, they argue he is wrong on this issue. Democrats are using Musk's opposition as an opportunity to derail the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his role in the party's rise. Yusuf's contributions included financial support, enhancing the party's appeal, and organizational skills. However, his departure highlights the party's struggle to retain staff and build a stable organization. Nigel Farage's parties have a history of fallouts, making it crucial for Reform UK to hire and retain expertise for long-term success.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court overturned a ruling ordering former Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) executives to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster. The judge stated that the government's earthquake assessment did not provide a sufficient basis for the utility to conduct construction work to protect against a huge tsunami. The lawyer for the shareholders criticized the ruling and expressed intention to appeal.</p>
