          <p>Hurricane Erin has strengthened to a Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, prompting warnings of life-threatening surf and rip currents for the U.S. East Coast throughout the week. While the hurricane is not expected to make a direct landfall, its significant size and strength are projected to generate dangerous coastal conditions. Authorities have issued tropical storm watches and storm surge warnings for North Carolina's Outer Banks, leading to mandatory evacuations on Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands. The National Hurricane Center urges residents along the entire Eastern Seaboard to remain vigilant and heed local advisories, as the storm is expected to remain a major hurricane for several days.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders at the White House to discuss a potential end to the war with Russia. During the meeting, Trump suggested the U.S. would be involved in providing Ukraine with security guarantees, a key demand from Kyiv, though he emphasized Europe would need to bear much of the responsibility. The talks also covered the possibility of a trilateral meeting between the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, which Zelenskyy stated his country was ready for. The meeting was notably more cordial than their previous encounter, with Zelenskyy thanking the president for his efforts to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident in Tremonton, Utah, resulted in the deaths of two police officers, Sgt. Lee Sorensen and Officer Eric Estrada, with a third officer wounded. The officers were responding to a domestic disturbance call late Sunday when a man opened fire on them as they arrived at the scene. The suspect was later persuaded by bystanders to surrender his weapon and was taken into custody by additional responding units. Authorities have described domestic disturbance calls as among the most dangerous situations for law enforcement, and the event has sent shockwaves through the local community and law enforcement agencies across the state.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the current generative AI boom, arguing that the breathless hype from Silicon Valley is fostering a collective delusion and a sense of societal psychosis. The author points to bizarre applications, like an AI-reanimated version of a school shooting victim, as examples of a hastily conceived future that is being uncritically accepted. The piece explores the widespread anxiety over job displacement and the psychological impact of interacting with increasingly human-like chatbots. It questions whether the technology will ever deliver on its grandest promises, suggesting the real danger is that society reorients itself around a technology that remains merely "good enough" while causing significant cultural and economic damage.</p>

Committee Chairman James Comer stated that Barr was cooperative and shed light on the investigation, asserting that the former AG saw no evidence implicating Donald Trump. In contrast, Democratic representatives Jasmine Crockett and Suhas Subramanyam claimed the deposition left them with more questions and accused Republicans of not conducting a serious inquiry. The testimony is part of a broader bipartisan investigation into Epstein's case, which has also included subpoenas for other former high-ranking officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Bankrate reveals that despite wage increases, the average American's earnings have lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years, eroding household purchasing power. This persistent gap helps explain ongoing public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many families struggle with the cost-of-living crisis that began during the pandemic. The report highlights that educators have experienced the largest deficit between pay growth and inflation, while workers in sectors like leisure and hospitality have seen wages outpace rising costs. The findings underscore the financial strain on households, making it more difficult to save for emergencies, retirement, or other long-term goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>City officials in Anaheim, California, have issued a public warning about significant and disruptive immigration enforcement raids conducted by federal agents over the weekend. The city described the actions as part of a larger pattern of activity that has instilled fear and uncertainty within the community, particularly among its large Latino and immigrant populations. Incidents included a raid at a local car wash where a bystander was detained and another at a Home Depot where several day laborers were taken into custody. The Anaheim City Council has condemned the enforcement actions, stating they destabilize families and do not enhance public safety, and has voted to join a lawsuit challenging the federal operations.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the most recent ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, which could mark a significant step toward pausing the 22-month war with Israel. The deal is reportedly based on a U.S.-led framework and would involve an initial 60-day truce in exchange for the release of about half of the remaining Israeli hostages. This development comes as Israeli forces intensify strikes in Gaza City, and as public pressure mounts within Israel for a deal to bring the hostages home. Israel's official response to Hamas's reported acceptance remains unclear, as the government has previously insisted on the release of all hostages at once.</p>

          <p>As the popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services grows, so do concerns about consumer debt, with over 40% of users reporting at least one late payment. This article examines whether BNPL debts, which are a form of unsecured debt similar to credit cards, can be included in debt forgiveness or settlement programs. While technically eligible, the process can be complex because BNPL is a newer financial product, and not all providers may be willing to negotiate settlements. For consumers struggling with these payments, alternative strategies such as direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation loans, or seeking guidance from a credit counselor may offer more immediate and effective relief.</p>

          <p>The organizers of the Polari Prize, a prominent UK award for LGBTQ+ literature, have canceled this year's event following a significant controversy surrounding the nomination of author John Boyne. Boyne's inclusion on the longlist sparked backlash due to an article he wrote defending J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues, which many in the publishing community deemed hurtful and exclusionary. In protest, more than ten other longlisted authors withdrew their nominations, and one of the prize's judges resigned. After consultations, the organizers decided to pause the prize for the year to review its governance and increase the representation of trans and gender non-conforming judges on its panels.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction to halt the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) investigation into the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America. The probe was initiated after Media Matters published a report in November 2023 alleging that advertisements from major brands were appearing alongside antisemitic content on the social media platform X. U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ruled that the FTC's investigation was a likely violation of the group's First Amendment rights, representing a form of government retaliation for its constitutionally protected speech. The ruling is a significant victory for Media Matters, which is also facing a separate lawsuit from X owner Elon Musk over the same report.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:38:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains how a specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by nearly a quarter of U.S. retailers including Walmart and Target, could temporarily distort their reported profitability as new tariffs take effect. Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail ratio across broad categories rather than tracking the actual cost of each item, it can initially overstate profits when import costs rise suddenly. While this effect normalizes over time, it can create a disconnect between a company's operational efforts to mitigate tariff costs and what appears in its financial statements. The piece details how this accounting method works and why it can make a retailer's bottom line appear stronger than it is in the short term.</p>

          <p>Texas state health officials have officially declared an end to the state's largest measles outbreak in over three decades, which infected 762 people and led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The outbreak was declared over after 42 consecutive days—equivalent to two full incubation periods for the virus—passed without a new case being reported. The response involved extensive testing, vaccination campaigns, and public education efforts to contain the highly contagious virus. Despite this success, officials warn that vigilance is crucial, as declining vaccination rates and ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S. and globally mean that additional cases are likely to appear in the state.</p>

          <p>Florida Peninsula Insurance, a major private property insurer in the state, has filed for a significant rate reduction, signaling potential relief for homeowners grappling with the nation's highest insurance premiums. The proposed statewide average decrease is 8.4% for homeowners and 12% for condominium owners, a move attributed to recent legislative reforms that have reduced frivolous lawsuits and inflated claims. Experts see this as a positive sign that Florida's distressed insurance market is beginning to stabilize, which could be particularly beneficial for the state's hard-hit condo market. However, the recovery remains vulnerable to factors like reinsurance costs and the activity of the current hurricane season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 visas from international students due to violations of U.S. law, including overstaying their permitted time and criminal offenses. The department stated that the vast majority of revocations were for serious issues such as assault, burglary, and driving under the influence, while 200-300 were revoked for activities defined as "support for terrorism." This action is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration and its enhanced vetting of international students, which now includes screening social media accounts for perceived hostility towards the U.S. or support for designated terrorist groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses whether age limits exist for purchasing annuities, a retirement product gaining popularity for its guaranteed income stream. While there are no federal age caps, individual insurance companies often set their own maximum age limits, typically between 80 and 85, to manage risk associated with life expectancy. The optimal time to buy an annuity depends on individual financial strategy rather than a specific age, though purchasing in one's late 50s to mid-60s is often advised. Waiting until later in life can result in higher monthly payouts but also risks disqualification due to health issues or reduced product availability. (not investment advice)</p>

Following her termination, she filed a lawsuit against her former employer, alleging the firing was related to her public discussion of her addiction.

          <p>This article critically examines the Trump administration's recent focus on enforcing the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act against wind-energy projects. While wind turbines do pose a threat to eagles, the author argues that the administration's sudden concern is disingenuous, pointing out that far greater threats to birds, such as climate change and habitat loss, are being exacerbated by the same administration's policies. The piece suggests this selective enforcement is a tactic to stall the development of wind farms, an industry the president has frequently criticized. It highlights the irony that the very environmental laws now being wielded against renewable energy are being weakened by the administration in ways that benefit the fossil fuel industry.</p>

With their return, the legislative process can resume, and the controversial redistricting proposal is expected to move forward in committee. Democratic leaders stated their return allows them to build a legal case to challenge the maps in court, while the political battle over redistricting is now escalating nationally.</p>
