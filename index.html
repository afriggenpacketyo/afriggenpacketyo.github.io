          <p>A spokesperson has confirmed that former President Joe Biden is receiving radiation and hormone therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. The diagnosis was made in May 2025, revealing a high-grade cancer with metastasis to the bone, placing him in a significant risk category. This treatment follows a previous Mohs surgery in September 2025 for basal cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men, with age being a primary risk factor.</p>

          <p>Independent movie theaters are adapting to the challenges posed by streaming services and high ticket prices by embracing creative business models. The article highlights examples like Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas, which operates as a non-profit and leverages celebrity events, and Vidiots in Los Angeles, which combines a theater with a classic video store to build community. In contrast, New York's Metrograph has found success as a for-profit venture by offering a premium, multifaceted experience including a restaurant and bookstore, demonstrating that a focus on community is key to their survival.</p>

          <p>In recognition of the U.N.'s International Day of the Girl, a collection of photographs by photojournalist Danielle Villasana is featured, celebrating the strength and perseverance of girls globally. The images capture young women in challenging circumstances, from a Venezuelan migrant girl studying math at the U.S. border to others who have faced gender-based violence and displacement. Villasana's work aims to convey the message that when provided with opportunities, education, and resources, girls and women demonstrate incredible resilience and are "unstoppable" in overcoming adversity.</p>

          <p>A deadly drone and artillery strike has hit the Dar al-Arqam displacement camp in el-Fasher, Sudan, resulting in the deaths of at least 60 people, including women, children, and the elderly. Local activists attribute the attack to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been besieging the city for 17 months in its conflict with the Sudanese army. The attack has overwhelmed local hospitals and intensified the dire humanitarian crisis in the city, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped with dwindling supplies.</p>

According to the city's mayor, four of the injured individuals were airlifted to hospitals for treatment. As of the report, no suspects were in custody, and an investigation into the shooting is currently underway.</p>

          <p>Chinese airlines may face significant financial and logistical challenges if the U.S. Department of Transportation enacts a proposed ban on using Russian airspace for flights to and from the United States. U.S. officials argue that using Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers an unfair advantage with shorter flight times. Analysts suggest that if the ban is implemented, Chinese airlines would have to either cancel flights, leading to passenger compensation costs, or reroute them, which would increase operational expenses and potentially ticket prices. The decision could disrupt flight plans that are typically arranged months in advance.</p>

They also contest the search of his backpack, where a gun was found, as it was conducted without a warrant.

Many young people express frustration with high unemployment, corruption, and a political system dominated by 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who has been in power for 43 years. The disqualification of popular opposition candidate Maurice Kamto has further fueled disillusionment, with some youths reportedly tearing up their voter cards.

The author argues that Trump aligns himself with the machismo and "Ultimate Fighter" ethos of these sports to project an image of strength and to wage a culture war, as seen in his criticism of new NFL safety rules. By hosting a UFC event on the White House grounds, Trump is not just creating a distraction but is also leveraging the psychology of fan allegiance to his political advantage. The piece suggests this "MAGA-fication" of sports represents a noticeable increase in brutishness and an effort to weaken shared boundaries.</p>

          <p>Despite positioning himself as a champion of the American worker, President Donald Trump's actions during the ongoing government shutdown have drawn sharp criticism. The administration has begun laying off federal employees and Trump has suggested that some furloughed workers may not deserve back pay. Analysts argue this reflects a broader pattern where the president's policies, including widespread tariffs and changes to guest worker programs, negatively impact the working class by raising costs and driving down wages. Critics contend that while Trump uses pro-worker aesthetics, his administration's actions ultimately favor corporations and the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Palestinian Writer Reflects on Personal Loss Amidst Collective Tragedy</h2>

          <p>A writer shares a personal reflection on grieving the death of her grandmother while witnessing the immense suffering and loss of life in Gaza. She describes this as "disenfranchised grief," where personal sorrow feels unearned or indulgent when compared to a larger, public catastrophe. The author explores the guilt of living in safety while other Palestinians are displaced and starving, and how this dynamic turns her grief into anger. She concludes that for Palestinians, the acts of cooking traditional food, sharing stories, and creating space for both joy and sorrow are acts of defiance and survival in a world that often denies their humanity.</p>

          <h2>Exploring How to Productively Engage with the Emotion of Regret</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the nature of regret, framing it not as a purely negative emotion to be avoided but as a potential tool for self-discovery. Described as the "emotional price we pay for free will," regret often involves looking backward with a sense of loss or disappointment over past decisions. However, the piece suggests that by allowing ourselves to experience these feelings, we can learn valuable lessons about our present selves and our values. Instead of getting stuck in "what if" scenarios, engaging with regret can help inform our future choices and lead to personal growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The race to become the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is shaping up to be a verdict on Prime Minister Keir Starmer's leadership. The two main candidates, Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell, represent different approaches to the role. Phillipson, a current cabinet member, advocates for working within the government's inner circle, while Powell, who was recently sacked from the cabinet, positions herself as a voice that will offer a "course correction" when needed. With many party members reportedly disgruntled with Starmer's performance, Powell is seen as the favorite, and her potential victory could signal a rebuke to the current leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite persistent hunger, true famines have become far less common due to major advancements in global agriculture, which is on track for a record grain harvest this year. The article attributes this success to the Green Revolution, including the development of high-yield seeds, the widespread use of synthetic fertilizers from the Haber-Bosch process, and a significant expansion of irrigated farmland. While these innovations have created a world of food abundance, challenges remain. Modern famines, like those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political failures and conflict rather than crop failures.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has expressed support for President Trump and suggested deploying the National Guard to address crime in San Francisco. Citing security concerns for his company's Dreamforce conference, Benioff stated he was "all for it" if the Guard could act as police. The comments drew sharp criticism from local Democratic leaders, including the District Attorney and a State Senator, who warned against an "illegal military occupation." This marks another instance of a prominent Silicon Valley leader aligning with Trump, despite Benioff's history of donating to liberal causes.</p>
