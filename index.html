          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 22:40:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration, initially hesitant to intervene, grew concerned when escalating tensions between India and Pakistan threatened to spiral out of control after a terrorist attack in Kashmir. Vice President JD Vance's initial dismissal of the conflict as "none of our business" was quickly reversed as evidence of serious dogfights and explosions near Pakistan's nuclear arsenal emerged. The US, through direct calls from Vance to Prime Minister Modi and Rubio to General Munir, worked to de-escalate the situation, leading to a cease-fire. Despite Pakistan acknowledging US leadership, India did not publicly recognize American involvement.</p>

Gallego, who won in Arizona despite a Republican registration advantage, emphasized the need for alliances with those who may not agree 100% of the time. He also stressed the importance of empathizing with voters' economic struggles, suggesting that Democrats need to focus more on the economic pain felt by many Americans.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that a winning Eurovision song should feature self-empowering lyrics, simple yet effective staging, and a minor key for emotional depth. While acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, simple staging can make the song easier to remember. Adding a surprise element, like a key change or costume reveal, can also make a song more memorable.</p>
