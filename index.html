          <p>An Australian woman, Erin Patterson, has been found guilty of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them beef Wellington pastries containing deadly death cap mushrooms. The jury rejected her defense that the poisoning was an accident, concluding she intentionally laced the meals. The case, which centered on Patterson's intent, captivated Australia due to its bizarre and tragic nature, with prosecutors highlighting strained family relationships as a potential context for the crime.</p>

          <p>A review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there is no evidence of a "client list" associated with deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein, contrary to widespread speculation. The review also released footage that officials state further confirms Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell in 2019. According to a memo, investigators did not find evidence to support charges against any uncharged third parties, a finding likely to disappoint those who believed Epstein's powerful associates could be implicated.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic efforts for a Gaza ceasefire are intensifying, with growing but cautious optimism for a breakthrough as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the U.S. for talks with President Trump. The proposed 60-day truce, which includes the release of hostages held by Hamas, is being discussed in Qatar, though key differences between the two sides remain. The recent regional conflict with Iran is believed to have shifted dynamics, potentially making both Israel and Hamas more amenable to an agreement to end the 21-month war.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he terms the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This threat was issued via social media as the bloc of developing nations, which recently expanded, met in Brazil and criticized unilateral protectionist measures. The BRICS joint statement voiced serious concerns about trade-distorting tariffs, while Trump's announcement signals a further escalation of his administration's aggressive global trade strategy.

Researchers note that women are having fewer children, and more are opting out of parenthood altogether, driven by increased economic independence and changing social norms. This demographic shift could lead to depopulation in many nations, straining social safety nets like Social Security and creating future labor shortages.

          <p>This article posits that the increasing "financialization" of housing is a primary cause of Europe's severe housing crisis and a source of widespread political discontent. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have acquired vast amounts of residential property, treating homes as a lucrative asset class. This has driven up prices and rents, making housing unaffordable for many and fueling inequality. The author argues that this system benefits investors at the expense of residents and has become a major engine of social despair and political mobilization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Officials Face Scrutiny Over Warning Systems After Deadly Texas Floods</h2>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate warnings to residents and campers before the deluge. Local officials stated the severity of the flood, which saw the river rise nearly 30 feet, was unexpected and that the area lacks a comprehensive, county-administered warning system due to cost. The National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued flood watches and warnings with hours of lead time, but officials noted that spotty cell coverage in the area limits the effectiveness of modern alert systems.</p>

          <p>Mexico secured its 10th Gold Cup title with a 2-1 victory over the United States in a heated final in Houston. The decisive goal came from Edson Álvarez in the second half, a score confirmed by VAR after initially being ruled out for offside. The match was marked by controversy, as U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino was incensed that his team was denied a penalty for a handball just minutes before Mexico's winning goal. He called the decision "embarrassing" and suggested the pro-Mexico crowd may have influenced the officials.</p>

          <p>While Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new "America Party," political and legal experts note that creating a viable third party in the U.S. is an exceedingly difficult task. The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased toward the two major parties and often require enormous signature-gathering efforts. Even for the world's wealthiest person, building a national party from scratch would likely take years and hundreds of millions of dollars to overcome legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate formed in 2017, has become one of Africa's deadliest and most expansive militant groups. It is the primary force behind a wave of jihadist violence in the Sahel region, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The group, which seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law, has exploited local grievances and state weakness to recruit thousands of fighters. Despite international and local counter-terrorism efforts, JNIM's attacks have escalated dramatically, destabilizing the region and contributing to multiple military coups.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Brazil, the BRICS group of emerging economies issued a statement calling for the United Nations to take a leading role in establishing global governance for artificial intelligence. The leaders described AI as a major opportunity for growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without fair oversight. They stressed the need for international protocols to ensure trust and security in AI systems and argued that all countries, particularly those in the Global South, must have equal access to AI technology, data, and research capabilities.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp on the Guadalupe River, became the epicenter of tragedy when a sudden, massive flood swept through its grounds. The river rose 26 feet in about 45 minutes, inundating low-lying cabins where many young girls were sleeping and leaving behind a scene of total devastation. The camp's director and several campers were among the dead, with others still missing. Survivor accounts describe terrifying scenes of hysteria, prayer, and heroic efforts by counselors to save the children from the rushing water.</p>

No one was inside the restaurant at the time of the crash, and while multiple people from the three-vehicle accident were hospitalized, no injuries were reported from the explosion itself.</p>
