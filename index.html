          <p>A U.S. trade court has ruled President Trump's tariffs on imported goods illegal, creating uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to impose such tariffs, arguing that Congress cannot grant the president unlimited tariff-setting authority. The Trump administration intends to appeal the ruling, and could potentially seek alternative routes to reinstate the tariffs. This decision provides temporary relief to American businesses and consumers, but the future of these tariffs remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

Peace Now, an anti-settlement group, called the move the most extensive of its kind since the 1993 Oslo accords, reshaping the West Bank and entrenching the occupation.
