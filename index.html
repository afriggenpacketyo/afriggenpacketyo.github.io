          <p>The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, dismissed the federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested during an ICE facility visit. Habba cited moving forward as the reason for dropping the charge against Baraka, who is running for governor. Simultaneously, Congresswoman LaMonica McIver was charged with assaulting and interfering with law enforcement during the same protest. McIver claims the charges are political and a mischaracterization of her actions during a congressional oversight visit to Delaney Hall. Habba invited Baraka to tour the facility, claiming the government has nothing to hide. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants while legal proceedings continue. This decision lifts a lower court's injunction that had blocked the termination of TPS, which provides work permits and deportation deferrals. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. The Trump administration argued that continuing the program was "contrary to the national interest," while TPS beneficiaries claimed ending the protections would cause significant harm, forcing them to return to a dangerous country. The case highlights the ongoing legal battles over immigration policy and the executive branch's authority.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has made unsubstantiated claims that former President Biden delayed disclosing his prostate cancer diagnosis, alleging a cover-up of Biden's health decline. Trump conflated the Gleason score with the stage of Biden's cancer, suggesting the public should have been notified sooner. He also questioned Biden's cognitive abilities and insinuated that Biden's staff were running the office using an autopen. Biden's personal office has not commented on Trump's assertions. This comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Biden's health and age, especially after a special counsel report described him as elderly with a poor memory.</p>

          <p>A Lufthansa flight flew for approximately ten minutes without a pilot when the co-pilot became incapacitated while the captain was outside the cockpit. According to a report from Spain's Ministry of Transport, the co-pilot suffered a sudden neurological condition. The captain could not initially re-enter the cockpit due to the door's security system, but the co-pilot eventually opened the door. A doctor on board diagnosed the co-pilot with a possible heart condition, and the flight was diverted to Madrid, where it landed safely.

          <p>A divided panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of a 20-year-old Venezuelan man seeking to return to the United States after being deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a previous order directing the Trump administration to facilitate his return, finding that his deportation violated a class action settlement. The administration had argued that his removal was justified under the Alien Enemies Act and that he was an admitted gang member, which he denies. The court rejected these arguments, stating that the man's asylum application should be adjudicated on its merits.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which aims to combat online sexual exploitation, including the use of AI to create fake images. The bill makes it a federal crime to publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent, requiring websites and social media companies to remove such material within 48 hours. Melania Trump, who advocated for the bill, called it a "national victory" that will protect children from online exploitation. Critics argue the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate content and government monitoring of private communications.</p>

          <p>A Moody's downgrade of the United States' credit rating, citing congressional gridlock and potential deficit-increasing fiscal plans, has emboldened fiscally conservative Republicans to stall a major tax and spending cut package. These lawmakers, ideologically opposed to growing the federal debt, are demanding deeper cuts to federal programs. Representative Thomas Massie used the downgrade to argue that the bill would make "bond buyers realize we aren’t fiscally responsible." While the downgrade strengthens the fiscal hawks' position, it's uncertain if it will significantly alter the bill's progress, as moderate Republicans also worry about slashing social programs.</p>

These shell companies often default on tariff payments, utilizing a minimum $50,000 customs bond before ceasing operations and quickly setting up new entities.
