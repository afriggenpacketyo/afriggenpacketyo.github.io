          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain platform, has announced that he is the leading holder of the $TRUMP meme token, which has earned him an invitation to a dinner with President Donald Trump. Sun currently holds $18.6 million worth of the Trump-themed meme token, in addition to the $75 million he previously invested in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture that directs 75% of its revenue to Trump-owned entities. This brings Sun's total investment in the Trump family's crypto ventures to over $93 million. Sun, who faces civil fraud charges from the SEC, will attend a gala dinner with Trump for the top 220 $TRUMP holders.</p>

          <p>Walmart has shifted its tone on the impact of tariffs, warning that higher duties on imports would soon lead to increased prices for consumers, a move that drew criticism from President Trump. CFO John David Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb, while Walmart reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining low prices. This situation illustrates the challenges businesses face in navigating trade policies and managing relationships with the White House. Other companies like Microsoft and Subaru have also warned of price increases related to tariffs, while Home Depot plans to maintain current pricing levels.</p>

The recovered items include documents, recordings, photos, letters, and personal objects collected by Syrian intelligence after Cohen's capture. Cohen, who infiltrated the Syrian political echelon in the 1960s, provided critical intelligence that aided Israel's victory in the 1967 Middle East War.

          <p>The Trump administration has facilitated the opening of the first U.S. mine for antimony, a critical mineral used in defense and technology, aiming to reduce reliance on China, which controls about half of global production. The Idaho-based operation will extract and smelt antimony, essential for military tools like night-vision goggles and ammunition, as well as semiconductors and infrared technology. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued the mine's 404 permit to Perpetua Resources, and the project is expected to create 550 jobs. The mine is also expected to produce over 400,000 ounces of gold annually over the next four years and is projected to cut foreign reliance on antimony by one-third.</p>

          <p>A $25,000 annuity can provide a small, guaranteed monthly income stream, but its worth depends on individual financial goals and circumstances. Immediate annuities for a $25,000 investment can generate monthly payments ranging from approximately $92 to $180, depending on age and gender. While this supplemental income could cover some expenses, it may not keep pace with inflation or offer flexibility. Factors such as deferred payments, fixed or variable rates, and additional guarantees can influence payout amounts. For those seeking safety and predictable income, a small annuity may be a helpful component of a broader retirement strategy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued a rare public reprimand of Israel, demanding an end to the renewed military offensive in Gaza and monthslong restrictions on humanitarian aid. The three allies condemned the expanded Israeli campaign against Hamas, calling it "wholly disproportionate." Britain has suspended free-trade talks with Israel and will impose sanctions on extremist Israeli settlers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the criticism, claiming it encourages further attacks. International discontent is growing over the rising death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles has laid off 15 full-time employees, including members of the education and public programming team, representing 14% of its full-time staff. The museum cited a necessary shift in focus to ensure it opens on time next year as the reason for the layoffs. The museum's opening has been delayed to 2026, and its director and chief executive, Sandra Jackson-Dumont, stepped down earlier this year. The museum emphasized that education remains a central pillar and that educational program plans are still in development.</p>

          <p>A new book claims that Hunter Biden urged his father, President Joe Biden, to rest during a trip to Ireland in April 2023, expressing concerns about his ability to handle the demanding schedule. Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley, who witnessed the interaction, was reminded of his own father's decline due to Parkinson's. The book describes Biden's speech behind the scenes as breathless and weak, and claims that his cognitive decline was evident to many observers. Despite these concerns, Biden has rejected claims of cognitive decline and is seeking re-election.</p>
