          <p>U.S. online sales reached $7.9 billion on the first day of Amazon's Prime Day event, a 9.9% increase year-over-year, marking the largest e-commerce day of the year so far. The sales event, which now spans four days, has prompted competing promotions from other major retailers like Walmart and Target. While home and outdoor goods saw strong initial demand, overall consumer spending patterns appear more spread out than in previous years. This year's event occurs amid economic uncertainty due to U.S. tariff policies, though their direct impact on prices remains a point of debate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded 1,288 confirmed measles cases this year, the highest number since 1992, according to the CDC. The cases span 38 states, with 92% of those infected being unvaccinated or having an unknown vaccination status. At least three deaths have been reported, including two unvaccinated children in Texas. This resurgence highlights a concerning trend of declining vaccination rates among kindergarteners, which have fallen below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity, even as health officials continue to recommend the MMR vaccine as the best protection.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country have claimed at least 119 lives, with dozens of people still missing. The disaster, which occurred over a holiday weekend, was particularly devastating for a summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors died. The region's geography makes it prone to such events, but the intensity was exacerbated by a confluence of weather systems. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, as many survivors reported receiving no alerts before the deluge.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is conducting a two-day tour of South Carolina, meeting with local Democratic leaders and voters in a move widely interpreted as laying groundwork for a 2028 presidential campaign. While officially focused on the 2026 midterm elections, Newsom's appearances in the key early primary state included calls for Democrats to be more assertive against Donald Trump. He also addressed recent natural disasters with a non-partisan tone, contrasting with Republican criticism he has faced. The visit has drawn criticism from South Carolina's Republican Attorney General, highlighting the political lines being drawn for future contests.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expanded his aggressive trade policy by sending letters to at least six more countries, including the Philippines and Iraq, dictating new tariff rates on their imports. This follows a similar action days earlier where 14 other nations were informed of steep new tariffs, ranging from 20% to 40%, set to begin on August 1. The letters suggest the rates could be adjusted based on the U.S. relationship with each country. These actions resume a tariff strategy that was briefly paused for 90 days after causing significant turmoil in global markets earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's invitation to the leaders of Senegal, Mauritania, Gabon, Liberia, and Guinea-Bissau for White House talks reflects a significant shift in U.S. policy towards Africa. Analysts suggest the focus has moved from aid and development to a more transactional, "America First" approach centered on trade, security, and migration. The U.S. is likely seeking cooperation on curbing migration routes and Islamist insurgencies, while also competing with China and Russia for access to the continent's vast mineral resources. This "pure trade" diplomacy marks a departure from previous administrations' focus on poverty reduction and democratic initiatives.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Sues California Over Law Allowing Transgender Athlete Participation</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's law allowing transgender athletes to compete on teams matching their gender identity violates federal civil rights law. The suit alleges California is in violation of Title IX by discriminating against cisgender women and girls, a move that could jeopardize billions in federal education funding for the state. California officials have rejected the administration's demands, setting up a major legal battle over conflicting interpretations of sex-based discrimination. The lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction to block the state's policy, escalating a long-expected clash.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced it will issue administrative subpoenas to Harvard University for information on its foreign students, escalating a conflict over the school's visa program certification. The administration claims Harvard provided "insufficient" data regarding alleged "illegal and violent" activities by its international students. This action follows a federal judge's ruling that barred the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students. The administration has also threatened the university's accreditation, accusing it of failing to address antisemitism, part of a broader campaign against the institution since President Trump returned to office.</p>

          <p>Poland has reinstated border controls with Germany, mirroring Germany's own checks, creating new difficulties for the deeply integrated border cities of Slubice and Frankfurt an der Oder. The move is a response to Germany's toughened migration policy, but it disrupts the daily lives of thousands of commuters and strains the "without borders" spirit the region has cultivated. The situation is further complicated by the presence of self-proclaimed "citizen patrols" monitoring the border. This development is seen by some as another blow to the Schengen Agreement, threatening the freedom of travel that has been a cornerstone of European unity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the public inquiry into the UK's infected blood scandal states that victims are being "harmed further" by significant delays and "obvious injustices" in the government's compensation scheme. An estimated 30,000 people were infected with HIV and hepatitis from contaminated NHS blood products in the 1970s and 80s. Inquiry chair Sir Brian Langstaff criticized the government for its slow rollout of the £11.8 billion compensation fund, with only 460 people having received full payment so far. The report calls for urgent reforms, including allowing victims to apply directly rather than waiting for an invitation.</p>

          <p>Analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the moon's far side by China's Chang'e-6 mission suggests a massive asteroid impact over 4 billion years ago altered the lunar mantle. The research, published in the journal Nature, indicates the collision was powerful enough to create the solar system's largest crater and strip key chemical ingredients from the moon's deep interior. These findings provide new insights into the moon's violent early history and the formation of its distinct near and far sides.

          <p>Los Angeles is under fire for its method of fulfilling a legal settlement to reduce homeless encampments, with critics arguing the city is merely displacing people without providing housing. The city counts the removal of tents during sanitation cleanups toward its goal of clearing 9,800 encampments, even if the occupants are not offered shelter. A federal judge has ruled this practice violates the settlement agreement, stating that an offer of shelter or housing must accompany any encampment removal to be counted. The conflict highlights the immense challenge of addressing the city's homelessness crisis and the tension between public space management and providing permanent solutions.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has declined to rule out extending the current freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds beyond its planned 2028 end date. The freeze, introduced by the previous Conservative government, effectively raises taxes for millions as wage inflation pushes them into higher tax brackets. During Prime Minister's Questions, Starmer only committed to the pledges in Labour's manifesto, which did not include a specific promise on thresholds. This has fueled speculation that tax rises are likely, as the government faces pressure on its spending plans following U-turns on other fiscal policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's consideration of naming a "shadow chair" for the Federal Reserve long before the current chair's term ends is raising concerns about the central bank's political independence. Such a move is seen as an attempt to pressure the Fed into cutting interest rates to lower government debt-servicing costs, a departure from the Fed's dual mandate of stable inflation and full employment. Analysts warn that this could undermine the credibility of the eventual nominee, who might be perceived as a political appointee rather than an impartial steward of monetary policy, potentially unsettling financial markets.

          <p>The controversy surrounding former Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who was accused of inappropriate behavior, is symptomatic of a larger, systemic issue regarding Formula 1's attitude toward women. While the sport has seen explosive growth and attracted a larger female fanbase, critics argue that its institutions have failed to adequately address workplace culture and protect female employees. The handling of the Horner situation, which focused more on competitive implications than workplace safety, suggests that efforts to promote women in the sport, like the F1 Academy, may be superficial. This moment is seen as a pivotal test of F1's commitment to genuine cultural change.</p>
