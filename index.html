          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 06:22:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has approved its 18th sanctions package against Russia, notably lowering the price cap on Russian crude oil to further curtail Moscow's war funding. The new cap, set just above $47 per barrel, aims to limit revenue for Russia's war coffers while keeping its oil on the global market to prevent supply shortages. This move is part of a broader European effort to pressure Russia over the ongoing war in Ukraine and also includes sanctions against a major Russian refinery's operations in India. The measures demonstrate the EU's continued resolve to weaken Russia's economic and military capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 06:09:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article suggests Donald Trump's long-standing influence over his MAGA base may be weakening due to his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The author posits that unlike previous controversies, the Epstein scandal resonates deeply with a segment of his supporters who expected him to expose elite corruption. The piece notes that prominent MAGA influencers and podcasters are now openly criticizing Trump, indicating a potential shift in loyalty. This development suggests that even Trump's powerful narrative control has limits when faced with a deeply resonant and concrete issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary criticizes the Trump administration's decision to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Haitians, arguing it contradicts the dangerous reality on the ground. The author, a Human Rights Watch researcher, recounts recent experiences in Haiti, highlighting rampant gang violence, killings, and widespread displacement that make safe return impossible. The article points out the internal contradiction of the U.S. government simultaneously issuing travel warnings for its own citizens to leave Haiti. It calls for the continuation of TPS, framing it as a necessary humanitarian protection.</p>

          <p>Representative Addison McDowell has introduced the "BIDEN Act," a bill aimed at prohibiting the use of an autopen for a president's signature on critical documents like engrossed bills, executive orders, and pardons. The legislation asserts that only the president may physically sign such items and that any document signed by a machine would have no legal force or effect. McDowell stated the bill is intended to prevent "rogue bureaucrats" from seizing authority by taking advantage of a president. The move follows controversy and questions surrounding former President Biden's use of the device during his term.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appointed John Sarcone III as "special attorney to the attorney general" for New York's northern district, allowing him to retain power after federal judges rejected his permanent appointment as U.S. attorney. This move bypasses traditional Senate confirmation processes and has drawn scrutiny, particularly as Sarcone has faced questions about his credibility, including his residency and a disputed claim of being attacked by an undocumented immigrant. Critics suggest this is part of a pattern by the administration to work around oversight mechanisms and install preferred officials in key legal positions.</p>

          <p>At the behest of President Trump, the Texas Legislature is holding a special session to redraw the state's congressional map, aiming to increase the number of Republican-held seats in the U.S. House. The move comes mid-decade, an unusual step, and follows a Justice Department letter alleging that some current districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. While Republicans aim to solidify their narrow House majority, critics argue the redrawing is a political maneuver that could undermine the voting power of communities of color and face significant legal challenges. The effort highlights the high stakes of national politics influencing state-level legislative actions.</p>

          <p>In a podcast interview, veteran pollster Frank Luntz describes a profound crisis in American democracy, rooted in a complete breakdown of trust and an inability of citizens to listen to one another. He traces the start of this decline to the 2000 presidential election and notes that the anger and division he detected in 2014 were precursors to the rise of Donald Trump. Luntz expresses deep frustration, stating he no longer has a "road map" to fix the system, which he says rewards extremism.

          <p>This in-depth article profiles Harvard President Alan Garber, who is steering the university through a period of intense crisis, marked by internal debates over free speech and external pressure from the Trump administration. Initially an interim leader, Garber is now tackling campus illiberalism, which he believes fueled the anti-Semitism controversy, while simultaneously fighting the administration's threats to cut billions in federal funding. The piece portrays Garber as an institutionalist caught in a political firestorm, attempting to reform Harvard from within to address valid critiques while resisting what he sees as a government takeover.

          <p>This analysis explores two seemingly contradictory future scenarios: a world with labor shortages due to declining population and a world with mass job loss due to artificial intelligence. The article suggests that long-term economic growth is more dependent on innovation than population size, pointing to historical periods where progress surged despite slowing population growth. However, there is significant uncertainty about whether AI will be a transformative, productivity-boosting technology like electricity or merely an incremental one. The piece concludes that while the conversations around demographics and AI are often separate, their intersection will be crucial in shaping future economic policy and societal stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump's goal to hire 10,000 new ICE officers is facing skepticism from experts who point to significant logistical and ethical challenges. Historically, rapid, large-scale hiring sprees in federal law enforcement have struggled with long recruitment times and have sometimes resulted in lowered standards and increased corruption, as seen with a Border Patrol expansion in the mid-2000s. Experts note that recruiting is difficult today due to lower pay compared to local police and the sheer volume of applicants needed.

          <p>Sir Grant Shapps, the former U.K. Defence Secretary, has defended the government's decision to use a "super-injunction" to hide a massive data breach that exposed the personal details of thousands of Afghans who worked with Britain. He argued the secrecy was justified to save lives, as those on the list were at risk of being "murdered and executed" by the Taliban. The breach, which also included data on British officials and spies, occurred in 2022 but was not discovered until 2023, forcing the government to covertly launch a resettlement scheme for those affected. The injunction has since been lifted, revealing the scale of the error and the government's response.</p>

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is introducing the rules to prevent consumers from accumulating excessive debt, meaning some shoppers may be refused this type of credit. The currently unregulated sector, dominated by firms like Klarna and Clearpay, has seen rapid growth, but debt charities have warned of rising financial problems. The new rules will bring BNPL services in line with other forms of credit, requiring clear information and providing consumer recourse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deaths of children and staff at a Texas summer camp due to extreme weather, experts are urging parents to ask camps detailed questions about their safety protocols. With no federal standards for camps and varied state-level regulation, the American Camp Association and other experts advise parents to inquire about specific plans for heat, floods, and wildfires. Key questions include how camps manage hydration and heat exposure, whether they are located in a floodplain and have evacuation plans, and how they monitor air quality during wildfire season. This guidance aims to empower parents to assess risks as climate change increases these dangers.</p>

A parliamentary committee described the situation as "woeful," blaming weak regulation and years of underinvestment in infrastructure by the water industry.
