          <p>The latest Henley Passport Index names Singapore's passport as the most powerful in the world for 2025, granting visa-free access to 193 destinations.

European nations largely dominate the top ten, though Japan and South Korea also feature prominently near the top of the list, highlighting a shift in global travel freedom.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the UK's top counter-terrorism and crime agencies, including MI5, have issued a joint warning to parents about the risk of children being radicalized online during the summer holidays. The agencies report an increasing trend of young people being exposed to extreme content, including violence and terrorist material, leading to a desensitization to such content. Authorities are urging parents to implement online safety measures and discuss the dangers with their children, noting a concerning rise in terrorism-related arrests among individuals under 17.</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan have finalized a significant trade deal, which includes lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 25% to 15%. President Trump announced the agreement, stating it also involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and opens Japanese markets to American goods like rice and trucks. The deal is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and has already caused a surge in Japanese automaker stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey have removed interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal attorney to President Trump, from her position as the state's top federal prosecutor. The judges invoked a rarely used power to appoint her top assistant, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to the role. However, hours later, the Trump administration's Justice Department ousted Grace, with Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing the judges of being "rogue." The move has drawn condemnation from New Jersey's Democratic senators, who criticized the firing of a career public servant.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, who served as President Trump's border czar, strongly criticized Hunter Biden for recent comments comparing the Trump administration's immigration policies to Nazi Germany. During a podcast interview, Biden referred to Trump as a "thug" and described deportation plans as sending a marginalized group to "a prison camp in a foreign country." Homan dismissed the comments, crediting the Trump administration with creating the most secure border in U.S. history and highlighting an increase in the arrest of criminals compared to the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the 30-year-old accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in November 2022, has pleaded guilty, thereby avoiding the death penalty.

While some relatives expressed frustration, others found a sense of closure in avoiding a grueling trial. The case, which drew intense national media attention and online speculation, was solved after investigators used DNA from a knife sheath, cell phone data, and vehicle surveillance to identify Kohberger.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a history stretching back 250 years. Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that fought in the American War of Independence, it was later sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology, archival research, and a community-led effort by local islanders. The ship wrecked in 1788, and its surviving timbers are now being preserved with plans for a permanent display.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama's office issued a rare and forceful statement refuting President Donald Trump's accusation that he committed "treason." Trump claimed Obama orchestrated a "coup" by manufacturing evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election, a charge he based on a recently released document from the Director of National Intelligence. Obama's spokesperson called the allegations "bizarre," "ridiculous," and a "weak attempt at distraction," reaffirming the consensus that Russia did work to influence the election. The statement emphasized that these findings were confirmed by a bipartisan Senate report.</p>

          <p>Dozens of peacocks and peahens that were a signature feature of the historic Ryde Hotel in Northern California have gone missing, with staff believing they were stolen.

Recent attacks have resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths, with both sides accused of targeting non-combatants.

The author connects these removals to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's past writings, which express views that women are a distracting influence in the military, suggesting the administration is deliberately making the armed forces inhospitable to female service members.</p>
