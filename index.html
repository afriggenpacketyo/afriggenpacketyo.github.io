        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-led House narrowly passed President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a single vote after weeks of internal GOP negotiations. The bill, which includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and immigration spending, aims to fulfill Trump's domestic campaign promises. The passage was a victory for Speaker Mike Johnson, who faced sharp divisions within his conference. The bill now moves to the Senate, where revisions are expected due to opposition from some Republican Senators. Key changes to the bill include adjustments to Medicaid work requirements and an increase in the state and local tax deduction cap.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the South China Morning Post argues that China and the European Union must redefine their partnership to avoid lasting estrangement, especially given Donald Trump's potential return as US president. The article highlights Brussels' growing concerns over non-reciprocal market access, trade imbalances, and conflicting industrial policies. It suggests that Europe's scattered "de-risking" efforts and tariffs on electric vehicles have missed fundamental issues and fueled escalation. The author asserts that the global setting is entering a new phase, requiring concrete cooperation between China and the EU.</p>

          <p>Shares in Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, have experienced a significant rally, gaining nearly 80% this year, and analysts predict further growth. The surge follows upbeat earnings reports and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Xpeng's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, which helped narrow its net loss and improve its gross margin. Analysts anticipate Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of this year, citing strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models.</p>

          <p>The government is moving forward with sentencing reforms aimed at alleviating prison overcrowding, largely accepting recommendations from an Independent Sentencing Review. These reforms include earlier release for some offenders based on an "earned progression model," where good behavior is rewarded with early release after completing a third of their sentence. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has ruled out early releases for the most serious offenders, such as those incarcerated for violent, sexual, or terrorist offenses. Additionally, the government plans to expand a pilot scheme offering voluntary chemical castration to some sexual offenders.</p>

          <p>Rapper Kid Cudi, also known as Scott Mescudi, is expected to testify in Sean Combs' sex-trafficking and racketeering trial, providing details about an incident where his car was allegedly "blown up" following threats from Combs. Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, testified that Combs made angry threats after discovering her relationship with Mescudi in 2011. Combs' lawyers acknowledge physical abuse towards Ventura but deny the allegations of sexual coercion, asserting that any sexual activity was consensual. The trial involves accusations of running a criminal enterprise for two decades, including allegations of arson.</p>

New estimates showed 431,000 more people arrived in the UK than left over the 12-month period, compared to 860,000 a year earlier - the largest numerical drop on record. The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving.</p>
