          <h2>Homeland Security Ends Mandatory Shoe Removal for All US Airport Travelers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 18:16:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has officially ended the mandatory shoe removal policy at all U.S. airport security checkpoints, effective immediately. Secretary Kristi Noem announced that advancements in layered security, including new technology and the implementation of REAL ID, have made the nearly two-decade-old rule obsolete. While most travelers can now keep their shoes on, some individuals may still be asked to remove them for additional screening. The agency is also planning a pilot program for more streamlined checkpoints in the future, further aiming to improve the passenger experience while maintaining security standards.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire raging near Marseille, France's second-largest city, has injured at least 110 people, including nine firefighters. The blaze, which authorities believe was sparked by a car fire, spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry conditions, forcing the evacuation of at least 400 residents. Over 800 firefighters are battling the fire, which has not yet been contained and has prompted officials to urge residents to stay indoors. The fire temporarily shut down Marseille Provence airport and has burned approximately 700 hectares, creating what some residents described as an "apocalyptic" scene.</p>

          <h2>French Intelligence Chief Assesses Recent Strikes "Extremely Delayed" Iran's Nuclear Program</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to France's intelligence chief, Nicolas Lerner, recent American and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have "extremely delayed" Tehran's nuclear program by many months. In his first public remarks on the matter, Lerner stated that each stage of the program was "very seriously damaged." He also noted that while a small portion of Iran's highly enriched uranium was destroyed, the majority remains in the hands of Iranian authorities. The assessment comes as Iran has suspended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, limiting international oversight of its remaining nuclear stockpile.</p>

          <p>The murder of 31-year-old Aileen Seiden has uncovered a complex and abusive polyamorous relationship involving her, Zachary Abell, and Christina Araujo. Seiden was found dead after the trio checked into a Florida motel room, with investigators discovering a brutal crime scene. Friends of Seiden reported that she was a victim of physical abuse from both Abell and Araujo but was allegedly afraid to go to the police due to threats. Both Abell and Araujo were charged in Seiden's murder, though it took nearly six years for the case to proceed to trial against just one of them.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to at least 110 deaths, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, devastating communities and a girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, which reported at least 27 fatalities among its campers and counselors. A massive search and rescue operation is underway involving state and federal agencies, as officials have conducted hundreds of air rescues. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the region, and authorities are continuing to search the vast river system for victims while grappling with the scale of the destruction.</p>

          <p>Chicago Sky star Angel Reese is facing criticism after a video showed her slapping a clipboard out of a coach's hand during a timeout in a close game against the Washington Mystics. The incident occurred with less than 30 seconds left in the game, which the Sky ultimately lost. Reese appeared visibly upset as she walked off the court, and the clip quickly went viral on social media, drawing negative reactions from fans who viewed the act as disrespectful. Despite Reese's strong individual performance with 22 points and 15 rebounds, the Sky's loss dropped their record to 5-13.</p>

The plan assigned primary responsibility for ordering evacuations to the Kerrville Police Chief and Kerr County Sheriff.

          <p>A recently passed bill, touted as eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security, does not actually repeal the tax but instead introduces a new temporary deduction for seniors.

While the White House claims this will result in nearly 90% of beneficiaries paying no federal tax on their benefits, policy experts clarify the relief comes from the new deduction, not a change to how benefits themselves are taxed. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Savers Advised to Secure High CD Rates Before Potential Fed Rate Changes</h2>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting approaching at the end of July, savers are being encouraged to strategically lock in high certificate of deposit (CD) rates before a potential shift in the interest rate climate. The article suggests that individuals should carefully calculate how much they can deposit for a specific term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. To find the best returns, savers should shop at online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. Once a high-rate CD is found, it's crucial to lock it in promptly to protect earnings against possible future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Review: New 'Superman' Film Presents a Heroic but Unfocused Man of Steel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 16:24:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, reboots the hero as an earnest but somewhat obtuse figure, played by David Corenswet. The film pivots away from recent cynical takes on the character, aiming for a more sincere, if slightly goofy, tone where idealism is "the real punk rock." The plot is described as impatient and crowded, juggling Lex Luthor's schemes, a host of other DC characters, and the director's signature comedic style. While entertaining, the review suggests the film's tone shifts recklessly and struggles to be earnest, resulting in a hero who is more overwhelmed than inspiring.</p>

          <p>The California School for the Deaf has agreed to a $14 million settlement with a former student who was sexually abused for years by a dormitory attendant. The lawsuit alleged that the Fremont-based boarding school ignored numerous complaints and red flags about the employee, Ricardo Rose, over his 30-year tenure. The victim, who was 10 when the abuse began, was repeatedly sexually assaulted and threatened by Rose. The abuse came to light when the victim reported it as an adult, leading to Rose's conviction and the discovery of other potential victims.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Department of Justice and FBI review has concluded that Jeffrey Epstein did not possess a so-called "client list" that could implicate high-profile associates in his crimes. The investigation also reaffirmed the official finding that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell, directly contradicting widespread conspiracy theories about his death. According to the memo, investigators found "no credible evidence" that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals and uncovered no information that would warrant new investigations into uncharged third parties. The findings were met with skepticism by some who had anticipated major new revelations.</p>

          <p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have charged four men, two of whom are active members of the Canadian Armed Forces, over an alleged plot to form an anti-government militia. The group is accused of conducting military-style training and planning to "forcibly" seize land in the Québec City area. A police search uncovered a significant cache of explosive devices, dozens of firearms, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The arrests come amid growing pressure on the Canadian military to address extremism within its ranks, as a recent report found rising ties to extremist groups.</p>

          <p>The annual cost of the UK's state pension triple lock is projected to be three times higher than originally estimated by the end of the decade, reaching £15.5 billion by 2030. The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, attributes the rising cost to higher-than-expected inflation and wage volatility. The report warns that the UK's public finances are in a "vulnerable position," with rising debt exacerbated by age-related spending pressures and recent reversals of planned spending cuts. Despite the warning, the government stated it remains "committed" to the triple lock policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of major cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid, this article analyzes the long-standing debate over whether universal programs like Social Security are more politically durable. It argues that the political strength of Social Security and Medicare may stem more from benefiting the elderly, a powerful voting bloc, rather than their universal nature, pointing to cuts in the universal unemployment insurance program. While acknowledging the policy benefits of universal programs, the analysis suggests that establishing them is politically challenging due to public aversion to the necessary tax increases, a problem exacerbated by the new legislation.

According to the complaint, Orso, who had a known heart condition, was still significantly intoxicated when released.
