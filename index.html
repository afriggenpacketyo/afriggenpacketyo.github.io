          <h2>Trump Aims to Reshape College Accreditation with Executive Order</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 19:19:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order targeting college accreditation, emphasizing "results" over "woke ideology." The order directs the Department of Education to hold accreditors accountable and potentially recognize new agencies, focusing on merit and outcomes. Trump also wants scrutiny of students' math capabilities at prestigious universities like Harvard and Yale, and is pushing for stricter enforcement of laws requiring universities to disclose large foreign gifts, alleging Harvard has violated these laws. These actions come amid escalating tensions between the Trump administration and several universities over funding and policies, with Harvard facing a lawsuit over frozen federal funding.

          <p>A coalition of a dozen states has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging the legality of his newly imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The states argue that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump has cited. This legal action follows a similar suit filed by small businesses, arguing that the tariffs disrupt the constitutional order and harm the American economy. The states contend that tariffs are a tax that will be passed on to consumers, impacting their economies negatively. (not investment advice)</p>

This method has the potential to improve the lives of adults with severe allergies, providing protection against accidental exposure and allowing them to take control of their condition.</p>

          <p>A Dartmouth College study estimates that emissions from 111 fossil fuel companies caused $28 trillion in climate damage between 1991 and 2020. The study presents a method for directly linking emissions to specific climate harms, aiming to hold companies accountable for extreme weather costs. The research attributes about a third of the total cost to five companies: Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP.

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has steadily declined during his first three months in office, according to polling averages. His approval has fallen to around 45 percent, a decrease from 52 percent shortly after his inauguration. Disapproval of his performance now stands at approximately half of the country. While presidential approval ratings typically decline over time, Trump's drop has been slightly faster than that of his predecessors. Trump began his term with one of the lowest approval ratings in modern history.</p>

          <p>Israel's military initially claimed that emergency vehicles were "advancing suspiciously" toward troops, and were eliminated for being Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. After days of investigation and a leaked audio recording, Israel has changed its story regarding an attack on rescue workers in Gaza. The military now attributes the incident to an "operational misunderstanding" and professional failures. This acknowledgment of failure is rare in the context of the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in a high number of civilian casualties.</p>
