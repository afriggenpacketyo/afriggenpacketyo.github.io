          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft resigned from her position as a government whip, citing concerns over proposed cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed understanding for the need to address the rising welfare bill, but disagreed with targeting personal independence payments and universal credit. She felt unable to effect change from within the government and criticized the lack of desired amendments to the bill. The government responded that its reforms aim to fix a broken system and support those who can and want to work, while protecting the most vulnerable.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, nicknamed "razor blade throat" due to its symptom of a severe sore throat, is being monitored by health officials. The variant, derived from Omicron, has been detected in multiple states and is the second most dominant in the U.S., accounting for approximately 37% of cases. Experts indicate the variant appears more transmissible due to changes in its spike protein, but it doesn't seem to cause more severe illness or increase hospitalization rates. Health experts recommend updated vaccinations, practicing good hygiene, and considering masks in crowded areas.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that despite Donald Trump's perceived geopolitical advantages as commander-in-chief, he has struggled to translate them into tangible achievements. The author contrasts Trump's initial boasting to Volodymyr Zelensky with the current strategic landscape, where Ukraine has seized the initiative against Russia. Trump's promises of deals with Russia and Iran have not materialized, and traditional conflict zones have escalated. The piece suggests that having resources is different from skillfully using them, leading to new strategic quagmires.</p>

The storm's center was located 35 miles north-northeast of Acapulco, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. Erick is expected to dissipate overnight, although it initially reached Category 4 status with 140 mph winds before landfall, impacting areas previously devastated by Hurricane Otis.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests a passing star could cause more havoc to our solar system than previously thought, potentially disrupting the orbits of planets, including Earth. Researchers used computer simulations to indicate that isolated models of the solar system can underestimate the degree of future orbital changes. Over billions of years, stars could destabilize objects like Pluto, and increase the risk of instability for Mercury, Mars, and even Earth. While the chances of such a collision are low, they are higher than previously estimated.</p>

          <p>A study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are reducing shoreline pollution, with areas enacting such policies experiencing a decrease of up to 47% in plastic bag waste collected during cleanups. The effectiveness of these policies varies, with fee-based approaches proving more successful than partial bans. California's initial ban, while well-intended, led to an increase in thicker plastic bag waste due to loopholes. The study also suggests that bag laws may reduce harm to marine life, with a decrease in entangled animals in areas with such policies.</p>
