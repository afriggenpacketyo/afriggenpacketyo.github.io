          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has officially formed in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the sixth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin. Forecasters predict it will remain over open waters, strengthening into a hurricane by Monday before gradually weakening on Tuesday. Located approximately 405 miles south-southeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, it is currently moving north at 10 mph, and is expected to move well east of Bermuda. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had previously forecast an above-normal hurricane season this year, anticipating between 13 and 18 named storms, with five to nine expected to become hurricanes.</p>

          <p>Max Dowman, a remarkable 15-year-old talent, delivered a dazzling Premier League debut for Arsenal against Leeds, becoming the club's second-youngest player. The midfielder, who has trained with the first team since age 14, showcased exceptional skill, winning two penalties and exciting the home crowd with weaving runs. Manager Mikel Arteta highly praised Dowman's maturity, stability, and hunger, noting he has never witnessed such conviction in a 15-year-old to deliver on the field. With potential injuries to key players like Bukayo Saka, more significant opportunities may arise for the promising young winger in what could be his breakthrough season.</p>

          <p>Former reality TV star Kate Gosselin addressed persistent rumors during a TikTok Live, strongly denying allegations that she stole her children's college money. She affirmed that all her children have more than sufficient funds for college, stating the accusations are entirely false and never happened. Gosselin also dispelled rumors of estrangement from her daughter Hannah, confirming they maintain regular contact and Hannah visits frequently. Currently working grueling 12-hour shifts as a pediatric nurse, she explained her reality TV earnings were largely spent on supporting eight children, covering their college funds, and enduring substantial legal fees from constant court battles.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes and shootings killed at least 33 people in Gaza, including Palestinians sheltering in tents and seeking food aid, as the world confronted an exceptional announcement of famine gripping Gaza City. This dire determination by the IPC intensified international pleas for Israel to halt its 22-month offensive, prompted by Hamas's 2023 attacks. Israel denounced the famine declaration as false, while pressing ahead with preparations to seize Gaza City, and ceasefire efforts remain on hold. Aid groups warn of insufficient food, with nearly half a million facing catastrophic hunger exacerbated by displacement and collapsed food production.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies ace Zack Wheeler will be sidelined for six to eight months after being diagnosed with venous thoracic outlet syndrome and requiring additional surgery. This procedure follows an initial surgery on August 18 to remove a blood clot from his upper right arm, and a second opinion recommended the thoracic outlet decompression surgery. Such an extensive recovery period threatens Wheeler’s ability to start the 2026 season on time.

          <p>Jailed associate Ghislaine Maxwell, in newly released interview transcripts with US officials, denied witnessing any inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. She also asserted that a much-discussed "client list" related to Jeffrey Epstein does not exist. The interview, conducted while she seeks a pardon and appeals her conviction, drew outrage from Virginia Giuffre's family, who accused the government of giving Maxwell a platform to rewrite history. Maxwell additionally called allegations against Prince Andrew "mind-blowingly not conceivable" and claimed a widely circulated photo involving him and an underage girl was fake, despite settling with Giuffre in 2022.</p>

          <p>Rams second-round draft pick Terrance Ferguson made an impressive preseason debut against the Browns, showcasing his potential as the heir apparent to veteran tight end Tyler Higbee. After missing the first two preseason games due to a hamstring injury, Ferguson delivered a significant 33-yard over-the-shoulder catch and a subsequent 15-yard gain. Coach Sean McVay praised Ferguson's performance, noting his "nice pace to his game" and expressing satisfaction with getting him on the field. This strong showing suggests Ferguson will be a significant factor in the tight end group, which also includes Colby Parkinson and Davis Allen, as the team looks to finalize its 53-man roster.</p>

The ruling expands previous restrictions, asserting that the administration's executive order to cut funds based on local immigration policies is likely unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers. Sanctuary policies typically limit local resources for federal immigration enforcement, not prohibiting federal action or judicial warrants. The White House stated it expects to ultimately win on appeal, arguing sanctuary cities impede law enforcement and endanger American citizens, but the injunction protects the jurisdictions for now.</p>

          <p>David Mackenzie's "Relay" is a smart, paranoid thriller featuring Riz Ahmed as Ash, a solitary off-the-grid fixer who helps potential whistleblowers disappear using a unique text-telephone relay service. The article praises the film's nifty premise, which updates the 1970s paranoid thriller genre for the digital age, focusing on escaping dangerously far-reaching entities rather than assassins. The plot follows Ash's efforts to protect a rattled biotech scientist, Sarah, in a "dizzyingly enjoyable" cat-and-mouse chase through New York. The review highlights the film's exploration of modern anxieties and the profound loneliness inherent in such a covert crusade.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is at the forefront of global efforts to prevent species extinction, housing over 20 threatened species on its sprawling 32,000-acre facility. Scientists at SCBI conduct critical research into reproduction, ecology, and genetics, aiming to breed and reintroduce animals like the Przewalski's horse and black-footed ferret back into their natural habitats. Despite successes, conservation biologists remain deeply concerned about the accelerating rate of species loss, emphasizing the cascading ecological effects when any species vanishes. The institute also plays a vital role in training future conservationists, offering hope for biodiversity preservation.</p>

          <p>Thomas Frank, Tottenham's new manager, has made an impressive start, leading the team to consecutive wins and clean sheets, despite widespread supporter discontent over the club's summer transfer window. Replacing Ange Postecoglou, Frank's tactical approach, balancing defensive solidity with attacking freedom, has quickly won over fans and pundits. The article suggests that securing Frank from Brentford might be chairman Daniel Levy's most significant achievement this summer, especially after the collapse of deals for key transfer targets like Eberechi Eze. Midfielder Joao Palhinha, another new signing, has also excelled under Frank's leadership, earning player of the match honors.</p>

Diplomatic incidents between Russia and Azerbaijan, alongside a perceived weakening of Russia's superpower image, have emboldened these states to pursue multi-vector foreign policies.

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has declared a decades-old grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) unconstitutional, aligning with a lawsuit seeking to terminate the funding. The program, which allocates grants to colleges with at least 25% Hispanic undergraduates, was established to address lower college attendance and graduation rates among Latino students. Citing the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action, the Justice Department argues the program grants an unconstitutional advantage based on ethnicity. This move is opposed by HSI associations, who contend the grants are crucial for equitable funding and are open to students of all races.</p>

Speaking at a Christian Democratic Union party conference, Merz acknowledged the difficulty for his Social Democrat coalition partners but urged cooperation on reforming the social insurance system due to rising costs and budget gaps. This stance sets the stage for potential contention, as SPD Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil has suggested tax increases for higher earners and emphasizes imaginative solutions over mere benefit cuts.
