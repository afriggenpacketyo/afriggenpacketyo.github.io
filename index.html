          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have signed veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen to a one-year deal valued at $8.52 million, bringing the franchise's second all-time leading receiver back to the team. Allen, who spent last season with the Chicago Bears after a salary-cap related trade, is expected to bolster a receiving corps in need of experience following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. The six-time Pro Bowl selection joins a group led by Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston, providing a reliable target for quarterback Justin Herbert.</p>

Sources familiar with the matter indicate the Trump administration is considering a public release of the interview transcripts and a possible audio recording. The meeting was reportedly requested by Maxwell, who is appealing her conviction and seeking a potential presidential pardon, while Trump has stated any discussions were "totally above board."</p>

          <p>An analysis by CBS News suggests that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a Trump administration initiative, has significantly overstated its cost-cutting achievements. The review focused on three large contract cancellations from the Department of Health and Human Services related to pandemic-era programs, finding the actual savings were approximately $165 million, less than 3% of the $6.4 billion claimed by DOGE. Critics argue the agency engages in "transparency theater" by reporting potential contract values as realized savings, while the reported cuts to agencies like USAID could have severe humanitarian consequences.

          <p>Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is formally urging President Trump to commute the seven-year federal prison sentence of former Congressman George Santos. In a letter to the Pardon Attorney, Greene described the sentence for wire fraud and identity theft as an "abusive overreach," arguing that other members of Congress have committed "far worse offenses" without facing criminal charges. Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023 after fabricating large parts of his background and pleading guilty to financial crimes, has expressed remorse and accepted responsibility for his actions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the fatal 2023 Titan submersible implosion has concluded the tragedy was "preventable" and resulted from OceanGate's use of "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory oversight. The report found that the company operated outside established deep-sea protocols, ignored warnings about the vessel's compromised hull, and fostered a "toxic" safety culture under the overconfident leadership of CEO Stockton Rush. Investigators stated that the vessel's design and testing processes were fundamentally flawed, ultimately leading to the catastrophic implosion that killed all five people aboard during its descent to the Titanic wreckage.</p>

The disease is spread to humans through the feces of infected fleas, which are often carried by animals like rats, opossums, and stray cats. Health departments have issued guidance on prevention, urging residents to use flea control on pets, secure trash, and avoid contact with wild or stray animals. Symptoms include fever, headache, and a rash, and while treatable with antibiotics, the illness has led to hospitalizations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has decided not to pursue the death penalty against three high-profile alleged Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 torture and murder of a DEA agent, while Zambada is charged with leading a powerful faction of the Sinaloa cartel. The decision is notable given that Mexico typically requires assurances against capital punishment for extraditions, but Zambada was not formally extradited, leaving the option open until now.</p>

The article explains that the atmosphere is a "chaotic system," where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, a concept known as the Butterfly Effect. Communicating vast amounts of data and uncertainty in a concise format for TV or apps also presents a challenge. While forecasters are now more accurate than ever, the difficulty of predicting weather for small geographic areas and the public's rising expectations contribute to the occasional sense of a missed forecast.</p>

Zara, which has since removed the images, stated that both models had provided medical certificates confirming their good health.

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued a series of subpoenas as part of its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case, demanding records from the Department of Justice. The bipartisan committee also subpoenaed several high-profile individuals for testimony, including former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and multiple former attorneys general and FBI directors. The move seeks to scrutinize the federal government's handling of the investigation and prosecution of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, escalating a congressional inquiry that risks a clash with the White House.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing a White House task force for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, naming himself as its chair. This move signals a potentially more active role for a sitting president in Olympic planning than has been traditional. At an announcement event, Trump also stated he would use the National Guard or military if necessary to ensure the Games' security, a comment that may prove contentious following the recent deployment of troops to Los Angeles for immigration enforcement. The task force will coordinate federal efforts on security and transportation for the event.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that missed analyst expectations, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. While overall revenue grew 32% year-over-year, the company's AI business revenue declined, which CEO Lisa Su attributed to U.S. export restrictions that eliminated sales of its MI308 chip to China. The company is transitioning to its next generation of AI chips, the Instinct MI400 and MI350, and noted strong growth in its data center and gaming segments, but the impact of the China export controls weighed on its performance.

          <p>Escalating trade tensions between the United States and India are casting doubt on a planned visit by President Trump this fall and potentially weakening the Quad strategic alliance. The White House has been seeking significant "deliverables" for Trump to announce, but without a trade breakthrough, the visit is reportedly unlikely to happen. Recent tariff threats and criticism from Trump have reportedly left New Delhi feeling "bitter," straining a key relationship in the Indo-Pacific region that is meant to counter China's growing influence.</p>

          <p>Snap's stock price dropped significantly after the company reported second-quarter financial results that included a key miss on its global average revenue per user (ARPU). While daily active users grew, the amount of advertising revenue generated from each user fell short of expectations, a worrying sign when some social media peers are seeing strong results. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weaker topline growth to a flawed advertising platform update, the timing of Ramadan, and changes in trade policy. The company's net loss also widened compared to the same quarter last year. (not investment advice)</p>

With significant funding from the Department of Defence, the U.S. aims to rebuild its domestic supply chain for these critical minerals, addressing a strategic vulnerability highlighted by geopolitical and trade tensions with China.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has announced a proposal to streamline the process for companies to use drones for commercial purposes, such as deliveries and inspections. The new rules would create a clearer pathway for businesses to operate drones beyond an operator's line of sight, a practice that previously required a complicated case-by-case waiver process. Under the proposal, commercial drones would need to meet specific safety standards, including having collision avoidance technology, and would be restricted from flying over large public gatherings. The move aims to foster innovation and help the U.S. catch up with other countries in commercial drone deployment.</p>
