          <p>Texas Democratic legislators have fled the state in a strategic move to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by former President Trump, would significantly expand the GOP's advantage in the state's districts. Democrats have criticized the move as a power grab, arguing that disaster relief for recent flood victims should be the legislature's priority, not what they term a 'Trump gerrymander.' This action echoes previous quorum breaks in Texas politics over contentious issues like redistricting.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake was felt across parts of New Jersey and New York City, causing brief shaking but no significant damage or injuries. The quake's epicenter was located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Residents reported feeling a loud boom and a shake, with some comparing it to a vehicle hitting their house. This event follows a more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the region in April, though officials noted such occurrences remain relatively rare for the East Coast.</p>

He argues that both nations have reasons to cooperate and that a measure of rationality should prevail, though he does not foresee a quiet period. Sachs advises that from a long-term perspective, China should focus its export growth on markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rather than the U.S. or Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident, which was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor, brings the total death toll to six, including one person killed at the time of the collapse. The state-owned mining company Codelco expressed its condolences as authorities announced a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy at the world's largest underground copper mine.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, just days after a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region. The eruption sent a plume of ash and gas thousands of feet into the air, prompting an aviation alert. Seismologists suggest the powerful earthquake may have acted as a trigger, shaking loose the magma system of a volcano that was already primed to erupt, though the area is sparsely populated.</p>
