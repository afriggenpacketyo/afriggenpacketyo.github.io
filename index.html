        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration plans to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), a key scientific body. This move is part of a broader plan to reduce the EPA's staff by 23%, which the administration claims will save money and streamline operations by creating a new "Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions." Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, arguing it will cripple the agency's ability to use science in policymaking and have long-term negative impacts on public health and safety. The closure of ORD has been described by opponents as a "travesty" that will leave the EPA "flying blind."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships argues that teaching "self-connection" is the single most important skill for a child's success. This involves helping children understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice, which builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently dismiss a child's feelings, eroding their self-trust over time. Instead, parents are advised to validate emotions, welcome all aspects of their child's personality, and model their own emotional regulation to foster this essential life skill.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, outlines the precarious situation for American businesses operating in China amid ongoing trade tensions. He suggests that a 90-day pause on new tariffs is likely to be extended, as the alternative of returning to high tariffs is undesirable for both nations. While recent Chinese actions on fentanyl precursors could lead to a reduction in some US tariffs, the business community remains concerned that discussions are overly focused on tariffs rather than broader trade normalization. The interview highlights the complex tightrope American companies must walk to maintain their presence in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the cancellation of plea deals for the defendants in the 9/11 military tribunals, the future of the long-stalled cases at Guantanamo Bay is uncertain. Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck explains the current legal landscape and the potential next steps for the trials. The collapse of the plea agreements, which would have taken the death penalty off the table, reopens complex legal and procedural questions. This development marks another significant delay in the effort to bring justice for the September 11th attacks, with the path forward remaining unclear.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after a tragic accident involving an MRI machine at a medical facility on Long Island, New York. The man, identified by his wife as Keith McAllister, was wearing a heavy 20-pound metallic chain used for weight training when he entered the MRI room. The machine's powerful magnet pulled him in, causing a fatal "medical episode." His wife stated she had asked him to enter the room to help her up after her scan. The incident highlights the extreme dangers of bringing metal objects near active MRI machines, which generate powerful magnetic fields.</p>

This initiative is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces intense public scrutiny over rising bills and sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has pledged to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new watchdog will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes, bringing the water sector in line with other utilities that have a single point of contact for consumer grievances.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Australia is potentially sabotaging its own efforts to stabilize its relationship with China. While Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit to China was portrayed positively by Chinese media, the author contends that actions and rhetoric back home are counterproductive. Specifically, the framing of the Darwin Port sale as a defiance of Chinese threats is seen as undermining attempts to attract Chinese investment. The piece suggests that a focus on confrontation over cooperation could hinder the progress made during diplomatic engagements, creating an unreliable image for potential Chinese partners.

This has impacted local businesses and the community's social fabric.

          <p>Following a week of deadly sectarian violence in southern Syria, Bedouin fighters have agreed to a ceasefire with the Druze community but have not ruled out a return to hostilities. The clashes, which also involved Syrian government forces and Israeli air strikes supporting the Druze, have resulted in over 1,120 deaths and displaced more than 128,000 people. Bedouin fighters have retreated from the city of Suweida but are demanding the release of their injured members, whom they consider hostages. The situation remains tense, with a fragile calm prevailing amid widespread destruction and deep-seated mistrust between the communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that the Washington Commanders NFL team should revert to its former name, the "Redskins," a term widely considered a slur against Native Americans. He threatened to block a deal for the team to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., on federally controlled land unless the name change occurs. In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the old name and that the heritage of Native Americans is being "systematically taken away." This intervention adds a new political dimension to the team's complex efforts to return to a stadium in the nation's capital.</p>

In a podcast interview, Wolff described a common look of long hair, skirts above the knee, and high boots, suggesting that many of these women resemble Melania Trump. He mentioned past and present aides like Hope Hicks and Alina Habba as examples of this trend. Wolff made these observations based on the extensive access he was granted to the White House during his research, where he noted a pattern in the appearance of the women hired.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed that August 1 is a "hard deadline" for new U.S. tariffs to take effect on imported goods, though he noted that negotiations can continue after that date. Speaking on Sunday, Lutnick clarified that many smaller nations in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa will face a baseline tariff of 10%. However, he stated that larger economies will either have to open their markets to American businesses or face higher tariffs. This announcement provides some clarity for trading partners who have been engaged in last-minute negotiations to avoid or lower the steep levies proposed by the Trump administration.
