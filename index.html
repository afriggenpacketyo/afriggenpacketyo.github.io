            <p>Some American tourists in Paris are experiencing a sense of shame and embarrassment due to President Trump's trade policies. Some tourists are concealing American symbols, while others are altering their attire to avoid unwanted attention. This sentiment is reflected in a decrease in orders for travel guides about the US and a predicted drop in French tourism to the country. While some argue this is a media narrative, others acknowledge volatility due to the tariffs, highlighting a potential strain in transatlantic relations.</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey has filed a lawsuit to block President Trump's executive order targeting the firm, calling it unconstitutional. The firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its case against Fox News, alleges that Trump is retaliating against them for defending the integrity of the 2020 election. The executive order seeks to block the firm's access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. Susman Godfrey argues that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies.</p>

            <p>A small plane crash in Boca Raton, Florida, resulted in the deaths of three people and injuries to another. The Cessna 310 crashed near I-95 after departing from Boca Raton Airport, bound for Tallahassee International Airport. The crash caused significant disruptions, including road closures and suspension of train services. Witnesses reported seeing the plane experiencing trouble before the crash, and aviation experts suggest a flight control issue may have contributed to the accident.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil, a legal US resident, has not been charged with a crime, but the government cited a Cold War-era immigration law, claiming his presence is adverse to American foreign policy interests. The ACLU described the decision as "pre-written," stating that it was based solely on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio targeting Khalil's speech. Khalil's legal team plans to appeal the order.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has ended temporary protected status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans in the U.S., potentially leading to their deportation. The decision, made by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, affects over 9,000 Afghans who were previously granted TPS due to the turmoil in their home country. Critics argue that conditions in Afghanistan have not improved and that the decision undermines America's commitment to its allies. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to overhaul immigration policy.</p>

While the US has paused some tariffs, the continued escalation of the trade war poses a significant threat to African economies dependent on trade with both the US and China.</p>
