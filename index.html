Ukrainian authorities reported the attack, which damaged three floors of the tower block, trapping some residents. While Moscow has not commented, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down over 40 Ukrainian drones in a separate overnight operation. The article notes that long-range drone strikes have become a defining feature of the ongoing war, with both sides developing more advanced weaponry.</p>

          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary has revealed a significant rift within the Democratic party, prompting concern among moderate business leaders and politicians. In response, some are strategizing to support an independent candidate to challenge Mamdani in the general election, with figures like billionaire Bill Ackman pledging financial backing. However, progressive leaders like former Mayor Bill de Blasio argue the victory shows Mamdani's policies align with the majority of voters. Mamdani has expressed a commitment to meeting with all stakeholders, including concerned business executives, to move the city forward.</p>

The procession honored key figures like Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami, who were among over 1,000 Iranians killed in the war. Israel stated its campaign was aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear program, claiming it killed 30 commanders and 11 scientists. The ceremonies represent Iran's first public mourning for its high-ranking officials since a ceasefire was declared, with officials vowing a strong response to the attacks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a crucial test vote on President Trump's major tax and spending package, though its passage remains uncertain due to internal Republican disputes and procedural hurdles. The legislation proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs to fund tax reductions and increased defense and immigration spending. The final text was released late Friday, giving senators little time for review before the vote. The bill's progression has been complicated by rulings from the Senate parliamentarian, who determined that some controversial provisions violate reconciliation rules and must be altered or removed.

          <p>Following a backbench rebellion that forced a U-turn on welfare cuts, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described fixing the nation's benefits system as a "moral imperative." Speaking at the Welsh Labour Party conference, he asserted the system is broken and failing people, but promised reforms would be done "in a Labour way," without removing the essential safety net. The government conceded on its initial plans, which would have made it harder to claim certain disability benefits, but some MPs and unions are pushing for more significant changes or for the proposal to be scrapped entirely.</p>

In an interview, he stated that the political path "would be an easy one" but expressed hesitation about subjecting his family to the intense scrutiny and "brutality" of the political system. While he has primarily focused on the family business, he remarked that he is unimpressed with many current politicians. He also defended his family against accusations of profiting from the presidency, claiming the personal and financial toll has been "astronomical."</p>

          <p>Pakistan and Iran are escalating the forced deportation of Afghan refugees, sending thousands back to a country grappling with a severe humanitarian crisis. Many of these refugees have lived in the host countries for decades and are returning with nothing, facing food shortages and a lack of basic services. The situation is worsened by significant cuts in international aid to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power.

The author uses the example of a recent shooting of Minnesota politicians, a major story that quickly faded from the news cycle in favor of the international conflict. While acknowledging the importance of covering the president's actions, the article contends that the media's tendency to prioritize war stories benefits politicians seeking to command public attention. This dynamic ultimately leaves crucial topics like gun violence, voting rights, and other domestic crises underreported.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that personal debt is a significant factor shaping the career paths and job choices of many Americans. According to the report, approximately 38% of respondents have taken a second job to manage their debts, while a similar percentage accepted positions they were not interested in or were outside their field simply to repay balances. The data, which shows credit card debt is the most common liability, suggests that financial obligations are preventing individuals from pursuing entrepreneurial ambitions or further education. Career experts advise that while a side job is a short-term fix, focusing on long-term income growth is a more sustainable strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Aid groups like Doctors Without Borders have condemned the distribution system, which operates in militarized zones, calling it a "slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid" that must be dismantled.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift driven by the war in Ukraine and pressure from allies, Germany is planning a massive increase in defense spending to build the largest military in Europe. The government intends to change its constitution to allow for increased borrowing, aiming to spend 3.5% of its GDP on defense over the next decade. This move marks a historic departure from Germany's post-war policy of military restraint. The plan includes a special fund of over $100 billion and is intended to rebuild the nation's armed forces and meet NATO commitments without cutting social programs.</p>

          <p>Despite Kentucky being a staunchly pro-Trump state, its most prominent Republican congressional members have become a rare center of resistance to the president's agenda. Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, along with Representative Thomas Massie, have opposed Trump on key issues like tariffs, executive power, and foreign policy, drawing the ire of the president and his base. This article explores the unique political landscape of Kentucky, where libertarian and institutionalist factions of the GOP coexist, creating a dynamic unlike most other red states. The ongoing clashes are frustrating Trump's supporters and setting the stage for contentious future primary battles.</p>

The lawsuits allege that an improperly grounded pylon caused both fires, which resulted in destroyed homes and at least one death. Edison denies its equipment caused the 2019 fire and has characterized the lawyers' theories as preposterous, while facing ongoing scrutiny for its maintenance practices.</p>

          <p>Following devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County, many residents are interested in rebuilding their homes with fire-resistant and sustainable natural materials like adobe and straw bale. However, some architects and engineers report that navigating the county's approval process for these alternative materials is onerously complex and uncertain. While county officials express openness to innovative construction, advocates say the lack of clear guidelines and potentially expensive testing requirements make it a risky choice for fire victims. This has created a conflict between the desire for resilient, climate-friendly housing and the practical challenges of a cautious regulatory system.</p>

          <p>In a significant local political outcome, voters in Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public library system. The measures successfully blocked a controversial proposal to create a parent review board for children's books and prevented the potential privatization of the city's libraries. This result is viewed as a rebuke to the city's conservative-majority council, which had pushed for these changes, and is being celebrated by local activists as a victory for community organizing. The campaign's success suggests that even in conservative-leaning areas, there are limits to the reach of culture war politics.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1972 murder trial and wrongful conviction of Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a Black Panther Party leader in Los Angeles. Defended by a young Johnnie Cochran, Pratt was sentenced to life in prison based on questionable witness testimony and hidden evidence, a case Cochran later called a zone of "deceit" and "official corruption." The conviction was finally overturned after 27 years when it was revealed that authorities, including the FBI under its COINTELPRO program, had concealed evidence of their star witness being an informant. The case stands as a stark example of how the justice system was weaponized against perceived subversives.</p>

          <p>California's legal challenge against President Trump's deployment of troops in Los Angeles centers on the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, a law that prohibits using the military for civilian law enforcement. A federal judge has ordered the government to provide evidence regarding the troops' activities to determine if they are violating the act. The law originated in the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, passed by Southern Democrats to prevent federal troops from protecting Black voters from white supremacist violence. Now, this historically complex statute is at the forefront of a modern battle over executive power and the role of the military on U.S. soil.</p>

The author contends that the history of the gay rights movement, from the Stonewall Riots led by drag queens to the first out political candidates, has always been rooted in diversity and challenging norms. The piece asserts that the true spirit of Pride is about collective progress and celebrating all facets of the community, not about conforming to mainstream expectations to gain acceptance.
