          <p>Actress Loni Anderson, best known for her iconic role as the intelligent and savvy receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on the classic sitcom "WKRP in Cincinnati," has died at the age of 79. Her family confirmed she passed away in a Los Angeles hospital following a prolonged illness, just days before her 80th birthday. Anderson's portrayal of Marlowe, which defied "dumb blonde" stereotypes, earned her two Emmy and three Golden Globe nominations. She was also a prominent public figure due to her high-profile marriage to actor Burt Reynolds and her 1995 autobiography, "My Life in High Heels."</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech startups Innovent and BeOne are expected to reach profitability in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's burgeoning biopharmaceutical industry. According to analyst projections, Innovent is forecast to post its first full-year profit, driven by strong anticipated sales of its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide. This development signals a maturation of China's biotech sector, indicating that these companies are becoming financially self-sustaining and creating value without constant reliance on investor funding. The success highlights a key transition from pre-revenue startups to profitable enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Office has committed an extra £100 million to intensify its crackdown on illegal people-smuggling gangs operating across the English Channel as crossings reach record highs. The new funding is designated to support the National Crime Agency (NCA) with up to 300 additional officers and advanced surveillance technology to track and disrupt the criminal networks. In a further deterrent measure, the government also plans to introduce a new criminal offense, with penalties of up to five years in prison, for anyone who creates and publishes online material advertising illegal crossings.</p>

The incident, involving a collision between the camp's sailboat and a barge in Biscayne Bay, had previously claimed the lives of two other girls, 7-year-old Mila Yankelevich and 13-year-old Erin Ko Han. A fourth girl was also injured but has since been released from the hospital.

          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz has left seven inmates dead and eleven others injured, according to regional authorities. The unrest, which included fires within the facility, reportedly began on Saturday due to inmate anger over alleged extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization. This event highlights ongoing systemic issues within Mexico's prison system, including severe overcrowding and the significant influence of cartels and gangs. Security forces have since intervened to restore order at the over-capacity prison.</p>

          <p>Eight decades after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, efforts to find the remains of the missing continue on the nearby island of Ninoshima. In the chaotic aftermath of the 1945 attack, thousands of dead and dying victims were transported to the island, with many buried in unmarked mass graves. Researchers and volunteers are still unearthing remains, including the jaw bone of an infant, driven by a desire to provide closure for families and honor the victims. The ongoing search underscores the lasting trauma of the event and the commitment to ensuring the war is truly over for those still unaccounted for.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a new system to dramatically increase the survival rate of combat drones against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small or medium-sized drones with compact, side-mounted rocket boosters. These boosters would allow the drone to perform sudden, high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers in the final moments before an impact, making it difficult for even advanced missiles to track. According to digital simulations detailed in a Chinese defense journal, this technology could boost a drone's ability to survive an attack to nearly 90 percent.</p>

          <p>Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, believes artificial intelligence is on an exponential curve of progress and could achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) within the next decade. He suggests that such advanced AI could revolutionize science and society, potentially ending all disease and creating "radical abundance" by eliminating scarcity. Hassabis also acknowledges the significant risks, including misuse by bad actors and the challenge of keeping powerful AI systems aligned with human values. He stresses the need for international coordination to establish safety guardrails for the technology's development.</p>

          <p>In an interview, economist Jeffrey Sachs stated that the United States initiated the trade war with China and that its continued aggressive posture could become a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to actual conflict. He argues that both nations have reasons to cooperate and that rationality should prevail, though President Trump's unpredictability remains a challenge. Sachs advises that China should focus on expanding exports to developing regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America rather than relying on the U.S. or European markets, which will likely remain contentious partners.

          <p>Rescuers have found the body of the fifth and final worker who was trapped in Chile's El Teniente copper mine, bringing the total number of fatalities from the incident to six. A 4.2 magnitude tremor on Thursday caused a partial collapse in the tunnels of the world's largest underground copper mine, trapping the workers deep below the surface. The state-owned mining company Codelco has suspended operations at the affected tunnel. Authorities are now conducting a criminal investigation to determine whether the tremor was natural or caused by mining activity.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, forcing the pilot to declare a mayday emergency. The Boeing 787 aircraft was ascending when the crew reported the failure of the left engine to air traffic control. The plane was guided to turn back and landed safely at Dulles without incident or disruption to other airport operations. All 219 passengers and 11 crew members deplaned safely with no injuries reported, and the airline arranged alternate travel for the affected customers.</p>

          <p>A volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending a large ash plume into the sky and prompting an aviation alert. The eruption of the Krasheninnikov Volcano occurred just days after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of the region. Seismologists suggest the quake may have triggered the eruption, as seismic waves could have disturbed the magma system within the volcano, which was likely already close to erupting. The area is sparsely populated, and no immediate threat to people has been reported.</p>

Local councilors shared a photo of the rodent to highlight what they call a growing problem in the area, stating that this is not an isolated incident. They are calling for more decisive action from the borough council to address the infestation, which they say has returned in greater numbers after being dealt with two years prior. The story has gained national attention, which officials hope will spur a resolution.</p>

          <p>As part of the national security agreement for Nippon Steel's purchase of U.S. Steel, the U.S. government has secured special governance rights, which President Trump has termed a "golden share." This arrangement, negotiated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), gives the president veto power over major operational changes, such as factory closures or salary reductions. While not a traditional golden share involving an equity stake, it grants the government significant control, reflecting a broader trend of scrutinizing foreign investments for national security implications.</p>

          <p>World Athletics has approved new regulations requiring athletes to undergo genetic testing to confirm their biological sex to compete in the female category, reigniting a long-standing and contentious debate. This formalizes a policy that critics argue is a return to outdated and flawed methods of sex testing used from the 1970s to the 1990s. The policy combines rules for transgender athletes and those with differences in sex development (DSD), collapsing distinct biological situations. The move is seen by many as a violation of the International Olympic Committee's framework on inclusion and fairness.</p>
