            <p>Arizona State University men's golf coach Matt Thurmond was temporarily removed from Augusta National during a Masters practice round for violating the club's dress code by wearing shorts. Thurmond was there to support former ASU player Kevin Yu and current senior Josele Ballester. While patrons are allowed to wear shorts, players and coaches are required to wear full-length pants beyond the ropes. Thurmond acknowledged his mistake and expressed his appreciation for being at Augusta, emphasizing his intention to follow the rules. </p>

            <p>Concerns are rising that China, a major holder of US mortgage-backed securities (MBS), could sell off its holdings in retaliation for US trade policies, potentially driving up mortgage rates. China had already begun selling off some US MBS last year, and an acceleration of these sales, along with similar actions by other nations, could further destabilize the housing market. The spring housing market is already facing challenges due to high home prices and weakening consumer confidence, and foreign MBS sales could exacerbate the situation. The Federal Reserve's current policy of allowing MBS to roll off its portfolio adds to the potential pressure.</p>

While administration officials dismiss the decline, Americans are increasingly opposing the tariffs, fearing economic recession. The move consolidates an anti-wealth political consensus, excluding upwardly mobile voters who supported Trump's promise of economic prosperity.

This represents a shift from the hyper-liberal model of globalization towards a new protectionist era, with restricted migration, shorter supply chains, and a focus on industrial strategies.</p>

            <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a vote on the Senate-approved GOP budget blueprint, despite opposition from some rank-and-file lawmakers. Speaker Mike Johnson, with President Trump's support, is working to persuade GOP holdouts to advance the legislation. Hard-liners are concerned about how the plan would reduce the deficit. Trump has urged passage of the bill, emphasizing the need for spending cuts, while Johnson believes the meeting with Trump was productive.</p>

            <p>Refinancing student loans can be a strategic move to secure better rates and streamline payments. The best option varies based on individual circumstances, with companies like Earnest, PenFed, Laurel Road, MPOWER Financing, and SoFi offering different advantages. Considerations include interest rates, loan terms, repayment options, fees, and eligibility requirements. Refinancing is generally suitable for borrowers with high-rate private loans, strong credit, and stable income, but federal loan borrowers should be cautious due to lost government protections.

The company aims to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented. Walmart maintained its first-quarter sales outlook of 3% to 4% growth. This uncertainty comes as major US companies begin to express concerns about the impact of the tariffs on their businesses.</p>

            <p>Confidence in the US economy is declining as investors sell off government debt amid growing concerns over the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs. Interest rates on US government borrowing spiked sharply, reaching the highest level since February. The rise has spooked economists because US bonds are traditionally seen as a safe haven for investors. Some analysts suggest the Federal Reserve might be forced to intervene if the turbulence continues.</p>

            <p>Delta Air Lines has pulled its 2025 forecast due to disappointing bookings amid President Donald Trump's shifting trade policies, which CEO Ed Bastian called "the wrong approach." Delta's second-quarter revenue is expected to decline or grow modestly, and the airline is not expanding flying capacity in the second half of the year. Bastian noted a reduction in consumer and corporate confidence and said that main cabin bookings are weaker than previously expected. He also said that international and premium travel have been relatively resilient.</p>

            <p>The US Economy has taken a destructive turn, that may be described as the dumbest economic policy in modern history. The article highlights the decline of American manufacturing and calls for a policy to grow U.S. manufacturing in areas core to our national interest, including public subsidies for new manufacturers, a concerted effort to work with friendly trading partners in Europe, Asia, and North America to expand supply chains. The Trump plan, however, manages to achieve the opposite of all of these goals, all at once.</p>

            <p>The weekend killing of a Palestinian American teenager by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank has sparked an outcry from relatives and community members in the Palestinian territory as well as the United States. The family of 14-year-old Amir Rabee said he was picking olives with two friends, also U.S. citizens, on Sunday when Israeli forces fired at them. The Israeli military said it opened fire toward three people who were endangering drivers by hurling rocks at a highway in the village of Turmus Ayya, killing one person and injuring the other two.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a volatile session, swinging between gains and losses amid fears of a global trade war, with China and the European Union imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell, while the Nasdaq showed a slight gain. A selloff in U.S. Treasury markets raised concerns about a safe-haven asset during instability. President Trump's latest tariffs on China increased the cumulative rate on Chinese goods, prompting retaliation from Beijing.</p>

            <p>A Florida school district chose not to renew a high school teacher's contract after she referred to a student by a name other than their legal name without parental permission. The decision was made after an investigation into the situation, said Brevard Public Schools spokesperson Janet Murnaghan in a statement emailed to FLORIDA TODAY, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Tuesday night. The teacher's contract will expire in May of this year, Murnaghan said, adding that the district didn't renew it since Florida will have to review her teaching certification because her actions violated state law.</p>

            <p>Mike Brown is convinced that beyond Neptune, at the far reaches of our solar system, there's an unseen giant planet. For about a decade, he and other researchers have been trying to prove that the so-called "Planet 9" exists. Researchers are close to finally starting up a powerful astronomical facility that's on a mountaintop in Chile. The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a joint project of the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, has been under construction for years — and later this month workers are expected to finally start the commissioning and fine-tuning of its instruments.</p>
