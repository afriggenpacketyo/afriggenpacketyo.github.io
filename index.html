          <p>Broadcom has reported fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by a significant 63% increase in revenue from its artificial intelligence-related products, which reached $5.2 billion. The chipmaker also provided a strong revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, projecting $17.4 billion against an expected $17.02 billion. The company's growth is attributed to its custom AI accelerators and networking components for major cloud companies, positioning it as a potential competitor to Nvidia in the AI chip market. Overall quarterly revenue rose 22% year-over-year to $15.96 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has paused a lower court's order that would have dismantled a controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling allows the site to continue operating while a lawsuit from environmental groups proceeds. The court found that federal and state officials are likely to succeed in arguing the facility is not subject to federal environmental reviews because it is state-operated and has not yet received federal funding. The Department of Homeland Security praised the decision, framing it as a necessary tool for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's stock dropped over 10% in after-hours trading following the release of a disappointing full-year financial outlook. Although the company exceeded second-quarter earnings estimates, it significantly lowered its full-year earnings per share forecast to a range of $12.77 to $12.97, far below the anticipated $14.45. The company cited an expected $240 million hit from tariffs and disappointing U.S. business results as key factors. Same-store sales in the Americas fell by 4%, contributing to an overall comparable sales increase of just 1%, missing analyst expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

The request seeks to pause a lower court's ruling that reinstated Slaughter, arguing her termination was illegal without cause, such as neglect or malfeasance. The White House contends that the President has the authority to remove heads of executive agencies, citing recent Supreme Court precedents. This legal battle is part of a broader push by the administration to assert control over federal agencies and raises significant questions about the independence of federal regulators.</p>

          <p>As a strike by 3,200 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers enters its second month, Boeing has announced plans to hire permanent replacement workers for its defense unit. The company stated the move is part of its contingency plan to ensure it can continue supporting its customers. The strike began after workers rejected a contract offer that included a 20% general wage increase and a $5,000 ratification bonus. Boeing claims the union's demands have driven the parties further apart, necessitating the hiring of new manufacturing staff.</p>

While that panel nullified the monetary penalty, it upheld the trial court's finding that Trump had committed fraud.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly accused former CDC Director Susan Monarez of lying. Monarez claimed in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Kennedy pressured her to preapprove recommendations from a newly overhauled vaccine advisory panel before she was fired. During a Senate hearing, Kennedy flatly denied the accusation, stating that Monarez was lying and that he had asked for her resignation because she admitted she was not a "trustworthy person." Monarez's lawyers have since refuted Kennedy's claims as "false," escalating the public conflict over the administration's controversial changes to vaccine policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has announced a significant investment in a new, long-acting HIV prevention drug called lenacapavir, aiming to reach up to 2 million people by 2028. The medication, which requires only twice-yearly injections, has been hailed as a "game changer" for its near-complete protection against HIV transmission. This initiative, a partnership with the Global Fund and drugmaker Gilead, marks a renewed U.S. commitment to global HIV prevention after recent foreign aid cuts severely impacted related programs. The focus will be on low- and middle-income countries with high HIV rates, particularly for preventing mother-to-child transmission.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is launching a new marketing campaign to combat a seven-consecutive-month decline in tourism, with visitor numbers in July down 12% year-over-year. Industry leaders like MGM Resorts CEO Bill Hornbuckle acknowledge that perceptions of poor value have hurt the city, even as affordable options remain available. The slump in this key destination is raising concerns that it may be a leading indicator for the broader U.S. travel industry. Factors such as a 40% drop in Canadian visitors, a sharp increase in U.S. visa fees, and significant cuts to federal tourism promotion funding are creating major obstacles for the sector nationwide.</p>

The shooter, Robin Westman, spent about 40 minutes in the store, appeared at ease, and had passed all required background checks. While the purchased revolver was not used in the attack, the interaction highlights the challenge of identifying potential threats. Westman used other legally acquired firearms to kill two schoolchildren and injure 21 others at the Church of the Annunciation before dying by suicide, with a motive still under investigation.</p>

          <p>Investors are cautiously anticipating Friday's official U.S. jobs report, which is expected to show the addition of just 75,000 nonfarm payrolls in August, confirming a weakening labor market. The market is hoping for a "sweet spot" number—cool enough to support a Federal Reserve interest rate cut but not so weak as to fuel recession fears. The report will also face intense scrutiny as it is the first to be released since President Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, raising concerns about the integrity of federal economic data. Recent weaker-than-expected private payroll data has set a tense backdrop for the official release. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is ending its "Prime Invitee" program on October 1, a legacy feature that allowed Prime members to share free, fast shipping benefits with one other adult living at a different address. This move effectively closes a loophole that extended the popular perk beyond a single household. Going forward, members can only share benefits with another adult at the same residential address through the "Amazon Family" program. The change is seen as part of a broader trend, similar to Netflix's crackdown on password sharing, aimed at converting shared-perk users into full-paying subscribers.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's recent Supreme Court petition regarding its tariff policy suggests its own arguments could render the tariffs illegal under the court's "major questions doctrine." This doctrine, previously used to strike down major Biden administration policies, holds that Congress must speak clearly when assigning agencies decisions of vast economic and political significance. The administration's petition describes the tariffs as its "most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative" with a multi-trillion-dollar impact, a scale that seemingly meets the doctrine's threshold for invalidation. This creates a potential legal paradox if the conservative-majority court applies its own precedent consistently.</p>

The White House defended the action as within the president's lawful authority to protect federal assets.

          <p>A new bill introduced by congressional Democrats, the "You Earn It, You Keep it Act," aims to completely eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. To offset the cost, the proposal would expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to all annual earnings above $250,000, removing the current income cap. This approach contrasts with a recent Republican law that provides a temporary tax deduction for seniors but does not fully eliminate the tax. Proponents argue the bill would extend the solvency of the Social Security trust funds for an additional 24 years while providing significant relief to retirees. (not investment advice)</p>
