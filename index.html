          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked and sunk a second cargo ship in the Red Sea in one week, resulting in at least three crew deaths and 19 others missing. The Greek-operated vessel, Eternity C, was hit by rocket-propelled grenades, lost all propulsion, and eventually sank. The Houthis claimed they attacked the ship because it was heading to Israel and stated they took some surviving crew members to a "safe location." This attack marks a significant escalation in the region, bringing the total number of ships sunk by the group to four since they began their campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A child was killed and four other people were injured after a tree fell at the Camp Wildcraft summer camp, located at King Gillette Ranch in Calabasas. The incident occurred on Wednesday afternoon when a large tree branch snapped and fell near a group of picnic tables. One of the injured was airlifted to a hospital in critical condition, while two others sustained moderate injuries. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has opened a homicide investigation into the death, and the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, which manages the park, has pledged full cooperation with the investigation.</p>

          <p>Russia launched another massive overnight drone attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, killing at least two people and injuring thirteen others. According to local officials, drone wreckage struck a residential building in the city's central Shevchenkivskyi district, causing fires to break out across multiple areas. This assault follows a major aerial attack just two nights prior, marking a continued escalation of strikes on Ukrainian cities. The Ukrainian military's air defense systems were activated to repel the attack, while authorities urged residents to remain in shelters.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the company behind cereals like Corn Flakes and Fruit Loops, skyrocketed by over 50% following reports that it is in advanced takeover talks with Ferrero. The Italian chocolate giant, owner of the Ferrero Rocher and Kinder brands, is reportedly close to a deal valued at approximately $3 billion. If completed, the acquisition would give Ferrero a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market and represents another major expansion for the company. The move comes as traditional cereal makers like WK Kellogg face financial struggles and shifting consumer preferences toward healthier options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its policy interest rate at 2.5%, choosing to assess the impact of recent government measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. Housing prices in the capital spiked over 19% in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid expansion of household debt. Despite a recent economic contraction, the central bank prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth, citing the risks associated with the country's unique "jeonse" rental deposit system, which contributes to high levels of household borrowing. Analysts expect rate cuts later in the year once the housing market shows signs of stabilizing. (not investment advice)</p>

The report highlights that the number of African billionaires has grown from zero in 2000 to 23 today, with their combined wealth surging by 56% in the last five years. Oxfam contends that government policies biased against the poor and ineffective tax systems allow the super-rich to accumulate vast fortunes.

In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where floods killed three people, residents and officials were anticipating the danger due to "burn scars" from previous wildfires, allowing for some mitigation and a quicker return to normalcy. Conversely, the ferocity of the flood in Texas, which killed at least 119, caught many by surprise. This article suggests that recent experience with a specific type of disaster heavily informs a community's response, illustrating how familiarity with risk can lead to better adaptation and survival.</p>

The major sticking point in negotiations remains the status and presence of the Israeli military within Gaza during and after any temporary truce.

This approach forces many Chinese businesses to adopt a cautious "wait-and-see" stance, halting expansion and production decisions.

While the administration aims to boost domestic production, analysts note that ramping up U.S. copper mining and processing capabilities would take several years to meet demand.

          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Plans to Cut Over 2,100 NASA Employees</h2>

          <p>According to internal documents, the Trump administration is planning to eliminate at least 2,145 positions at NASA, targeting mostly high-ranking employees with specialized and managerial experience. This move is part of a broader push to reduce the federal workforce through buyouts and early retirements, which critics argue will deprive the agency of decades of expertise. The planned cuts have caused chaos within the space industry and come as the White House also proposes significant budget reductions for NASA's science programs. Seven former NASA science heads have condemned the proposals, warning they threaten U.S. leadership in space exploration.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Delays in Texas Flood Emergency Alerts</h2>

          <p>A review of emergency communications from the recent catastrophic flooding in Kerr County, Texas, reveals significant delays in activating the CodeRED emergency alert system. Radio traffic shows that a firefighter requested an alert be sent out an hour into the flood response, but dispatchers indicated they needed supervisor approval, which was not immediately granted. A former county official who helped install the system noted that critical time was lost as the floodwaters rose rapidly. Despite the National Weather Service issuing 22 warnings, many residents reported receiving no local alerts, raising serious questions about the county's emergency response system.</p>

          <p>In response to a new wave of tariff threats from the Trump administration, the European Union has indicated it may finalize an outline for a trade deal with the United States within days. The announcement comes as President Trump targeted multiple countries with new duties and confirmed a 50% tariff on copper imports. EU officials expressed hope for a satisfactory conclusion to negotiations, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions that have unsettled the global economy. The developments highlight the ongoing friction between the U.S. and its major trading partners, who are navigating the administration's aggressive trade policies.</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded 1,288 measles cases so far in 2025, surpassing the total for all of 2019 and marking the worst year for the disease since 1992. The majority of infections are linked to a large outbreak in West Texas, which has seen over 750 cases and the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the highly contagious virus, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, to declining vaccination rates in some communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend the MMR vaccine as the most effective protection against the disease.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for sweeping layoffs across the federal government. The high court's unsigned opinion stated the administration was likely to succeed in its argument that the executive order authorizing the cuts is lawful. This decision halts a legal challenge brought by a coalition of labor unions, which argued the president was unconstitutionally reorganizing government without congressional approval. The ruling represents a significant victory for the administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its efforts to reduce the size of the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia city officials and the union representing 9,000 blue-collar workers have reached a tentative agreement, ending an eight-day strike that disrupted city services. The strike, which included sanitation workers, 911 dispatchers, and others, led to piles of uncollected trash across the city during a summer heatwave. The new three-year contract reportedly includes a 3% raise each year and a one-time bonus, a figure significantly lower than the union's initial demands. Workers returned to their jobs immediately as the city began the cleanup process, with the union membership expected to ratify the deal soon.</p>
