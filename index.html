          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined Barclays £42 million for significant failures in its anti-money laundering systems. The regulator found that the bank did not conduct proper due diligence on two major clients, which facilitated the movement of funds linked to financial crime. Barclays received a reduced fine due to its cooperation with the investigation and has stated it has since strengthened its financial crime controls. The case highlights ongoing regulatory scrutiny of major financial institutions' compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Co-op has issued an apology after a cyber-attack in April resulted in the theft of personal data from all 6.5 million of its members. The compromised information included names, addresses, and contact details, but no financial or transaction data was lost. Four individuals have been arrested and bailed in connection with the hack, which also affected retailer M&S. The company is now partnering with a cybersecurity firm to recruit young talent into legal careers to combat cybercrime.</p>

          <p>In an unusual alliance, Amazon utilized a rocket from its direct competitor, SpaceX, to launch 24 of its Project Kuiper internet satellites into orbit. This collaboration is part of Amazon's effort to build a constellation of over 3,000 satellites to provide global broadband service, competing with SpaceX's established Starlink network. Amazon is under a Federal Communications Commission deadline to deploy half of its planned satellites by July 2026. The launch highlights the intense competition and massive investment in the growing satellite internet market.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic nomination in the special primary election for Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held by her late father, Rep.

Grijalva, a progressive, will face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in the special general election in September. While the seat is not expected to shift party control of the House, it is one of three vacancies that will likely narrow the slim Republican majority.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing serious questions regarding a major data breach that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK resettlement. The leak occurred in February 2022, but the previous Conservative government obtained a super-injunction to prevent it from being reported, a move critics are calling a cover-up. The current Labour government has revealed the breach and an emergency resettlement scheme that has cost £400 million so far. The incident raises significant concerns about the safety of Afghans who assisted British forces.</p>

It also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide higher returns than long-term ones. Laddering CDs is suggested as a strategy to capitalize on high short-term rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A prosecutor in Brazil has asked the nation's Supreme Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of plotting a violent coup to overturn his 2022 election loss. In closing arguments, the prosecution accused Bolsonaro and seven others of seeking to violently overthrow the democratic order, a plot that allegedly failed when the military did not support him. The trial has drawn sharp criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called it a "witch hunt" and threatened tariffs against Brazil. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Nuclear power company Westinghouse has announced a plan to construct 10 of its large AP1000 reactors in the United States, with the goal of beginning construction by 2030. The company's interim CEO, Dan Sumner, revealed the plan to President Donald Trump during an energy and AI conference. This initiative aligns with the Trump administration's executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. The project is projected to generate $75 billion in economic value, marking a significant push to revitalize the nation's nuclear energy sector after decades of limited expansion.</p>

          <p>Bank of America posted mixed financial results for the second quarter, beating earnings estimates but falling short on revenue expectations. The company's profit increased by 3% to $7.12 billion, while revenue grew 4% to $26.61 billion, slightly below analyst forecasts. The miss was attributed to net interest income (NII) coming in lower than expected, as growth in loans and deposits was offset by lower interest rates compared to the previous year. Despite the NII miss, the bank saw positive momentum in its markets businesses and noted continued resilience among consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

This case is part of a trend under the Trump administration where over two dozen such refugees have been deported to Bhutan, only to be turned away.

          <p>Total mortgage application volume in the U.S. dropped by 10% last week as rising interest rates dampened housing market activity. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.82%, driven by higher Treasury yields amid renewed economic concerns over tariffs. Applications for home purchases fell 12% to their slowest pace since May, while refinancing applications also declined by 7%. The data reflects the housing market's sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations and broader economic uncertainty affecting both buyer demand and seller confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beijing has condemned Taiwan's tightened residency rules for mainland-born spouses, vowing to punish those responsible for what it calls "discriminatory treatment and deliberate suppression." A spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office described the policy as an abuse of power aimed at persecuting mainland spouses. The new rules, enforced under Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's administration, require spouses who obtained identity cards before 2004 to prove they have abandoned their mainland residency. Taipei has defended the move as a necessary measure to counter what it terms "infiltration" by mainland China.</p>

Internal political fractures within the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) are adding to the instability.

A survey found that while a majority of children attend summer programs, participation is much lower for lower-income families, a third of whom find camp financially inaccessible. Beyond cost, parents struggle with limited program durations that don't cover a full workday and a frantic registration process for scarce spots. This annual scramble highlights a significant gap in the nation's childcare and family support infrastructure.</p>
