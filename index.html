          <p>Recent layoffs from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are increasing the labor supply, particularly for white-collar jobs, at a time when hiring is slowing down. Economists are watching to see if this trend, combined with higher interest rates affecting tech sector hiring, will be reflected in the upcoming June nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show weaker growth. The article notes the significant challenge for displaced federal workers in finding new roles within a softer, more competitive job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew reveals shocking details in the 2020 murder of his wife, Suzanne. Prosecutors allege her remains, found in a shallow grave, were moved there after decomposing elsewhere, suggesting at least two relocations. The indictment also states that a tranquilizer compound used for sedating wildlife, which Barry Morphew had access to, was found in her bone marrow. This evidence suggests she was drugged before her death, which occurred amid her plans to divorce him.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted most U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move aimed at reclaiming regional leverage and countering Iranian influence. The decision follows a meeting between President Trump and Syria's new transitional leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and is conditioned on Syria's cooperation on counterterrorism and distancing itself from Iran. Experts view this as a strategic calculation to stabilize the region and potentially expand the Abraham Accords, with Syria as a possible next candidate for normalization with Israel.</p>

          <p>New details have emerged about a recent Chinese military exercise in the Western Pacific involving two aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, for the first time. The drills, which extended near Guam, demonstrated a significant increase in complexity and intensity compared to previous exercises, focusing on reconnaissance, counterstrikes, and day-and-night flight operations. Analysts suggest that by training its carriers against each other, China is gaining valuable operational experience that even the U.S. military may lack, signaling a major advancement in its naval capabilities.</p>

          <p>California has enacted new laws to streamline housing construction by exempting most urban, multifamily developments from the state's lengthy environmental review process (CEQA). This move is seen as a significant shift away from the anti-growth sentiment that has historically dominated Democratic politics in the state, which contributed to a severe housing shortage. The article argues this reflects a new governing philosophy prioritizing material abundance and public interest over placating specific interest groups, offering a potential blueprint for Democrats nationwide.</p>

          <p>Merit Street Media, the media network founded by television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection less than two years after its launch. The company, which aimed to offer an alternative to "woke" culture, reported assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. The filing follows two rounds of significant layoffs and coincides with a lawsuit filed by Merit Street against its partner, Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), for allegedly failing to provide promised national distribution.</p>

          <p>A ferry carrying at least 65 people has sunk in the strait between the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali, resulting in at least six deaths and leaving dozens missing. Rescue efforts have saved 31 survivors, but the search continues, complicated by reports that more passengers may have been on board than were listed on the official manifest. Such discrepancies are common in Indonesia, where marine accidents are frequent due to inconsistent enforcement of safety regulations. President Prabowo Subianto has ordered an immediate emergency response.</p>

          <p>Indonesia and Malaysia are actively strengthening diplomatic and economic ties with Russia, signaling a move toward a more non-aligned foreign policy. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto's recent visit to Russia and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's multiple trips reflect a desire to balance relationships amid the U.S.-China rivalry and a perception of waning U.S. global influence. This pivot includes exploring expanded trade, energy cooperation, and participation in alternative international forums like BRICS, driven partly by geopolitical strategy and domestic anti-Western sentiment.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "A Physical Education," author Casey Johnston details her journey from obsessive cardio and calorie counting to the empowering world of strength training. The article discusses how lifting weights reframes exercise for women, shifting the goal from shrinking one's body to building functional strength and capability. This approach requires adequate nutrition, directly challenging the restrictive mindset of diet culture. It presents weightlifting as a way to unify mind and body in the pursuit of getting stronger, rather than smaller.</p>

Historically, large, partisan bills passed via budget reconciliation have led to a public backlash and significant electoral losses for the governing party in subsequent midterm elections, a pattern seen with Reagan, Clinton, and Obama.
