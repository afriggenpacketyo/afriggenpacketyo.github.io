An original Bronco from 1960-1966, Taylor left an indelible mark on the franchise, holding records for receptions (543), receiving yards (6,872), and touchdown receptions (44) for over 30 years. He notably became the first receiver in AFL or NFL history to achieve 100 receptions in a single season, maintaining an average of over 80 catches annually during his first six seasons. Inducted into the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame in 1984, he later won two Super Bowl rings as a wide receivers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, further cementing his legacy in professional football.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai is in the final stages of his national security trial, accused of colluding with foreign forces under Beijing's imposed law. Detained since December 2020, the 77-year-old British and Chinese citizen faces a potential life sentence, with critics arguing his case weaponizes the legal system to silence opposition. Lai, a self-described 'born rebel' who fled mainland China as a child, built a multi-million dollar empire before becoming a fierce critic of Beijing after the Tiananmen Square massacre, launching pro-democracy publications like Apple Daily. His case draws international attention, with calls for his release amid concerns for Hong Kong's freedoms.</p>

Chattanooga experienced its second-wettest day since 1879, with 6.42 inches of rain. Rescuers worked for hours to evacuate residents from flooded homes and vehicles in Hamilton County, leading the county mayor to declare a local state of emergency.</p>

          <p>A multi-week investigation dubbed 'Crowing Rooster' in San Bernardino County led to 56 arrests and the seizure of 3,500 birds, firearms, and drug paraphernalia in a massive cockfighting bust. Authorities served 26 search warrants, charging 10 individuals with felonies related to animal cruelty and other illicit activities like unregulated gambling and narcotics trafficking. The seized birds, bred for fighting, were humanely euthanized due to their inability to be safely rehabilitated or rehomed. Officials highlight the link between cockfighting and broader criminal enterprises, though some argue current state penalties are insufficient deterrents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is seeking to extend his temporary control over Washington D.C.'s police department beyond the initial 30-day period, citing the need for a 'crime bill' pertaining to the capital. This follows his invocation of a rarely used law to assume temporary federal authority over the Metropolitan Police Department. Trump suggested he might declare a 'national emergency' if Congress doesn't approve the extension, though D.C. crime statistics show a decline in violent crime. The move is part of his broader effort to address what he terms 'out of control' crime in the city.</p>

This ruling allows the administration to maintain its hold on funds earmarked for global health and HIV/AIDS programs, which Trump has previously labeled 'wasteful.'

          <p>UK cities face an increasing threat from 'firewaves,' a new phenomenon describing multiple urban wildfires triggered by extended hot, dry weather, according to Imperial College London scientists. Recent heath fires in London and Edinburgh highlight this growing vulnerability, once considered a rural risk. Professor Guillermo Rein's research, in collaboration with the London Fire Brigade, identifies a critical 'vapour pressure deficit' where vegetation becomes highly flammable after ten consecutive dry days. Climate change is intensifying these conditions, leading to calls for the Met Office to adopt the 'firewave' term to signal extreme urban fire danger and inform public safety strategies.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests ADHD Medication Offers Broader Life Benefits Beyond Core Symptoms</h2>

          <p>A new study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for newly diagnosed ADHD can significantly reduce the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. Researchers found that taking ADHD medication was linked to reductions in first-time instances and recurrent events across these areas, which are often linked to impulsive and distracted behaviors. The findings, based on data from 148,500 people in Sweden, highlight the wider potential benefits of medication beyond managing core symptoms, offering crucial evidence for patients considering treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following mass arrests of over 700 protesters supporting the recently proscribed group Palestine Action, a legal and political battle is escalating over the ban. The UK government proscribed Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, citing millions of pounds in criminal damage and alleged militant activities, including an 'underground manual' detailing break-ins. Critics, including a UN human rights chief, argue the ban infringes on free speech and is disproportionate. The outcome hinges on three key courtroom battles: the prosecution of protesters, trials for alleged violent incidents, and a High Court review of the ban's legality and proportionality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that US President Donald Trump's new curbs on China's shipbuilding industry are prompting South Korean shipbuilders to invest more in Southeast Asia, particularly ASEAN nations. This strategic shift aims to address constraints like limited capacity, labor shortages, and domestic union tensions that have diminished South Korea's competitiveness against China. HD Hyundai, for example, plans a 10-year lease to revive a bankrupt shipyard in the Philippines, investing $550 million to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. While seen as a viable long-term solution, experts caution that improving worker skills in new locations will take time.</p>

          <p>Nova Scotia is facing significant pushback for its 'draconian' ban on hiking, fishing, and ATV use in wooded areas, implemented to curb wildfire risk in extremely dry conditions. The ban, which carries a C$25,000 fine and includes a tip line for violations, is defended by Premier Tim Houston as necessary given 97% of provincial wildfires are human-caused and no rain has fallen since June. Critics, including the Canadian Constitution Foundation, decry it as a 'dangerous example of 'safetyism' and creeping authoritarianism.' Twelve individuals have been fined so far, including a military veteran who deliberately sought a fine to challenge the ban in court.</p>

The lawsuit claims Zelle's quick registration and lack of verification made it 'uniquely susceptible to fraud,' a flaw EWS allegedly knew about but failed to address or enforce anti-fraud rules on its partner banks. A Zelle spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as a 'political stunt,' noting a similar previous lawsuit was dismissed. The AG seeks restitution and damages for affected New Yorkers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nine years after legalizing Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), Canada faces ethical complexities as demand for assisted death far outpaces predictions, straining medical providers. The law's emphasis on patient autonomy, where patients don't need to exhaust all other options, distinguishes it from other countries. Clinicians, like Dr. Madeline Li, grapple with interpreting broad eligibility criteria, often making individual discretion-based decisions, sometimes with regret. The surge in demand is partly attributed to MAID coordination centers allowing patients to seek multiple opinions and a widespread public awareness of assisted death as an option, unlike in some European countries.</p>

Hochman highlighted the success of social media influencers, both paid and organic, and the standardization of Chili's $10.99 value meal, which resonates with customers due to its simplicity.

          <p>New research from UC Riverside reveals that sinking land in California's San Joaquin Valley is significantly depressing home prices, causing losses of $6,689 to $16,165 per home and an estimated $1.87 billion across eight counties between 2015 and 2021. This 'slow problem,' caused by excessive groundwater extraction leading to soil compaction, also damages infrastructure and increases insurance premiums. While home values generally rise in California, those in subsidence areas experience much smaller increases. The study underscores the costly effects of chronic groundwater overuse, urging investments in mitigation efforts like stormwater capture and stricter pumping regulations under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.
