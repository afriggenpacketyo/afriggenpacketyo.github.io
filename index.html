          <p>Erika Kirk, widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, declared his mission would grow "stronger, bolder, louder" following his assassination at Utah Valley University. Speaking from his Turning Point USA office, she thanked law enforcement, Donald Trump, and JD Vance for their support. Kirk, known for divisive rhetoric and bringing young people into the MAGA movement, was fatally shot while speaking. His wife urged students to continue his cause, framing his death as a spiritual battle and a call to action for his followers.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer initially defended Lord Mandelson, the former US ambassador, despite No 10 and Foreign Office officials being aware of supportive emails between Mandelson and convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein. Mandelson was later sacked after the full emails, revealing his expressions of support and travel payments from Epstein, were published. This development has intensified pressure on Starmer regarding his handling of the appointment and raised questions about transparency within the government.</p>

          <p>Belarus released 52 political prisoners in a US-brokered deal, leading to the lifting of sanctions on the national airline. However, opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya stated that these individuals were forcibly deported to Lithuania, not truly freed. Many were nearing the end of their sentences and wished to remain in Belarus, now finding themselves exiled without passports. This move, while seemingly a step towards improving US-Belarus ties, is criticized for its coercive nature and separation of individuals from their families.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers passed a Republican-led redistricting plan, supported by former President Trump, aiming to create an additional GOP-leaning House seat. The new map, which splits the Kansas City area, is expected to shift the state's congressional delegation to seven Republican and one Democratic seat. Critics, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, called the map "rigged" and "unconstitutional," with legal challenges already filed. This move is part of a broader national effort by Republicans to reshape congressional maps ahead of midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health study found that women who experienced stalking or obtained restraining orders faced a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The research, analyzing data from over 66,000 American nurses, revealed a 41% increased risk for stalking victims and a 70% higher risk for those with restraining orders. This suggests that experiences of violence impact cardiovascular health beyond traditional risk factors, prompting calls for doctors to include such questions in future heart health screenings.</p>

          <p>A US House Republican report identifies approximately 50 US-China joint education programs as "high-risk," advocating for their termination. These partnerships, including those with New York University and Johns Hopkins, are flagged due to concerns they could advance Beijing's military and technological modernization. Congressman John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, stated these collaborations "must end." This move reflects escalating efforts to curb academic ties perceived as national security threats.</p>

          <p>This article provides a stark glimpse into the fear experienced by undocumented immigrants in Trump's America, focusing on "Luz," a Mexican woman living in constant anxiety of detention. She highlights how many undocumented individuals, despite contributing to society through work and taxes, now face daily terror. The narrative contrasts with the administration's "stop the illegal invasion" rhetoric, showing the human cost of intensified ICE raids and the potential disruption to families, including US-born children, leading some to consider returning to Mexico.</p>

          <p>The review for "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" suggests the sequel struggles to recapture the comedic brilliance of the 1984 original. While Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer reprise their roles, the film's reliance on celebrity cameos and the band's revered status undermines its satirical tension. The article notes some agreeable silliness in exploring the characters' post-fame lives but finds the overall effort to be a "nostalgia lap" that fails to deliver fresh, pointed humor, ultimately falling short of the classic.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that the Trump administration can terminate humanitarian parole protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This decision, a victory for the administration, allows the ending of these temporary legal statuses while a lawsuit proceeds. Advocates for the migrants expressed deep disappointment, calling it the "largest mass illegalization event in modern American history" and highlighting the risks of family separation and return to dangerous home countries. The ruling reflects the administration's broader efforts to dismantle Biden-era immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is suing Uber for allegedly discriminating against passengers with disabilities, including those with service dogs. The lawsuit claims Uber drivers routinely refuse service, impose illegal cleaning fees for service animal shedding, and deny front-seat access for mobility devices. This alleged discrimination has caused disabled individuals to miss appointments and be stranded. Uber states it prohibits such actions and deactivates non-compliant drivers, but the DOJ seeks $125 million for affected individuals, highlighting ongoing accessibility challenges in ride-hailing services.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers approved Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill overriding local zoning laws to permit high-density housing near transit hubs. The bill allows for buildings up to nine stories near certain transit stops, impacting single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile. Proponents argue it's crucial for addressing the state's housing shortage, while critics claim it's an overreach that strips local control and could negatively affect lower-priced areas. The bill's passage was bolstered by a deal with a powerful labor group, adding union hiring provisions.</p>
