          <p>A public dispute erupted between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, marked by online exchanges on Truth Social and X, formerly Twitter. The feud began after Musk criticized Trump's tax-cut and spending bill, leading to Trump threatening to withdraw government contracts from Musk's companies. Billionaires like Bill Ackman urged the two to reconcile for the benefit of the country, while others like Steve Bannon suggested seizing SpaceX. Wall Street reacted negatively, with Tesla shares plummeting due to investor fears about the regulatory environment under a potential Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China is driving down producer prices, leading to a potential surge of cheap exports globally, which may cause anxiety in Asia but could ease inflation for consumers. Despite tariffs deterring exports to the U.S., Chinese producer prices have remained deflationary, prompting concerns from other economies about being overwhelmed by inexpensive goods. However, economists suggest this influx of low-cost Chinese products could lower costs for consumers, offering central banks some relief as they balance lowering living costs with trade tensions. Emerging growth risks and subdued inflation may pave the way for more rate cuts across Asia. (not investment advice)</p>

Mann's Nobel Prize in 1929 was for "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain", but he also delivered radio speeches and wrote essays against the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust.

It reveals that productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI, and wages for workers with AI skills are 56% higher. The study suggests AI can enrich jobs, create broader opportunities, and be beneficial in countries with declining working-age populations. (not investment advice)</p>

Factors contributing to this issue include physical and digital evidence mismanagement, unavailable witness statements, and inadequate crime scene evidence gathering.

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries, comes as part of a series of draconian immigration restrictions implemented during his second term. These measures include suspending the asylum system, ending temporary legal residency for thousands, and restricting student visas. This new ban is not as shocking as the initial 2017 ban due to the upending of immigration overall. While it includes exemptions, it is expected to separate families and disproportionately affect those seeking refuge.</p>
