          <p>The UK government expressed relief, but not delight, at President Trump's newly imposed tariffs.  While avoiding the worst-case scenario, the tariffs will still significantly impact UK businesses, particularly the car industry.  The government is engaged in intensive negotiations with the US, characterizing the discussions as more corporate than a trade negotiation.  Conservatives highlight the UK's comparatively better treatment compared to the EU as a Brexit benefit.</p>
