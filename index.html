          <p>Heavy monsoon rains have triggered a red alert in Mumbai and surrounding areas, causing significant disruptions to traffic and daily life. The India Meteorological Department issued the upgraded warning as incessant rain led to waterlogging and train delays in parts of the commercial capital. Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has directed authorities to remain vigilant and provide immediate relief and rescue operations, urging citizens to stay indoors. The monsoon's early arrival in Maharashtra, ten days ahead of schedule, marks the earliest onset since 1990, while Kerala also experienced an early monsoon, arriving eight days ahead of usual.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced his disapproval of Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine, describing them as "absolutely crazy" following a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack. Trump expressed his dismay at the loss of life and hinted at the possibility of increased U.S. sanctions against Russia. Ukraine reported that Russia launched 355 drones and nine cruise missiles, marking the largest drone attack since the invasion began in February 2022.

          <p>Japan has revised its family registry system to allow Taiwanese individuals marrying Japanese citizens to list Taiwan as their place of origin, instead of China. This change aligns the family registry with Japan's residence registry and certificates for foreign residents. The decision has been welcomed by Taiwan as a means to protect the rights and interests of Taiwanese in Japan. China has criticized the move, asserting that Taiwan is an inalienable part of its territory. The Japanese ministry implemented the change to avoid confusion in marriage or divorce cases involving Japanese and foreigners.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defends the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, citing a "moral component" and claiming those who refuse to work are "defrauding the system." The bill, passed by the House, includes cuts to various programs to fund Trump's tax reforms, sparking debate over Medicaid reductions. Johnson insists the bill focuses on fraud, waste, and abuse, and that those able-bodied individuals who are not working are taking advantage of the system. However, critics like Senator Hawley argue that slashing Medicaid is "morally wrong and politically suicidal," raising concerns about cost-sharing measures impacting low-income individuals.

          <p>A review of BBC Sport pundits' predictions for the Premier League season reveals that none correctly foresaw Liverpool's title triumph. While some accurately identified teams that would finish in the top four, their exact placements were often off the mark. Opta's 'supercomputer,' which simulated the season 10,000 times, also failed to predict Liverpool's win, instead favoring Manchester City. Despite sophisticated algorithms, predicting the unpredictable nature of football remains a challenge, highlighting the role of hunches and unforeseen circumstances in shaping the outcome of the season.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to King Charles III to open the Canadian parliament is being interpreted as a strong statement of Canada's sovereignty in the face of perceived threats from US President Donald Trump. The move is seen as a way to emphasize Canada's unique traditions and independence, distinguishing it from the United States. The visit, the first by a British monarch to deliver Canada's throne speech since 1977, comes at a time when Canada is seeking to strengthen its ties with Europe and find new allies amidst a changing relationship with the US. While some Canadians remain indifferent or critical of the monarchy, the visit is primarily intended to send a political message both domestically and internationally.</p>

While the Post acknowledges Trump's penchant for using tariffs, it cautions that the "whiplash" effect of his on-again, off-again approach is wearing thin, and that "even fans of the presidentâ€™s theater can get sick of endless drama."</p>

          <p>Four former Volkswagen executives have been convicted of fraud in a criminal trial related to the Dieselgate scandal. The Braunschweig Regional Court in Germany concluded a nearly four-year trial, finding the executives guilty of manipulating diesel car emissions tests. Two of the executives received prison sentences, while the other two received suspended sentences. The Dieselgate scandal, which surfaced in 2015, has cost Volkswagen over â‚¬30 billion in lawsuits and other expenses. The proceedings against former CEO Martin Winterkorn were suspended due to health reasons.</p>

The electoral council, filled with Maduro loyalists, announced the results on state television without providing evidence, stripping the opposition of key positions. Independent vote monitors were absent, and critics have deemed the election a sham designed to legitimize Maduro's regime. The announcement follows a presidential election last year in which Maduro also claimed victory despite evidence to the contrary, further eroding trust in the country's electoral process.</p>

However, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War estimate that at Russia's current rate of advance, it would take approximately 91 years to achieve this goal. The ISW also suggests that such an endeavor would cost Russia a significant number of soldiers and resources, making it highly impractical.</p>
