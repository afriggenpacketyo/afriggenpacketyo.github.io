          <p>The Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report projects that the trust fund for retirement benefits may be depleted by 2033, unchanged from last year's projections, at which point 77% of benefits would be payable. The combined trust funds are expected to last until 2034, one year earlier than previously estimated, with 81% of benefits payable at that time. The Disability Insurance fund is projected to pay full benefits through at least 2099, while Medicare's Hospital Insurance trust fund is expected to pay full benefits until 2033, three years earlier than last year's estimate. The report considers the effects of the Social Security Fairness Act but does not include new tax proposals, tariffs, or deportations, which could further impact Social Security's financing (not investment advice).</p>

Walter's track record with the Dodgers, including consistent playoff appearances and multiple World Series wins, is cited as evidence of his ability to build a championship-caliber team. The move is expected to bring significant investment in infrastructure, coaching, and scouting, with a focus on sustained success rather than relying on aging superstars. While Jeanie Buss will remain as Lakers governor, the new ownership is anticipated to bring a more analytics-driven approach and a stronger championship culture.</p>

The remaining carbon budget has shrunk due to continued record emissions and improved scientific estimates, with the current rate of warming at about 0.27C per decade. The excess heat is primarily absorbed by the oceans, leading to disruptions in marine life and rising sea levels. The authors emphasize the need for rapid and stringent emissions cuts to mitigate the impacts of climate change, despite a slowing rate of emissions increases.</p>
