        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate's version of a major Republican spending bill aims to extend former President Trump's 2017 tax cuts and includes new temporary tax breaks for tip income, overtime, and auto loans. The nearly 1,000-page bill also proposes a significant $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, a point of contention for some fiscal conservatives within the party. Key provisions include raising the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 and eliminating the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. The legislation faces an uncertain path as lawmakers push for a vote before the July 4th holiday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Kate Hudson revealed that she once considered legal emancipation from her parents, Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, to advance her acting career as a teenager. This consideration arose when she was offered a role that required her to work as a legal adult. Hudson explained that her mother, Goldie Hawn, was firmly against the idea, but the situation resolved when she landed a guest role on the popular 1990s drama "Party of Five." The article also touches on her close relationship with Hawn and her estrangement from her biological father.</p>

The article notes that while the de-escalation of Mideast tensions was the primary driver, investor expectations for multiple Federal Reserve interest rate cuts by year-end also supported the market's upward momentum.

          <p>The latest Supreme Court term concluded with a series of significant victories for conservative states and former President Trump's claims of executive authority, though without the blockbuster rulings of previous years. The court's 6-3 conservative majority expanded states' rights on issues like transgender medical treatments and funding for Planned Parenthood clinics. It also reined in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural win for the Trump administration. The article notes a trend towards a "states-rights" style of conservatism and highlights the court's continued support for broad executive power.</p>

          <p>Researchers studying the ancient city of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey have found genetic evidence suggesting it may have been a matriarchal society over 9,000 years ago. By analyzing DNA from skeletons buried under the city's houses, scientists discovered that family connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring tended to remain in their family homes. The findings, which also show females received significantly more grave goods than males, challenge traditional assumptions about ancient social structures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has sentenced two men to life in prison for their roles in the 2022 deaths of 53 migrants, including six children, found in an abandoned tractor-trailer in Texas. Felipe Orduna-Torres and Armando Gonzales-Garcia were convicted for the human smuggling operation where migrants suffocated in the vehicle's trailer, which had a broken air conditioner. The migrants, from Mexico and Central America, had paid thousands to be smuggled across the border.

The woman's injuries were not life-threatening, and she was treated at the scene.

Grossi stressed the urgent need for diplomatic engagement and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify the status of Iran's nuclear material and activities.

          <p>One week after the U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, descriptions of the mission's success have shifted among administration officials, sparking questions about the actual extent of the damage. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed the program was "obliterated," subsequent intelligence assessments and official comments have presented a more nuanced picture. Some reports suggest the setback to Iran's program may only be temporary, and officials later emphasized the attack's success in achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than total destruction of the facilities. The ambiguity highlights the difficulty in assessing the true impact of the strikes.</p>

His comments echo concerns from the global players' union, Fifpro, which has called for mandatory off-season breaks.
