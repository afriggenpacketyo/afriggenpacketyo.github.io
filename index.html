          <p>Ukraine and Russia have initiated another prisoner exchange, with President Zelenskyy announcing the return of the first group of Ukrainian captives, including wounded and young soldiers. This exchange follows Moscow's drone attack on a Ukrainian air base and comes after direct talks between the two countries in Istanbul. Russia confirmed the return of prisoners under 25 years old as part of the agreement, with both sides remaining entrenched in their demands for halting the fighting. The ongoing conflict has intensified, with Moscow claiming gains in eastern Ukraine and launching drone attacks in retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian military aircraft, as both sides continue to engage in drone warfare.</p>

          <p>Mark Gordon, on trial with Constance Marten over the death of their newborn baby, described the prosecution's case as "like a script from a movie," alleging that the prosecution "just made things up." Gordon and Marten deny manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of a child, arguing that their baby did not die of hypothermia. The couple stated their baby died on the second day of camping, and they stayed with the body for three days, considering suicide. The prosecution argues that the baby was exposed to cold and inadequate clothing, but Gordon countered that they were experienced campers and had taken precautions.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates, highlighting the potential for earning higher returns compared to standard savings accounts. It notes that leading CD accounts offer returns exceeding the current inflation rate, with the added benefit of locking in high rates for the CD's term. The article distinguishes between national average rates and those offered by online banks, which often provide more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. It also advises considering short-term CDs, as the inverted yield curve has led to higher interest rates for shorter terms, and suggests a CD laddering strategy for long-term savings.
