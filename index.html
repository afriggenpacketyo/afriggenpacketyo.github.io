            <p>Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times is set for a retrial after an appeals court reversed a previous dismissal. Palin claims a 2017 editorial falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting, damaging her reputation. The Times acknowledges the inaccuracy but maintains it was an honest mistake, swiftly corrected. The retrial, expected to last a week, comes amid heightened scrutiny of media outlets by political figures, including Donald Trump, who have alleged unjust treatment by the press.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs suggests that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investors should re-evaluate their stance on oil and gas companies, similar to the shift in sentiment towards defense stocks following the Russia-Ukraine war. They argue that the energy transition will be longer than expected, requiring continued investment in oil and gas development. Furthermore, oil and gas companies are major investors in low-carbon energy, and their capabilities are needed for affordable energy, especially in emerging markets. However, some ESG experts disagree, citing the negative impacts of fossil fuels on the climate. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant increase in March, driven by businesses rushing to ship goods ahead of anticipated tariff increases from the United States. However, analysts suggest this surge may be a "final hurrah," with exports expected to decline in the coming months due to the escalating trade war. The drastic tariff increases and policy uncertainty are creating challenges for businesses and disrupting global trade patterns. This is causing buyers and sellers to pause orders until the situation becomes more predictable.</p>

The growth slowdown is attributed to declines in manufacturing and some services sectors, as well as the impact of US tariffs and the US-China trade war. (not investment advice)</p>
