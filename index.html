          <p>Comments by former President Trump suggesting the use of the U.S. military as training grounds in American cities have drawn sharp and opposing reactions from congressional leaders. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the remarks as being "cherry-picked" from a longer speech and indicative of a serious approach to crime. In contrast, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries described the statement as "deeply disturbing," emphasizing that American citizens should never be viewed as targets for the military.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a 20-story public housing building in the Bronx led to the partial collapse of the structure on Wednesday morning. Video footage showed an entire corner of the high-rise had fallen away, sending a large cloud of dust and debris onto the street below. The New York City Fire Department responded to the scene, investigating a possible gas explosion in the incinerator shaft as the cause. Despite the extensive damage, authorities reported no initial injuries as they began search and rescue operations.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, driven by strong consumer demand for electric vehicles and large SUVs. Sales of all-electric models surged by 30.2% to a new quarterly record, while the broader category of electrified vehicles, including hybrids, grew by 20%. This sales boost occurred just before the expiration of federal EV incentives, which likely encouraged many buyers to purchase vehicles sooner, potentially impacting future sales figures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government officially shut down after Congress failed to agree on a funding extension, immediately triggering a contentious blame game between the two political parties. Republicans assert that Democrats are responsible for the closure, claiming they are holding the government hostage over healthcare-related provisions. Conversely, Democrats argue that Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, making the shutdown entirely their own, and are refusing to negotiate in good faith.</p>

The deceased suspect, who reportedly died by suicide, left a written statement containing explicit threats against the festival, prompting a large-scale security sweep of the grounds.</p>

          <p>In the current economic environment, certificates of deposit (CDs) are providing savers with interest rates that exceed the rate of inflation, helping to preserve the purchasing power of their money. While national average yields remain modest, top online banks are offering significantly more competitive rates, especially on short-term CDs of one year or less. Financial experts note that CDs allow savers to lock in these high rates for a fixed term, offering a secure and predictable return on their investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New government-imposed fees are creating substantial financial hurdles for individuals seeking asylum and other forms of immigration relief in the United States. The changes, part of a legislative package signed by President Trump, include a new $100 fee for asylum applications and significant cost increases for work permits and legal appeals. Immigration advocates argue that these fees are prohibitively expensive for vulnerable, low-income applicants and are intended to deter them from accessing the legal system.</p>

          <p>The threat of broad pharmaceutical tariffs from the Trump administration appears to be diminishing after it struck a deal with Pfizer, setting a new precedent for the industry. In exchange for a three-year exemption from pharma-specific tariffs, Pfizer agreed to voluntarily lower some U.S. drug prices and invest $70 billion in domestic manufacturing. This move signals a strategic shift from widespread levies to individual company negotiations, providing other major drugmakers a potential path to avoid future tariffs.</p>

          <p>The popular UK bakery chain Greggs has announced its third price increase of the year on certain items, including breakfast deals and biscuits, in response to mounting cost pressures. The company's CEO attributed the hikes to rising staff costs and an unexpected £20 million increase in National Insurance payments. While the iconic sausage roll will not be affected this time, the move reflects the broader trend of inflation impacting businesses and consumers across the UK high street.</p>
