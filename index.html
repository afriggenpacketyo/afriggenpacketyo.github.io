          <p>Japan and the U.S. have reported progress in tariff negotiations, with both sides aiming for a potential agreement as early as next month before the G7 summit. Japan's negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, emphasized that Japan is still requesting the removal of all additional U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted the importance of boosting investment and collaborating on economic security issues. The two countries plan to continue negotiations, and leaders are expected to discuss the matter at the G7 summit in Canada. Optimism surrounding the trade negotiations is tempered by previous unsuccessful attempts to resolve tariff disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

He stated Nippon Steel would invest $14 billion, including $2.2 billion to increase steel production in Pittsburgh's Mon Valley and $7 billion to modernize mills in other states. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, creating jobs and offering a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. Steel worker.

          <p>China is digitally transforming its coal industry with the introduction of driverless electric mining trucks in Inner Mongolia's Yimin open-pit coal mine. The mine now uses a fleet of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks, representing the world's largest deployment of autonomous electric mining trucks. This upgrade addresses a shortage of drivers and improves safety, as dangerous driving conditions led to high attrition rates. The initiative aligns with China's push to upgrade traditional industries with advanced technologies, driven by a shrinking labor force and an aging population.</p>

The decision raises concerns about the future of H.I.V. research and prevention efforts. This action aligns with broader trends in the administration's approach to healthcare funding and priorities. The termination could potentially slow progress in finding a vaccine and combating the spread of H.I.V.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Halts Trump Administration's Downsizing of Federal Workforce</h2>

          <p>An appeals court refused to freeze a California judge's order halting the Trump administration from downsizing the federal workforce, meaning that Department of Government Efficiency-led cuts remain on pause for now. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the White House's request to freeze the injunction. The administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by U.S. Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities, including San Francisco and Chicago. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said voters gave him a mandate to remake the federal government, and he tapped billionaire Elon Musk to lead the charge through DOGE.</p>

The review will recommend the deployment of new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and to control the army's own, future, unmanned weapons.

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center has called on people grappling with soaring rice prices to beware of websites claiming to sell the staple at heavily discounted prices. Complaints related to such websites have spiked since March, with some claiming the rice was never delivered though payment had been made. The warning came as the average price of rice at supermarkets has risen steadily in recent months due partly to a poor harvest, hitting a record 4,285 yen per 5 kg in mid-May, roughly double last year's level. As the government's attempt to curb prices with the release of its rice stockpiles has so far had a limited impact, it has begun selling through direct contracts under new farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who has targeted reducing prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kg by early June.
