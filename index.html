          <p>Dallas Cowboys' standout pass rusher Micah Parsons is maintaining his silence regarding his contract dispute with the team. When asked for an update on negotiations, Parsons gave a four-word response: "My mouth is closed." This comes as Parsons, who is entering the final year of his rookie deal, seeks a lucrative extension similar to other top players at his position. Team owner Jerry Jones has stated he does not intend to trade the All-Pro edge rusher despite a public trade request from the player.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are warning that UK cities face a growing risk from "firewaves," a term for multiple urban wildfires occurring during extended hot, dry periods driven by climate change. Following recent fires in London and Edinburgh, scientists from Imperial College London noted that after about ten dry days, vegetation becomes dangerously flammable, increasing the likelihood of simultaneous blazes that could overwhelm emergency services. The London Fire Brigade is now using this research, along with new technology like drones, to better predict and combat the rising threat to urban green spaces.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his administration will ask Congress for a "long-term" extension of the federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, which is currently limited to 30 days. The move is part of a broader push to address what the administration calls a crime crisis in the capital, although local data indicates a recent decline in violent crime. While Trump expressed confidence that Republicans would approve the extension, it would likely require bipartisan support to pass the Senate, presenting a significant legislative hurdle for the initiative.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Fire Department successfully contained a one-acre brush fire in Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in Highland Park on Wednesday afternoon. The blaze, which burned for approximately 40 minutes in dense, dry brush, did not threaten any homes or require evacuations. One firefighter was treated for apparent heat exhaustion while responding to the incident. Crews, assisted by water-dropping helicopters, remained on the scene to manage hotspots, and the cause of the fire is currently under investigation by authorities.</p>

          <p>On the second anniversary of the Maui wildfires that killed 102 people, the community is still grappling with a slow and difficult recovery. Only 50 of the more than 2,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt, and a recent state-funded study reveals that nearly half of Lahaina residents exhibit symptoms of depression. Survivors describe the ongoing mental health crisis and the immense trauma that persists two years after the disaster. Despite the challenges, residents are finding motivation in family and community to continue the arduous rebuilding process.</p>

The crew restrained the passenger twice, but he managed to break free both times. Upon landing, the individual was taken into custody by local police at the direction of the FBI.</p>

          <p>Marc Maron, host of the long-running podcast "WTF," has criticized the current state of podcasting, calling it a landscape of mediocrity. In a recent interview, the comedian lamented that the proliferation of podcasts has lowered the bar, resulting in "hundreds of groups of two or three white guys" creating content akin to uninspired drive-time radio. Maron, who recently announced his influential show will end this fall, expressed his distaste for the sheer volume of low-quality "yammering." His comments reflect a broader critique of a medium he helped popularize.</p>

          <p>New research from UC Riverside reveals that land subsidence, caused by the excessive pumping of groundwater for agriculture, is depressing home values in California's San Joaquin Valley. The study found that home sale prices in affected areas are 2.4% to 5.4% lower than in stable areas, resulting in an estimated collective loss of $1.87 billion in home values over six years. This slow-moving problem, which causes cracked foundations and other structural damage, is adding a significant economic burden on homeowners on top of the environmental consequences of chronic groundwater overdraft.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes presidential summit in Alaska, this article revisits the history of the territory's sale from Russia to the United States in 1867. The purchase, initially derided as "Seward's Folly," transferred control of the vast region for the sum of $7.2 million. The piece notes that despite the clear historical transaction, the sale is still questioned by some hardline nationalists in Russia. This historical context provides a unique backdrop to the modern geopolitical discussions set to take place on land that was once part of the Russian Empire.</p>

Lai, a British citizen, faces a potential life sentence if convicted of colluding with foreign forces under the controversial law imposed by China in 2020. His case is viewed internationally as a key indicator of the erosion of legal autonomy and freedom of speech in Hong Kong.

          <p>Newly installed temporary barriers successfully protected Alaska's capital, Juneau, from severe damage during a record-level glacial outburst flood. The Mendenhall River crested at unprecedented heights after a nearby ice-dammed basin released a massive surge of water, a phenomenon intensifying due to climate change. While some minor flooding occurred, the fortified Hesco barriers held back the worst of the waters, preventing the widespread destruction of homes seen in previous years. Officials credited the proactive measures with averting a potential catastrophe for hundreds of residences in the flood zone.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid can proceed. The court determined that the humanitarian groups who sued did not have the standing to bring the challenge, stating that only the Government Accountability Office can legally challenge the withholding of funds under the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. This decision is a major blow to global health and humanitarian programs, allowing the administration to withhold funding for initiatives like HIV/AIDS prevention, and it raises significant questions about the separation of powers.</p>

This marks a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was ranked last at under $1 billion. The surge in value is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's vision and development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium and the surrounding Hollywood Park district.
