As rocket launches become more frequent, the noise, including sonic booms from returning boosters, is causing disruptions. Researchers, led by Kent Gee at Brigham Young University, are investigating why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and how atmospheric conditions affect sound propagation. Their work aims to address rocket noise issues before they become widespread, especially with the advent of larger and louder rockets like Starship.</p>
