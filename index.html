          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key R&D employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This strategic move is not an acquisition of the company but involves Google paying for employee compensation and a nonexclusive license for Windsurf's technology. The deal underscores the intense competition for top AI talent among major tech firms like Google, OpenAI, and Meta. This transaction follows reports that Windsurf had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI, highlighting the high demand for expertise in advanced AI coding tools.</p>

          <h2>Prada to Collaborate with Indian Artisans Following Sandal Controversy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced a partnership with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing backlash for designs resembling traditional Kolhapuri sandals. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, leading to criticism from fashion critics and cultural advocates. In response, Prada initiated talks with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents the artisans. This move is seen as a positive step towards respectful collaboration between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities, with plans to patent the Kolhapuri chappal to protect its heritage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting immigration stops in several Southern California counties based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and immigrant rights groups, which alleged that federal agents were engaging in unconstitutional racial profiling and warrantless arrests. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong cited a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims. The order represents a significant, albeit temporary, check on the administration's intensified immigration enforcement operations in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward, although some claims were dismissed. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege Lovo deceptively used their voices, recorded for what they were told were internal tests, to create and sell AI-generated voice clones on its platform. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices as a whole, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their recordings as training data will proceed. This case is a significant development in the legal battles surrounding AI and artists' rights.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing a global presence to meet the growing demand from Chinese companies expanding their operations abroad. These firms are finding that Chinese businesses prefer the familiarity and trust of working with lawyers from their home country. The number of overseas Chinese legal offices has seen a significant 70% increase since 2018, reflecting a strategic push from Beijing to support this expansion. However, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients, particularly amidst rising geopolitical tensions, marking a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry on the world stage.</p>

A coalition of international experts and local campaigners, backed by a public petition, argues that the bridge can be repaired and a third track added alongside it.

          <h2>Preliminary Report on Air India Crash Indicates Engine Fuel Switches Were Turned Off</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary investigation into the Air India crash that killed at least 270 people has found that the fuel cutoff switches for both of the plane's engines were moved to the off position shortly after takeoff. According to the report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so. This action, occurring just three seconds into the flight, caused both engines to lose thrust. The report does not conclude whether the action was intentional or inadvertent, but it shifts focus onto crew actions rather than a mechanical failure.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new, large-scale Wonsan Kalma beach resort, with the first group of Russian tourists arriving this week. The project, championed by leader Kim Jong Un, is part of an effort to boost the nation's sanctioned economy and strengthen ties with Russia. However, the development is shrouded in controversy, with human rights groups and the UN highlighting credible reports that it was built using forced labor, including "shock brigades" subjected to brutal working conditions. Satellite imagery and internal documents analyzed by the BBC reveal the rapid construction of the resort, which bears a resemblance to Spanish tourist destinations like Benidorm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An intense and prolonged marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea is raising serious alarms among scientists about the potential for devastating impacts on marine life. Sea surface temperatures have regularly surpassed 30°C (86°F), reaching levels six or seven degrees above normal for this time of year, which is warmer than many swimming pools. This extreme heat, driven by global warming, can lead to mass mortality events for species like seagrasses and other organisms that form the foundation of the marine ecosystem. Ecologists warn that such events can have severe knock-on effects, including on vital fish stocks.</p>

          <p>A top Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of mismanaging an "ostentatious" office renovation project, escalating the White House's conflict with the central bank. In a letter, the Office of Management and Budget questioned the project's costs and suggested the Fed may be violating the law by altering plans without proper approval. This criticism comes amid President Trump's ongoing attacks on Powell for not lowering interest rates. Powell has previously testified that descriptions of the renovation, which includes necessary updates to buildings from the 1930s, have been misleading and inaccurate.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data and a stark warning from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggest the United Kingdom is facing a period of significant tax rises. The OBR's report described the country's financial risks as "daunting," with the potential for government debt to soar, while monthly figures show a dip in economic growth. This economic gloom sets a challenging stage for the new government's autumn Budget, with analysts predicting tax increases of £10bn to £20bn may be necessary to stabilize public finances and meet borrowing limits. The OBR stressed that continued borrowing is not a sustainable solution to rising spending pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, who are meeting for the first time at the tour level. The outcome will likely hinge on which player better handles the pressure of the occasion. While Swiatek has more experience in major finals, Anisimova's underdog status may allow her to play more freely and aggressively. A key tactical battle will be Swiatek's powerful top-spin forehand against Anisimova's formidable backhand. Both players have found strong form on grass, setting the stage for what promises to be a competitive championship match.</p>

In a recent speech, he drew inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, who pivoted towards the U.S. based on strategic reality rather than tradition. While reaffirming the importance of the U.S. alliance and security pacts like AUKUS, Albanese's government is signaling a recalibration of relationships. This approach emphasizes Australia's sovereignty and its determination to shape its own future in an increasingly uncertain Asia-Pacific region.</p>

Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will invoke its reciprocity law, creating the risk of a tariff war.

This move is part of a broader strategy of using tariffs to pressure numerous countries.

The Trump administration framed the action as a move against illegal labor and child exploitation, while farmworker advocates and local officials condemned it as a disproportionate and cruel action that terrorized the community.
