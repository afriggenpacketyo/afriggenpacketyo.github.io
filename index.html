The defense is pursuing an appeal based on this and separate allegations of jury tampering by the court clerk.</p>

          <p>British counter-terrorism police have issued a warning that hostile states like Russia, Iran, and China are increasingly attempting to recruit teenagers and other vulnerable individuals as proxies. This recruitment is for carrying out acts of sabotage and violence on UK soil, with investigations into such activities now comprising a significant portion of their workload. Authorities are urging parents and teachers to be vigilant for signs of manipulation, as the threat grows in complexity and volume.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, blocking the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to end the protections, arguing the situation in Afghanistan has improved, but the court's decision provides a brief reprieve. The ruling gives advocacy groups and the government time to file further arguments on the policy, which affects roughly 11,700 Afghans.</p>
