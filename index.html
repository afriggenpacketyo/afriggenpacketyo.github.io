          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 18:35:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a long-standing federal policy, now excluding undocumented children from the Head Start preschool program. This change is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for undocumented immigrants, compelling them to self-deport. The new rule, announced by the Department of Health and Human Services, also reclassifies at least 12 other programs as "federal public benefits" to restrict access for non-citizens. Advocacy groups warn this will create fear and confusion among all low-income families and deny vulnerable children access to crucial early education and nutrition.</p>

          <p>Suspected asbestos has been discovered in five locations surrounding a controversial bonfire site in south Belfast, built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency removed 20kg of the hazardous material, but public health concerns remain. Police have declined to assist in dismantling the bonfire, assessing that intervention carries a higher risk than letting the event proceed with mitigation measures. The situation has highlighted deep political and cultural divisions, with some residents defending the bonfire as a cultural tradition while officials worry about safety.</p>

          <p>Casey Anthony, who was acquitted in 2011 of murdering her daughter Caylee, was recently seen on what appeared to be a date at a sports bar in Manchester, New Hampshire. New images show her with an unidentified man, and an eyewitness reported noticeable chemistry between the two. Since her highly publicized trial, Anthony has attempted to rebrand herself as a legal advocate and researcher, launching accounts on TikTok and Substack. She has stated these platforms are for her to reintroduce herself and advocate for herself and her deceased daughter.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has completed the signing of Ghanaian midfielder Mohammed Kudus from West Ham in a deal worth £55 million. The 24-year-old has signed a six-year contract with Spurs, citing the club's history, Champions League play, and new head coach Thomas Frank as key reasons for the move. Kudus was a vital player for West Ham, scoring 14 goals in his first season after joining from Ajax in 2023. The transfer is part of a busy period for Tottenham, who are also expected to complete a £60 million deal for Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White.</p>

          <p>According to CDC data, emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. have reached their highest level in six years, with a notable spike in the Northeast. Experts attribute the rise to record-high tick populations and a longer active season for the arachnids, driven by climate change. Ticks can transmit numerous serious illnesses, including Lyme disease, making the increase a significant public health concern. Health officials emphasize the importance of prevention, urging people to wear protective clothing, use insect repellent, and perform thorough tick checks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>Just weeks before a devastating flood killed at least 96 people, officials in Kerr County, Texas, were scheduled to begin developing a new flood monitoring system. The region, known as "flash flood alley," has a history of dangerous inundations, but lacked a centralized public alarm network. The new dashboard was intended to be a decision-support tool for emergency managers, not a public alert system. The tragic timing highlights the area's vulnerability and raises questions about whether better warning infrastructure could have mitigated the catastrophic loss of life from the Guadalupe River's overflow.</p>

          <p>As the only nation to have suffered a nuclear attack, Japan has long championed global disarmament, a national identity shaped by the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, this long-held position is beginning to shift due to growing regional security threats. China is engaged in a rapid nuclear buildup, and North Korea remains a hostile, nuclear-armed neighbor. According to this analysis, the prospect of South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons could be the tipping point that compels Japan to abandon its non-nuclear taboo, potentially triggering a dangerous proliferation cascade.</p>
