Yamamoto expressed gratitude to his teammates for their support, noting his ability to contend in games each week due to a good five-day rest schedule between starts. The article highlights Yamamoto's defensive skill, referencing a play where he fielded a bunt and tagged a sliding runner at first base. </p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. The research, published in Cell, showed that rice plants adapted to cold stress passed on this tolerance to subsequent generations through epigenetic changes. This finding supports Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's theory that organisms can pass on learned survival traits, reigniting the debate between Lamarckism and Darwinism. The study identifies DNA methylation as the mechanism driving cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that epigenetics plays a role in evolution.</p>

          <p>Japan has approved a $6.3 billion spending package to shield its economy from the impact of U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump. The funds will support small and medium-sized businesses and subsidize household energy costs, addressing concerns about an economic slowdown and rising consumer prices. The automotive sector, a key part of Japan's economy, has already been affected by tariffs on finished automobiles and car parts. The Japanese government is seeking an exemption from these auto tariffs in negotiations with the U.S., though progress has been slow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong’s leader, John Lee Ka-chiu, has criticized organizations that defend members under tax investigations, stating that such attempts to pressure authorities will only expose their ugly nature. He emphasized that no one has a special privilege to evade taxes and that authorities would pursue legal responsibility in accordance with the law. His comments come in response to recent tax reviews on members of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. He added that the Inland Revenue Department has a legal obligation to conduct tax audits and assessments.</p>
