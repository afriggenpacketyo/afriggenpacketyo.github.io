          <p>Several tankers have altered their courses away from the Strait of Hormuz amid rising concerns about potential disruptions to trade following reported U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Data indicates that at least six vessels initially diverted their routes, but some have since resumed their journey towards the strait. This event is set against a backdrop of heightened tensions in the region, impacting shipping patterns and raising concerns about the stability of vessel flow in the area. The situation remains fluid, with analysts closely monitoring vessel movements and geopolitical developments.</p>

Cooper emphasized that the ban is specific to Palestine Action and does not affect lawful protest groups campaigning on issues around Palestine or the Middle East. If passed in Parliament, membership or support of the group would become a criminal offense, punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, alleging antitrust violations related to Zillow's new rule that bans home listings appearing on other services for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow. Compass claims this policy, dubbed the "Zillow ban," is an attempt to stifle competition and leverages Zillow's market dominance. Compass utilizes a three-step marketing strategy for listings, which includes a "private exclusive" period before appearing on Zillow, arguing that Zillow's policy interferes with this approach. The lawsuit seeks to protect consumer choice and prevent Zillow from coercing agents and listings.</p>

          <p>Amid global uncertainty following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, President Trump is expected to attend a NATO summit in the Netherlands.
