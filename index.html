          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that the Pentagon is discussing acquiring equity stakes in leading defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin. This consideration follows the U.S. government's recent $9 billion acquisition of a 10% stake in Intel. Lutnick suggested the current financing of defense capabilities is a "giveaway," indicating a potential major overhaul of Pentagon appropriations. The move reflects President Trump's broader strategy of increasing government control over the private economy to achieve economic and national security goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A column in the LA Times criticizes the Republican party for perceived hypocrisy and President Trump's actions, which the author describes as bordering on tyranny. The article highlights several instances, including the deployment of armed troops in D.C. and other cities, the acquisition of Intel stock, and alleged politically motivated firings and threats against critics. The author argues that both political sides contribute to a "ratchet effect" of increasing violations of norms, but emphasizes that the current administration's actions are particularly concerning, warning against the erosion of constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>A new Quaest poll reveals a significant shift in Brazilian public opinion, with negative views of the United States doubling to 48% and surpassing positive views for the first time in two years. Conversely, perceptions of China have markedly improved, with 49% now holding a favorable opinion. The article notes a deep ideological polarization within Brazil, where left-leaning voters maintain a positive image of China, while right-leaning voters are stronger supporters of the U.S. This data underscores changing geopolitical alignments and internal political divisions in Brazil.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly ridiculed Democrats, particularly Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for what he described as adherence to deeply unpopular political positions. Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Trump highlighted significant Republican voter registration gains, contrasting them with Democratic losses. He specifically targeted Democratic stances on crime and the issue of transgender athletes in women's sports, portraying these as "traps" that alienate voters. The article notes these comments come as the Democratic Party seeks to recover from recent electoral setbacks and fundraising deficits.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that the federal government will seek the death penalty for murders committed in Washington, D.C., as part of an escalated federal crime crackdown. This initiative serves as a test case for broader federal law enforcement efforts, including plans to establish National Guard forces ready for civil unrest in each state. Despite D.C. abolishing the death penalty in 1981, Trump views capital punishment as a strong preventative measure. The announcement follows a period of federal intervention in D.C. crime, which saw a temporary lull in murders.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of depositing $100,000 into Certificates of Deposit (CDs) versus high-yield savings accounts. While CDs offer fixed, guaranteed rates for a set term, high-yield savings accounts feature variable rates that can fluctuate. The analysis provides examples showing that depending on the term length, either option could yield slightly more interest, but the certainty of a CD's rate is a key differentiator. Both vehicles are presented as viable options for savers seeking to protect principal and earn high rates without stock market volatility, though CDs require funds to be locked in to avoid penalties.

          <p>Decades after their conviction for the 1989 murders of their parents, Lyle and Erik Menendez's claims of lifelong abuse are bolstered by newly surfaced evidence. This article details a recently discovered letter from Erik to his cousin, written months before the crime, describing ongoing abuse by their father. Additionally, former Menudo band member Roy Rossello has come forward with a sworn affidavit alleging sexual assault by Jose Menendez in the 1980s. Their appellate attorney argues this evidence, previously unavailable or dismissed, should vacate their first-degree murder convictions and lead to a new trial or resentencing to manslaughter.</p>

          <p>A Frankfurt court has ruled that Apple can no longer market its Apple Watch as "CO2-neutral" in Germany, citing misleading consumer claims. The judgment, which can be appealed, sided with environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), finding Apple's reliance on a Paraguay reforestation project for offsets insufficient. The court noted that only 25% of the land for the project is secured beyond 2029, falling short of consumer expectations for long-term guarantees. This article highlights a significant win against greenwashing practices in advertising.</p>

          <p>German media reports indicate that some of the approximately 2,000 Afghans who fled the Taliban and are awaiting German visas will soon be permitted to travel from Pakistan. Berlin had initially resisted their entry, citing a need for individual security reviews, even for previously approved cases. However, facing multiple court challenges arguing binding promises had been made, an unspecified number of these individuals are now expected to fly to Germany via commercial flights in the coming days. This development suggests a resolution for many facing uncertainty after assisting German entities in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever have voiced strong warnings against seizing over €200 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets held in Europe. They argue that such a move, while urged by some to aid Ukraine, poses significant legal problems and could prompt other nations to withdraw capital from the EU, undermining financial stability. While interest payments from these funds are already assisting Kyiv, both leaders, citing legal and market impacts, emphasized the potential for unlawful action and liability for the Belgian state.</p>

          <p>A Berlin court has issued an 18-month suspended sentence to a Syrian teenager, who was 14 at the time, for his involvement in an "Islamic State"-inspired plot to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. The minor was found to have sent bomb-building instructions and facilitated contact with an ISIS member, having been radicalized online. The plot, thwarted with U.S. intelligence assistance, led to the cancellation of three Vienna concerts. Austrian authorities are prosecuting three other teenage suspects, while the defendant in Berlin made a comprehensive confession.</p>

          <p>Despite the S&P 500's strong performance in 2025, financial experts are advising investors to diversify their portfolios due to increasing market concentration. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks accounted for 26% of recent earnings growth, making the market "narrow" and heavily reliant on a few large-cap companies. Investment strategists suggest that while long-term index investing remains valid, frequent account checking and the current market structure warrant active stock picking and diversification into other sectors, international markets, or smaller-cap stocks. This approach aims to capitalize on untapped opportunities, especially where generative AI can drive productivity beyond the already-priced tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>
