          <p>The UK is bracing for another day of temperatures exceeding 30C, with central England potentially reaching 32C, as an early summer heatwave persists. While Friday is expected to be slightly cooler than Thursday's record-breaking temperatures, Saturday could see highs of 34C. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, cautioning of significant impacts on health and social care services, particularly for the elderly and those with health conditions. The heatwave is predicted to peak on Saturday, with some regions experiencing thundery showers, before temperatures ease slightly on Sunday, remaining below the June peak of 1976. </p>

          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, intends to divide his estimated $13.9 billion fortune among his over 100 children. Durov stated that all his children will have equal rights to the inheritance, which they will not be able to access for 30 years, as he wants them to live normal lives and build themselves up independently. Durov, who faces criminal charges in France related to the moderation of his app, explained that his job involves risks, as defending freedoms earns one many enemies. He denies any wrongdoing and describes the charges as absurd, emphasizing that the use of Telegram by criminals does not make the platform's operators criminals. </p>

          <p>UK retail sales experienced a sharp decline last month, primarily driven by poor sales in supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Sales volumes fell by an estimated 2.7% in May, marking the largest monthly drop since December 2023. The ONS indicated that alcohol and tobacco sales decreased as consumers cut back on spending. Separate figures from the ONS revealed an increase in government borrowing last month, reaching the second-highest level for May since records began in 1993. </p>

          <p>A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump can maintain control over National Guard troops in Los Angeles, despite objections from California's governor. The court stated that Trump's administration provided a defensible rationale for the deployment, which was to protect federal personnel and property. This decision reverses a lower court ruling that ordered Trump to return control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, who criticized the deployment as an authoritarian move. Trump celebrated the ruling as a "BIG WIN," while Newsom emphasized that the president's powers are not unlimited. </p>

          <p>Leading publications of Chinaâ€™s ruling Communist Party have urged local governments to implement strictures on lavish banquets carefully, seeking to temper overzealousness amid concerns from the food and beverage industry. A commentary in Qiushi, the party's theoretical journal, emphasized that the frugality measures are intended to limit extravagant practices, not ordinary dining. Some local governments have been scrutinizing every meal gathering and intervening in banquets, leading to agencies canceling official receptions and cadres avoiding normal working meals. These oversimplified measures have complicated understanding of the regulations, derailing their original intention and causing unnecessary shocks to the catering industry. </p>

          <p>The recent conflict between Israel and Iran has highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, potentially boosting the prospects for the U.S.'s proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system. Trump's Golden Dome aims to protect the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through a network of satellites, sensors, and interceptors. The project has faced criticism due to its high cost and potential to escalate arms races, but it is seen as an opportunity for private space companies facing budget cuts at NASA. The House Appropriations Committee has proposed significant funding for missile defense and space programs to support the Golden Dome effort. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mother from Bishop Auckland is among 28 people who have been poisoned by fake Botox injections in the north-east of England, leading to potentially fatal botulism. Nicola Fairley experienced severe adverse effects, including a closing throat and facial drooping, after receiving what she believed to be a legitimate Botox jab. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has launched an investigation into the illegal sale and supply of fake "Botox-type" products. Experts warn that cheap anti-wrinkle injections could indicate the use of illegal toxins, and call for greater regulation of the cosmetic injections industry. </p>

The condition is best treated before the age of seven, but many councils are unable to offer screenings due to capacity or budget constraints.

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can extend the shelf life of fruits by 2Â½ times. The low-cost coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, effectively delaying rot in various fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes. The new strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity. The team, led by researchers at Shaanxi Normal University, published their findings in Nature Communications, emphasizing the coating's universal applicability for post-harvest and fresh-cut fruits. </p>
