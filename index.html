          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The location was chosen for its historical connection, as the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867. The summit follows Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, though his suggestions of potential land swaps have raised concerns in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend but will be briefed on the outcome of the high-stakes diplomatic meeting.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly threatened to sue Apple, alleging antitrust violations over the placement of his companies' apps, X and Grok, in the App Store. Musk claims that Apple is deliberately preventing these apps from being featured in its 'Must Have' section, which he argues is a politically motivated move to disadvantage competitors to OpenAI. He asserted that this behavior makes it impossible for other AI companies to achieve top rankings, prompting his AI firm, xAI, to prepare for immediate legal action.

          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, savers with significant funds can choose between Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts for reliable growth. This article compares the potential interest earned on a $50,000 deposit in both account types over different terms, highlighting the trade-offs involved. While CDs offer a fixed, guaranteed return, high-yield savings accounts provide more flexibility but have variable rates that can change with market conditions. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals and risk tolerance for interest rate fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England is currently experiencing its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 33C (91.4F) in some areas. The prolonged period of dry, warm weather has led to what the national drought group describes as "nationally significant" water shortfalls, impacting agriculture, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk. In response, millions of people are now under hosepipe bans to conserve water. The extreme weather is also causing disruptions to rail services due to the shrinking of soil under the tracks, highlighting the growing infrastructure challenges posed by climate change.</p>

The victims were identified as Kristen Grissom, 38, and Christine Marie McAbee, 35. An autopsy revealed McAbee died from a gunshot wound, and investigators believe the women were killed at a different location before their bodies were moved. The sheriff's office has stated that the incident appears to be isolated and does not pose a threat to the wider community.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, has been successfully rescued after surviving for nine days while lost in a remote region of British Columbia, Canada. Barber utilized his wilderness knowledge to build a shelter from moss and sticks and drank pond water to survive. He also created distress signals, including carving "HELP" on a rock and drawing an "SOS" in the mud, which ultimately led to his discovery by a search and rescue helicopter. He was found severely dehydrated with a leg injury but is expected to make a full recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose 2.7% annually in July, holding steady from the previous month as lower gas and grocery prices offset other increases. However, economists are pointing to underlying data suggesting that the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies are beginning to exert upward pressure on prices for certain goods. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, climbed to a 3.1% annual rate, its fastest pace since February. Analysts predict this figure could rise further as the full effects of tariffs are passed on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines' stock price plunged by nearly 40% after the company issued a warning about its ability to continue operations, stating there is "substantial doubt" it can remain a going concern. This cautionary statement comes only months after the budget carrier emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In its quarterly report, Spirit cited persistent adverse market conditions, including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and rising operational costs. The airline, which has already initiated pilot furloughs, noted it needs more liquidity and may have to sell aircraft and real estate.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages offer a way for homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, providing a potential income boost in retirement. While most of these loans are federally regulated and insured, they are not without risks. Homeowners must continue to pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failure to do so can lead to default and foreclosure. The loan's balance grows over time, which can significantly deplete the equity left for heirs, making it a complex financial decision that requires careful long-term planning.

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has asked a judge to consider jailing former congressman Beto O'Rourke for allegedly violating a court order. The order temporarily blocked O'Rourke's political group, Powered by People, from fundraising to support Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a Republican-led redistricting effort. Paxton's filing claims O'Rourke openly defied the ruling by continuing to solicit donations. The legal battle is part of a larger political conflict over a proposed congressional map that would significantly favor Republicans in the state.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour party came to power in July of last year. The milestone has drawn criticism from opposition parties, who argue the government's pledge to "smash" smuggling gangs has been ineffective. The government acknowledges the challenge, pointing to a new returns agreement with France as a key part of its strategy to deter crossings. The news comes as French authorities confirmed another death, a woman who died while attempting to board a boat to the UK.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to potentially allow 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. This move could significantly change retirement savings options for American workers, offering the potential for higher returns but also introducing greater risk and complexity. While the private equity industry has long sought access to the vast 401(k) market, experts caution that adoption may be slow due to concerns over higher fees, lack of transparency, and the potential for increased volatility in retirement portfolios.

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his pressure on the Federal Reserve, threatening to allow a "major lawsuit" against its chairman, Jerome Powell, if interest rates are not cut immediately. In a social media post, Trump criticized Powell's performance and claimed the potential lawsuit would relate to the management of costly renovations at the Fed's headquarters. The president has persistently attacked Powell for not lowering interest rates more aggressively, a move Trump claims would save the government money. The Fed, which operates independently, has so far kept rates steady in 2025.</p>

Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal, which is higher than the startup's own valuation.

The warning reportedly targets Nvidia's H20 chip, which was recently approved for export to China under a new licensing deal with the U.S. government. This development complicates the situation for U.S. chipmakers, who created these less-advanced chips specifically to comply with U.S. export controls while still serving the crucial Chinese market.
