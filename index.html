            <p>As trade tensions escalate between China and the United States, Chinese Premier Li Qiang has urged officials to foster positive market expectations and create synergy to overcome risks. Vice-Premier He Lifeng emphasized China's commitment to being a fertile ground for foreign investment while meeting with Nvidia's CEO. These efforts aim to reassure businesses amidst tariffs imposed by the US, with China vowing to "fight to the end" in response to Washington's reciprocal tariffs on all its trading partners. The Chinese government is trying to stabilize the economy and maintain investor confidence in the face of ongoing trade disputes.</p>

            <p>An energy expert argues against the hype surrounding small modular reactors (SMRs) as a solution for California's energy needs, citing their high costs and historical failures. Despite venture capital and media attention, SMRs are deemed less economically viable than larger reactors and face challenges from tariffs and cheaper renewable energy sources. The author points to the Vogtle plant in Georgia as an example of the high costs associated with nuclear power, making it an expensive energy source compared to natural gas, solar, and wind. The expert suggests focusing on wind, solar, and battery storage as more cost-effective and cleaner alternatives for California's energy future.</p>

            <p>U.S. airstrikes targeting the Houthi-controlled Ras Isa oil port in Yemen reportedly resulted in dozens of casualties, marking a significant escalation in the conflict. Central Command stated the strikes aimed to eliminate a fuel source for the Houthis and deprive them of revenue used to fund terrorist activities. The Houthis and Iran condemned the attacks, while the U.S. also accused a Chinese satellite company of supporting Houthi attacks. This action occurs amidst ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Iran regarding Iran's nuclear program, further internationalizing the Yemen war.</p>

The administration's measures, including disabling the CBP One app and launching the CBP Home app, have created fear in immigrant communities. Advocates report an increase in inquiries from those considering leaving on their own terms, despite having built lives and families in the U.S. This decision reflects a growing sense of vulnerability and a desire to avoid the trauma of forced deportation.</p>

            <p>The leaders of Canada's major federal parties engaged in their second and final debate, focusing on trade relations with the U.S., domestic affordability, and environmental policy. Liberal leader Mark Carney faced challenges from opponents highlighting the perceived failures of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau. Leaders debated how to respond to Trump's tariffs, with a shift towards targeted tariffs to maximize pain on the U.S. while minimizing harm to Canada. Smaller parties fought for air time amid polls suggesting a dominance of the Conservatives and Liberals.</p>

            <p>Millions of people are expected to face disruption to their Easter weekend travel plans due to rail engineering works, airport strikes, and heavy traffic. Planned industrial action at Gatwick Airport could impact some airlines, while Network Rail carries out maintenance projects. The RAC warns of potential "big jams" on roads, and the Port of Dover cautions about traffic causing extended processing times. Weather could also affect travel with yellow warnings for rain issued for parts of the UK.</p>

            <p>Chinese-backed online retailers Shein and Temu announced they will increase US prices due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs. The de minimis exemption, allowing packages under US$800 to enter the US duty-free, will no longer apply to Chinese goods starting May 2. This change, coupled with new tariffs of up to 245 per cent, is expected to significantly impact the platforms’ cost structures. The platforms attributed the price hikes to rising operating costs, with nearly identical statements issued on their US websites.</p>

            <p>A batch of lercanidipine, a common drug for high blood pressure, has been recalled after some packs were wrongly labeled as containing 10mg tablets when they actually contain 20mg pills.

Taking too high a dose of lercanidipine can cause dizziness and sleepiness. The error is limited to one batch, but over 7,700 packs have already been distributed.</p>

The coroner labeled the licensing system as "ineffective and unsafe," noting the UK's reliance on self-reporting of visual conditions.

            <p>Climate change is not merely a problem of physics but a crisis of justice, shaped by inequality and colonial structures. Research shows that the effects of extreme weather depend on local economic and social conditions, with poverty and lack of infrastructure exacerbating the impact. The narrative that burning fossil fuels is essential for prosperity obscures the role of colonial practices and inequality in the climate crisis. Addressing climate change requires transforming social life, political power, and economic decision-making.</p>

            <p>Mexico's governing party, Morena, has achieved significant electoral success by focusing on socioeconomic justice, bucking the trend of far-right gains in other countries. Led by Andrés Manuel López Obrador and later Claudia Sheinbaum, Morena doubled the minimum wage and expanded social programs. While progressives can learn from Morena's focus on inequality and party organization, the party's populist tactics and embrace of right-wing positions raise questions about its broader applicability. Morena's success is rooted in Mexico's unique history and political landscape, making it a complex model for other left-leaning movements.</p>
