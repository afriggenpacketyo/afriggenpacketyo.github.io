          <p>Firefighters responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, were ambushed by a gunman shooting from the woods. The incident triggered an active shooter response and a shelter-in-place order for the surrounding area. Authorities are investigating the possibility that the fire was deliberately set to lure first responders into an attack. Idaho Governor Brad Little condemned the event as a "heinous direct assault" on emergency personnel, and the FBI is assisting the local sheriff's office in the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Thousands of reported sightings continue to fuel a passionate search for the Tasmanian tiger, a wolf-like marsupial declared extinct in 1986. Enthusiasts in Tasmania invest significant time and resources, using trail cams and analyzing potential evidence, driven by personal encounters and a deep-seated belief the animal survives. The quest has also entered the laboratory, where scientists are working on a controversial "de-extinction" project using DNA from the thylacine's closest living relative, the dunnart. While some experts are skeptical of both the sightings and the genetic revival, the enduring hope reflects a powerful connection to the lost species.</p>

          <p>A rare photo album donated to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum provides a chilling glimpse into the lives of SS officers at Auschwitz. The scrapbook belonged to Karl Höcker, an administrator at the camp, and contains 116 images of officers and staff enjoying social gatherings, singing, and relaxing at a nearby resort. These photos, taken while the camp was operating at its peak extermination rate, juxtapose the perpetrators' seemingly normal lives with the systematic murder of 1.1 million people. The discovery, which includes the only known photos of Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz, has inspired a play exploring the psychology of those who carried out the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is facing a significant national security challenge from mysterious drone swarms repeatedly flying over sensitive military sites and critical infrastructure. A particularly alarming series of events occurred over 17 nights at Langley Air Force Base, forcing the relocation of advanced F-22 fighter jets for their own protection. Despite investigations, the origin and operators of these drones, which range in size from small quadcopters to car-sized vehicles, remain unknown. Officials express concern over these intelligence-gathering incursions, highlighting a critical gap in the nation's ability to detect, track, and counter low-altitude aerial threats within its own airspace.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed director Werner Herzog, now 82, has built a six-decade career making unconventional films that explore the power of nature and the fringes of human sanity. From hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for "Fitzcarraldo" to documenting the life of a man who lived with bears in "Grizzly Man," Herzog's methods are famously extreme. He views filmmaking as a pursuit of profound, poetic truth, often narrating his own documentaries with a distinctive voice. Insisting he is the "only one who is clinically sane" in the film industry, he continues to work, teaching a new generation of "rogue" filmmakers to embrace a life of experience to create their art.</p>

          <p>Seven miles off the English coast, the Principality of Sealand exists as a self-declared sovereign nation on a former World War II anti-aircraft platform. Founded in 1967 by pirate radio operator Roy Bates, the micronation has its own royal family, currency, and a history of fending off coups and rival invasions. Today, the Bates family maintains Sealand's existence by selling noble titles online, funding the upkeep of the unusual territory. This story of defiance and eccentricity highlights the unique journey of a family that turned a concrete fort in the North Sea into a symbol of freedom and independence.</p>

They worked as communications operators, relaying information about incoming transports and the number of prisoners being sent to the gas chambers.

          <p>Stopping the mysterious drone swarms over sensitive U.S. sites is a complex challenge due to a combination of technical limitations and legal hurdles. Standard radar systems are often unable to track these low-flying objects, and simply shooting them down over populated areas poses significant safety risks from falling debris and munitions. Furthermore, jamming the drones' communication frequencies could disrupt civilian services like Wi-Fi and GPS. A lack of a single, empowered agency to coordinate a response among the military, FAA, and law enforcement further complicates the issue, leaving a critical vulnerability that the Pentagon is now urgently trying to address.</p>

The plane, known for its fuel efficiency and composite-material construction, has been the subject of multiple whistleblower allegations regarding quality control at its South Carolina factory. Former employees have claimed that pressure to meet production targets led to safety compromises, including the use of substandard parts and flawed assembly processes. While Boeing insists the aircraft is safe, the crash has brought these long-standing concerns about the plane's structural integrity back into the spotlight.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun debating a major Republican legislative package that includes significant tax cuts and increased spending on immigration enforcement. According to a new analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bill is estimated to increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade. The CBO also projects that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 due to cuts in healthcare and nutrition programs, which are intended to offset the cost of extending Trump-era tax breaks. The stark projections pose a challenge for Republican leadership as they push to pass the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is cracking down on writers of "danmei," a popular genre of gay erotic fiction, with dozens of young female authors arrested in recent months. The writers, who publish on the Taiwan-hosted platform Haitang, are accused of producing and distributing obscene material, a crime that can carry a lengthy prison sentence. This genre has a large following among young women in China, offering a creative outlet to explore themes of desire outside of traditional norms. The crackdown, which authorities have tried to suppress online, is seen as part of a broader push by Beijing to enforce traditional family values and control online content.</p>

          <p>A week after the U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the mission's success and goals. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed the sites were "obliterated," preliminary intelligence reports suggested the setback to Iran's nuclear program was more limited. As the week progressed, officials appeared to shift their focus, highlighting the achievement of a ceasefire with Israel as a key outcome rather than the complete destruction of the facilities. This evolving narrative has sparked ongoing questions about the actual extent of the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

Speaking to the BBC, Majid Takht-Ravanchi said that while the U.S. has indicated a desire to negotiate through mediators, its position on potential future strikes during dialogue remains unclear. He emphasized that Iran will insist on its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes and rejected any "zero enrichment" demands. The statement underscores the deep mistrust following recent U.S. bombing raids on Iranian nuclear sites, which scuttled a planned round of talks.</p>

Drawing a comparison to the mid-1990s, when American students were just beginning to return to China after the 1989 Tiananmen Square disruption, he notes a similar dynamic today post-pandemic. Based on a recent trip to China with his students, he observed a warm and welcoming reception, indicating a desire for connection despite high-level political friction. This suggests that people-to-people exchanges can persist and help bridge divides even during periods of intense geopolitical rivalry.</p>

Coming in as a bulk reliever, the 24-year-old left-hander allowed just three hits and struck out six, continuing a strong run of form in his sophomore season. After a difficult start to the year, Wrobleski has made key adjustments, notably increasing his fastball velocity, which has helped him become a reliable depth option for the team.

          <p>Norway's state-owned lottery company, Norsk Tipping, has apologized after mistakenly informing thousands of Eurojackpot players they had won significantly more money than they actually had. The error occurred due to a technical glitch where winnings in Euros were incorrectly multiplied instead of being converted properly to Norwegian kroner. The company's CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, expressed deep regret for the disappointment caused to customers who had already begun making plans with their supposed winnings. Following the incident and other recent technical issues, Sagstuen announced she would be stepping down from her position.</p>

          <p>Senator Mark Warner of Virginia has alleged that the Trump administration explicitly threatened the University of Virginia with major cuts to jobs, research funding, and student aid if its president, Jim Ryan, did not resign. Ryan, who had championed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies opposed by the president, stepped down on Friday amid a Justice Department investigation into those policies. Warner condemned the move as an "outrageous action" and an overreach of federal power into education, warning that other universities could be similarly targeted for their academic policies and leadership.</p>

          <h2>Tangled Strap Likely Caused Fatal Ejection Seat Accident, Air Force Report Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Air Force investigation has concluded that the death of instructor pilot Capt. John Robertson in May 2024 was likely caused by an accidental activation of his T-6A Texan II's ejection seat. The report suggests that while taxiing after a flight, a strap from Robertson's gear probably snagged the ejection handle as he was unbuckling, launching him from the aircraft. The unplanned ejection occurred while the plane was on the ground, and Robertson died from his injuries. Investigators noted that unbuckling while taxiing is not uncommon and that guidelines on the procedure are not clear.</p>

          <p>NBA legend LeBron James is set to make history by playing a record 23rd season in the league after exercising his $53 million player option to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2025-26 season. At 40 years old, the NBA's all-time leading scorer is reportedly targeting a fifth championship ring. The move surpasses the previous record for seasons played, which James shared with Vince Carter. By staying with the Lakers, James continues his pursuit of both team success and individual records, including potentially becoming the all-time leader in regular-season games played.</p>
