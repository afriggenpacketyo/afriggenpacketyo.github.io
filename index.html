          <h2>US Federal Reserve's Inflation Gauge Shows Subdued April Amid Spending Slowdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 10:17:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge indicated subdued inflation in April, coinciding with a slowdown in consumer spending, according to the New York Times article. This suggests that the Fed is likely to maintain its current stance on interest rates, awaiting more clarity on President Trump's economic policies. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key measure for the Fed, showed a modest increase, reflecting a cautious approach to monetary policy amidst economic uncertainty. The Fed's decision-making is heavily influenced by these indicators as they assess the overall health and stability of the economy. The central bank aims to balance inflation control with sustainable economic growth. The article underscores the intricate relationship between fiscal policy, consumer behavior, and monetary decisions. Optimism that this balance will be achieved is moderate.</p>

          <p>President Trump accused China of violating a recent trade agreement with the United States, leading to a slight dip in U.S. stocks in early trading, according to the ABC News article. Trump's criticism casts doubt on the stability of the accord and raises concerns about a potential resurgence of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also voiced pessimism about U.S.-China trade talks, further contributing to market unease. The trade agreement had previously led to a surge in the stock market and eased recession forecasts, but the recent developments have created renewed uncertainty. A federal appeals court temporarily reinstated tariffs after a panel struck down the legal justification for the levies.</p>

          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as New York City's Police Commissioner during the 9/11 attacks, has died at the age of 69, as reported by the New York Times.

Kerik's post-9/11 leadership was initially praised, but his subsequent legal troubles cast a shadow over his achievements. The article serves as an obituary, chronicling his life and career highlights, as well as the controversies that marked his later years.

          <p>Gerry Adams, the former Sinn Féin leader, has been awarded €100,000 in damages in a libel case against the BBC over a story alleging he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, according to the BBC News article. The court found that the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and Adams, who denies any involvement in the murder, stated that the case was about holding the BBC accountable. The Donaldson family called for a public inquiry into the murder, expressing that they have been "stonewalled" during the libel case. The BBC expressed disappointment with the verdict, stating that they believe they provided extensive evidence of journalistic diligence and careful editorial process, raising concerns about potential limitations on freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Costco exceeded earnings and revenue expectations for its fiscal third quarter, reporting an 8% year-over-year sales increase, yet shares fell slightly, according to the CNBC article. The company's leaders noted that tariffs have led to higher costs and supply chain adjustments, forcing them to tweak their supply chain and, in some cases, raise prices. While Costco does not provide an annual outlook, it has been actively seeking ways to reduce tariff costs and maintain competitive prices. The company has absorbed some tariff-related cost differences while increasing prices on discretionary items. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This Vox article critiques Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, arguing that scientific evidence points to genetics as the more significant factor. Experts suggest that the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, increased awareness, and better screening. The article highlights the identification of hundreds of genes associated with autism and the development of new therapies based on genetic research. Researchers fear that Kennedy's emphasis on environmental factors could divert resources from genetic research that holds promise for treating autism.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic article discusses a unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, asserting it as a victory for the constitutional system of separation of powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The decision emphasized that the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive power to lay and collect taxes and regulate commerce with foreign nations. The ruling imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the IEEPA tariffs, but the administration has appealed the decision.</p>

          <h2>Financial Incentives May Not Be Enough to Boost US Fertility Rates</h2>

          <p>This CNBC article discusses why U.S. policies like baby bonds and child tax credits may not be sufficient to convince Americans to have more children, as the fertility rate hovers near historic lows. Economists express concern about the economic implications of a shrinking population, including fewer future workers to support programs like Social Security and Medicare. Lawmakers have proposed financial incentives such as lump-sum payments for newborns and bigger child tax credits. However, experts argue that these measures are unlikely to significantly impact long-term fertility trends due to the substantial long-term commitment and costs associated with raising a child.

          <p>Russell Brand pleaded not guilty to charges of sexual assault in a London courtroom, according to the NPR article. Brand, facing five counts of sexual assault, denied any wrongdoing with all of them. The charges date back more than 25 years and involve four women who accuse him of attacking them in separate incidents. Brand, a recent convert to Christianity, has leaned into his faith in denying the charges and claims the "law has become a weapon" used against people who criticize corruption.</p>
