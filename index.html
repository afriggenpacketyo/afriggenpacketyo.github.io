          <p>Nvidia plans to anchor CoreWeave's IPO with a substantial $250 million order, despite the offering's price reduction from the initial filing.  This demonstrates Nvidia's strong commitment to CoreWeave, a company that leverages Nvidia's AI chips, and highlights the growing demand for AI computing resources.  Nvidia's existing 6% stake in CoreWeave further underscores this strategic partnership.</p>

          <p>General Motors' stock experienced the most significant decline among automakers in response to President Trump's new tariffs.  This is attributed to GM's higher reliance on vehicle imports from Mexico compared to competitors like Ford and Stellantis. Analysts predict that GM may need to adjust its production strategy to mitigate the impact of these tariffs. <i></i><br>(not investment advice)<i></i></p>
