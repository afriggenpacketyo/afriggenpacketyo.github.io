          <p>Eric Jackson, a hedge fund manager known for his role in the Opendoor trading surge, has publicly endorsed Better Home & Finance Holding Co., dubbing it the 'Shopify of mortgages.' Jackson highlighted the company's use of artificial intelligence to rebuild the $15 trillion mortgage industry. He noted Better Home's valuation at 1x 2026 sales, compared to a competitor's 19x, despite Better Home's faster growth. Jackson projects a potential 350-bagger return for Better Home within two years, emphasizing it is not a meme stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem supported last week's interest rate cut as a precautionary measure to bolster the labor market. However, he expressed wariness about additional reductions, citing ongoing concerns about inflation. Musalem believes the current monetary policy stance, targeting 4%-4.25%, is appropriate and near neutral, cautioning against becoming overly accommodative. He is a voting member of the FOMC this year, and his remarks align with some officials who foresee limited further easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cyberattack on Friday, September 19, caused significant disruptions at several European airports, including Berlin, Brussels, and London Heathrow. The EU cybersecurity agency, ENISA, confirmed a third-party ransomware attack targeted MUSE, a widely used check-in and boarding software by Collins Aerospace. The incident led to numerous flight cancellations and delays, with experts warning of potential further spread due to Collins' services being used globally. Investigations are ongoing, with speculation on the attackers' identity ranging from nation-states like Russia to smaller groups. The economic impacts are immediate, affecting airlines and airports, with long-term concerns for Collins and potential data breaches. The article emphasizes the critical reliance on IT systems and calls for greater transparency. </p>

          <p>Nepal's urban youth led an anti-corruption rebellion, ousting the government of K P Sharma Oli and sparking debate over internal versus external influences. Political scientists attribute the revolt to mass frustration from cronyism and lack of opportunities, noting increased external influence as state institutions weaken. Nepal's traditionally non-aligned foreign policy is crucial for balancing ties with India, China, and the US, all of whom have significant stakes in the Himalayan nation's stability. The interim government now faces the challenge of organizing elections and navigating these complex international relationships while maintaining national sovereignty.

This growth, particularly notable in states like California and Florida, is fueled by declining barriers to entry thanks to artificial intelligence and social media platforms. AI acts as a virtual assistant, while social media, like TikTok, enables solopreneurs to connect with global customer bases instantly and affordably. The trend reflects a broader shift towards flexibility, autonomy, and purpose, with many individuals, especially women under 30, prioritizing personal brands over traditional corporate paths. This article highlights how technology is empowering individuals to create and scale businesses more easily than ever before. </p>

          <p>The Dominican Republic announced that a boat targeted by a U.S. air strike was transporting over 2,200 pounds (one ton) of suspected cocaine. This seizure followed a joint operation between Dominican authorities and the U.S. Southern Command, marking the first such effort against narcoterrorism in the Caribbean. President Donald Trump has ordered multiple strikes this month to combat drug trafficking, warning that those transporting drugs that can harm Americans will be hunted. The packages seized are undergoing forensic analysis to confirm their exact contents and weight. This article details a significant international effort to disrupt drug routes. </p>

          <p>An Indian court issued an injunction against nine journalists and digital platforms, restricting them from publishing content deemed 'unverified and defamatory' by Adani Enterprises. This order, which included immediate takedowns of YouTube videos and Instagram posts, has sparked fears for press freedom in India. Critics argue the 'ex parte' nature of the order, issued without hearing the defendants, sets a troubling precedent for pre-publication censorship and could have a chilling effect on investigative reporting. While some journalists successfully appealed the order, the broader use of such legal tactics, akin to SLAPP cases, is seen as a method to exhaust and silence critics of powerful corporations.

          <p>China's crude oil imports from Russia saw a 15.2% year-on-year decrease in August, totaling 7.94 million tonnes. This dip, however, was largely offset by significant increases from other partners, including a 50.4% jump from Brazil and a nearly 90-fold rise from Indonesia. Analysts suggest the decline from Russia might be a temporary fluctuation due to maintenance at key production sites like Sakhalin-1. China's overall crude oil imports remained steady, indicating a diversification of supply sources rather than a reduction in demand.

An article argues that targeting Jewish intellectuals who dissent from prevailing political views echoes historical patterns of antisemitism and suppression of free speech.

          <p>A review of the newly opened Tesla Diner in Los Angeles critiques it as a 'failure of imagination,' prioritizing superficial design over basic functionality and culinary innovation. Despite Elon Musk's promise to reinvent dining, the establishment offers a limited, overpriced fast-food menu in a sterile, white-plastic environment, with initial features like robots and roller skates largely absent. The diner struggles with practical issues, such as a one-way spiral staircase and a punishingly hot roof-deck. Most visitors come to charge their cars or for TikTok content, rather than the dining experience. The article concludes that the Tesla Diner represents a backward-looking vision, offering little new beyond a branded Instagram museum. </p>

The Old Farmer's Almanac forecasts a cooler, drier autumn for the Midwest, while the Farmer's Almanac anticipates a 'tug-of-war' between stormy and fair conditions, with potential for severe thunderstorms. In contrast, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center suggests a 33-40% chance of warmer-than-normal temperatures for Indiana from October through December, with equal chances for above or below normal rainfall.

          <p>Despite recent high interest rates and limited inventory, new homebuyers and those looking to refinance can find favorable mortgage rates, especially with strong credit. As of September 18, 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates are around 6.39%, with 15-year rates at 5.57%. Refinance rates are slightly higher. Experts anticipate rates may stabilize or even drop further if the Fed pauses rate hikes, making borrowing more affordable. Borrowers are encouraged to strengthen their credit profiles, shop around for lenders, and understand loan terms and fees before locking in a rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German decathlete Leo Neugebauer surprised himself and the world by winning gold at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, his first major title. The 25-year-old, who previously won Olympic silver, overcame a 'rollercoaster ride' season and pre-championship doubts to deliver a stellar performance. His victory, secured by a mere 20 points, was Germany's only gold medal at the championships. Neugebauer attributes his success partly to training at the University of Texas at Austin, which helped him develop athletically and mentally. He now looks forward to the 2028 Los Angeles Games, where he will still be in his prime. </p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a £2.2 billion privately-financed project designed to boost economic growth. The expansion involves moving the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, alongside terminal extensions. This initiative aims to increase annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s and raise passenger numbers to 80 million. While welcomed by the Chancellor for job creation and investment, the Green Party and environmental groups have criticized the decision as a 'disaster' for climate goals. The approval includes stricter noise controls and public transport targets. </p>

          <h2>Trump-Xi Call Signals Emerging Era of Managed Rivalry Between US and China</h2>

          <p>A recent phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, described as 'pragmatic, positive and constructive' by Chinese state media, indicates a new normal in US-China relations: managed rivalry. Despite ongoing tensions and Trump's past imposition of tariffs, both nations are being pushed towards accommodation rather than escalation. This shift reflects a pragmatic acceptance of mutual economic dependence, particularly in hi-tech sectors for the US and supply chain/green technology for China. The article suggests this framework is essential for global stability, as all-out conflict would be mutually devastating. </p>
