          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has stated that the club must retain captain Marc Guehi to ensure a successful season, amid transfer interest from Liverpool. Guehi, who has one year left on his contract and scored in a recent victory, has been the subject of a £35 million bid. Glasner emphasized that the club has no replacement lined up and that there was an agreement to only sell the crucial player if a suitable substitute was secured. Despite Guehi indicating he won't sign a new contract, the manager remains firm on keeping the team's key defender as the transfer window deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy in Houston, Texas, is in critical condition after being shot while participating in a door-knocking prank with friends. Police have detained one person for questioning but have not yet filed charges in the incident, which occurred late Saturday night. The event highlights a dangerous national trend, sometimes called the "Door Kicking Challenge," where youths film themselves banging on doors and fleeing. Authorities across the country have warned that such pranks can be mistaken for break-in attempts and may provoke violent responses from homeowners, urging parents to discuss the serious consequences with their children.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of prominent politician Andriy Parubiy. The 54-year-old parliamentarian was killed in the city of Lviv by an assailant who had posed as a courier, prompting a nationwide manhunt. Parubiy was a key figure during the 2014 Euromaidan protests, which led to the ousting of the pro-Russian president and advocated for closer ties with the European Union. President Zelensky did not release details about the suspect's identity but instructed police to make their findings public.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview at the Telluride Film Festival, Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao discussed her latest film, "Hamnet," an adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel about William Shakespeare's family and the death of their son. Zhao described the period after her Marvel film "Eternals" as a "very painful fire," which led to a profound personal shift and a return to more intimate filmmaking. She explained her initial hesitation to direct a period piece about motherhood and Shakespeare, but ultimately found a deep connection to the story's themes of grief and existence. The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, received a rapturous reception at its premiere.</p>

          <p>Following the No. 8 ranked Alabama Crimson Tide's shocking 31-17 upset loss to unranked Florida State, former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel declared that the team's era of dominance and intimidation is over. Manziel asserted that the "fear aspect" of facing Alabama is "completely gone" and that no opponent, regardless of their ranking, is scared of them anymore. His comments echo similar sentiments from sports analysts who believe the retirement of legendary coach Nick Saban has marked a significant downturn for the storied football program. The loss breaks a 23-game season-opener winning streak for the Crimson Tide.</p>

          <p>Police in Epping, Essex, arrested three people during a protest against the housing of approximately 140 asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel. The arrests were for inciting racial hatred and breaching public order restrictions that police had placed on the demonstration. Tensions in the area have been high following an incident last month where an asylum seeker housed at the hotel was charged with the sexual assault of a teenage girl. The protest is one of several recent demonstrations and counter-protests in the area, reflecting broader unrest across England regarding national asylum policies.</p>

Afghanistan is situated on a tectonically active junction, making it highly susceptible to seismic events.

Ramsey strongly advised against this, stating that the act had hurt, not helped, her daughter by putting her in an unaffordable vehicle.

          <p>The United Kingdom has temporarily closed its embassy building in Cairo, Egypt, following a diplomatic row sparked by the arrest of a pro-government activist in London. The closure occurred after Egyptian authorities removed security barriers from outside the embassy, a move seen as retaliatory. The dispute began when the activist was arrested during a protest outside Egypt's embassy in the UK, leading to calls within Egypt for a reciprocal response. The UK Foreign Office stated the embassy remains operational, and it is engaging with Egyptian officials regarding the security of the premises and its staff.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Plan for Executive Order Mandating Voter ID Nationwide</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to issue an executive order that would mandate identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move widely expected to face immediate legal challenges as unconstitutional. The U.S. Constitution primarily grants states the authority to regulate elections, with no explicit power given to the president in this area. The push is rooted in Trump's baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Critics argue that strict voter ID laws disproportionately disenfranchise minority, low-income, and elderly voters, and that voter fraud is exceedingly rare.</p>

Manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged the team's struggles after conceding two late goals, stating they "forgot to play" after initially taking the lead. Historically, no team in a 38-game season has won the league after losing two of their first three matches.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's contradictory and improvisational approach to the war in Ukraine has created a diplomatic stalemate that primarily benefits Vladimir Putin. While Trump portrays himself as a peacemaker, his vacillating statements on U.S. involvement have caused confusion and undermined a coherent strategy, allowing Putin to continue his war of attrition. The author suggests that Putin is patiently exploiting the resulting fatigue and that without decisive U.S. leadership, the conflict will persist. The piece concludes that Trump risks being seen not as a peacemaker but as a president who enabled Russia's imperial ambitions.</p>
