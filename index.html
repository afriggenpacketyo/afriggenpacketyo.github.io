          <p>Several individuals, disguised as construction workers, executed a brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing at least nine pieces of jewelry of "inestimable heritage and historical value" from the Napoleon collection. The thieves used a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor gallery, smashed display cases with an angle grinder, and fled on motorcycles within seven minutes. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to recover the stolen items and bring the perpetrators to justice, emphasizing the attack on national heritage. Investigations are underway, with police recovering some abandoned items and studying CCTV footage.</p>

          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, discusses the evolving US-China rivalry, extending beyond trade to technology and ideologies. She asserts that concerns over trade protectionism's impact on China's economy are exaggerated, noting that US exports constitute only about 2.8% of China's GDP. Qian emphasizes the critical role of women's voices in policymaking and highlights China's unique approach to innovation compared to Western models, contributing to a broader understanding of global economic dynamics.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, alleging AI market monopolies, will remain in Fort Worth, Texas, despite minimal local connections. Judge Mark Pittman, in an ironic order, encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth given their preference for the venue. This decision implicitly critiques the practice of "forum-shopping" in judicial districts, a tactic previously used by plaintiffs associated with Elon Musk. The case highlights ongoing legal battles in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.</p>

          <p>Federal officials found a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area used by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. The Secret Service identified "items of interest" during a pre-arrival sweep, sharing a photo of what appeared to be a hunting stand high in a tree, located over 200 yards away. While there was no impact on Trump's movements and no individuals were involved, the discovery prompted investigation, especially given a previous assassination attempt at a nearby golf club. The article highlights ongoing security concerns for high-profile figures.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines whether today's great powers will manage hegemonic transitions through "managed accommodation," akin to Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai, or through confrontation. It argues that a multipolar order is already present, shaped by economic fundamentals. Two key distinctions from past transitions are nuclear weapons, making total war irrational, and technological interdependence, creating immense costs for systemic rupture. The article suggests that these factors compel major economies to avoid systemic breakdown, favoring patient statecraft over confrontation.</p>

Her opening monologue and other sketches directly referenced the controversy surrounding her album cover, "Man's Best Friend," and her "lusty" adult image. The article suggests Carpenter's performance served as a defiant and humorous response, implying she is "in on the joke" and dismissing concerns about her sexuality.</p>
