          <p>Plant-based food company Beyond Meat experienced significant volatility as its recent meme stock rally lost momentum. After surging dramatically earlier in the week due to its inclusion in a meme stock ETF and a subsequent short squeeze, the stock's gains were significantly reduced, briefly entering negative territory. This resurgence of retail trader activity, reminiscent of the pandemic era, is viewed by some analysts as a sign of a frothy market, with the company's long-term financial struggles remaining a primary concern for investors.

          <p>Walmart has temporarily stopped sponsoring H-1B visas for most prospective employees, a direct response to the Trump administration's recent policy changes. The administration imposed a significant fee increase for each new visa application, aiming to encourage companies to prioritize hiring American workers. This move by the nation's largest private employer highlights how corporate hiring strategies are adapting to shifting immigration policies, though the company noted that exceptions may still be made for certain critical roles.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the thirteenth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring significant rainfall to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. While the storm is forecast to strengthen, potentially reaching hurricane status, its long-term track remains uncertain, with current models suggesting it is unlikely to have a major impact on the mainland United States. A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti, and residents in the affected Caribbean islands are warned of potential flash flooding and landslides.</p>

          <p>The partial shutdown of the U.S. government has now entered its 22nd day, making it the second-longest funding lapse in American history. The impasse stems from Senate Democrats' refusal to pass a Republican-sponsored funding bill that lacks extensions for Affordable Care Act tax credits, which could lead to higher insurance premiums for millions of citizens. With Republicans controlling the Senate but lacking the 60 votes needed to pass the bill, and with no negotiations scheduled, there is no clear end in sight to the disruption of federal services.</p>

          <p>Following massive "No Kings" protests against the Trump administration, organizers from groups like Indivisible and the ACLU are planning the movement's next phase. The strategy is to evolve beyond single-day protests into a sustained, multi-faceted resistance, including coordinated rapid responses to government overreach, targeted economic boycotts, and local organizing efforts. Leaders emphasize the need to build on the protest's momentum by channeling energy into concrete actions that challenge the administration's policies and support democratic institutions, with some groups exploring a future general strike.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Shares Fall After Earnings Miss Attributed to Brazilian Tax Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 11:29:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix's stock price declined after the company reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, a miss it attributed to an unexpected expense from a tax dispute in Brazil. Despite the earnings miss, the streaming giant's revenue grew by 17%, meeting forecasts, driven by strong membership growth and increased advertising sales. The company projects continued strong revenue growth for the fourth quarter and noted that its ad-supported tier had its best sales quarter ever, though the tax issue led to a downward revision of its full-year operating margin forecast.

          <p>A TikTok streamer who was shot and wounded by an ICE agent during an immigration enforcement operation has been federally charged with assaulting a federal officer. Authorities allege that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, 44, rammed his vehicle into law enforcement vehicles that had boxed him in during the arrest attempt, prompting an agent to open fire. The incident, which also resulted in a U.S. deputy marshal being wounded by a ricochet, is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on unauthorized immigrants and has drawn increased public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A prominent child abuse expert has withdrawn his candidacy to chair the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, citing that the process has been undermined by political opportunism. This follows the resignation of four survivors from the inquiry's advisory panel, who raised concerns about candidates having backgrounds in policing or social work—systems they feel failed them. The departures highlight deep-seated distrust among victims and threaten to derail the high-profile inquiry, which was intended to address decades of systemic failures in protecting children from organized sexual exploitation.</p>

          <p>The International Chess Federation (Fide) is examining public attacks made by former world champion Vladimir Kramnik against grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who died recently at age 29.

Prominent figures in the chess community have condemned Kramnik's conduct, suggesting the public pressure took a severe toll on Naroditsky, sparking a broader conversation about online harassment and accountability.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called for Prince Andrew to be questioned by a parliamentary committee regarding the lease on his Royal Lodge residence. The demand for greater transparency follows revelations about the financial terms of his deal with the Crown Estate, which effectively allowed him to prepay his rent for the 75-year lease with an £8 million lump sum. This call for scrutiny comes amid ongoing pressure on the prince over his past associations and broader questions about the secrecy surrounding royal finances.</p>
