          <p>Financial markets across the Asia-Pacific region displayed varied performance as investors processed developments from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. Uncertainty lingered following a U.S. court ruling against President Trump's tariffs and his continued criticism of India's trade policies, which he claimed included a recent offer to eliminate tariffs. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw gains, while markets in Hong Kong and mainland China were more subdued. South Korea's Kospi also rose despite inflation data showing a slower-than-expected increase, adding to the complex economic picture for traders in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump sharply criticized the trade relationship between the U.S. and India, labeling it a "totally one sided disaster" in a social media post. His comments followed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attendance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China, a meeting that underscored India's strengthening ties with Beijing. Trump reiterated his grievances over what he described as India's high tariffs on U.S. goods and its purchases of Russian oil and arms. The statement highlights the escalating trade tensions and deteriorating diplomatic relations between Washington and New Delhi. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a prominent New York Democrat and the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing the need for "generational change" within the Democratic party, the 78-year-old congressman reflected on his decision in an interview with The New York Times. Nadler, who served as the chair of the House Judiciary Committee and was a manager during President Trump's first impeachment, has been a fixture in Congress since 1992. His retirement marks the end of an era and opens up a key seat in New York politics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced a weak recovery in early Asian trading as markets reopened following the Labor Day holiday, after having sustained five consecutive days of losses. Investor sentiment has been negatively affected by concerns over the Federal Reserve's independence amid criticism from President Trump, pushing traders toward safe-haven assets like gold. The dollar index had previously touched its lowest point since late July. Market watchers are now closely anticipating key U.S. economic data, including manufacturing indices and the non-farm payrolls report, to gauge the health of the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has hinted that upgraded versions of two hypersonic missiles, the YJ-21 and DF-17, could be featured in an upcoming Victory Day parade in Beijing. A military commentator on the network highlighted the potential debut of an air-launched variant of the YJ-21, which was originally a sea-based weapon. This new version would reportedly be capable of launching from bombers outside enemy air defense ranges to penetrate defenses and destroy targets. The development suggests China is building a versatile family of land-, sea-, and air-launched hypersonic weapons for various combat scenarios.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has brought new evidence to light in the nearly 50-year-old disappearance of revered Lebanese Shia cleric Imam Musa al-Sadr, who vanished in Libya in 1978. Researchers at Bradford University used a sophisticated facial recognition algorithm to compare photos of Sadr with an image of an unidentified corpse found in a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011. The analysis yielded a high probability match, suggesting the body could be Sadr's and that he was likely killed. This technological breakthrough offers a potential resolution to a mystery that has long captivated the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A recent opinion piece highlights a growing trend among some prominent intellectuals who are drawing parallels between contemporary Western countries, like Britain, and the Soviet Union in its final years. The commentary suggests that the West is exhibiting similar signs of decline, such as political rigidity and an unwillingness to question outdated dogmas within its institutions. The author argues that this resemblance to the late Soviet era's managerial class, which ignored impending change, warrants serious attention. The article posits that even a decline, short of a full collapse, could have significant global consequences.</p>

Tidball argues that these physical barriers make it difficult for disabled individuals to work in or even visit Parliament. While some improvements have been made, she is advocating for more comprehensive changes to ensure the UK's center of democracy is inclusive and reflects the 22% of the voting population with disabilities.</p>

At the time of its opening, it was advertised as the largest log cabin in the world.

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has officially decided to establish a development bank to serve its 10 member countries, which include China, Russia, and India. The move, announced at a recent summit, is seen by analysts as a strategic effort to insulate the Eurasian bloc from the risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated global trade system. By creating their own concessional lender, the SCO nations aim to accelerate key infrastructure projects and foster greater economic integration. This advancement marks a significant step for the long-discussed financial institution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he will award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. The announcement came just two days after Giuliani, a longtime political ally and former New York City mayor, was seriously injured in a car crash. The decision to honor Giuliani is highly polarizing, given his celebrated leadership after the 9/11 attacks as well as his subsequent disbarment and criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Trump praised Giuliani as a "great American Patriot."</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave over 60 years ago. Using advanced uranium-series dating, researchers determined the skull is at least 286,000 years old, placing it in the Middle Pleistocene era. This new dating strengthens the theory that the fossil belongs to Homo heidelbergensis, a species considered the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. The finding reshapes our understanding of European prehistory, suggesting that these more primitive human populations coexisted with the emerging Neanderthal lineage.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the Northern Lights to be visible across much of the United Kingdom in the coming days, potentially as far south as the Midlands. The heightened opportunity for sightings is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which sends charged particles toward Earth's magnetic field. While visibility is never guaranteed and will depend on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, the increased solar activity could provide a rare and memorable celestial display for many in the UK.</p>

          <p>The recent transfer window has ignited a debate over "player power" in football, highlighted by strikers Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa successfully forcing moves after refusing to train with their clubs. Their actions have been labeled "despicable" by some commentators, who argue that players should honor their contracts. In contrast, England defender Marc Guehi, who maintained his professionalism at Crystal Palace, saw his desired transfer to Liverpool collapse. This disparity raises questions about whether confrontational tactics are becoming a necessary, albeit controversial, tool for players seeking to change clubs.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated threats to punish Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine, significant new sanctions have yet to be implemented. According to analysts, the administration's hesitation stems from complex strategic considerations that extend beyond the immediate conflict. A primary factor is the concern that completely isolating Russia would push it into a deeper alliance with China, strengthening Beijing's global position and access to resources. Additionally, Trump reportedly still hopes to broker a peace deal himself, a goal that could be undermined by escalating economic pressure on Moscow.</p>
