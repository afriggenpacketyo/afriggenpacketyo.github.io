          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a personal meeting in Turkey for ceasefire talks, amidst ongoing exchanges and proposals for peace. Zelenskyy hopes for a ceasefire starting Monday and will await Putin in Turkey on Thursday, following U.S. President Donald Trump's urging for Ukraine to accept Russia's offer for direct talks. European leaders have coordinated calls for a 30-day truce, backed by the EU and Trump, with threats of tougher sanctions if Putin declines.

Lula views China as a partner in rebalancing global power and a geopolitical counterweight to U.S. influence.

          <p>House Republicans have released a plan that would cut Medicaid, potentially causing millions of Americans to lose healthcare coverage, as part of a larger bill to enact President Trump’s domestic agenda. While the plan omits some of the deepest cuts demanded by ultraconservative Republicans, it still includes measures such as work requirements and stricter income verification processes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the legislation would reduce federal spending by $912 billion over a decade and cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured. Democrats have criticized the proposal as an attack on vulnerable populations, while some Republicans have expressed concerns about the impact on their states.</p>

Experts and politicians raised concerns about why such content was ever considered appropriate, especially given that non-fatal strangulation is a criminal offense. The Welsh government emphasized that non-fatal strangulation is dangerous and illegal, and resources provided to schools make this clear.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, despite facing charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, remains popular in the Philippines. Supporters have sent flowers and cards to his detention center in The Hague, and he is expected to win another term as mayor of Davao City. His arrest and extradition have divided the country, with some viewing him as a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The upcoming midterm elections could be pivotal for Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who faces impeachment charges.</p>

In the 30 years before the mid 1990s, net migration, the number arriving minus the number leaving, bobbed up and down but was broadly balanced. In other words, net migration was zero. But from 1994 onwards, it began to climb, jumping during Labour's time in office in the early 2000s – and doing so by more than they publicly estimated when the EU expanded and the UK didn't impose any limits on those who could move here.</p>
