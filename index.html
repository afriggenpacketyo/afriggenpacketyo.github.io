            <h2>China Responds to Vance's "Peasants" Comment Amid Tariff Tensions</h2>

            <p>China has criticized Vice President JD Vance's remarks about the U.S. borrowing money from "Chinese peasants," calling them "ignorant and impolite." This comes as President Trump maintains a firm stance on tariffs, with China facing the highest additional taxes. Vance defended the tariffs as a solution to a "globalist economy" that he believes has not benefited ordinary Americans, while Trump argues that tariffs will revitalize America's manufacturing base. However, economists have raised concerns about the tariffs' potential to drive up prices and increase the risk of a U.S. recession.</p>

            <p>The White House has announced that a 104% tariff on goods imported from China will take effect on Wednesday. This follows President Trump's threat of an additional 50% tariff after China retaliated with a 34% import fee on American products. China's commerce ministry has asserted that Beijing will "fight to the end" and take countermeasures if Trump does not back away from his latest threat.

            <p>Mortgage rates have spiked to their highest level in over a month, reversing a recent period of improvement, due to tariff uncertainty roiling the markets. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage jumped significantly, mirroring the stock market's volatility following President Trump's tariff announcements. This rise in rates coincides with already high home prices and waning consumer confidence, potentially hindering the spring housing market. Experts suggest that upcoming economic data, such as the Consumer Price Index, could further influence rate movements. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has touted falling oil prices and borrowing costs as positive signs resulting from his sweeping new tariffs. However, experts argue these trends actually indicate expectations of an economic slowdown, diminishing energy demand, and a flight to safe-haven investments like bonds. While lower oil prices and borrowing expenses may offer some short-term relief for consumers, they are unlikely to offset the potential economic pain caused by a downturn. Economists suggest these indicators should be viewed as warning signs rather than reasons for celebration.</p>

            <p>The Keystone Pipeline has been shut down following a reported "mechanical bang" in North Dakota, prompting an immediate response from emergency personnel. A pressure drop was detected in the system, leading to the isolation of the affected segment. A release of crude oil was confined to an agricultural field, with containment resources mobilized to the site. The cause of the rupture and the volume of the spill are currently under investigation.</p>

            <p>USAID has terminated a scholarship program that allowed 208 Afghan women to defy the Taliban's ban on college education. The program, funded by a $50 million USAID endowment, enabled these women to take online courses at the American University of Afghanistan. The sudden termination has left the students in limbo, with concerns about their ability to continue their studies.

            <p>An economist predicts that President Trump's sweeping tariffs could drive the unemployment rate to recessionary levels. The economist, Michael R. Strain, argues that job cuts are likely as businesses attempt to control costs in response to the tariffs. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that Trump's tariffs will cut 2025 U.S. GDP growth by a percentage point, potentially raising the unemployment rate to 4.7% by the end of the year. The economist emphasizes the negative impact of the tariffs on the labor market, outweighing any potential benefits.</p>
