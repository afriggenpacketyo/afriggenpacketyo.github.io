          <p>Walmart has shifted its tone regarding President Donald Trump's tariffs, warning that higher duties on imports will soon lead to increased prices for shoppers. CFO John David Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb, prompting Trump to lash out at Walmart on social media. This situation illustrates the delicate balance business leaders face in appeasing customers, shareholders, and a transactional White House. Walmart responded by reiterating its commitment to maintaining low prices, motivated by a sense of obligation to explain potential price hikes to customers and investors.</p>

          <p>Federal medical research grants have been significantly cut, disrupting funding for projects backed by former President Joe Biden's "Cancer Moonshot" initiative, as the Trump administration froze funding to Columbia University and Harvard University over campus protests about the war in Gaza. Cancer scientists at Harvard have seen their NIH funding evaporate, affecting research into breast and ovarian cancer. The Trump administration terminated millions awarded for developing anti-cancer immunity at Harvard's immuno-engineering center. The cuts are criticized as an attack against cancer research.</p>

          <p>Sable Offshore Corp. has resumed crude oil production in federal waters near Santa Barbara nearly 10 years after a major oil spill prompted the closure of several drilling platforms. The announcement has sparked outrage from environmental groups and some officials, particularly since it comes shortly after the California Coastal Commission levied an $18-million fine against the company for failing to obtain necessary permits. Environmentalists are concerned about the risks of restarting aging pipelines, while Sable defends its actions by stating that it has secured necessary approvals and is helping bring energy security to California.</p>

          <p>With gold's value surging, investors are considering adding it to their portfolios, but it's essential to approach gold investments strategically. Limiting gold to a maximum of 10% of an overall diversified portfolio remains sound advice, as gold serves as an income protector rather than an income producer. It's best to avoid riskier investment types like gold mining stocks, opting instead for gold bars, coins, or gold IRAs. Investors should monitor the economic climate and their portfolio to ensure gold effectively hedges against inflation and to identify potential selling opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>
