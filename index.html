          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a UK logistics firm supplying major supermarkets like Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Aldi, has fallen victim to a ransomware attack, where hackers encrypted the company's data and locked them out of computer systems, demanding payment to hand back control. The attack has disrupted order processing, potentially leading to thousands of products, including meat, being wasted if deliveries are not promptly restored. While the company asserts that transport activities remain unaffected, customers are facing uncertainty and potential financial losses due to the disruption in the supply chain. This incident underscores the growing cybersecurity challenges faced by smaller logistics firms in the food industry.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, reflects on President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of prostate cancer and draws parallels to her father's announcement of his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1994. Davis suggests that Biden's diagnosis presents an opportunity for him to connect with the American people on a vulnerable, human level, transcending political divides. She emphasizes the importance of openly discussing the emotional challenges that come with a cancer diagnosis, similar to how her father opened the gates to discussing Alzheimer's. Davis argues that Biden's candor could restore trust with voters and offer solace to those grappling with similar health concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration's effort to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans living in the United States. This decision lifts a previous hold placed by a California judge, allowing the administration to end protections and work permits for migrants with TPS. The move has drawn criticism from lawyers representing TPS holders, who describe it as the largest single action stripping non-citizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history. The ruling is the latest in a series of immigration policy decisions from the high court under the Trump administration, with potential humanitarian and economic repercussions.</p>

          <p>Carlos Lozada, in this New York Times article, reviews Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's upcoming book, "Original Sin," which delves into the Democratic Party's awareness and handling of Joe Biden's alleged physical and mental decline leading up to the 2024 election. The article highlights the book's claims that many within the Democratic Party, the White House staff, and the Biden campaign were aware of Biden's diminishing capabilities but chose to remain silent, driven by denial, partisanship, and a belief in Biden's electability against Donald Trump. The review underscores the book's portrayal of a campaign that masked Biden's condition, even simplifying his speeches and relying heavily on teleprompters, ultimately leading to his electoral troubles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this Fox News opinion piece, Craig Shirley argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share more similarities than differences, particularly in their outsider status and conservative ideologies. The article asserts that both men challenged the political establishment, championed individual freedoms, and pursued policies such as tax cuts and a strong national defense. Shirley suggests that both Reagan and Trump resonated with blue-collar voters and possessed a sense of humor, contrasting them with figures like Joe Biden. The author concludes that despite differences in style, Reagan and Trump are aligned in their commitment to conservative principles and their focus on the individual.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will not finalize a proposed rule that would have allowed Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, despite some states already offering this coverage. GLP-1s are a pricey class of drugs that have shown promise in treating obesity, but their high cost has made them inaccessible to many. While some states like South Carolina have implemented strict prerequisites for Medicaid beneficiaries to access these drugs, others, like North Carolina, have ended coverage due to the projected high costs. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suggested that future coverage may be possible as costs decrease.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has reduced the five-year loan prime rate (LPR), a benchmark for mortgage loans, by 10 basis points in an effort to stabilize the country's struggling property market. This move follows a previous cut to the seven-day reverse repo rate and is part of a broader effort by Beijing to revive the property sector, which has been a drag on the economy due to solvency issues among major real estate developers. The reduction is intended to boost domestic demand and ensure economic stability amid heightened external risks, particularly under Donald Trumpâ€™s second presidency.</p>

          <p>Ramon van Meer, a Texas showerhead salesman, conducted an online experiment to determine if customers would pay more for a 'Made in the USA' version of his product after President Trump imposed tariffs on Asian imports. Despite offering a domestic option costing $100 more than the imported version, not a single customer chose the 'Made in the USA' model. This outcome underscores the challenges faced by domestic manufacturers in competing with cheaper imports, even with tariffs in place. Van Meer's experiment suggests that shoppers are not willing to pay a premium for products made in the United States, potentially undermining efforts to encourage domestic manufacturing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports, particularly from China, collecting these tariffs has proven challenging due to smuggling, transshipping, and a lack of resources at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Trade experts say higher tariffs incentivize companies to skirt the law, while CBP struggles with understaffing and a surge in low-value packages. Some U.S. business owners allege that competitors evade tariffs by routing products through third countries, and they propose increased funding for a DOJ task force to prosecute trade fraud. The combination of trade fraud and under-resourced enforcement efforts is costing the U.S. government in lost revenue.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a dormant thruster on Voyager 1, averting a potential loss of communication with the spacecraft, which has been exploring the outer solar system since 1977. The decision to reactivate the primary roll thrusters came as the backup thrusters showed signs of failure and a critical ground-based radio antenna was scheduled to go offline for upgrades. By carefully testing and reactivating the primary thrusters, engineers ensured that Voyager 1's antenna remains pointed at Earth, allowing the mission to continue gathering valuable data from interstellar space. This remote fix extends the lifespan of the spacecraft, increasing the likelihood of celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

The IPO, which was the largest globally this year, saw CATL's shares surge, but the exclusion of American investors underscores the deepening financial decoupling between the two countries. CATL has been caught in the crossfire of sanctions and blacklists, leading to the decision to restrict U.S. investment in its Hong Kong listing. The article notes that this move marks a significant shift from a decade ago when Chinese companies like Alibaba eagerly sought U.S. investors.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose over 16% in their Hong Kong trading debut following a HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) IPO, the largest globally this year.

The company plans to use 90% of the funds raised to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. CATL's expansion into Europe comes amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed tariffs on EVs made in China.

The author argues that China is presenting itself as a more reliable partner for Latin America, while Trump's policies and rhetoric are alienating the region.

          <p>According to analysts, Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar's visit to China is expected to highlight both nationsâ€™ growing enthusiasm for deepening defence and security cooperation. The visit is likely to be viewed by India as a show of support for Islamabad, though analysts added it was probably arranged well before the conflict. Dar is expected to hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi as well as take part in a trilateral foreign minister-level strategic dialogue with Afghanistanâ€™s acting foreign minister.</p>
