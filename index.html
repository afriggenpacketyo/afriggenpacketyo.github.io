          <p>Following a poor showing at the Club World Cup, Los Angeles FC aims to win back fan support in a crucial rivalry match against the LA Galaxy. Despite their recent return to form in the MLS with three consecutive wins, the team views the derby as a vital opportunity to deliver a significant victory for their supporters. The match carries extra weight as it could be the final regular-season derby under the current schedule, with LAFC fighting for playoff positioning while the Galaxy struggles at the bottom of the conference. Both teams are managing key injuries but emphasize that in a rivalry of this magnitude, current form and statistics are often irrelevant.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for masterminding a large-scale drug trafficking operation across southeast England. Deborah Mason recruited her four children and other relatives to distribute cocaine worth up to £80 million, funding a lavish lifestyle that included designer accessories for her cat. The police investigation tracked the family gang for seven months as they completed numerous drug and cash handovers. The judge described Mason as having a "leading role" and corrupting her children, who also received lengthy prison sentences for their involvement in the sophisticated criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>The Syrian presidency has announced the deployment of a new force to address deadly sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze communities in the southern Suweida province, where over 700 people have reportedly been killed. The move comes amid reports of a ceasefire between Israel and Syria, brokered to de-escalate the situation after Israeli strikes targeted Syrian troops accused of committing abuses against Druze civilians. The UN has received credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions by multiple armed groups. Syria's interim president has vowed to hold perpetrators accountable and prioritize the protection of the Druze minority population.</p>

          <p>Daniel Dubois is preparing for a high-stakes rematch against Oleksandr Usyk at Wembley Stadium, aiming to become the undisputed heavyweight champion. Having been stopped by Usyk in their 2023 fight, Dubois has since won three consecutive bouts and captured the IBF world title. Boxing world figures are divided in their predictions for the upcoming fight, with some believing Usyk's experience and skill will secure another victory, while others point to Dubois's renewed confidence and power as key factors that could lead to an upset. The central question is whether the 38-year-old Usyk can withstand the challenge from a re-energized and improved Dubois.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have developed a groundbreaking and more affordable method for CAR-T cell therapy, a personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The new technique allows for the anti-cancer cells to be produced directly within the patient's body, eliminating complex and expensive external manufacturing processes. Researchers successfully used this in-body gene therapy to treat four patients with multiple myeloma, a common blood cancer. This innovation could dramatically reduce the cost of the treatment, which currently exceeds $139,000 per patient, and has shown promise for treating other conditions like asthma and autoimmune diseases.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning as torrential rain and thunderstorms are expected to cause dangerous flash flooding over the weekend. The Met Office forecasts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to a high risk of fast-flowing, deep floodwaters that could disrupt transport and cause power outages. The severe weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and parched, which increases the likelihood of severe runoff as the earth cannot absorb the sudden downpour.

Despite government incentives like a 'Baby Bonus,' many Italians find the support insufficient to overcome challenges like the high cost and lack of access to childcare.

The detainees, who are Venezuelan nationals, were recently released from CECOT and sent to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange for Americans held there. In a court filing, an ICE official confirmed that the U.S. obtained assurances from the Maduro regime that it would not obstruct the travel of any former detainee needed for U.S. legal proceedings. The declaration was made in a case involving a migrant who was sent to the controversial prison in violation of a prior settlement agreement.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a strong majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support for space exploration is particularly high among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey suggests that the public generally views the space program as a source of national pride and believes it contributes to technological advancements that benefit society. These positive views on space exploration are broadly consistent across different political and ideological lines, showing widespread backing for future ambitious missions.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are redefining the global AI landscape by championing open-source development, presenting a significant challenge to the closed, proprietary systems of U.S. giants like OpenAI and Google. By making the source code and weights of their powerful large language models freely available, these companies are fostering a collaborative environment that has won support from developers worldwide. This trend has unleashed a wave of new AI applications in China and provides a viable alternative for global innovators. Analysts suggest this open-source movement poses a more serious competitive threat than previous efforts in other software domains.</p>

          <p>The CEO of U.S. tech company Astronomer, Andy Byron, has been placed on leave after a video of him embracing a female colleague at a Coldplay concert went viral online. The clip, which showed the pair quickly hiding their faces when they appeared on the stadium's large screen, sparked widespread speculation and rumors of an affair. The band's lead singer, Chris Martin, even commented on the moment during the show. In response to the internet frenzy, Astronomer's board announced it has initiated a formal investigation into the matter and appointed an interim CEO, stating that its leaders are expected to uphold high standards of conduct.</p>

          <h2>California's Workplace Safety Agency Critically Understaffed, State Audit Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 21:51:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California state audit has revealed that the state's occupational safety agency, Cal/OSHA, is suffering from critical understaffing that severely weakens its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. The audit found an overall vacancy rate of 32% in the last fiscal year, leading the overstretched agency to close complaint and accident cases without proper on-site inspections. When inspections were conducted, they often lacked sufficient documentation, and fines were sometimes reduced without clear justification. Cal/OSHA responded that it has since reduced its vacancy rate and is working to improve operations, but experts argue the issue requires major investment.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit seeking at least $10 billion in damages from Rupert Murdoch, his company News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal for defamation. The suit targets an article that reported on a purportedly bawdy birthday letter Trump sent to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which included a hand-drawn sketch of a naked woman. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter, labeling the story as false and malicious. The lawsuit names the publisher, CEO, and the two reporters as defendants, escalating a conflict between the former president and the prominent conservative media mogul amid growing pressure for transparency on the Epstein case.</p>
