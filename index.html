        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy demonstrated unexpected strength in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, exceeding analyst forecasts. The Office for National Statistics attributed this growth primarily to the services sector, with notable contributions from production. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed these figures as indicative of the UK economy's potential, shadow chancellor Mel Stride cautioned against complacency, citing downgraded growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility and the International Monetary Fund. This article notes the impact of impending US tariffs and increased employer taxes, which analysts believe may temper future growth.</p>

          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest in Basel is underway, but not without its share of political tensions and controversies. Protests have erupted over Israel's participation, sparked by the country's military operations in Gaza, with some demonstrators accusing Eurovision of complicity in genocide. The European Broadcasting Union has implemented a code of conduct to prevent political statements during the competition. The article also notes other controversies, including complaints about song lyrics and staging, as well as the absence of information about Israeli singer Yuval Raphael's experience as a survivor of the Hamas attack on the Supernova festival.

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of its rice reserves to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to curb soaring rice prices. This action comes amid concerns about a rice shortage and hoarding by wholesalers and farmers. While the increased supply aims to stabilize prices, it would reduce the government's stockpile to a level that may raise concerns about future responses to potential harvest failures. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian representatives are set to meet in Istanbul for the first time since the early stages of the conflict. Despite an invitation from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Russian President Putin will not be present at the talks. The return to Istanbul is symbolic, as the city hosted previous diplomatic efforts, including the Istanbul Communiqué, which outlined a potential peace agreement. The U.S. delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who stated that there is no military solution to the conflict and that it will end through diplomacy. Trump has been seeking a ceasefire and eventual peace deal, and hinted that he might travel to Istanbul.</p>

          <p>Two British academics have discovered that a manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library is an original 1300 version of Magna Carta, not a copy as previously believed. The document, purchased for $27.50 after World War II, is now recognized as one of only seven such originals in existence. The researchers authenticated the manuscript using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history, noted the document's resurfacing at a time when Harvard has come under extraordinary pressure from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a group of 21 economies including the United States and China, has cautioned about a potential slowdown in growth due to trade tensions and policy uncertainty. APEC forecasts growth to drop to 2.6% in 2025, from 3.6% in the prior year. Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit Carlos Kuriyama stated that the uncertainty was weighing on business confidence, leading many firms to delay investments. The article emphasizes the importance of predictability in global trade.</p>

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have approved legislation that enhances legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the bill supports law enforcement, while Democrats contend it could lead to increased violence against Black people. The legislation allows for an immunity hearing where a judge will decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties. Critics fear the bill will embolden misconduct, while supporters argue it does not give blanket immunity to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, fueled by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are unlikely to be a major factor. The IMF noted that most Danish drug products are neither produced nor shipped from Denmark. Danish drugmakers rely on a system where the intellectual property is the main value, and manufacturing is contracted to other countries. The IMF said heightened trade tensions and policy uncertainty pose risks to the outlook.

The decree tightens restrictions on citizenship, requiring immigrants to spend two uninterrupted years in Argentina or make a significant financial investment to secure an Argentine passport. Immigrants seeking permanent residency must show proof of income and have clean criminal records. The decree also makes it easier for the government to deport migrants who enter the country illegally, falsify their immigration documents or commit minor crimes. This article notes that the new decree also charges foreigners to access Argentina's public health care and education while mandating that all travelers to the country hold health insurance.</p>

The world may have sidestepped a disaster. But last week’s fast-moving crisis demonstrates the inherent dangers of the modern nuclear age — and the corresponding and urgent need for diplomacy — as more nations expand their nuclear arsenals and rely on them for coercion or to make up for a weakness in conventional forces. It wasn’t until the unthinkable suddenly looked possible that the Trump administration felt compelled to intervene. On Thursday, during an appearance on Fox News, Vice President JD Vance said the tit-for-tat fighting was “fundamentally none of our business.” On Friday, the day India bombed the base in Rawalpindi, Mr. Vance\nsubstantially shifted\nfrom that isolationist stance, calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to warn against the mounting escalation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later said in\na statement\nthat he and Mr. Vance had engaged with senior officials from both countries, including their prime ministers.</p>
