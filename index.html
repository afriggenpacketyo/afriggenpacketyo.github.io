          <p>Medical professionals are raising significant alarms after Donald Trump baselessly linked Tylenol use during pregnancy to a rise in autism among children. Leading organizations like the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) firmly endorse acetaminophen as safe for use during pregnancy, based on thorough reviews of existing research. They critically describe the administration's message as irresponsible and confusing, potentially harming pregnant patients who rely on this beneficial medicine. The manufacturer of Tylenol also publicly pushed back, stating credible scientific data shows no proven link.</p>

          <p>China has decisively rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, stripped-down versions of advanced AI technology, viewing their purchase as an unacceptable concession to US-dictated tech inferiority. This move marks a significant turning point, reinforcing Beijing's commitment to technological independence rather than relying on American suppliers. Regulators have reportedly ordered leading tech companies to halt purchases and launched antitrust investigations into Nvidia. The article argues that US restrictions have inadvertently strengthened China's resolve to build an entirely self-sufficient semiconductor industry, shifting national discourse from desirability to necessity.</p>

          <p>France has officially recognized a Palestinian state, becoming the latest nation to take this significant diplomatic step at the UN General Assembly in New York. President Emmanuel Macron declared that "the time for peace has come," emphasizing that nothing justifies the ongoing conflict in Gaza and urging for a two-state solution. This decision adds to mounting international pressure on Israel, which views such recognition as rewarding Hamas. Macron called for a ceasefire and the release of hostages, indicating France's readiness to contribute to a stabilization mission.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump delivered a rambling press conference, advising pregnant women and parents to avoid Tylenol due to an unproven link to autism and questioning childhood vaccine schedules. He openly stated his advice was based on "what I feel," not established scientific research, which largely dismisses singular causes for autism and affirms vaccine safety. The article highlights Trump's strategy of pushing sensational conclusions based on disputed studies, even seemingly outflanking his own health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This approach deviates sharply from standard public health communication and scientific consensus.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen Airport has reopened and resumed flight operations after a nearly four-hour suspension caused by sightings of two to three large, unidentified drones. Danish police confirmed they were unable to determine the drones' origin, type, or current location, initiating an investigation into the incident. The disruption led to significant flight diversions and ongoing delays, impacting thousands of passengers. Authorities would not confirm any potential Russian involvement, highlighting the continuing uncertainty surrounding the security breach in Danish airspace.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reversed his decision to boycott a local ABC town hall, agreeing to participate after the network reinstated Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani had initially withdrawn in protest of Kimmel's suspension, which stemmed from FCC threats over the host's criticism of the Trump administration. Disney's decision to bring Kimmel back on air, following widespread public and celebrity backlash, prompted Mamdani's change of heart.

          <p>A Colorado jury has awarded $205 million to the family of Wongel Estifanos, a 6-year-old girl who tragically fell over 100 feet to her death from a theme park ride in 2021. Investigations revealed the child was not properly secured, and an operator overrode a warning alarm before the ride began. The lawsuit alleged operator negligence and ignored customer complaints about unsafe practices. This substantial verdict, among the largest wrongful death awards in state history, brings a measure of accountability for the incident, which led to the permanent closure of the Haunted Mine Drop ride.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in UCLA medical research grants, providing significant relief to the University of California system. U.S. District Judge Rita F.

This injunction, which also covers other federal grants, prevents potential layoffs and the closure of labs conducting vital cancer and stroke research.

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK Liberal Democrats, is actively urging US cancer scientists to consider relocating to the UK, proposing discount visas for those impacted by Trump administration funding cuts. He argues that the UK should "step up" and assume a leading role in global cancer research, directly contrasting with what he terms Trump's "anti-science agenda." This initiative follows significant US government cuts to biomedical research grants, which experts warned would severely impede cancer research progress. The article highlights a strategic political move to attract talent and criticize US science policy.</p>
