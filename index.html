            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez can proceed, despite objections from the District Attorney's office. The Menendez brothers were convicted of killing their parents in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Former DA George Gascón had filed a motion to reduce their sentences, citing years of alleged abuse suffered by the brothers. The current DA, Nathan Hochman, sought to withdraw that motion, arguing the brothers haven't taken full responsibility for their crimes, but the judge denied his request, setting the stage for further hearings and potentially a clemency hearing after June 13.</p>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's system, which impacted the code used to exempt freight from new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, has been resolved after more than 10 hours.

            <p>Black women are urged to advocate for themselves regarding health concerns, as they face higher rates of iron deficiency and maternal mortality. Jenny Pierre, who experienced severe menstrual issues and a miscarriage, emphasizes the importance of self-advocacy after doctors initially dismissed her concerns. Dr. Steven Fein highlights that Black women are twice as likely to have iron deficiency compared to white women, and this deficiency is linked to higher mortality rates during pregnancy. Regular iron testing is recommended, especially during pregnancy, and April 11-17 is Black Maternal Health Week.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that the high tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Beijing could test China's ability to withstand Western economic pressure during a potential crisis in the Taiwan Strait. However, they caution that the decision to act on Taiwan remains a complex political and military calculation for Beijing. One professor suggests that if China weathers this tariff period, it will boost Beijing's confidence in facing potential Western sanctions in a future cross-strait war. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports.</p>

            <p>An immigration judge has ruled that Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported, citing that his presence threatens foreign policy, as alleged by the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, faces deportation to Syria or Algeria. The judge's decision aligns with Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assertion that Khalil's actions pose "adverse foreign policy consequence." Supporters of Khalil decried the ruling as a violation of due process and an attempt to suppress dissent. </p>

            <p>Monica Sementilli, wife of famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, has been found guilty of murder in his 2017 death.

Fabio Sementilli was beaten and stabbed in their Los Angeles home. Robert Baker, Monica's lover, had previously pleaded no contest to the murder and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, can be deported by the Trump administration. Khalil, a permanent legal US resident, has not been charged with a crime. The government cited a Cold War-era immigration law, declaring that his presence in the US was adverse to American foreign policy interests. The judge gave his lawyers until 23 April to appeal against the order. His legal team plans to fight for Mr Khalil's "right to speak out against what's happening in the US".</p>

The reiteration of deeper space defense collaboration came at a forum hosted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, as efforts by China and Russia loomed. Tokyo’s heightened concern came to the fore in 2023 with its “Space Security Initiative”, a policy document vowing to “radically expand the use of space systems for national security” and strengthen collaborations with allies.</p>
