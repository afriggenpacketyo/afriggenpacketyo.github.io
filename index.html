          <p>Amid escalating tensions between President Trump and California Governor Newsom, approximately 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines were deployed to Los Angeles to quell protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The protests, initially concentrated in Los Angeles, have spread to several other major U.S. cities. The situation remains highly volatile.</p>
