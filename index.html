          <p>Following a ceasefire with Pakistan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi convened a meeting with top government officials, including the Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, as well as senior military personnel. The discussions took place a day after both sides alleged ceasefire breaches, although no escalation of hostilities has occurred since US President Donald Trump announced the truce. The meeting suggests a cautious approach by the Indian government to maintain stability in the region after recent tensions. The focus remains on upholding the ceasefire agreement and preventing any further escalation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism regarding upcoming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, suggesting significant progress is imminent in a Truth Social post. This comes after Putin announced a unilateral three-day ceasefire for Russia's Victory Day celebrations, which Ukraine claimed was violated by Russian forces. Zelenskyy has proposed a 30-day ceasefire and expressed that Putin's offer for direct talks in Istanbul on Thursday is a 'positive sign'. Both leaders indicate a willingness to engage in negotiations, marking a potential shift in the ongoing conflict dynamics, although skepticism remains about the feasibility of a lasting agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers should ease up on the pressure to be perfect, as being flawed is a crucial part of parenting. She points out that the mental health field has historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, overlooking the credit they deserve. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to acknowledge their imperfections and recognize that their flaws help children learn to accept their own, and gives a quiz for mothers to help them realize they are doing a good job. The article ultimately advocates for self-compassion and reducing the unrealistic expectations placed on mothers.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, in response to calls from Ukraine and its allies for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.

This proposal follows threats from European leaders to increase pressure on Moscow if it does not accept a 30-day ceasefire. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has expressed readiness for peace talks, but only after a ceasefire is established.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, is accused of providing his much younger girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthesia drugs, including propofol and ketamine, allegedly to control her, ultimately leading to her death. Sarah's mother, Tina Harris, became suspicious of Ryan after he admitted to noticing Sarah when she was only 14 and later discovered Sarah with drug vials and medical paraphernalia. Texts revealed Ryan offering and administering drugs to Sarah, creating a chemical dependency. Ryan was convicted of drug distribution, intent to distribute, and depraved heart murder, receiving a 45-year prison sentence.</p>

The company's net income for the quarter was $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, while free cash flow decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion. These figures reflect ongoing pressure on Aramco's financial performance due to sluggish crude prices and slowing global demand.

          <p>This article discusses the impact of the Trump administration's cuts to USAID funding on healthcare in Africa, leading to medication shortages and program cancellations. The cuts have affected various countries, including South Africa, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Somalia, resulting in potential deaths from treatable diseases. While some countries are attempting to compensate for the loss of funding, experts fear the cuts could undo years of progress in disease prevention and treatment. The article emphasizes the need for continued international support to combat infectious diseases in Africa.</p>
