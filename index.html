          <p>The highly anticipated summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded in Alaska without a definitive breakthrough on ending the war in Ukraine. While Trump described the talks as "productive" and noted progress on many points, he confirmed that "there's no deal until there's a deal." The meeting, intended to de-escalate the conflict, ended with Putin inviting Trump for a subsequent meeting in Moscow, leaving the path to a ceasefire uncertain. The discussions took place without Ukrainian representation, raising concerns about potential compromises affecting the nation's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the summit, framing it as an act of appeasement where Donald Trump appeared deferential to Vladimir Putin. The author suggests the meeting was a significant propaganda victory for Putin, who is indicted for war crimes, by welcoming him back to the world stage with a red carpet on U.S. soil. The piece highlights Putin's apparent dominance during the press conference and his success in getting Trump to echo his views on the 2020 election, portraying the summit as a concerning moment for Western diplomacy and democratic norms.</p>

          <p>This article breaks down the Alaska summit into five key observations, providing a structured overview of the event's significance. It highlights Vladimir Putin's warm reception as a major diplomatic win for Russia, effectively ending his status as a pariah in the West. The summary also notes the lack of any concrete agreement on Ukraine, Putin's continued insistence on addressing the conflict's "root causes"—maximalist demands amounting to capitulation—and the unusual vagueness of Trump's statements, which did not even mention Ukraine directly during his public remarks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan's government has announced a proposed change to its residency laws that would impose stricter requirements on spouses from mainland China. The new policy would mandate that applicants provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. This move is part of a broader strategy announced by President Lai to counter escalating threats from Beijing, including societal infiltration and security risks posed by ambiguous dual-status residency. The amendment marks a significant shift in cross-strait governance, reflecting heightened tensions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a critical 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, ending a four-game losing streak and moving back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The win was anchored by a strong six-inning performance from pitcher Clayton Kershaw and, notably, a solid showing from the team's recently struggling bullpen, which successfully protected a narrow late-game lead. This victory provided a much-needed boost for the team, which had been slumping and recently lost infielder Max Muncy to the injured list.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with Fox News following the Alaska summit, President Trump shared his perspective on the talks with Vladimir Putin. He emphasized that while significant progress was made, there is "no deal until there's a deal," and advised Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to "make a deal." Trump rated the meeting a "10" for fostering good relations and claimed that Putin agreed the war would not have happened if he had been president. The interview provided insight into Trump's position, framing the summit as a successful step toward peace.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, and is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane over the weekend.

          <p>California Democrats have introduced a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps, a move aimed at giving their party an advantage in up to five U.S. House seats. This effort is a direct countermeasure to a similar Republican-led redistricting plan in Texas and is part of the larger national battle for control of Congress. The plan, which would reshape several GOP-held districts to favor Democrats, would require a state constitutional amendment and must be approved by California voters in a special election.</p>

By hosting Putin on U.S. soil, the Trump administration effectively ended his status as an international pariah. Although Trump did not explicitly concede to Putin's demands regarding Ukraine, the Russian president's core positions appeared unchanged, leaving Kyiv and European allies in a state of uncertainty about the future of the conflict and U.S. policy.</p>
