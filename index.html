          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia was detained by ICE after his release from criminal custody, facing potential deportation to Uganda despite a previous mistaken deportation to El Salvador. His lawyer filed a new lawsuit challenging his confinement and demanding a fair immigration trial, while political figures like Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Gov. Wes Moore condemned the administration's actions and called for due process. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, however, labeled Abrego Garcia an MS-13 gang member and child predator, justifying his processing for deportation. This case highlights ongoing tensions around immigration policy and the legal rights of individuals facing deportation.</p>

Government data revealed a sharp slowdown in job growth and weaker payroll gains in recent months, alarming experts who foresee further challenges for job seekers. Three red flags include fewer overall hires, a surge in long-term job seekers, and increased unemployment among young workers.

          <p>The leaders of South Korea and Japan met in Tokyo, signaling a new era of cooperation and a commitment to overcome historical differences. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to develop "stable, future-oriented" ties, focusing on areas like AI, industry, and denuclearization. This diplomatic shift is largely seen as a response to the unpredictable foreign policy of the Trump administration and the strengthening ties between North Korea, China, and Russia, aiming to present a united front. The positive atmosphere and concrete plans for collaboration mark a significant turnaround in their often-strained relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland is facing significant water scarcity due to its driest spring since 1964 and a hot summer, leading to critical river levels in areas like Aberdeenshire and North Fife. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency is implementing restrictions on water abstraction for industry and agriculture, with concerns that more regions could follow suit without sustained rainfall. Scottish Water is exploring emergency measures like transferring water from the River Isla, while also urging customers to reduce their consumption, which is significantly higher than in England and Wales. This situation highlights the growing impact of climate change on Scotland's perceived abundant water resources.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed reinterpretation of the Endangered Species Act, which would limit the definition of "harm" to exclude habitat destruction, poses a significant threat to vulnerable species like manatees.

Journalist Danielle Friedman highlights key influences like post-WWII inactivity, early TV fitness personalities, and President JFK's "The Soft American" campaign. The 1970s marked a pivotal decade with the rise of the women's movement, Title IX, and the commercialization of activities like running, aerobics, yoga, and weightlifting, notably popularized by figures such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jane Fonda. The article suggests that while fitness culture is an American invention, it often embodies a relentless pursuit of "thinner, better, faster, stronger."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK hospitality industry reports that over half of all job losses since the last budget, totaling around 89,000, have occurred within its sector. UKHospitality attributes this to higher taxes and rising operational costs, including minimum wage increases and National Insurance contributions, which have stifled investment and hiring. Industry leaders are calling for urgent action, such as cuts to business rates and VAT, warning of significant business closures and further job losses if current trends continue. This situation highlights the severe economic pressures on restaurants, bars, pubs, and hotels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal agents' increased presence in Washington D.C. has sparked widespread fear among immigrant families and childcare workers, with reports of unmarked cars near daycares and arrests. Parents are hesitant to send children to school, and nannies are calling out of work due to safety concerns. The White House confirmed 719 arrests, many of undocumented immigrants, since the crackdown began, leading to new safety protocols at schools and daycares. This situation highlights the profound human impact of aggressive immigration enforcement on daily life and community well-being.</p>

          <p>Unions and workers are vehemently opposing the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, warning it could lead to more catastrophic train crashes and job losses. They argue that consolidating power among freight rail carriers, already criticized for their safety records and labor practices, would exacerbate risks, citing the East Palestine derailment as a cautionary tale. Critics fear the merger, which aims for $2.75 billion in "synergies," will primarily result in workforce reductions and increased leverage against workers and shippers, without benefiting the public or improving safety.

          <p>Donald Trump's potential involvement is casting a shadow over New York City's mayoral election, as he reportedly considers backing a candidate. This adds complexity to a race where Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is leading, challenging incumbents Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo, who both have indirect links or past interactions with Trump. Despite a White House official stating Trump doesn't intend to get involved, speculation persists, fueled by wealthy New Yorkers seeking to thwart Mamdani's progressive agenda. Experts suggest a Trump endorsement would be detrimental given his low popularity in the city.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the debate surrounding phones in schools, arguing that while convenient for parents, constant phone access distracts students, increases social anxiety, and hinders emotional growth. The author, a former teacher, supports the growing trend of state-level phone restrictions, citing positive outcomes in Australia where bans led to improved learning and reduced behavioral problems. The piece emphasizes that removing phones forces students to engage more with peers and teachers, fostering resilience and independence, and offers parents a reprieve from constant digital vigilance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's homelessness policy emphasizes involuntary commitments, or civil commitments, to force unhoused individuals into mandatory drug or mental health treatments, alongside increased criminalization. While this approach sounds extreme, it has been a long-standing practice, increasingly adopted by "blue states" like California, which accounts for half of the nation's unsheltered homeless. Experts like Alex Barnard argue that such commitments are largely ineffective without accompanying housing solutions and can even worsen homelessness, highlighting a reframing of coercion as compassion that often conflicts with civil liberties.</p>

          <p>A new environmental report indicates that China burned more coal in the first seven months of 2025 than at any time since 2016, despite paradoxically installing enormous amounts of renewable energy capacity.

While China's overall emissions have seen a slight drop due to renewables, "powerful coal interests" are hindering its climate goals, threatening to keep coal power entrenched for years to come and potentially derailing its commitments for greenhouse gas reductions.</p>

This trial is significant as it focused on the demographic and viral strains prevalent in Africa, where the majority of global HIV infections occur. While not a complete home run, achieving long-term viral control in 20% of participants offers genuine optimism for future cure strategies.</p>
