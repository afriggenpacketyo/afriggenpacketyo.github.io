            <p>Mongolia has approved a deal with China to construct a new cross-border rail connection, strengthening ties between the two nations amidst ongoing trade disputes with the United States. The 19.5-kilometer railway will facilitate increased Mongolian coal exports to China, a project that had been delayed for over a decade but has recently gained momentum. Construction is slated to begin this year and conclude in 2027, including the development of coal terminals on both sides of the border. This initiative is part of China's broader strategy to enhance regional connectivity through a pan-regional rail network. </p>

            <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC advises investors to avoid panic selling despite his belief that an economic recession is likely on the horizon, triggered by President Trump's new tariffs. While acknowledging the tariffs pose a significant threat to the U.S. economy, Cramer does not anticipate a second Great Recession due to the strength of current institutions. He suggests that Trump could alleviate market anxieties by demonstrating a willingness to negotiate trade deals, and that investors should look for buying opportunities in stocks that have already declined substantially.

            <p>Lisa Whelchel, star of "Facts of Life", clarifies the reasons behind the stalled reboot of the show, following claims by co-star Mindy Cohn that a "greedy b----" sabotaged the project. Whelchel explains that while the cast was excited and contracts were signed, the writers' and actors' strikes, along with the deaths of Charlotte Rae and Norman Lear, ultimately led to the project's dissolution. Cohn later alleged that one of the actresses attempted to secure a separate spinoff deal for herself, causing a rift within the group and effectively ending any chance of a reunion. The actresses have not spoken for a while and now do-ish, but there's definitely, it was an ouch.</p>

            <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Donald Trump to discuss efforts to release Israeli hostages from Gaza and address new U.S. tariffs. Netanyahu stated Israel would eliminate the trade deficit with the U.S., while Trump emphasized the financial aid the U.S. provides to Israel. Trump also announced direct talks between the U.S. and Iran regarding Tehran's nuclear program, a move supported cautiously by Netanyahu, who insisted Iran must not have nuclear weapons.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the US and Iran are holding "direct talks" over a possible nuclear deal, scheduled for Saturday. He warned that it would be a "very bad day for Iran" if no agreement was reached, and reiterated that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. The announcement follows previous rejections of direct talks by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

            <p>US shares stemmed losses on Monday, as investors hoped that President Trump would turn from tariffs to trade deals. The S&P 500 ended the day down about 0.2%, after a wild day of trading that saw shares gyrating from losses to gains in some of the sharpest swings since the Covid-19 pandemic. The respite came despite Trump escalating his tariff threats against China, as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he was opening negotiations with Japan, and looking forward to talks with other nations.</p>

            <p>Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna have reached an agreement to address proxy voting for new parents, aiming to end legislative paralysis in the House. The agreement formalizes "vote pairing," allowing an absent member to coordinate with a present member on the opposite side of an issue. However, a key Democrat criticized the deal as inadequate, signaling an uphill climb for Republicans to find Democrats to offset GOP absences under the pairing scheme.</p>

            <p>President Trump has ruled out pausing the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on countries across the world after a rollercoaster day on Wall Street that ended with most of the US markets down. Intense swings were seen on the three main stock market indexes on Monday as economists fear President Trump's "Liberation Day" levies could cause a global recession. The sudden rise appears to have been the result of a social media post that incorrectly claimed that Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council director, said Mr Trump was considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China.</p>

            <p>General Motors unveiled a new all-electric Chevrolet Corvette concept car as part of the opening of a new design studio in England. The car features a sleek, aerodynamic exterior that resembles a futuristic IMSA race car more than a traditional Corvette, but it does pay some homage to the American sports car in featuring a split window design from the 1963 Sting Ray model, among other design elements. The concept and U.K. design center opening come at an inopportune time as the U.S. and the world's largest automotive markets partake in a trade war with tariffs, including between America and Europe.</p>
