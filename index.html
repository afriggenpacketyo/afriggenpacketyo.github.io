          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 02:15:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, formed in the eastern Atlantic, is projected to intensify into the Atlantic's first hurricane of the season, potentially reaching major hurricane strength near the Caribbean islands. While it poses no immediate threat to the U.S., its long-term trajectory remains uncertain, with most models suggesting a northwest pivot. The storm has already caused significant damage and at least eight fatalities in Cabo Verde, highlighting the immediate dangers posed by such weather events. Forecasters predict an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, which peaks from August to October.</p>

          <p>China asserted it warned and "drove away" the U.S. destroyer USS Higgins from waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, accusing the U.S. of seriously infringing its sovereignty and violating international law. The U.S. Seventh Fleet countered, stating the vessel was conducting a lawful "freedom of navigation operation" and would not be deterred. This incident further escalates tensions in the South China Sea, following a recent collision between a Chinese warship and a Philippine patrol boat, amidst an ongoing U.S.-China trade spat and Beijing's expansive territorial claims.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Madonna has publicly appealed to Pope Leo XIV to visit Gaza, urging him to bring his "light to the children before it's too late" and witness their suffering firsthand. Her plea, made on her son's birthday, emphasizes a humanitarian focus without taking sides in the conflict, solely aiming to prevent more children from dying of starvation. This call reinforces the Pope's recent appeals for an immediate ceasefire, as aid workers report thousands of children diagnosed with malnutrition and a territory pushed to the brink of famine.</p>

          <p>Gaza City is enduring intense Israeli air attacks, with plans for a ground operation, causing widespread destruction and hindering the recovery of dead and injured. The UK, EU, Australia, Canada, and Japan issued a joint statement warning that "famine is unfolding" and demanded immediate aid access, a claim Israel denies while accusing UN agencies of distribution failures. The World Health Organization appealed for medical supplies, and a group of former leaders, "The Elders," have for the first time labeled the situation an "unfolding genocide," escalating international criticism of the 22-month-long conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld Arkansas' first-in-the-nation ban on gender transition medical treatment for minors, reversing a lower court's decision. The 8-2 ruling cited a U.S. Supreme Court decision on a similar Tennessee law, affirming that the ban does not violate transgender minors' equal protection rights. Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin praised the decision, stating it protects children from "experimental procedures." However, the ACLU of Arkansas called the outcome "tragically unjust," arguing the law is dangerous and harms children by denying them essential healthcare.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggling bullpen has suffered another "big blow" with right-hander Brock Stewart placed on the injured list due to shoulder inflammation. Stewart, acquired at the trade deadline to bolster the relief corps, joins several other key pitchers sidelined with injuries, adding to the team's challenges amid a recent 12-19 skid. While the team hopes the injury was caught early and he will return for the stretch run, his absence underscores the ongoing vulnerability and uncertainty surrounding the Dodgers' pitching staff.</p>
