          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order to lower medication costs by tying Medicare prices for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries, an effort to revive a program previously blocked by courts. The "most favored nation" policy aims to ensure the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest drug costs globally, with Trump boasting potential savings of trillions of dollars, although the actual figure is unclear. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that lower prices will hurt profits and innovation. The Biden administration abandoned a similar proposal in 2022 due to court orders and stakeholder concerns, while Trump accuses pharmaceutical companies of exploiting Americans with high drug prices.</p>

          <p>Stocks in Asia rose following trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, signaling progress in easing trade tensions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cited "substantial progress," with details expected to be released soon, raising investor hopes for lowered tariffs. The meetings are the first since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting retaliatory taxes from China. Economists have warned that the escalating trade war could lead to an economic downturn, including in Asia, where economies rely heavily on both countries as trade partners. Analysts anticipate an initial agreement involving a "much lower level" for tariffs, and economists have warned that the continuing division of the global economy into ‚Äúrival blocs‚Äù could cut global gross domestic product by nearly 7 percent over the long run.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is under scrutiny for potentially accepting a luxury Boeing jet from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One, raising ethical concerns.

          <p>Argentina's Supreme Court rediscovered 83 boxes of Nazi material confiscated during World War II in its basement. The boxes, sent from the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941, drew the attention of authorities who feared their contents could affect Argentina's neutrality. The materials, including postcards, photographs, and propaganda from the Nazi regime, were confiscated by a federal judge. The court has transferred the boxes to a secure room and invited the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires to participate in their preservation and inventory.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark decided to stop offering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, forcing many Americans to switch to a less effective drug. This decision exemplifies how secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) limit treatment options for patients. Despite research indicating Zepbound leads to more weight loss, Caremark chose to exclude it, citing lower drug prices for employers. Patients like Ellen Davis, who lost 85 pounds on Zepbound, are frustrated by the change, viewing it as a forced switch to a less effective medication.</p>

Personal trainer Ethan Smith emphasizes whole foods, while Dr. Paul Morgan warns that many protein-advertised products are ultra-processed. Ultra-processed foods have come under scrutiny recently with one study published last month linking them to early death.
