          <p>European officials have expressed optimism about reaching a trade agreement with the U.S. President Donald Trump, while also warning of potential economic repercussions for both regions if a deal is not achieved and tariffs are fully implemented. Negotiations between the EU and the U.S. are ongoing to avert U.S. tariffs on EU goods and subsequent EU countermeasures, talks that have yet to yield significant compromises. The IMF has also cautioned that Trump's announced tariffs pose major challenges for both the U.S. and the global economy in 2025, leading to downward revisions in growth forecasts. Optimism remains, but substantial work is needed to bridge the divide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices are surging as investors seek safe-haven assets amidst trade turmoil and declining confidence in U.S. Treasurys and the dollar. Analysts attribute this trend to a shift in U.S. trade policy and waning faith in the U.S. economy, with gold's inflation-hedging qualities and independence from any single nation's economic trajectory boosting its appeal. While U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar have traditionally served as safe havens, recent events have diminished their standing among investors, driving a gold rush. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SK Hynix, a major supplier for Nvidia, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and operating profit due to strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets.

However, the company cautioned that macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies, could create demand volatility in the second half of the year.
