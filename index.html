        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Resident doctors in England have voted overwhelmingly in favor of renewed strike action, continuing a long-running dispute with the government over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) is demanding "pay restoration," arguing that real-term wages have fallen by about 20% since 2008, despite recent pay rises. The government has maintained that its door is open for talks on working conditions but not on pay. The vote grants the BMA a six-month mandate for industrial action, raising concerns about the potential for further disruption to the NHS and the cancellation of thousands of patient appointments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has begun phasing out the requirement for passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes at several U.S. airports. This change, which was not formally announced, appears to be a gradual rollout, with travelers at airports like BWI, LAX, and LaGuardia reporting they were not asked to take off their footwear. The no-shoes rule was implemented nationwide in 2006 following the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. While the TSA has not confirmed a permanent policy change, it stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has indicated that churches whose pastors endorse political candidates from the pulpit should not automatically risk losing their tax-exempt status. In a joint court filing, the IRS and plaintiffs including the National Religious Broadcasters Association proposed an interpretation that would shield communications from a house of worship to its congregation during religious services from the Johnson Amendment. This 1954 rule prohibits tax-exempt organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates. The move aligns with a long-standing informal policy of non-enforcement and President Trump's stated goal of eliminating the amendment.</p>

          <p>Online fashion retailer Shein has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, a move reportedly designed to pressure U.K. regulators to approve its long-delayed London listing. The company has faced significant hurdles in London, particularly regarding disagreements between U.K. and Chinese regulators over risk disclosures related to its supply chain in China's Xinjiang region. Shein's listing ambitions have been fraught with challenges, including scrutiny over its labor practices and alleged use of forced labor, which previously derailed a potential New York IPO. The dual-track approach highlights the company's determination to go public despite ongoing regulatory and ethical concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose significant new tariffs on 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and others across Asia, Africa, and Europe, with rates ranging from 25% to 40%. The new levies are set to take effect on August 1, extending a previous deadline to allow for further trade negotiations. The move is part of the administration's ongoing effort to implement what it calls "reciprocal" trade policies to address perceived imbalances. Economists have expressed concern that the widespread tariffs could disrupt global trade, fuel inflation, and hinder economic growth.</p>

Among the hardest-hit locations was Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp in Kerr County, which confirmed at least 27 fatalities among its campers and counselors. The disaster has raised questions about the adequacy of warning systems, as the rainfall far exceeded forecasts for the drought-stricken region.</p>

The author argues this act desecrated a human body, turning it into a state-controlled instrument and symbolizing the degradation of women's personhood in post-Dobbs America. The case draws parallels to sexual assault, where a body is used for another's ends without regard for the person.</p>

Currently, only a small fraction of the region's population outside of Hong Kong has health and life insurance, presenting a significant opportunity for expansion.

          <p>A 48-year-old man has been identified as the 140th "stolen grandchild" traced by the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo activist group in Argentina. Born in a clandestine detention center in 1977, he was taken from his mother, a left-wing activist who was arrested and disappeared by the country's military dictatorship. For decades, the group has used DNA to identify the nearly 500 infants believed to have been stolen and given to families loyal to the regime. This latest identification brings profound joy to his older sister, who has been searching for him her entire life, offering a moment of resolution amid a dark chapter of national history.</p>

          <p>In an opinion column, a contributor who testified at a recent House subcommittee hearing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) criticizes the proceedings as political theater. The author argues that conservative lawmakers advanced an anti-DEI agenda using leading questions and anecdotes rather than engaging with evidence of systemic discrimination. The piece asserts that racism has long influenced hiring practices to the benefit of white applicants and that DEI programs are a necessary, intentional strategy to address these historical and ongoing inequities. The author laments the refusal to engage in nuanced discussion about the complexities of racial disparities in the American workplace.</p>

          <p>In a rare display of bipartisanship, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Republican Senator Tim Sheehy are co-sponsoring a bill to give the Department of Defense the "right to repair" its own equipment. The legislation aims to save taxpayer money and improve military readiness by ending restrictive contracts that often require expensive and time-consuming repairs by private defense contractors. The bill would codify a policy already being pushed by the Army, ensuring service members have the technical data and intellectual property needed to perform their own maintenance, thus increasing efficiency and battlefield flexibility.</p>

The author contends that the accumulation of immense individual wealth is a "policy failure," reflecting tax structures and economic policies that favor the rich at the expense of public services. This system forces public goods like museums and hospitals to depend on the philanthropy of plutocrats.</p>

The author suggests Musk's strategy of targeting a few key congressional seats is sound, as it could grant significant legislative power if successful.

          <p>A recent swarm of over 1,300 earthquakes in Japan's remote Tokara Islands is fueling public anxiety about a potential megaquake. The seismic activity has coincided with viral online speculation based on a comic book that some interpret as predicting a major disaster in July 2025. While scientists have dismissed the prediction as baseless, they acknowledge the country's real and ever-present seismic risks. Government experts have long warned of an 80% chance of a catastrophic magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake along the Nankai Trough fault line within the next 30 years, a scenario far more credible and devastating than any fictional prophecy.</p>

In response, parents are increasingly advocating for schools to take action, pushing for more green spaces, shade structures, and upgraded air conditioning on campuses.
