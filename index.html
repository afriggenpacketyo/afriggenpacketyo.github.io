          <p>Data from the CDC indicates a 1% increase in US births in 2024, totaling roughly 3.6 million, signaling a possible shift in a long-term decline that started around 2008. Demographers urge caution in interpreting this data as a definitive trend reversal, citing persistent economic uncertainties and the high costs of housing and childcare. The report also highlights a record-low number of teenage births and an increase in births among women aged 40-44, with Hispanic and Asian women contributing to the rise in birth rates. This data does not address the impact of abortion bans on birth rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report by the 5Rights Foundation suggests that Instagram still poses serious risks to children, even with the introduction of Teen Accounts. Researchers were able to create accounts using fake birthdays and were subsequently shown sexualized content and hateful comments. The report raises concerns about the effectiveness of Instagram's age checks and content moderation. Meta, which owns Instagram, states that its new accounts have built-in protections and shares the goal of keeping teens safe online.</p>
