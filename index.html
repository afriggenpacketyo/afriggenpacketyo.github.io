          <p>A prominent economic think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces a £41.2 billion shortfall in her budget. To meet her self-imposed fiscal rules, Niesr recommends a "moderate but sustained increase in taxes," suggesting reforms to council tax or extending the freeze on income tax thresholds. The report presents Reeves with a "trilemma" between her spending commitments, her tax promises, and her borrowing limits, concluding one must be abandoned. The government maintains that economic growth is the best path to strengthening public finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese automaker Honda reported a 50% year-over-year drop in its first-quarter operating profit, falling short of analyst estimates. The company attributed the significant decline primarily to the impact of 25% U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles and a stronger yen. Despite the quarterly setback, Honda raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 40%, signaling confidence in future performance. The earnings report highlights the substantial effect of U.S. trade policy on Japan's auto industry, a cornerstone of its economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this surge, the figure slightly missed analyst expectations, causing a minor dip in the company's share price. Following a recent downward revision of its full-year outlook, the company has pledged to implement cost-cutting measures and enhance its commercial focus.

          <p>The BBC has begun broadcasting a new season of MasterChef that was filmed before its long-time hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were dismissed following a report upholding misconduct allegations. The decision to air the series has drawn criticism from broadcast unions, but the BBC stated it was "the right thing to do" for the contestants involved. One contestant was edited out at her own request, and the episodes reportedly feature less banter than usual, focusing more on the chefs. The controversy stems from upheld complaints against both presenters for their on-set conduct.</p>

          <p>This article examines how the throw-in, a common football set-piece, remains a largely underutilized tactical resource in the Premier League. It recalls the era of Rory Delap's long throws for Stoke City as a rare example of a team weaponizing the situation. The piece suggests several innovations, such as specialized training for long-throw specialists and developing complex set-plays similar to corner routines. It also highlights the incredible advantage of the offside law not applying to throw-ins, a loophole that is seldom exploited by top clubs.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched two new open-source artificial intelligence models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, in a significant strategic shift for the company. CEO Sam Altman described the models as "the best and most usable" in the world, marking a direct challenge to the growing number of popular open-source models from China, such as Alibaba's Qwen family. This move represents a return to OpenAI's origins, as its last open model was released in 2019. Analysts see this as a competitive response, although China is still considered to lead in the sheer quantity of available open models.</p>

          <p>Ion Iliescu, the dominant figure in Romania's post-communist transition and its first freely elected president, has passed away at the age of 95. He rose to power during the chaotic 1989 overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, an event he helped shape. His legacy is complex; while he guided Romania toward a form of democracy, he also violently suppressed opposition, notably during the "mineriads" where miners were used to attack protesters. For decades, he faced investigations for his role in the deaths that occurred during the revolution, but was never ultimately convicted in court.</p>

          <p>Australia's Great Barrier Reef has suffered its most significant annual loss of live coral on record, according to a new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The decline follows a severe and widespread mass coral bleaching event in early 2024, which was driven by unprecedented levels of heat stress from record-high ocean temperatures. The northern and southern regions of the reef were most affected, with coral cover dropping by as much as one-third. Scientists warn that this volatility indicates an ecosystem under severe stress, primarily due to the effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>The article examines the significant challenges faced by crossover athletes, like Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit, who attempt to transition to the NFL. It identifies two primary hurdles: the complexity of the NFL playbook and the sheer depth of athletic talent available in American football. Experts note that learning a playbook is intellectually demanding, comparable to studying law, and requires rapid application on the field. Furthermore, while an athlete may be elite in their original sport, they often face hundreds of similarly athletic competitors in the U.S. who have a lifetime of football experience.</p>

At least one person is confirmed dead and more than 100 are missing after a massive wave of water and debris surged through the area. Rescue operations are underway but are being hampered by continued heavy rainfall and severely damaged roads, which have cut off access for some disaster response teams.

          <p>Driven by a surge in domestic coffee consumption and a zero-tariff policy for certain African nations, China is increasing its efforts to secure coffee bean supply chains from the continent. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are leading this push, signing agreements in top-producing countries such as Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to invest in local processing and procure large quantities of beans. This strategy allows China to "lock in supply" and diversify its sources, leveraging its growing market power. The move reflects a broader Chinese strategy of securing new overseas commodity supply lines.</p>

He detailed numerous issues he identified with the submersible's carbon fiber hull and other components, and his failed attempts to have the vessel independently certified.

While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts say the move is symbolically damaging for a nation desperately needing foreign investment to rebuild after 13 years of war. The tariff threatens to restrict potential trade and sends a message that Washington will maintain economic leverage over Syria's new transitional government. This policy adds another obstacle to the country's recovery, which is already hampered by a devastated infrastructure and ongoing instability. (not investment advice)</p>

Under the proposed terms, ESPN would own and operate the NFL Network, integrating it into its upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service. ESPN would also gain distribution rights for the RedZone channel and merge its fantasy football platform with the NFL's. The deal, which requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, marks a major strategic alignment between the two media powerhouses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is facing a shortage of launch rockets as it races to build satellite internet constellations to compete with SpaceX's Starlink, creating a potential conflict between national and local projects. The national priority project, Guo Wang, has recently accelerated its launch schedule, utilizing multiple state-owned Long March rockets. This has left other ambitious projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan constellation, to seek launches from the private sector. Qianfan recently issued a tender for seven private rocket launches, highlighting the capacity constraints within China's state-run space program as it pursues its strategic goals.</p>

In his speech, Hiroshima's mayor warned against the growing acceptance of nuclear weapons amid current global conflicts, while Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reaffirmed Japan's mission to lead efforts toward a nuclear-free world.

The lawsuit argues that Wu and the other absent Democrats have abandoned their public duties, justifying their removal.

The facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release prisoners early; they will be transferred to other institutions. The closure raises questions about the future of the property, which originally opened in 1928 as the luxurious Lake Norconian Club hotel before being converted into a prison.</p>
