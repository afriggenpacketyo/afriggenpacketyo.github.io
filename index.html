          <p>Delegations from Ukraine and Russia convened in Istanbul for another round of U.S.-brokered peace negotiations aimed at resolving the three-year conflict. The talks occurred a day after Ukraine launched a drone attack on Russia's strategic bomber fleet, escalating tensions. Ukraine seeks a 30-day ceasefire, while Russia insists on annexing Ukrainian regions and blocking Ukraine's NATO accession. Despite President Trump's pressure and hinted frustration, both sides remain entrenched in their positions, with accusations of sabotaging the peace process. The article highlights the challenges in achieving a lasting resolution amidst ongoing military actions and political maneuvering, as well as the complex international dynamics influencing the conflict's trajectory.

          <p>The Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore highlighted increasing tensions between the US and China, with the US warning of China's aggressive actions in the Indo-Pacific region. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Asian allies to bolster their defenses against China's military buildup near Taiwan. China's Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng dismissed the US remarks as baseless accusations, while the Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized the US military presence in the Asia-Pacific. Amid these exchanges, French President Emmanuel Macron cautioned against the growing divide between the two superpowers, as the forum underscored the complexities and potential dangers of the US-China relationship in the region.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip tailored for the Chinese market to comply with US export regulations. The new B30 chip will allow users to link multiple units for high-performance computing clusters, and Nvidia plans to produce over one million units this year. This move aims to maintain Nvidia's market share in China amid tightened tech restrictions from Washington. The new GPU is expected to be introduced in July and will likely be based on Nvidiaâ€™s Blackwell platform, addressing concerns over export controls on its H20 chips designed for Chinese customers.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the modern US economy increasingly conflicts with women's fertility, demanding more years in education and longer work hours during their prime childbearing years. It highlights the rising average age of first-time mothers and the challenges faced by those who wish to start families earlier. Colleges and workplaces are often ill-equipped to support parents, with long educational pipelines and demanding career paths. The article advocates for policies that support both fertility and parenthood, such as affordable education, stronger labor regulations, and expanded remote work opportunities.

          <p>An Indian national was arrested at Mumbai airport for smuggling dozens of venomous vipers and other reptiles in their checked-in baggage. The haul included 44 Indonesian pit vipers, three spider-tailed horned vipers, and five Asian leaf turtles. Mumbai Customs officials discovered the snakes concealed within the passenger's luggage upon arrival from Thailand. This seizure is part of a series of unusual wildlife smuggling incidents at the airport, including previous cases involving gibbons and turtles.

          <p>A new study by Healthy Babies, Bright Futures reveals that arsenic was found in all 145 rice samples tested from stores across the United States. The report also found cadmium, lead, and mercury in the rice, with arsenic at the highest levels. One in four rice samples exceeded the federal limit for arsenic in infant rice cereal, though no such limit exists for rice itself. The USA Rice Federation maintains that American-grown rice has the lowest levels of inorganic arsenic globally, while Healthy Babies, Bright Futures recommends cooking rice in extra water and opting for lower-arsenic varieties like California-grown or Thai jasmine rice. The findings underscore concerns about heavy metal contamination in food.</p>

          <p>A Swedish commission has recommended ending international adoptions following an inquiry that revealed systemic abuse and fraud over several decades. The investigation found instances of child trafficking, adoptions without parental consent, and falsified documentation. The commission urged the government to issue a formal apology to adoptees and their families, emphasizing the need to acknowledge the human rights violations that occurred. The probe was initiated after a newspaper report exposed serious issues within Sweden's international adoption system, prompting a reevaluation of the country's approach to international adoptions.

This announcement follows a Â£1.6 million fine imposed on the trust for avoidable failings related to three baby deaths in 2021.

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing conservative historian and euroskeptic, has narrowly won the Polish presidential runoff, dealing a significant blow to Donald Tusk's pro-European government. Nawrocki's victory will likely result in obstruction of the government's reforms, particularly those aimed at restoring the rule of law. His foreign policy stances, including skepticism towards Ukraine's NATO membership and mistrust of Berlin, also clash with the government's agenda. Analysts suggest that Poland may follow Hungary's path, distancing itself from Europe under Nawrocki's leadership, potentially paving the way for a return to power for the Law and Justice party in 2027.</p>

          <p>Eight people were injured in Boulder, Colorado, during a march in support of Israeli hostages when a suspect used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted act of violence," and the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was allegedly heard yelling "Free Palestine." The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, included a Holocaust refugee. Authorities have condemned the attack as a hate crime, with Colorado Governor Jared Polis calling it a "heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community."</p>

The Trump administration's increased export restrictions on semiconductors and revocation of visas for Chinese students drew criticism from Beijing. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that these actions undermine the Geneva deal and vowed to safeguard China's interests. China's firm stance on rare earths exports also contradicted Washington's expectations, signaling a potential worsening of relations between the two economic superpowers.

          <p>Major steel stocks experienced a significant surge following President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%. Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs, a mining company, jumped by approximately 25% in premarket trading, while Steel Dynamics and Nucor saw increases of over 10%. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also rose by 1.9%. Trump's move, announced at a rally in Pennsylvania, aims to further secure the steel industry in the United States, although it has reignited trade tensions and drawn criticism from global partners.

          <p>A new Social Security Administration (SSA) policy requiring nearly 2 million additional beneficiaries to visit local offices annually to change direct deposit information is causing concern due to long travel times for seniors. Almost one-quarter of seniors live over an hour away from their nearest Social Security field office, and half need to drive at least 33 minutes. The SSA implemented the new requirements to curb fraud, estimating $19.9 million in losses were avoided as a result of enhanced safety measures. Advocates argue the change is an overreaction, especially given that many seniors do not have internet access or transportation, making in-person appointments burdensome.</p>

High interest rates could lead to an economic downturn and constrain politicians' ability to pass tax cuts or deficit-financed spending. The bond market's influence could significantly impact the cost of Trump's policies, making it more expensive for the government and individuals to borrow money. (not investment advice)</p>
