          <p>Evelyn Palla, 52, has been named the new chief executive of Germany's state-owned rail operator, Deutsche Bahn (DB), succeeding Richard Lutz amidst mounting reliability and infrastructural issues. Palla, an Italian national, previously headed DB Regio, the subsidiary overseeing regional operations. This article notes that her appointment was welcomed by the train drivers' union and passenger advocacy groups, who praised her experience and focus on punctuality. Despite ongoing problems, public transportation use in Germany increased in the first half of 2025, though the initial boom from the Deutschlandticket appears to be waning due to rising prices.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, with wind gusts up to 230 km/h, has made landfall over Panuitan Island in the northern Philippines, prompting thousands of evacuations. Regional authorities describe the storm as potentially "catastrophic," warning of life-threatening storm surges exceeding 3 meters, widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure damage. Schools and government offices, including in Manila, are closed as the typhoon barrels west towards southern China. This article notes the storm follows weeks of severe monsoon flooding and comes amidst protests against government corruption blamed for inadequate flood control.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2bn privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. The project involves moving the existing Northern Runway 12 meters for regular use, alongside terminal expansions, expected to increase annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. This article notes Chancellor Rachel Reeves anticipates thousands of jobs and billions in investment, despite strong opposition from climate campaigners who deem it a "disaster." Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and enhanced public transport targets to mitigate environmental concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is bracing for significant economic repercussions following the Trump administration's decision to raise H-1B visa application fees to $100,000. This article details how the move led to a nearly 3% slump in Indian tech stocks, with companies like Mphasis and Persistent Systems experiencing notable losses. Analysts suggest that the increased costs will prompt Indian IT firms to re-evaluate staffing strategies, potentially increasing offshoring or local US hiring, which could impact profit margins. Furthermore, a decline in new H-1B visa holders is expected to reduce remittances to India and discourage Indian students from pursuing education in the United States, adding a new "tax" on their job prospects.

This article highlights accounts from women who experienced reduced libido and physical side effects like vaginal dryness, often without prior warning from doctors. While a 2013 review found about 15% of women reported decreased desire, the majority experienced no change or an increase, possibly due to pregnancy-related anxiety relief. Researchers suggest the pill's effect on testosterone, by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), may reduce "free testosterone" and thus sexual desire.</p>

          <p>Outdoor clothing brand Arc'teryx has apologized for a fireworks display in Tibet, which drew significant online backlash for its potential environmental impact on the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. The promotional event, designed by Chinese artist Cai Guo Qiang, sparked criticism for contradicting the brand's conservation-focused image. This article reports that Chinese officials are investigating the incident, while Arc'teryx stated the display was "out of line with Arc'teryx's values" and used biodegradable materials, aiming to raise mountain culture awareness. Critics question the approval process for such a large-scale project in a sacred and tightly controlled region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that global fossil fuel production plans are vastly out of sync with climate targets set under the Paris Agreement. Countries, especially the top 20 polluters like China, the US, and India, are projected to produce over twice the amount of fossil fuels by 2030 than is consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This article highlights that the "Production Gap Report" shows a significant increase in this near-term discrepancy, with China's slower reduction in coal production being a major factor. Despite international pledges to move away from fossil fuels, the current trajectory suggests a concerning acceleration in production, undermining efforts to avert the worst effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>Officials are issuing warnings regarding a dolphin nicknamed "Reggie," whose increasingly close interactions with swimmers off England's south coast have led to alarming behavioral changes. This article details incidents where the solitary male bottlenose nudged swimmers and pushed two women underwater, prompting concerns for both human safety and the dolphin's well-being. Experts emphasize that human habituation can cause dolphins to lose their natural wariness, leading to potential injury or aggression. The UK government's Marine Management Organization has reinforced its code, advising the public never to swim with, touch, feed, or approach dolphins to prevent such dangerous alterations in animal behavior.</p>

This article notes the decision aligns with economists' expectations that Chinese authorities would hold off major stimulus amid a recent stock market rally, even as economic data signals fatigue.
