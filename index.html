          <p>Shares of minerals explorer Trilogy Metals experienced a significant surge in premarket trading after the White House announced it would acquire a 10% stake in the company. This partnership is part of a U.S. initiative to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper by developing the Ambler mining district in Alaska. The move, which includes a $35.6 million investment, reverses a previous administration's decision to block the Ambler Road project. The project remains controversial, with opponents citing potential harm to local ecosystems and communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marking the second anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack, the conflict continues with devastating consequences for Gaza, where infrastructure is decimated and the civilian death toll has surpassed 67,000. Israel has expanded its military operations into neighboring countries while facing international accusations of genocide, which it denies. The Trump administration has been actively pushing a 20-point peace plan, which has received a cautiously positive initial response from Hamas, leading to new ceasefire talks in Egypt. The plan proposes a new technocratic Palestinian government under international oversight.</p>

The Trump administration maintains the deployment is necessary to help local leaders who have been ineffective in securing their cities.</p>

          <p>A REACH medical helicopter crashed on Highway 50 in Sacramento, leaving its three crew members—a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic—with critical injuries. The aircraft was returning to its dispatch point after transporting a patient when it experienced an in-air emergency. Miraculously, no vehicles on the busy freeway were involved in the incident, a fact officials described as "mind blowing." The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash, which was captured on video by a motorist in the westbound lanes.</p>

          <h2>Democrats Frame Government Shutdown as a Battle Over Affordable Care Act Subsidies</h2>

          <p>Amid the federal government shutdown, congressional Democrats are leveraging the situation to pressure Republicans into extending crucial Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits. These subsidies have significantly lowered health insurance premiums for millions of Americans, and their expiration coincides with the upcoming open enrollment period. Democrats are highlighting the potential for dramatic premium increases, particularly in states that supported Donald Trump, to frame the shutdown as a fight for affordable healthcare. This strategy aims to win back support from working-class voters by contrasting with recent Republican-led cuts to other health programs.</p>

          <p>This opinion article frames the ongoing government shutdown as a strategic opportunity for the Trump administration to reduce the federal workforce and restore fiscal discipline. The author argues that federal spending is unsustainable and that the public largely supports cutting waste, fraud, and the number of government employees. The piece praises the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in eliminating wasteful contracts and suggests the shutdown could be used to permanently downsize or eliminate numerous federal agencies. The author concludes that the White House should seize this chance to make significant cuts.</p>

          <p>A couple in New Orleans discovered a nearly 1,900-year-old Roman grave marker while clearing their yard, prompting an investigation into its origins and an effort to repatriate it to Italy. Experts identified the inscription as a dedication to a second-century Roman sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus. The headstone is believed to have been reported missing from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, which was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II. The FBI's art crime team is now involved, though the exact path of how the ancient relic traveled to Louisiana remains a mystery.</p>

          <p>Tensions are high in Venezuela as the Trump administration intensifies its pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro's government. The U.S. has deployed warships, labeled Maduro a "narco-terrorist," and conducted deadly strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats, actions many observers see as a pretext for regime change. In response, Maduro's allies are vowing to resist any potential U.S. invasion, conducting civil defense drills and invoking the specter of a protracted conflict similar to the Vietnam War. While some Venezuelan opposition figures support U.S. intervention, many citizens fear the devastating consequences of a full-scale military conflict.</p>

          <p>UEFA has allowed two domestic league matches—a La Liga game in Miami and a Serie A match in Australia—to be played abroad, a move critics are calling a damaging turning point for European football. While UEFA's executive committee stated its opposition to the practice, it claimed FIFA's rules were not clear enough to block the games. This decision is seen as opening the floodgates for leagues to chase revenue globally, potentially compromising competitive integrity and betraying local fanbases.

          <p>President Trump's push to deploy the National Guard to cities like Chicago and Portland is testing the legal limits of presidential power, prompting lawsuits from state and local officials. The administration is invoking Title 10, a rarely used statute allowing the president to bring the Guard into federal service to execute U.S. laws, in this case related to immigration enforcement. Legal experts note this application is unprecedented, as federalizing the Guard domestically typically occurs in extreme civil unrest with state approval. Courts have issued mixed rulings, blocking a deployment in Oregon but allowing one in Illinois to proceed for now.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, some federal employees are expressing that the Trump administration's threats of mass layoffs are not their primary concern.

One NIH program director stated that the damage being done internally is far worse than what most Americans realize.

A conservative Christian legal group, representing a therapist, argues that the ban infringes on free speech rights during talk therapy.

The funding cut, part of the administration's broader rollback of the Inflation Reduction Act, forces the tribe to scale back its project to power only about 100 homes.

The conflict has killed over 66,000 Palestinians and left the enclave in ruins, while Israelis remain traumatized and eager for the return of hostages. The negotiations are based on a 20-point plan proposed by Donald Trump, who has applied significant pressure on both sides to engage. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces pressure from his far-right coalition partners who oppose concessions.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 18 individuals in the UK's largest-ever operation against mobile phone theft, dismantling a network believed to be responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen phones to China annually. The investigation began after a victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse, where police discovered a shipment of nearly 900 devices destined for Hong Kong. The gang is thought to handle up to half of all phones stolen in London, where thefts have nearly tripled in the last four years, driven by a lucrative international market for secondhand devices.</p>

El-Anani's nomination comes as UNESCO faces significant budget challenges following the withdrawal of the United States, which cited an anti-Israel bias. He has pledged to prioritize the agency's budget and seek the U.S.'s return as a member, while also continuing the fight against antisemitism and religious intolerance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that a new 25% tariff will be imposed on all medium- and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States, effective November 1st.

The announcement was made via a post on his Truth Social platform and comes just before a scheduled meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. This new tariff adds to the ongoing trade tensions affecting the global economy and various market sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is traveling to Washington to meet with President Trump in an effort to advance stalled trade negotiations. Canada is the only G7 nation without a new trade deal with the Trump administration this year, and Carney faces domestic pressure to secure an agreement that would ease punishing U.S. tariffs on key sectors like steel and lumber. The visit comes as Trump has renewed talk of making Canada a U.S. state, and insiders suggest there is a lack of clarity from the White House on what a potential deal would entail.</p>

          <p>China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center, located in the sea near Hainan province. The project involves installing server racks inside large, 1,300-tonne cabins submerged 35 meters deep, using the surrounding seawater as a natural coolant. This method is designed to significantly reduce the energy consumption and operational costs typically required for cooling land-based data centers. The initial phase is part of a larger plan to build a subsea facility with 100 data cabins, contributing to the development of Hainan's blue economy and technological infrastructure.</p>

The term 'supermoon' refers to a full moon that appears up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than at other times. This year's Harvest Moon is the latest it has occurred since 1987, rising close to the autumn equinox and providing extra light for several successive evenings.</p>

          <p>Two years into the war, surveys indicate a significant decline in mutual empathy and trust between Israelis and Palestinians, raising concerns about the long-term prospects for reconciliation. One poll found a majority of Israeli Jews agree with the statement "There are no innocent people in Gaza," reflecting a hardening of attitudes. Experts on both sides describe an almost complete dehumanization, which complicates any potential peace process. While some analysts believe third-party actors could help bridge the divide, others argue that strong, visionary leadership is needed to overcome the deep-seated resignation and distrust.</p>

          <p>France is facing renewed political turmoil after Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned just 27 days into his term, citing an inability to form a functional minority government. President Emmanuel Macron now faces difficult choices: appoint a sixth prime minister in under two years or dissolve parliament and call for new elections, a risky move with Marine Le Pen's far-right party leading in the polls. The crisis stems from a deadlocked parliament where no party holds a majority, making it impossible to pass key legislation, including the 2026 budget, which remains in limbo.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has raised its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a 4% prediction in April, citing the effects of government support measures. This upgrade comes despite escalating trade tensions with the U.S., which saw tariffs on Chinese goods more than double this year. China's export growth has remained resilient, offsetting a domestic slump in real estate and sluggish consumer spending. However, the bank expects this momentum to slow, projecting China's GDP growth to ease to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus fades and exports weaken. (not investment advice)</p>
