          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's tariffs and domestic policies create a 'Luddite trap' for the American auto industry, potentially isolating it from innovation and global competition. The author contends that while tariffs aim to protect the industry from foreign competition, Trump's domestic policies risk cutting it off from advancements in electrification, digitization, and automation. The article emphasizes the need for the U.S. to remain competitive in the global race for next-generation vehicles, particularly against China's advancements, to safeguard its economy and national security.

          <p>Pakistan's decision to close its airspace to Indian airlines has forced carriers to reroute flights, particularly those linking India to Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East. This closure results from heightened tensions between the two nations following a deadly attack in Jammu and Kashmir. While Indian airlines face longer and more expensive flights, analysts suggest that airfares may not increase significantly due to the closure, which is considered more symbolic than disruptive. The impact on Indian airlines' competitiveness is also discussed, drawing parallels to the impact of Russia's airspace closure on European airlines.</p>

          <p>Mining and energy companies are increasingly exploring natural hydrogen, also known as white, gold, or geologic hydrogen, as a potential clean energy source. Natural hydrogen is found beneath the Earth's surface, contains no carbon, and produces only water when burned. While exploratory efforts are underway globally, some critics raise environmental concerns and distribution challenges, with the IEA warning that the resource might be too scattered for economically viable capture. Despite the challenges, some see natural hydrogen as a promising opportunity to accelerate industrial decarbonization.</p>

Some pouches contain more sugar than a one-year-old should consume in a day. Experts recommend that these products be used sparingly and not as replacements for homemade meals, as they can cause health problems if used as a primary source of nutrition. Concerns are raised about misleading nutrition claims and the marketing of pouches to babies as young as four months old, against expert guidance.</p>

          <p>The Filipino community in Vancouver is experiencing sorrow and fury following an attack at the Lapu Lapu festival where a man drove an SUV through the crowd, killing eleven people. Community members are described as being numb, angry, confused, sad, and devastated. Witnesses described seeing bodies bouncing off the vehicle and the chaotic aftermath. Despite the tragedy, there is a strong sense of unity and cooperation among Filipinos, with many expressing the cultural value of Bayanihan, a spirit of helping each other.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Canadian election has been significantly influenced by Donald Trump's actions, such as imposing tariffs and threatening annexation, leading to a surge in Canadian nationalism. Mark Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of England, has emerged as a leading candidate, styled as an anti-Trump figure. The Conservative Party's initial lead in the polls has vanished as Canadians see Carney as a stronger choice to negotiate with the US President.

          <p>Referees missed a foul on Tim Hardaway Jr on the final play of Detroit’s 94-93 playoff loss to the Knicks on Sunday.
