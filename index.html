          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union met in London to announce a new deal intended to strengthen trade and defense ties, signaling a reset in relations after Brexit. The agreement includes a defense and security partnership, extended access to fishing waters for European boats until 2038, and discussions on trade and geopolitical collaboration. The summit addresses the need for both Europe and Britain to reorient themselves in a world where the United States is perceived as a less reliable ally. The deal also aims to facilitate youth mobility and cooperation on irregular migration, marking a significant step towards a more collaborative post-Brexit future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, faced public backlash after stating he doesn't need to buy rice because he receives it from supporters, a comment viewed as out-of-touch given the soaring rice prices affecting households. The remarks surfaced amidst criticism of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government for its handling of the rice market, where average prices have doubled. Eto's statement has been described as distasteful and lacking common sense by the public, particularly those struggling with rising food costs. The minister has since expressed regret for his comments, but faces calls for his replacement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 05:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reversing course on Medicaid's expansion into social services, arguing that government health insurance shouldn't fund housing, nutrition, and other non-traditional benefits. This decision has thrown states that expanded their Medicaid programs into disarray, with leaders from both parties worried about the impact on investments already underway. Health experts warn that the disinvestment will lead to more death, suffering, and higher health care costs, as social factors like homelessness and food insecurity significantly impact health outcomes. While some evidence supports social investments by Medicaid, the Trump administration is signaling a shift towards more conservative approaches.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest Beijing may not implement aggressive fiscal stimulus measures in the coming quarter due to China's economic resilience against US tariffs. April's macroeconomic data indicates that the Chinese economy is holding steady. Investment banks have already raised their growth outlook for China after a tariff truce with the United States and supportive policies from China's central bank. China's industrial output and retail sales grew more than expected, while exports also beat market expectations despite tariffs from the US.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office.

While the cancer is Stage 4, doctors believe it is hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management.

          <p>As Britain and the European Union hold their first summit since Brexit, analysts describe the relationship as less of a reconciliation and more of a pragmatic collaboration due to shared interests. While a majority of Britons now believe leaving the EU was a mistake, there's little appetite for reversing the decision. The summit focuses on smaller-scale issues like fishing rights and youth mobility, with larger topics like the single market and freedom of movement remaining off the table. The war in Ukraine and the Trump administration's approach to global affairs have underscored the need for renewed ties.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) opened its annual meeting facing a significant crisis due to funding cuts from the Trump administration and other Western donors. The cuts have impacted the WHO's ability to carry out its mandate, from recommending sugar reductions to leading global responses to pandemics. Member countries are expected to agree to raise annual dues and approve a pandemic treaty to strengthen WHO's finances and improve pandemic preparedness. The treaty aims to guarantee access to tests, medicines, and vaccines for countries sharing critical virus samples.</p>

A bill in Congress that would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent is adding to concerns about the fiscal deficit. Moody's cited the legislation and broader concerns about growing debt costs in its downgrade. U.S. stock futures indicate markets will decline, while the dollar weakens and gold rises.

          <p>President Trump is seeking a comprehensive 'one-stop shopping' deal with South Korea that combines trade, tariffs, and defense cost-sharing. Trump has repeatedly raised the issue of South Korea paying for the military protection provided by the U.S., which maintains approximately 28,500 troops in the country. While South Korean officials have indicated defense payments are off the table, Trump is likely to bring the issue up in trade talks. Analysts suggest South Korea could increase investment in its own forces and buy more U.S. military equipment as a way to 'pay more'.</p>
