          <p>Doctors Without Borders (MSF) reported that a hospital and market in South Sudan were bombed, resulting in at least seven fatalities and twenty injuries, raising fears of a return to civil war. Helicopter gunships targeted the pharmacy of the MSF-run hospital in Old Fangak, Jonglei state, before firing on the town for thirty minutes. A drone subsequently bombed a local market, according to MSF, destroying medical supplies at the only hospital serving over 110,000 people. The UN has warned that the country is teetering on the brink of full-scale civil war amid escalating tensions between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious in a Miami Grand Prix sprint race marked by wet-dry conditions and a safety car intervention. Oscar Piastri initially led after overtaking Kimi Antonelli, but the safety car period allowed Norris to pit for slick tires and gain the lead. Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson's crash triggered the safety car, adding to the race's drama. Max Verstappen finished fourth but was penalized for an unsafe pit release, which damaged his front wing and demoted him to last place.

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Dr. Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist, discusses the under-advertised challenges of antidepressant use, including sexual side effects and severe withdrawal symptoms. He notes the medical community's alarm over claims likening antidepressants to heroin, while acknowledging that some patients feel validated by such comments due to their own difficult experiences. The article highlights the lack of research on safely tapering patients off antidepressants, leading many to seek guidance in online communities. Dr. Aftab calls for more research and transparency regarding the benefits and trade-offs of psychiatric medications, cautioning against disregarding patients' concerns and leaving the conversation to those who might exploit their suffering.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, is facing economic uncertainty due to decreased consumer sentiment, with customers sharing meals and reducing orders. Consumer confidence has dropped to levels not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting restaurant traffic. The diner has paused expansion plans, and retaining staff is challenging due to the gig economy's flexibility. While food prices have remained relatively steady, companies are grappling with rising costs and tariffs, leading to potential price increases and reduced investments. Despite the challenges, the diner remains a community gathering place, supported by loyal customers.</p>

The AfD has been designated as a "confirmed rightwing extremist" force by Germany’s domestic intelligence service due to its xenophobic stances and incompatibility with the country's democratic order.

          <p>Mali's military junta intends to prolong its rule for at least another five years, without organizing elections and restricting the number of political parties, a move the opposition denounces as an attack on democracy. General Assimi Goita, the current interim president, has secured support from key allies to remain president until 2030. A "national conference" organized by the regime proposed dissolving the 2005 Political Parties Charter and limiting the number of permitted parties to five.

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. Ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, these tariffs follow earlier levies on imported cars. The tariffs affect even domestically made cars, as they often include foreign-made components. While parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt under certain trade agreement conditions, the policy is expected to increase costs for consumers and create uncertainty for automakers and suppliers. The administration claims the tariffs will incentivize domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign automobiles and parts.</p>

Albanese accused Dutton of mimicking U.S. President Trump's divisive tactics, while also highlighting his government's improved relations with China. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Albanese on his re-election, underscoring the enduring alliance between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP), which has governed since 1959, won another sweeping victory in the general elections, securing 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats.

The PAP's strong showing represents an improvement compared to the 2020 election, strengthening Wong's position amid economic uncertainty. The opposition Workers Party won 10 seats, but the election was largely dominated by the PAP, which has steered the island to prosperity while also being accused of suppressing dissent.</p>
