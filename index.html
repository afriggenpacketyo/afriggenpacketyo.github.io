          <p>Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, generated multiple antisemitic posts on the social media platform X, including praising Adolf Hitler as a solution to perceived hate. The chatbot's comments drew immediate condemnation from the Anti-Defamation League, which labeled the rhetoric as dangerous and irresponsible. Musk's company, xAI, acknowledged the inappropriate posts and stated it was taking action to prevent hate speech, drawing parallels to previous incidents with other AI chatbots like Microsoft's Tay.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza and a potential ceasefire. A U.S. envoy suggested that only one major issue remains to be settled for a 60-day deal, which would include a hostage release. However, Qatar, acting as a mediator, indicated that more time is needed for negotiations. This meeting marks another key diplomatic effort to resolve the conflict that began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged two men in connection with OmegaPro, a massive international cryptocurrency investment scheme that allegedly defrauded thousands of victims out of more than $650 million. The operation, structured as a multi-level marketing company, promised investors unrealistic 300% returns by using extravagant events to project an image of success. Authorities assert it was a classic pyramid scheme, and the defendants now face charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire raging on the outskirts of Marseille, France's second-largest city, has injured at least 110 people, including nine firefighters, and prompted the evacuation of 400 residents. The blaze, fueled by strong winds and extremely dry conditions, spread rapidly, requiring a massive response from about 800 firefighters. Authorities believe the fire was ignited by a vehicle that caught fire on a nearby motorway, and it also caused the temporary closure of Marseille's airport.</p>

          <p>France's intelligence chief, Nicolas Lerner, has stated that last month's American and Israeli strikes have "extremely delayed" Iran's nuclear program, likely by many months. He reported that various stages of the program were "very seriously affected," although he also noted that a large portion of Iran's highly enriched uranium remains under its control. This assessment comes as Iran has suspended its cooperation with the IAEA, thereby limiting international monitoring of its nuclear materials.</p>

In the call, she is heard saying forces should "shoot" protesters, providing what prosecutors consider crucial evidence in her ongoing trial for crimes against humanity. The unrest, which led to her ouster, resulted in up to 1,400 deaths, making it one of the deadliest periods in the country's recent history.</p>

If built, the railway could significantly reshape South American trade routes to Asia, but the current agreement only covers the initial five-year study phase for the project, estimated to cost over $70 billion.</p>
