          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland to El Salvador, is on his way back to the United States to face criminal charges. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for allegedly participating in a conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants within the U.S. The indictment alleges a years-long operation involving the transport of thousands of non-citizens, including some children and MS-13 members, from Texas to the interior of the country. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues the government is abusing its power by prosecuting him after initially deporting him in error, violating a 2019 court order. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is grappling with nearly 20% vacancy rates in its human food inspection divisions, a situation exacerbated by cost-cutting measures and a hiring freeze implemented by the Trump administration. These staffing gaps are raising concerns about the agency's ability to fulfill its public health mission and meet inspection obligations. While the FDA claims it is still meeting mandated timeframes, officials express worries about worsening attrition and reduced inspectional capacity. The agency needs to increase inspections to meet its goals, but is facing obstacles in recruiting and retaining qualified investigators.</p>

Analysts suggest that Tesla's investor base is largely unaffected by the drama. Reports of a potential truce brokered by Trump circulated, but a White House official denied any interest in a call with Musk. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures.</p>

          <p>The First Liberty Institute, a legal organization focused on religious freedom, is celebrating the Supreme Court's unanimous decision in favor of the Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB). The ruling struck down Wisconsin's attempt to deny a religious tax exemption to CCB because it doesn't proselytize or serve only Catholics. The court affirmed that the government cannot decide what it means to be religious, preventing government overreach into religious life. The institute believes this decision has far-reaching implications, protecting religious charities and ministries nationwide and preventing the government from intruding on religious doctrine.</p>

Her comments were deemed ignorant and hateful by fellow members of Congress, who defended religious freedom and diversity.

          <p>This opinion piece discusses the anti-managerialism driving the Trump administration's policies, particularly those enacted by the Department of Government Efficiency. The author argues that this movement, aimed at dismantling the "tyranny of the bureaucracy," is rooted in the belief that a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats has usurped democracy. The essay explores how this anti-managerial revolution seeks to roll back bureaucratic control and transform institutions from government to corporations.</p>
