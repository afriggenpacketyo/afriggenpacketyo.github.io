          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, was convicted of depraved-heart murder after providing his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthetics like ketamine and propofol, ultimately leading to her death. The article details how Ryan, who had been observing Harris since she was 14, initiated a romantic relationship with her after she became his patient for wisdom teeth removal. He then allegedly supplied her with drugs, leading to her chemical dependency and eventual overdose. The case hinged on incriminating texts and photos recovered by Harris's sister, Rachel, which revealed Ryan's control over Harris and his reckless disregard for her life, resulting in a 45-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. remained at 6.76% for the second consecutive week, close to its highest levels for the year, but still lower than the 7.09% rate from a year prior. The article notes that mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. High mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster start to the spring home-buying season.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, falling to $26 billion due to lower oil prices and production. While the figure slightly exceeded analyst expectations, it reflects ongoing pressure on the company's balance sheet as crude prices remain subdued and global demand slows. Aramco's free cash flow also decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, while the base dividend increased by 4.2% to $21.1 billion. The company reduced its performance-linked dividend payout for both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 to $200 million.</p>
