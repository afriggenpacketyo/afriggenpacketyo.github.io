          <p>Florida Democratic lawmaker Joe Casello has passed away at the age of 73 following a heart attack. First elected in 2018, Casello represented a district in Boynton Beach and had previously served as a firefighter for three decades in Massachusetts. His death creates a vacancy in the state legislature, which by law requires Governor Ron DeSantis to call a special election to fill the seat. Casello was reportedly surrounded by family at the time of his death.</p>

The Los Angeles Police Department stated the driver made a U-turn before accelerating into the line of people waiting to enter the venue. In the chaotic aftermath, bystanders reportedly attacked the driver, who was also shot by an unidentified individual before being taken into custody by police. The incident prompted a massive emergency response involving over 120 firefighters.</p>

          <p>Former professional wrestling star Marcus "Buff" Bagwell has had his right leg amputated above the knee. The surgery was necessary due to complications from injuries sustained in a 2020 car accident that never properly healed. Bagwell, 55, was a prominent figure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) during the 1990s, where he was a five-time tag-team champion. The wrestling community has expressed an outpouring of support for him following the news of his difficult health battle.</p>

          <p>Germany is deepening its security and defense cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new trilateral partnership often referred to as the "E3." This strategic pivot aims to create a stronger, more independent European defense posture in response to the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty regarding future US commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's recent diplomatic efforts, including a new bilateral treaty with the UK, underscore a significant shift towards European-led security initiatives, though they are not intended to fully replace the US defense guarantee.</p>

          <p>Andy Byron, the CEO of technology company Astronomer, has resigned after a video of him embracing the firm's chief people officer at a Coldplay concert went viral. The clip, which showed the pair on a large screen before they quickly hid from the camera, prompted the company to launch a formal investigation. In a statement, Astronomer confirmed the resignation and emphasized that its leaders are expected to meet a high standard of conduct and accountability. The company, which recently secured a $93 million investment round, will now begin its search for a new chief executive.</p>

          <p>Reports from Ukraine indicate that individuals with documented, incurable psychiatric conditions are being drafted into the military and found fit for service. This issue stems from gaps in the medical information system and military doctors' distrust of documentation, as some men attempt to fake disorders to evade conscription. Human rights advocates and some military commanders express concern that this practice endangers not only the draftees but also their entire units. The situation highlights a systemic problem within Ukraine's mobilization efforts during the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Ashley Kaye, a 36-year-old who quit her job and now lives and travels full-time in a custom-renovated Toyota Tacoma truck. After selling her house, she invested over $50,000 to make the vehicle a livable camper and is currently journeying along the Pan-American highway. Her monthly expenses average around $1,305, covering essentials like gas and food, allowing her to pursue a self-reliant and adventurous lifestyle. While she enjoys the freedom, she notes the logistical challenges of solo travel and constant border crossings.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right nationalist parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These parties are fanning concerns over the impacts of mass tourism, fueled by a weak yen, and are highlighting media reports of crimes committed by foreigners. While defenders of immigration point to Japan's severe labor shortages, nationalist leaders argue against relying on foreign workers and advocate for a "Japanese First" policy. This trend reflects a broader rise in nationalist politics seen in other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>Police investigating the 2024 murder of 15-year-old Rene Graham have released new CCTV footage of a suspect.

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the 2024 building collapse in George, which killed 34 construction workers, was "entirely preventable." The investigation found that numerous red flags, including the use of substandard materials and visible structural cracks, were ignored for up to a year before the disaster. Workers had reported feeling vibrations, and a safety officer had resigned in protest, yet construction continued. The public works minister has called for criminal accountability for those found to be negligent in the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A pregnant stay-at-home mom called into "The Ramsey Show" for financial advice, revealing that her family struggles to afford groceries despite a $156,000 household income. She explained that her husband spends hundreds of dollars monthly on tobacco and marijuana, with usage increasing recently. Host Dave Ramsey shifted the focus from a simple budgeting problem to a potential addiction and money control issue. He challenged the caller to treat the situation with the seriousness of an addiction rather than as a budget line item. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is progressing well in his recovery from a left knee bone bruise and is expected to return sooner than initially anticipated. Doctors informed Muncy that he was extremely lucky to have avoided a more severe, season-ending injury, as the impact missed critical ligaments by a fraction of a second. Muncy has already begun running and swinging a bat, reporting no pain and feeling that he is in a "really good spot." His return is crucial for the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled in his absence.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, the British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 World Championships has finally been presented with their gold medals. The ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, where the team was elevated from silver after the original winners, the USA, were disqualified. The disqualification came after US team member Antonio Pettigrew confessed in 2008 to doping during that period. The belated ceremony provided a moment of recognition for the British athletes in front of a large home crowd.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court justices, escalating a campaign in support of former president Jair Bolsonaro. This action follows a court ruling that Bolsonaro must wear an electronic tag as he awaits a verdict on charges of plotting a coup. The move, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has been fiercely condemned by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as unacceptable interference in Brazil's justice system and a violation of national sovereignty.</p>
