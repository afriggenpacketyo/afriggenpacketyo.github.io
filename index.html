          <p>A man suspected of fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounding Senator John Hoffman and his wife, has been apprehended near his farm in Green Isle, Minnesota, concluding a nearly two-day manhunt. The suspect, Vance Boelter, allegedly posed as a police officer to gain entry to the lawmakers' homes, and a target list of dozens of Minnesota Democrats, including Governor Tim Walz and U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, was found in his vehicle. Police found a hat associated with the suspect near his vehicle, which led them to believe he was in the area. The FBI was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Boelter's arrest. Optimism remains low given the severity of the situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump commented on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, stating that "sometimes they have to fight it out," as European leaders gather at the G7 summit to discuss his Iran strategy. Trump predicted "peace soon" between the two nations, echoing his earlier claim of being able to stop the Russia-Ukraine war in "24 hours." The conflict has led to the cancellation of planned US talks with Iran on its civil nuclear program, which were scheduled for Sunday, and Trump stated that he hopes there will be a deal. Trump's comments suggest a hands-off approach to the situation, which is concerning.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones, citing concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstructed natural light. Several projects have been scrapped due to local opposition, prompting industry groups to work on improving relations between residents and tech companies. Municipalities are beginning to implement regulations, such as requiring early construction announcements and clear indication of heat-emitting units, as demand for data handling continues to surge.

          <p>China's retail sales in May experienced their fastest growth since late 2023, increasing by 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates and accelerating from the previous month, boosted by extended holidays and the consumer goods trade-in program. However, industrial output growth slowed to 5.8%, and fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7%, falling short of expectations, while property investment continued to contract. The urban survey-based unemployment rate eased to 5.0%, the lowest since November. Despite the positive retail sales figures, falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment.

          <p>The Dodgers secured a series victory against the Giants after a pregame trade that involved the Giants sending pitcher Kyle Harrison to the Red Sox for infielder Rafael Devers. The trade disrupted the Giants' pitching plans, forcing them to use long reliever Sean Hjelle as the starter. The Dodgers' offense capitalized, with Tommy Edman and Andy Pages hitting home runs to secure a 5-4 victory. The win extends the Dodgers' lead over the Giants in the NL West standings, while Ohtani is set to start against the Padres on Monday.</p>

Researchers have extended the lifespan of PeLEDs to over 20 years at a brightness comparable to commercial displays. The team's PeLEDs reached a brightness of 1.16 million nits, far exceeding the brightest commercial display screens.

          <p>President Trump has claimed that more than $12 trillion has been "practically committed" to US business investment under his administration, but the BBC examines whether this figure is accurate. Government statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest that Trump's impact on investment is more incremental than claimed, with uncertainty potentially pausing business spending. While some companies have announced investment plans, many were already in the works or include items not traditionally considered investments. The BBC's analysis suggests that new investment stemming from these announcements is closer to $134 billion, far short of Trump's claims.</p>

          <p>President Trump reportedly advised Israel against assassinating Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to three U.S. officials, with one official stating that Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that killing Khamenei was "not a good idea." The conversation is said to have occurred since Israel launched its attack on Iran. While Netanyahu did not confirm or deny the report, he stated that Israel will do what it needs to do. The report comes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with both countries launching strikes at each other.</p>
