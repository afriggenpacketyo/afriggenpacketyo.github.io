          <p>A federal appeals court in New York has affirmed the $83.3 million judgment against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019. The court rejected Trump's claims of presidential immunity, stating he failed to provide any new grounds for reconsideration of their prior holding. The ruling concludes that the original trial was conducted without error and that the jury's damages award was both fair and reasonable given the circumstances of the case. This decision solidifies a significant legal defeat for the former president related to Carroll's allegations of sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>Manchester City Football Club and the Premier League have reached a settlement regarding the rules governing commercial and sponsorship deals. The club had initiated a legal challenge against the league's Associated Party Transaction (APT) regulations, claiming they were unlawful.

Both parties have agreed not to comment further on the matter, concluding the dispute over financial governance within the league.</p>

          <p>The new UK Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has indicated that the government may suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with deals to return their own citizens. This potential policy aims to pressure nations into accepting migrants who have no legal right to remain in the UK. The announcement came during a meeting of the 'Five Eyes' intelligence alliance, as the government faces pressure over a 37% year-over-year increase in small boat crossings. The strategy reflects a more transactional approach to foreign relations and border security, though no specific countries have been named yet.</p>

Hayes described his scars as a "daily reminder" of the July 2024 event where three young girls were murdered at a dance studio. The inquiry also heard from mothers of surviving children, who spoke of the lasting psychological trauma and the "lifetime of scars that you cannot see." The proceedings aim to examine the killer's history and any missed opportunities by relevant agencies to prevent the tragedy.</p>

          <p>After a six-year development period marked by intense fan anticipation and online speculation, the video game 'Hollow Knight: Silksong' has finally been released to widespread critical praise. The article details the fervent online culture that grew around the game's prolonged absence, which only amplified its eventual launch. The sequel to the 2017 hit 'Hollow Knight,' 'Silksong' is described as a mercilessly difficult but fair game with deep exploration and a unique, devotional atmosphere.

          <p>At least 19 people have been killed and many more injured in Nepal during widespread demonstrations against government corruption and a recent ban on major social media platforms. Protests erupted in Kathmandu and other cities after the government blocked access to sites like Facebook and X for failing to register with local authorities. While the government claims the ban is to regulate fake news and hate speech, demonstrators see it as an authoritarian move to silence dissent. The protests reflect broader public anger over the government's failure to address longstanding economic issues and perceived rampant corruption.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated a separation of powers dispute to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid funding. The request seeks to halt a lower court's order that compelled the administration to spend over $4 billion appropriated by Congress for foreign assistance programs. The administration is attempting to withhold these funds through a rare maneuver known as a pocket rescission. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court's injunction poses a "grave and urgent threat" to the executive branch's authority in foreign affairs.</p>

Key strategies include creating a detailed seasonal budget by reviewing past expenses and separating needs from wants. Another effective method is to use debit or cash for non-essential purchases to create a stronger emotional connection to the money being spent. Experts also recommend removing saved credit card information from online shopping accounts to add friction to impulse buys and setting up transaction alerts to track spending in real-time.</p>

          <p>According to a communication expert, the key to being highly likable is not about being overly agreeable but about making others feel seen and valued. This is achieved through small, consistent habits that demonstrate genuine interest and respect. These habits include remembering small personal details about others, freely giving credit to colleagues for their ideas, and responding to everyone regardless of their status. Additionally, likable people readily admit when they are wrong, which builds trust, and they make time for seemingly unimportant conversations, which humanizes them and strengthens relationships over time.</p>

Although some AI-driven layoffs have occurred, they have been largely concentrated within the tech sector itself, which constitutes a small fraction of the total U.S. workforce.

The Trump administration's decision to raise tariffs on Indian goods has prompted New Delhi to pursue a policy of "multi-alignment" and strategic autonomy. Foreign policy experts note that India is not abandoning its partnership with Washington but is hedging its bets to navigate an unstable global landscape. This diplomatic maneuvering aims to protect India's interests while leveraging its position between competing geopolitical blocs.</p>

          <p>On the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death, the Prince and Princess of Wales attended a Women's Institute event to honor the late monarch's long association with the organization. Prince William remarked that it was a "huge honour" and shared memories of his grandmother. Meanwhile, Prince Harry, who has returned to the UK from California, privately laid a wreath at the late Queen's burial site in Windsor. His visit includes several planned engagements for charities this week, though it is unclear if he will meet with his father, King Charles, during his time in the country.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a busy bus stop in Jerusalem has left six people dead and eight others wounded in one of the city's deadliest attacks in recent years. Israeli police reported that two gunmen arrived in a vehicle and opened fire on civilians before being "neutralized" by an off-duty soldier and an armed civilian at the scene. While no group immediately claimed responsibility, Hamas praised the attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel is in an "intense war against terrorism" and that security forces would pursue anyone involved in planning the assault.</p>

          <p>A small group of dedicated Scotland football fans traveled over 800 miles to Zalaegerszeg, Hungary, for a World Cup qualifier against Belarus, despite knowing the match would be played behind closed doors. Belarus is currently banned by UEFA from hosting games in its own country and must play at neutral venues without spectators due to its government's support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The fans, who traveled from Copenhagen, explained their philosophy that the social aspect of supporting their team is often the best part of the trip, even if they cannot watch the game in person.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comparison of monthly running costs reveals that charging a Tesla electric vehicle at home is more economical than buying gasoline for a Honda CR-V Hybrid. Based on average American driving distances and current energy prices, charging a Tesla costs approximately $50.75 per month, while fueling the CR-V Hybrid costs around $81.20. The primary reason for the difference is the higher energy efficiency of electric motors compared to internal combustion engines. While public fast-charging can be more expensive, the analysis highlights the potential savings for EV owners who primarily charge their vehicles at home.</p>

          <p>A proposed $6.2 billion acquisition of Minnesota Power's parent company by a BlackRock division is facing opposition from environmental and consumer advocates. Critics warn that the private equity takeover could lead to significant utility rate increases for the utility's 150,000 customers to prioritize investor profits. Despite the firm's commitments to a temporary rate freeze and green energy investment, opponents argue these measures are insufficient and non-binding. An administrative law judge has already recommended that state regulators reject the deal, citing risks of "significant rate increases" and questioning the firm's commitment to decarbonization.</p>

Prosecutors allege Routh planned the attack for weeks, aiming a rifle at Trump before being spotted by a Secret Service agent.

The project has gained urgency for Russia following Western sanctions over the Ukraine war, as it seeks to redirect its gas exports to Asian markets. However, unresolved issues over pricing and the pipeline's route continue to delay a final agreement.</p>

After the immense success of her 1997 Booker Prize-winning novel 'The God of Small Things,' Roy pivoted to writing critical essays on Indian politics, imperialism, and social justice. She describes this shift as an escape from the "gilded cage" of literary fame and a necessary response to rising Hindu nationalism in India. The memoir frames her life as a series of escapes, beginning with a flight from a difficult childhood, leading to her current status as a prominent dissident.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), set to be commissioned on September 9, is Africa's largest hydroelectric project and is expected to double the country's electricity output. The nearly $5 billion project was funded primarily through domestic sources like government bonds and public donations after international lenders withheld support due to its geopolitical sensitivity. Downstream nations Egypt and Sudan strongly oppose the dam, fearing it will severely reduce their access to the Nile's water, upon which they are heavily dependent. Despite years of negotiations, no water-sharing agreement has been reached between the three countries.</p>
