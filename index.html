        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that many tariffs imposed by President Trump exceed his authority under federal emergency laws, dealing a significant blow to his trade strategy. While the decision does not immediately block the tariffs, it vacates a lower court's universal injunction and directs a reevaluation. The Trump administration has vowed to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, arguing it undermines presidential power in foreign policy and harms the nation's economy. This legal challenge was brought by Democratic states and small businesses.</p>

          <p>Florida has scheduled the September 30 execution of Victor Tony Jones, who was convicted of fatally stabbing a married couple during a 1990 robbery. This marks the state's 13th scheduled execution of the year, extending a record number since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The state has executed more people this year than any other, surpassing its previous annual record of eight. Jones's legal team is expected to file appeals with both the Florida and U.S. Supreme Courts to block the execution.</p>

          <p>Charles Borges, the Chief Data Officer at the Social Security Administration, has resigned after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging that employees from the Department of Government Efficiency uploaded the entire country's Social Security data to a "vulnerable cloud environment." The SSA refutes the claim, stating the data was secure and "walled off" from the internet. Borges cited retaliation and a hostile work environment as reasons for his "constructive discharge," making it impossible to perform his duties ethically. His legal representatives confirmed he will continue to work with oversight bodies.</p>

Investment directors suggest that the rally could be sustained by overseas investors returning and domestic investors shifting from low-yield, fixed-income products. Key drivers for potential growth include Beijing's focus on technological innovation in sectors like advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics, which are seen as undervalued investment opportunities.

          <p>Data obtained by the BBC reveals that live-fire military exercises have caused 385 wildfires on Ministry of Defence land in the UK since January 2023. Firefighting efforts are often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance, some dating back to World War II, making it too dangerous for crews to access impact zones. Residents near training sites like Salisbury Plain have raised concerns about health risks from smoke and environmental damage. The MoD states it has a robust policy to monitor risks and limit live ammunition use during dry periods.</p>

          <p>Omar Torres, a former city councilman for San Jose, has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for sexually abusing an underage family member. The assaults occurred over several years beginning in the late 1990s. Torres pleaded no contest to charges including forcible sodomy and molestation of a child under 14. The district attorney's office praised the victim's courage for coming forward and emphasized that the sentence demonstrates that no one is above the law.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the administration likely acted unlawfully and that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the authority to terminate the program. The court emphasized that Congress designed TPS to be insulated from electoral politics to provide stability for recipients. The Department of Homeland Security condemned the decision, vowing to explore all legal options to end the program.</p>

The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker for deflecting from the city's crime issues.

          <p>The White House announced President Trump has canceled $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that had already been approved by Congress. The president used a rare "pocket rescission" procedure to withhold funds for 15 international programs, bypassing the normal legislative process as the fiscal year nears its end. The move has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, who argue it is an illegal violation of Congress's power to allocate spending. The cuts will primarily affect USAID projects and UN peacekeeping missions, raising concerns about a potential government shutdown during future budget negotiations.</p>

Experts recommend starting with behavioral therapy, as stimulant medications can have side effects like irritability and may lead to treatment failure if families find the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.</p>

          <p>Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again, just months after a previous reorganization. The airline plans to continue normal operations during the restructuring, honoring tickets and loyalty points while paying employees. Citing "adverse market conditions" such as weak demand for domestic leisure travel, the company stated that its first bankruptcy did not sufficiently address its financial challenges. Spirit has struggled with rising operational costs and debt since the pandemic, leading to pilot furloughs and other cost-cutting measures that have proven inadequate.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional map in a move designed to favor the GOP. This action follows a public request from President Trump, who is encouraging Republican-led states to gerrymander districts to secure a stronger House majority in the upcoming midterm elections. The proposed new map could target the district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver in the Kansas City area, potentially flipping a seat. The move is part of a national trend, with states like Texas and California also engaging in mid-decade redistricting battles.</p>

          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was granted to the local council, which argued the hotel's owner breached planning rules. However, the appellate court found the original ruling "seriously flawed," stating it failed to consider the difficulty of relocating the migrants. The decision comes after months of protests and counter-demonstrations outside the hotel, which the court worried could be encouraged by such legal actions, risking "further lawlessness."</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has addressed the backlash surrounding the original cover art for her album "Man's Best Friend," which depicted her on her knees at a man's feet. In a recent interview, Carpenter said she was shocked by the controversy, as the image was not a point of concern among her inner circle. She explained her artistic interpretation of the cover relates to being "in on the control" and exploring the dynamics of power and submission. Amid the debate, Carpenter released an alternative, more subdued album cover she humorously noted was "approved by God."</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new congressional map, signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, which is designed to increase the Republican delegation by five seats. The mid-decade redistricting plan heavily relies on the GOP's recent inroads with Hispanic voters, as four of the new districts are Hispanic-majority. This strategy is a significant gamble for Republicans, who hope to solidify their support within the state's largest demographic group ahead of the midterm elections. However, some polls suggest Latino voters may be shifting away from the GOP due to economic concerns and immigration policies, making the outcome uncertain.</p>

          <p>Following a decisive third-round loss to Elena Rybakina at the US Open, British tennis player Emma Raducanu suggested that the world's top players have a "point to prove" when they face her. Her four defeats at this year's major tournaments have all been against elite opponents. Raducanu is focusing on closing the gap by working with her new coach, Francisco Roig, who previously coached Rafael Nadal. She aims to improve her serve and her readiness for fast returns, planning to compete in the upcoming Asian hard-court swing to build momentum and improve her ranking.</p>

          <p>Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic state representative from Pennsylvania, is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The march is a protest against severe budget cuts to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which he attributes to Republican inaction in the legislature. Kenyatta aims to draw attention to the impact of the service cuts on students, workers, and the elderly. He described his protest as part of a "time honoured American tradition of marching" to fight for the needs of working people.</p>

Longoria's attorneys claim he drove away in fear after masked officers shattered his window, and that surveillance video contradicts the official account that he tried to run them down. His lawyers condemned the pre-dawn raid on his home as an act of intimidation for speaking out. Longoria has been released on bond but is now in ICE custody due to his immigration status.</p>

Activists cite a growing "urban war" over space, as locals are forced to move to the city's outskirts. While President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned some protest actions as "xenophobic," the city's mayor has unveiled a plan to regulate rent prices and protect residents.</p>

          <p>It was a difficult day for American men's tennis at the US Open, as two of its top contenders were eliminated in the third round. No. 6 seed Ben Shelton was forced to retire from his match with a shoulder injury, the first retirement of his career, while leading by two sets to one. Shortly after, Frances Tiafoe, a two-time semifinalist in New York, was upset in straight sets by German qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff. The dual losses leave only Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul as the remaining American men in the singles draw, narrowing the chances of ending the country's 22-year Grand Slam title drought.</p>
