          <p>A man in Boulder, Colorado, attacked a peaceful rally honoring Israeli hostages, injuring eight people using a "makeshift flamethrower" and yelling "Free Palestine." The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism, citing witnesses and the targeted nature of the violence. The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, sustained injuries from minor to very serious, with some requiring hospitalization and airlift to a burn unit. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is in custody and faces a $10,000,000 bond, along with a range of felony charges including the use of an incendiary device.</p>

          <p>Iran intends to reject the United States' proposal for a nuclear agreement, deeming it "not balanced" and favoring U.S. and Israeli interests. The diplomatic source claims the proposal is "totally one-sided" and a "non-starter", after negotiations began in April. The U.S. administration under President Trump has been pressing Iran to halt uranium enrichment, seeking a new deal after withdrawing from the 2018 agreement with six major powers. Despite ongoing indirect talks, differences remain, and Israel is reportedly considering attacking Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled a significant overhaul of the U.K.'s defense spending, cautioning the nation about the potential for "war in Europe." The strategic defense review includes plans to construct 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines, increase drone, missile, and munition production, and enhance cyber warfare capabilities. Defense spending is projected to rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with an aspiration to reach 3% by 2034, contingent on economic conditions. While NATO aims for members to spend 5% of GDP on defense by 2032, some analysts suggest the U.K.'s plans may be insufficient given current fiscal constraints.</p>

          <p>Negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza have reached a standstill due to a long-standing dispute between Hamas and Israel.

          <p>An Indian national was arrested at Mumbai airport for attempting to smuggle dozens of venomous vipers and other reptiles from Thailand.

Mumbai Customs released images of the seized snakes, highlighting the unusual nature of the seizure, which typically involves gold, cash, or drugs.

China's Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng dismissed the U.S. remarks as "groundless accusations," and China's Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific.

Deep funding cuts, staffing reductions, and threats of extinction are weakening these institutions, making the public more susceptible to manipulation. By diminishing access to natural beauty, literature, and the arts, the administration seeks to create a more divided and less enlightened electorate.

          <p>A Swedish commission has recommended ending international adoptions following the discovery of widespread abuse and fraud spanning several decades. The investigation revealed cases of child trafficking, adoptions without parental consent, and false declarations of death. The Swedish government was reportedly aware of these issues early on, but prioritized facilitating adoptions from abroad. The commission has urged the government to issue a formal apology to adoptees and their families, while emphasizing the need to raise awareness about the violations.</p>

          <p>Nottinghamshire Police have launched a corporate manslaughter investigation into failings at Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, which led to hundreds of baby deaths and injuries. The investigation will examine whether maternity care provided by the trust was grossly negligent, focusing on two maternity units. This follows a large-scale independent inquiry examining approximately 2,500 cases of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, and harm to mothers and babies. The announcement comes after the trust was fined Â£1.6 million for avoidable failings connected to the deaths of three babies in 2021.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize its flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times, fewer delays, and more flights. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes over UK airspace, many of which were established 70 years ago. The initial focus will be on modernizing airspace in and around London, with changes expected to be implemented in the 2030s. The government says these changes will also reduce aviation's climate change impacts and enable new technologies such as flying taxis, though some worry about increased noise pollution.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales experienced a sharp decline in several European markets in May, marking a fifth consecutive monthly decrease attributed to CEO Elon Musk's political activities and an outdated model lineup. However, Norway saw a significant increase in sales due to the delivery of revamped Model Ys. In Sweden and Portugal, Tesla's sales plummeted, while overall EV sales in those markets rose. Tesla is offering financial incentives in several countries to stimulate demand, but analysts suggest the company needs to innovate to maintain its competitive edge.</p>

          <p>Maintaining a romantic relationship requires effort from both parties, but determining when that effort becomes excessive is challenging. While research suggests that couples who invest effort in their relationships are happier, that effort should not come at the expense of mental and physical health. Relationships require cooperation, communication, and a willingness to address conflicts, but it is essential to recognize when a partnership is no longer a good fit. Couples who are intentional about showing compassion, spending time together, and being kind to one another are more likely to have successful marriages.</p>
