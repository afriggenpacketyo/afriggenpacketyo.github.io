        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ABC News has decided not to renew its contract with correspondent Terry Moran after he posted a critical message on X about President Donald Trump and advisor Stephen Miller, which the network deemed a violation of its policies. Moran's post labeled Trump and Miller as "world-class haters," with specific criticism aimed at Miller's perceived capacity for hatred. The White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the post "unhinged and unacceptable," and Vice President JD Vance described it as "dripping with hatred." This decision underscores ABC News' commitment to objectivity, fairness, and professionalism in journalism, though the loss of Moran may impact its coverage. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to their "repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities" in the occupied West Bank, mirroring similar actions by Norway, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The sanctions include a ban from entering the UK and a freeze on any UK-based assets. Foreign Secretary David Lammy accused the ministers of inciting extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights, prompting an outraged response from Israel. The UK's decision reflects growing international concern over rising violence and intimidation by Israeli settlers against Palestinian communities, which undermines prospects for a future Palestinian state. The move also comes amid escalating tensions between the UK and Israel over operations in Gaza and the West Bank. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to swiftly block President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles, citing concerns over state sovereignty and increased civil unrest. Attorney General Rob Bonta argued that the deployment poses imminent harm to the state and escalates tensions, while Trump's lawyers countered that the request is legally meritless and jeopardizes the safety of Homeland Security personnel. Newsom's lawsuit claims Trump broke the law by federalizing the California National Guard without his consent and that the action is unwarranted. Trump defended his decision by claiming Los Angeles would be "burning" without federal intervention, referencing past wildfires in the city. </p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, including shifting production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox from Mexico to the United States. This move comes as President Donald Trump's administration has implemented tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. GM's investment will also involve converting an idled plant in Michigan to produce gas-powered vehicles, a change from previous plans to manufacture all-electric trucks there. CEO Mary Barra stated that the investment demonstrates GM's commitment to American innovation and manufacturing, aiming to provide customers with a broad range of vehicle choices. </p>

          <p>A majority of House Democrats voted against a bill to prohibit non-U.S. citizens from voting in Washington, D.C. elections, highlighting a divide within the party on the issue. The bill, led by Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, passed with support from 56 Democrats, raising concerns among Republicans about potential foreign influence in local elections. D.C.â€™s city council passed a measure in 2022 allowing non-citizens who have lived in the district for at least 30 days to vote in local elections and hold local office. Progressive Democrats like Rep. Maxwell Frost argue that the bill is an attempt to demonize immigrants and undermine D.C.'s home rule, while Republicans express national security concerns about foreign agents participating in D.C. elections. </p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro denied leading an attempt to overthrow the government after losing the 2022 election, but admitted to discussing alternatives to accepting the results. Bolsonaro stated that proposals to deploy military forces and suspend civil liberties were quickly dropped, and that he never acted against the Constitution. The Supreme Court is hearing the case against Bolsonaro and others charged with plotting a coup to prevent Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office. Bolsonaro defended his administration's achievements and criticized the electoral system, while apologizing for unfounded allegations about Supreme Court justices. </p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* argues that "good taste" is becoming increasingly important in a world saturated with AI-generated content. The author defines taste as "judgment with style," combining the ability to make sound decisions with a sense of aesthetics and appropriateness. AI can generate countless variations of content, but it lacks the human discretion and cultural intuition to discern what is truly meaningful or resonant. The article suggests that taste is a skill that can be developed through exposure, curation, and reflection, and that it has an ethical dimension, guiding us to make choices that are respectful and considerate. </p>

The U.S. is currently the largest exporter of LNG, and this deal could further increase its export capacity by 2030.

Analysts suggest this marks an explicit abandonment of a cornerstone of US Middle East diplomacy, potentially complicating relations with US allies.
