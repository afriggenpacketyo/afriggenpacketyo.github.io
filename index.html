Katherine Hill, along with her father, was found guilty of fraud and sentenced for abusing her power as trustee. The sisters, Gemma and Jessica Thomas, describe how their mother's actions shattered their trust and family bond, leaving them feeling anxious and unable to reconcile. They also noted that their mother showed no remorse, and that the experience has had a massive effect on them, mentally and physically, and has impacted their ability to trust others. </p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on shortening the time required for immigrants to apply for citizenship, a move that has polarized the country. The referendum, initiated by a citizens' initiative, proposes reducing the waiting period from 10 years to five, aligning Italy with most other European nations. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes the referendum, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and encouraging Italians to abstain from voting. The outcome of the referendum could affect up to 1.4 million long-term foreign residents and their children, potentially changing perceptions of immigrants in Italian society. </p>

          <p>The British government's plans to modernize and potentially expand its nuclear arsenal are undermining international non-proliferation efforts and fueling a global nuclear arms race. Critics argue that this policy is a continuation of a redundant, immoral, and potentially illegal deterrence strategy that Britain can ill afford. The decision to spend an additional Â£15 billion on nuclear warheads is seen as hypocritical, especially as the UK urges other nations to abandon nuclear ambitions. Experts warn that the potential reintroduction of air-launched nuclear weapons could bring the prospect of nuclear warfare closer. </p>

          <p>Legal experts are debating the legality of President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles without the request of California's governor. The deployment is being made under Title 10, which allows the federal government to take over the National Guard. Critics argue that this action is an overreach of executive power and an attempt to suppress dissent, while supporters maintain that it is necessary to enforce federal law. The use of the Insurrection Act, which would allow for the deployment of troops to quell domestic unrest, is also being discussed. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, with its fertility rate estimated at 1.1 children per woman, well below the replacement level. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden on women for childcare duties. </p>
