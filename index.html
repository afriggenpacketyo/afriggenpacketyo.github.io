          <p>The Tate Modern art gallery in London has announced it will extend its opening hours to 9:00 PM on Friday and Saturday evenings, starting in late September. This strategic move aims to make the gallery more accessible, particularly to younger visitors and those who work during standard hours. The decision follows the immense success of the Tate Modern Lates program, a series of evening events that have attracted over 750,000 people since 2016. Officials hope the extended hours will further solidify London's reputation as a global cultural hub.</p>

          <p>The upcoming world swimming championships are set to feature a highly anticipated duel between American veteran Katie Ledecky and Canadian teenage phenom Summer McIntosh. Their clash in the 800m freestyle is being billed as a defining moment, pitting Ledecky's long-standing dominance against McIntosh's recent record-breaking form. McIntosh is attempting to win five individual gold medals, a feat only achieved by Michael Phelps. This race represents a potential generational shift in long-distance swimming and a major test for both athletes.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for international consensus on the governance of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need to balance technological development with security. Speaking at a conference in Shanghai, he criticized monopolistic control over AI and advocated for open access, a clear reference to the ongoing tech competition with Washington. This appeal for global cooperation comes as the US continues to impose restrictions on high-end chip exports to China, citing national security concerns.</p>

          <p>The Welsh women's rugby team achieved a significant milestone by defeating Australia in Brisbane, marking their first win under head coach Sean Lynn.

          <p>Planned Parenthood has announced the upcoming closure of two of its Houston-area facilities, including what pro-life activists describe as the largest abortion facility in the Western Hemisphere. The organization attributed the decision to rising operational costs, staffing shortages, and low reimbursement rates. This move comes in the wake of Texas's restrictive abortion laws following the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade.
