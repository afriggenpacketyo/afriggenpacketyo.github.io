          <h2>Supreme Court Appears Poised to Expand Role of Religion in Public Schools</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 15:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to this article, the Supreme Court seems ready to further integrate church and state, potentially mandating state funding for religious schools if parents have a choice to send their children elsewhere. Justice Kavanaugh suggested that separation of church and state might be unconstitutional if individuals can opt out of state-backed religious activities. The case in question, Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond, concerns whether states must fund religious charter schools with taxpayer money. Democratic Justice Elena Kagan raised concerns about the implications of this approach, questioning if states would be required to fund schools that do not meet curricular standards or that discriminate against students of different faiths.</p>

          <p>Maine State Representative Laurel Libby is seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court after being censured for a Facebook post criticizing the state's policy allowing transgender athletes to participate in girls' sports. The post identified a transgender athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition. Libby argues that the censure, which prevents her from voting, disenfranchises her constituents. She has filed a lawsuit alleging violations of the Constitution, including the First Amendment, after lower courts declined to grant her relief. The Justice Department has also sued Maine over its transgender athlete policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has again ordered the Trump administration to provide information on its efforts to comply with her order to return Kilmar Ábrego García from an El Salvador prison. Ábrego García was mistakenly deported despite a court order protecting him from being sent there, as he faced persecution from local gangs. The judge has criticized the administration's lack of action and ordered officials to provide sworn testimony documenting their efforts to bring him back. Trump acknowledged he could call the El Salvador president to have Ábrego García sent back, but doubled down on claims that Ábrego García is a member of the MS-13 gang.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article details Representative Elise Stefanik's return to Congress after her nomination as UN ambassador was withdrawn, and her strained relationship with Speaker Mike Johnson. Stefanik publicly accused Johnson of dishonesty after he claimed to have discussed a potential gubernatorial run with her. The article suggests Johnson had promised her a position on the Intelligence Committee but has not followed through, leading to distrust within the Republican Conference. Despite this setback, Stefanik is reportedly considering a run for New York governor in 2026 and has significant financial backing.</p>

          <p>Budget airline Avelo is facing criticism for signing a contract to operate deportation flights for ICE, starting next month. The airline argues that this deal will provide financial stability and keep its employees working, but activists and politicians are protesting the move, especially in Connecticut, where Avelo has a major hub. Critics argue that the airline is profiting from deportations, and some state officials are considering revoking support for Avelo. Avelo will join a small fleet of ICE Air Operations carriers that operate these flights, which immigration authorities rarely publicize.</p>

          <p>Federal agencies like the FBI, DHS, and DOD are increasing their use of polygraph tests to identify potential leakers of information to the press. While polygraphs have long been used in criminal investigations and security screenings, their reliability and accuracy are debated. Experts note that polygraphs don't detect lies directly but measure physiological changes that may indicate deception. Some experts caution against the broad use of polygraphs, emphasizing they should be used carefully and are most effective for triggering confessions rather than detecting lies. </p>

Farley emphasized the importance of policies that encourage exports and reward companies for American production.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the mystery surrounding the disappearance of a gray whale calf carcass from Scripps Canyon near San Diego. Divers, including underwater photojournalist Jules Jacobs, initially discovered the carcass at a shallow depth, an unusual occurrence for whale falls. After a week, part of the tail was missing, and after a surge of spring storms, the carcass vanished entirely. Marine biologists speculate that gas buildup during decomposition may have caused the carcass to rise and be swept deeper into the canyon by strong currents.</p>
