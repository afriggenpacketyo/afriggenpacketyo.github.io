          <h2>Genetic Study Reveals Ancient Human Migration from Asia to the Americas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 02:04:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of researchers has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas through an extensive genetic analysis. The study indicates that Native Americans descended from Asian populations, specifically from the West Beringian region, and that early migrants to South America formed isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This work, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, could provide insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have experienced significant population declines. Archaeological evidence suggests this migration was underway at least 23,000 years ago, with a human presence in South America confirmed by 14,500 years ago.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is speaking out against AI companies using her likeness and voice without permission, advocating for legislation to regulate the evolving technology. Johansson claimed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asked her to voice their Chatbot, but after she declined, the feature sounded remarkably like her. Her legal team sent letters to OpenAI, leading the company to remove the voice. Johansson emphasizes the need for boundaries in AI to prevent exploitation and supports others in the public eye speaking out on the issue, as she has become a reluctant voice in the AI conversation.</p>

This roll-on/roll-off vessel is transporting approximately 7,000 China-made vehicles to Europe. SAIC Anji Logistics, the owner, plans to increase its international shipping fleet to 22 vessels by next year, covering key export markets such as Mexico, Western Europe, South America, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official data reveals that Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, a steeper decline than expected, marking the first quarterly drop since early 2024. This contraction was primarily due to a fall in exports, which drive the Japanese economy, with demand waning even before the implementation of US tariffs. Uncertainty is heightened by these tariffs, leading to concerns that the economic slowdown trend will become more apparent. Economists suggest the possibility of a recession cannot be ruled out, depending on the downward pressure caused by the tariff issue, as Japan's economy remains vulnerable due to an aging population and weak exports and consumption.</p>

          <p>The latest Sunday Times Rich List indicates a decline in the number of UK billionaires, while King Charles' personal wealth has risen to match that of former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty. The number of billionaires has fallen from 165 to 156, the biggest drop in the list's history, partly due to criticism of tax changes by the new Labour government. Meanwhile, the King's wealth grew by £30 million to £640 million, increasing his rank to 258. Topping the list for the fourth consecutive year is the Hinduja family, with a fortune exceeding £35 billion.</p>

          <p>The Scotland women's cricket team, named their nation's team of the year in December 2024, currently has no scheduled fixtures, and has not played at home since 2023. This is due to the high costs associated with hosting series and the absence of a mandated Future Tours Programme for associate countries. The situation is frustrating for players who want to develop but lack the opportunities due to limited financial support, despite Cricket Scotland receiving approximately £1.3m per year from the ICC. There are calls for more assistance from England with regular fixtures to help sustain the women's program.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, totaling 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion), as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets amid trade tensions. This shift was largely driven by institutional investors, with pension funds and asset managers aggressively purchasing equities, and reserve managers, life insurers, and pension funds buying Japanese bonds. The inflows occurred predominantly in the first week of April, following President Trump's tariff announcements, which altered global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy and asset performance. While the U.S. is softening its trade stance, the confidence in U.S. assets is getting restored.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, due to the state's restrictive abortion law. The woman, Adriana Smith, was declared brain-dead in February but is now 21 weeks pregnant, and doctors say they cannot remove life-sustaining devices because the state bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. This situation has sparked controversy, with her family upset that they do not have a say in her medical treatment. Bioethicists argue that removing life support would not constitute an abortion, but the overturning of Roe v. Wade has created uncertainty about fetal rights.</p>

          <p>Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura faced cross-examination in the federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial against Sean "Diddy" Combs, detailing group sexual encounters, drug use, and her feelings toward Combs. Combs' defense attorney tried to establish a loving relationship between the pair, highlighting texts where Ventura helped plan "freak-offs," events Ventura described as Combs instructing her to take drugs and have sex with male prostitutes while he watched. Ventura said the texts were "just words" and that she sometimes initiated the acts out of fear, spending most of her time having a "freak-off" or recovering from one.</p>

          <p>A statewide transit strike in New Jersey began just after midnight Friday when about 450 unionized locomotive engineers walked off their jobs in a dispute over pay, shutting down New Jersey Transit’s rail network. The strike will leave tens of thousands of commuters scrambling for other ways to reach their jobs in the New York City metropolitan region. NJ Transit’s statewide bus system continued to operate as scheduled, and the agency hired private buses to substitute for its train service. But those chartered buses could accommodate only about 20 percent of the displaced train riders.</p>

          <p>Charles Strouse, the composer of enduring musical theater numbers such as "Put On a Happy Face" and "Tomorrow," has died at the age of 96. With more than a dozen Broadway shows to his credit, he composed some of the most enduring musical theater numbers of his era, earning him three Tony Awards, a Grammy, and an Emmy. Strouse had fully intended to be a composer of concert music, but light music would become his calling. His biggest hit, “Annie,” opened on Broadway in 1977 and ran for almost six years.</p>

Comey deleted the image and stated he opposed violence of any kind. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleged the message was a call for the assassination of Trump.</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or become a “shock absorber” in the face of tectonic upheavals in global trade imbalances between the US and China. Despite a recent respite in trade tensions following talks in Geneva, the outlook for Europe remains bleak if it fails to adapt to Washington’s efforts to reorder global trade. Without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes.</p>
