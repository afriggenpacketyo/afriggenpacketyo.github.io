            <p>Chinese enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments due to concerns about the safety and credibility of US assets and the weakening dominance of the US dollar. A survey by Renmin University's International Monetary Institute indicates a rising percentage of enterprises planning to increase yuan settlements, with about 68% using it for cross-border trade settlements. Fudan University finance professor Yang Changjiang noted that global capital isn't flowing to the US during recent market turbulence, presenting an opportunity for the yuan's internationalization. The US Treasury market's volatility, exacerbated by President Trump's global tariff plan, has further fueled this trend. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A delegation of House Democrats is in El Salvador to advocate for the release of Kilmar Ábrego García, an immigrant deported despite a Supreme Court order. The lawmakers aim to meet with Ábrego García, who lived in the US for over a decade before being deported, and challenge the Trump administration's refusal to facilitate his return. The case has sparked tensions between the administration and the Supreme Court, with the Justice Department claiming a lack of power to secure his release. Ábrego García, who had protected legal status, was deported to El Salvador and is held in a facility criticized by human rights advocates.</p>

Acutis, who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, was known for his computer skills and online evangelization efforts.

The Cardinal Camerlengo formally pronounced the Pope dead, and his Fisherman's ring will be broken. The funeral will take place within four to six days, with cardinals gathering in Rome to discuss the future of the Church. The Cardinal Electors will then isolate themselves in the Sistine Chapel to vote for a new pope until a two-thirds-plus-one majority is reached.</p>

            <p>The White House is defending Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth after revelations that he shared attack plans in a second Signal group chat, this time including his wife and brother. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed former Pentagon employees for leaking and lying to the media, asserting that no classified information was shared. Hegseth maintains that he and President Trump are on the "same page" and will continue fighting. The Pentagon's independent inspector general is currently reviewing Hegseth's use of Signal to discuss military actions.</p>

            <p>Pope Francis, during his 12-year papacy, steered the Catholic Church into new directions, softening its image and intervening in major social issues. He advocated for the poor and marginalized, challenged traditionalists, and promoted peace. Despite criticism from some quarters, his informality and focus on reaching people in their daily lives resonated globally. He addressed social issues like divorce and homosexuality with a new tone, but also maintained traditional views on certain topics. His efforts to reform the Church and address issues like corruption and child sexual abuse will shape his legacy.</p>
