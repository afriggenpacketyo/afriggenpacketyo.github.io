          <p>Viking Therapeutics experienced a significant stock price drop of over 40% after releasing midstage trial data for its oral obesity drug that failed to meet investor expectations. The results, which analysts deemed inferior to competitors like Eli Lilly on key metrics such as weight loss percentage and patient discontinuation rates, have cast doubt on the company's future in the competitive weight-loss drug market. The high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was a major concern noted in the trial, potentially hindering the drug's path forward and diminishing the company's appeal as an acquisition target.

          <p>The integration of artificial intelligence in education is creating a divide, with some teachers embracing it as a valuable tool while others worry about its impact on critical thinking. Proponents highlight AI's ability to save teachers time on tasks like lesson planning, with a recent survey indicating average savings of nearly six hours per week. However, critics raise concerns about potential cheating and a decline in students' analytical skills. Tech companies are investing in training programs to help educators navigate this new landscape, emphasizing that AI should enhance, not replace, the fundamental teacher-student relationship in the classroom.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government plans to acquire a non-voting equity stake in Intel in return for funds allocated through the CHIPS Act, as confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This strategic shift aims to ensure that American taxpayers benefit from the federal investment intended to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. The move, which converts a previously planned grant into an equity investment, is part of a broader administration strategy to reshore critical manufacturing. The announcement led to a significant increase in Intel's stock price, reflecting market response to the potential government backing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has released new immunization recommendations that differ from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's official guidance for the first time in three decades. The AAP strongly recommends COVID-19 vaccinations for children aged 6 months to 2 years, while advising them for older children at parents' discretion. This contrasts with the current CDC stance, which does not universally recommend the shots for healthy children of any age. The differing advice highlights an ongoing debate within the public health community regarding vaccination policies for children, creating potential confusion for parents navigating these critical health decisions.</p>

          <p>Epping Forest District Council has successfully obtained a temporary High Court injunction to prevent The Bell Hotel from being used to house asylum seekers, ordering them to be moved by September 12th. This legal action follows weeks of local protests and rising community tensions, which escalated after an asylum seeker residing at the hotel was charged with the sexual assault of a teenager. The council argued that the ongoing demonstrations were causing significant strain and risked irreparable harm to the community. The Home Office had warned the decision could substantially impact its ability to house asylum seekers nationwide.</p>

          <p>A Southern California family has found a grandmother for their twin boys through an unconventional online solution, Surrogate Grandparents USA, a Facebook group connecting families with seniors seeking grandchildren. The Turner family, feeling the absence of active grandparents in their children's lives, connected with Janet Firestein Daw, who was looking to fill the void of not having biological grandchildren. The relationship has flourished over two years, with "Nana J" becoming an integral part of the family, highlighting a growing trend of forming non-traditional family bonds to create a supportive "village" for raising children in modern society.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twenty states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department for imposing new immigration enforcement conditions on federal grants for crime victims. The lawsuit argues that the administration is illegally forcing states to choose between forfeiting critical funding for victim services and complying with rules that compel local officials to assist federal immigration agents. The states contend that these conditions, part of a broader crackdown on "sanctuary" jurisdictions, undermine trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities. They are seeking an urgent court order to block the rules before grant application deadlines pass.</p>

While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.02% APY, some online institutions are offering rates as high as 4.40% for similar terms. Experts suggest that savers consider shorter-term CDs, as an inverted yield curve has made their rates higher than those for longer terms. To maximize returns, consumers are advised to compare rates from different banks, particularly online ones with lower overhead costs, and consider laddering CDs of various term lengths.

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has stated that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will be a primary target for congressional investigation if Democrats regain control of the House in the midterm elections. Jeffries expressed deep concern over Noem's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, citing a lack of respect for due process and the use of masked agents in raids on immigrant communities. He indicated that experienced representatives like Bennie Thompson and Jamie Raskin would likely lead inquiries into the department's conduct. This signals that immigration policy and enforcement actions under the current administration will be a central focus of Democratic oversight efforts.</p>

          <p>During his meeting at the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented President Trump with a letter for Melania Trump from Ukraine's First Lady, Olena Zelenska. The letter expressed gratitude for Mrs. Trump's efforts to raise awareness about the thousands of Ukrainian children who Kyiv says have been abducted by Russia since the 2022 invasion. This gesture followed Melania Trump's own public letter to Vladimir Putin, urging him to consider the welfare of children affected by the conflict. The exchange highlights the humanitarian focus on the approximately 19,500 children Ukraine alleges have been forcibly deported to Russia or Russian-occupied territories.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new, more powerful artificial intelligence chip for the Chinese market, tentatively named the B30A, which would be an advancement over its current China-specific offerings. This development follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD will give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales in China in exchange for permission to resume selling regulated chips there. The move comes after the administration halted advanced chip sales over national security concerns. Nvidia stated it is evaluating various products to remain competitive within the bounds set by government authorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Alabama inmate scheduled for execution by nitrogen hypoxia in October is legally challenging the method as unconstitutionally cruel, requesting alternatives such as a firing squad, hanging, or medical-aid-in-dying. The inmate, Anthony Boyd, argues in his lawsuit that the state's nitrogen gas protocol lacks safeguards to prevent conscious suffocation and terror, citing observations from previous executions using this method. Nitrogen hypoxia was introduced in Alabama as an alternative to lethal injection, and Boyd had initially elected it without full knowledge of the procedure. State officials maintain that the method is humane and results in a quick loss of consciousness.</p>

The records detail nine separate complaints about his rude and belittling conduct toward women, which prompted the university to hold a mandatory training session.

This move allows the retailer to fill gaps in its inventory and offer products from smaller, innovative vendors without holding the stock itself.

Bessent described the practice as an "Indian arbitrage" that is unacceptable to the administration. Since Russia's 2022 invasion, India has become Moscow's largest oil customer, a significant shift from its minimal imports previously. In response, the U.S. has ordered an additional 25% tariff on Indian exports and is threatening further "secondary tariffs" to pressure Russia's trading partners and encourage a peace settlement with Ukraine.

At the direction of the president, Texas is moving to create new districts that could add up to five Republican seats in the House, a move critics argue is designed to predetermine election outcomes. Concurrently, the Supreme Court is set to hear a case challenging Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which could eliminate protections for majority-minority districts. These combined actions reflect a strategy to consolidate political power by manipulating electoral boundaries rather than persuading voters.</p>
