          <p>Congressional lawmakers visited Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two students detained by ICE for pro-Palestinian activism, denouncing their treatment as a "national disgrace." The delegation, led by Congressman Troy Carter, expressed support for free speech and concern for the students' well-being, highlighting their fear and desire to return home. The students' detention is seen as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants and suppression of constitutionally protected free speech critical of US foreign policy. Lawmakers described those being held as political prisoners and expressed fears of the US moving towards an authoritarian state. Optimism score: 25</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court seems inclined to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their children out of instruction involving storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The case centers on whether the school board's policy violates the First Amendment rights of parents to direct the religious upbringing of their children. Several justices expressed skepticism about the school board's reasons for eliminating opt-outs, with some suggesting the policy demonstrated hostility toward religion. A decision is expected by early July. Optimism score: 70</p>
