          <p>Timothy Schulz, a 42-year-old man believed to be on drugs, was shot and killed by Polk County sheriff's deputies in Florida after an apparent alligator attack. Deputies initially responded to reports of a man acting bizarrely and swimming in a lake with alligators, where he was bitten. After emerging from the lake, Schulz charged at deputies with garden shears and then attempted to enter their patrol vehicle. Deputies, who initially tried to de-escalate the situation and use a Taser, ultimately opened fire when Schulz tried to reach for weapons inside the vehicle, leading to an investigation and the deputies being placed on administrative leave.</p>

          <p>President Trump pardoned Scott Jenkins, a Virginia sheriff convicted of federal bribery charges, preventing him from serving a 10-year prison sentence. Trump criticized the Biden Department of Justice and the judge in the case, claiming Jenkins was unfairly persecuted. Jenkins was convicted in December 2024 for accepting over $75,000 in cash payments for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. The Department of Justice stated that Jenkins had violated his oath of office by engaging in a cash-for-badges scheme, though Trump defended Jenkins as a wonderful person who was unfairly targeted.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress revoked California's authority to set electric vehicle mandates, signaling resentment towards the state's influence on national policy. For decades, California has set stringent pollution limits, effectively setting the bar for carmakers nationwide, leading to resentment from Republican states tied to the fossil fuel industry. Republicans argue that electric vehicles are impractical for their constituents and that California's "extreme environmental agenda" should not govern other states. California officials have vowed to fight in court to preserve their autonomy in setting emissions rules, viewing the Republican action as a political statement against the state's liberal policies.</p>

Some countries are considering concrete repercussions if Israel does not change course, such as suspending trade negotiations and imposing sanctions.

          <p>A report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests that the official unemployment rate may not accurately reflect the state of the labor market. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which stood at 24.3% in April, includes not only unemployed workers but also those seeking full-time employment and those in poverty-wage jobs. This measure aims to capture nuances missed by other economic indicators, highlighting workers struggling to make ends meet. LISEP argues that the official unemployment rate presents an incomplete picture, as it counts part-time or poorly paid work as equal to full-time employment.</p>

          <p>Former referees' boss Keith Hackett criticized the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) for appointing Thomas Bramall, an inexperienced referee, to officiate Aston Villa's defeat by Manchester United. Villa complained about Bramall after a controversial call that contributed to their missing out on the Champions League. Hackett argued that a more experienced referee should have been appointed to such an important match, especially considering that top referee Michael Oliver was operating VAR on another game. Hackett expressed surprise and disappointment that Oliver was not chosen to referee the Aston Villa game.</p>

          <p>President Trump condemned President Putin's killings in Ukraine, calling his actions "absolutely CRAZY" after a weekend of intense bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Despite this criticism, Trump has so far refused to join Europe in imposing new financial sanctions on Russia or to offer new arms and help to Ukraine. This pattern reflects a strategic void in which Trump complains about Russia's continued aggression but remains unwilling to make Putin pay a price. While Trump claims to be considering sanctions, he has consistently pulled back when faced with the decision to join Europe in economic penalties.</p>

The United States and the European Union have differing priorities, including European reluctance to change their consumption tax system or roll back digital regulations. European negotiators hope to reduce tariffs implemented in April, but the Trump administration seems firm on keeping the current 10 percent rate. The European Union is preparing retaliatory tariffs in case negotiations fail, while seeking to reduce the trade deficit by buying more American liquefied natural gas and microchips.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles, once popular in the early 1900s, faded due to factors like cost, limited range, and the rise of gasoline-powered cars, bolstered by government incentives for the oil industry.
