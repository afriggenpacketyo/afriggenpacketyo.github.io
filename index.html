          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release, citing violations of her due process and First Amendment rights. Ozturk was detained after co-authoring an op-ed about Israel's war with Hamas, which the Trump administration cited as the reason for revoking her student visa. She expressed gratitude for the support she received and emphasized the importance of justice and democracy, while leaders in Massachusetts celebrated her release.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the 10% baseline tariff rate on imports is expected to remain for the foreseeable future. He dismissed concerns that consumers would bear the increased costs, asserting that businesses and foreign countries would absorb them. However, economic data indicates that businesses are already attempting to pass these costs onto consumers, leading to a decline in consumer confidence since the tariff announcement in April, with the prices of some household items already rising.</p>

          <p>After a four-day clash, India and Pakistan have seemingly pulled back from the brink, but underlying tensions remain. A new generation of military technology, including weaponized drones, fueled a dizzying aerial escalation, prompting international diplomacy to engage. The political realities in both countries, gripped by entrenched religious nationalism, create a powerful push toward future confrontations. India's determination to show a more muscular approach on the world stage has established a new level of deterrence with Pakistan, though the way the fight played out did not suggest improvement at the operational or strategic level.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests extending Father's Day into a month-long celebration, following Mother's Day.

While acknowledging the impracticality of his idea, Gaffigan playfully advocates for greater recognition of fathers, emphasizing the importance of honoring them in a lighthearted and self-deprecating manner.

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that the UK will end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The government intends to prioritize hiring British nationals and extending visas for existing overseas workers. This policy change is expected to decrease the number of lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 over the next year, while the government plans to unveil changes to visa and recruitment laws on Monday. There will also be new requirements for training commitments to get people who are not working back into the labour market here in the UK.</p>
