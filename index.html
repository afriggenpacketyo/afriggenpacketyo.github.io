        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, accompanied by a yellow thunderstorm warning issued by the Met Office for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The warning is in effect from Saturday afternoon into Sunday, raising concerns about localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is also in place in England until Monday, indicating potential strain on health and social care services, including increased deaths among vulnerable populations. Firefighters have responded to a significant surge in wildfires, and scientists link the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves to climate change. The Met Office warns of potentially dangerous conditions and advises people to take precautions. Optimism score is based on the author's tone and the reality of the potential dangers involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to support a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death, following its passage in the House of Commons. The bill proposes that mentally competent, terminally ill adults with less than six months to live could request assistance in ending their lives, subject to multiple safeguards including assessments by doctors and a multi-disciplinary panel. Critics, like Conservative peer Lord Shinkwin, fear the bill could lead to vulnerable individuals being coerced into ending their lives. Dame Esther emphasizes the bill's rigorous process and asserts that disability or mental disorder would not qualify anyone for assisted dying, even though she acknowledges the unlikelihood of the bill becoming law in her lifetime.</p>

          <p>Kris Jenner's recent youthful appearance has sparked speculation about a possible deep plane facelift, with experts weighing in on the procedures involved. While Jenner's representative confirmed that Dr. Steven Levine performed the work, the specific procedure was not disclosed. Plastic surgeons suggest that Jenner's face appears "youthful and natural" due to a well-performed procedure that likely involved lifting and tightening the deeper tissues. The article details the differences between traditional and deep plane facelifts, highlighting the risks and recovery times associated with each technique, and stressing the importance of choosing a board-certified surgeon and discussing medical history and aesthetic goals before undergoing surgery.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army's maneuvers around Taiwan have become more frequent and intense in recent years, evolving from occasional sorties to a well-coordinated campaign designed for combat training and strategic signaling. These operations fall into three categories: near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises, each varying in scale, intensity, and purpose. Since 2024, PLA Air Force sorties around Taiwan have sharply increased, particularly after Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te assumed office. The article analyzes the signals sent by each type of operation, with near-daily patrols increasing sharply in 2024.</p>

          <p>Reporters working for Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks are expressing concerns about their safety and future, particularly those who are foreign citizens, following mass layoffs and political retribution in their home countries. The Trump administration issued layoff notices eliminating 85% of positions at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America, raising doubts about the U.S. government's commitment to non-American journalists. A Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter was sentenced to nine years in jail in Azerbaijan on charges that are considered false, highlighting the risks faced by journalists reporting uncomfortable truths. VOA journalists from countries with repressive regimes fear returning home when their visas expire, as they risk imprisonment or worse, and are now scrambling to find refuge and seek asylum.</p>

The Royal Family's official account also shared a message with a photo of the prince visiting farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall. Orla was given to the royal couple by Catherine's brother in 2020 after the death of their previous dog, and the puppies were born in May.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a deepening downturn, exacerbated by a shrinking population that is casting a shadow over the stagnant property market. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed, with a significant decrease compared to the peak in 2017. The country's population has been declining for the past three years, and shrinking population will cripple home demand by 0.5 million units every year in the 2020s and a lead to a bigger dent of 1.4 million units annually in the 2030s, Goldman Sachs estimates, compared to the positive contribution of 1.5 million units in the 2010s when population was on a steady rise. Beijing's pronatalist policies are expected to have limited effect due to deep-rooted issues such as high economic costs for child-bearing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth elements, after experiencing an export ban from China in 2010. The country has invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects, notably Australia's Lynas, reducing its overall dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60% from over 90%. China's recent export curbs on rare earth elements have impacted Western auto industry groups, with Suzuki Motor suspending production of its Swift car model. Japan's approach serves as a template for Western nations, though it highlights the difficulty of escaping China's critical mineral orbit, requiring a government and industry approach to tackle China's mineral dominance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the nature of feminist critique of female celebrities, questioning whether it has devolved into mere snide remarks and policing of women's choices. Recent criticism of figures like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae is examined in the context of historical feminist debates and the influence of social media algorithms. The author argues that meaningful critique should consider economic forces and avoid paternalistic tellings off, suggesting that the current discourse often packs women into smaller boxes under the guise of concern for their safety. Instead, the author calls for a return to complex arguments about desire, domination, and the realities of capitalism.</p>

          <p>Chinese brands, like Xiaomi, are gaining traction in Europe through strategic advertising and sports sponsorships, despite initial challenges with brand image. Xiaomi is planning to open 500 new retail stores outside China this year, particularly in developed markets, aiming to open 10,000 stores overseas in the next five years. The company's decision to close its stores in France in 2022 was part of an adjustment in its retail strategy to better respond to consumer behavior. The brand is now attempting to make a comeback in the region.</p>

          <p>Towns and cities in eastern German states are offering free stays to encourage people to move there long-term, addressing depopulation issues. The "trial living" scheme provides people with the chance to stay for up to four weeks free of charge, aiming to attract new residents to areas that have experienced demographic changes after German reunification. Guben, for example, has seen its population decline by almost half since 1995 and is seeking to attract new residents to fill job vacancies and combat the aging population. The initiative includes opportunities to participate in social gatherings, contribute to local art, and undertake internships at local companies.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in southeast Los Angeles County after federal agents detained at least three people at a car wash in the city of Bell, leading to confrontations between protesters and masked men in fatigues. The immigration action sparked outrage from local officials, with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass questioning the identity and lack of identification of the armed individuals. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Border Patrol vehicles were violently targeted during lawful operations, with one vehicle rammed and another totaled.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat against Argentina, highlighting issues with cohesion and execution. Despite creating opportunities through sharp passages of play, the Lions struggled with offloads and passes, leading to turnovers. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his frustration, emphasizing the need for sharper performance as they prepare to tour Australia. The Lions attack felt like it should be judged in two different facets - ambition and execution, with the former being stronger than the latter.</p>

          <p>Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has been released after 104 days in immigration detention in the US, following a judge's ruling. The Columbia University graduate student had become a symbol of the crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses after being arrested by ICE. Despite being a legal US resident and not accused of breaking any laws during the protests, the Trump administration sought to deport Khalil over his role in the demonstrations. Judge Farbiarz ruled that the government can't deport Mr Khalil on the basis that his presence could undermine foreign policy, but it can continue deportation over allegations that he lied on his green card application.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines reflect the mixed reactions to the Commons vote on the assisted dying bill, with some papers highlighting the "victory" for campaigners and others emphasizing the "uphill battle" the bill faces in the House of Lords. The Daily Mail notes the narrow margin of the vote and the promised "attritional fight" in the Lords, while the Daily Express declares the vote a "victory" for dignity in dying. The Daily Telegraph reports on plans to map the DNA of every baby under an "NHS revolution" and carries a comment piece which says the assisted dying vote gave the state "the power to kill". The Guardian reports that end-of-life care is "to be transformed" in a "societal shift" after the assisted dying bill vote.</p>

The group of uninhabited islets, which China claims and calls Diaoyu, has long been a source of friction between the Asian neighbors. The Japan Coast Guard warned the ships not to approach Japanese territorial waters. The previous 215-day streak of Chinese ships sailing near the Senkakus ended on July 23, 2024, likely due to the approach of a typhoon.</p>

The author examines the political motivations behind the attacks, including Netanyahu's desire to rewrite his legacy and gain domestic support. While the attacks have garnered support within Israel, the long-term consequences of a "war of cities" between Tehran and Tel Aviv remain uncertain. The piece also explores the role of Donald Trump's administration in enabling the strikes and the potential for further escalation in the region.</p>
