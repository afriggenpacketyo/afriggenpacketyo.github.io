          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life sentences in Idaho for murdering her two children, has been given two more consecutive life sentences in Arizona. She was convicted in two separate trials for conspiring with her late brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019 and for the attempted murder of her niece's ex-husband. Prosecutors argued her motives were financial gain and a desire to be with her new husband, Chad Daybell, using their twisted religious beliefs as justification. The judge described her actions as an unparalleled series of manipulation and destruction, affirming the sentences as a necessary measure for justice.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled that he does not expect to finalize a new trade agreement with Canada, suggesting a tariff-based strategy might be more probable than a negotiated settlement. This statement follows remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who insisted Canada would not be pressured into accepting a "bad deal." President Trump has established an August 1 deadline for an agreement, threatening a 35% tax on Canadian goods not covered by the existing North American free trade pact, creating uncertainty for the two deeply interconnected economies.

          <p>The UN's World Food Programme has issued a dire warning about the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, reporting that almost one-third of the population is going entire days without eating. Malnutrition is reportedly surging, with an estimated 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment, and the death toll from malnutrition since the war's start has climbed to 122. Amid growing international pressure on Israel to lift aid restrictions, an Israeli official suggested aid airdrops could resume, a method that aid agencies have criticized as inefficient and insufficient to address the scale of the crisis.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has cautioned that England's National Health Service (NHS) is entering a difficult period with the start of a five-day strike by resident doctors. This industrial action, the twelfth since March 2023, was initiated after negotiations over pay between the government and the British Medical Association (BMA) failed. To minimize patient impact, senior doctors are covering shifts and non-urgent work is proceeding where possible. However, the BMA has raised concerns about staff being overstretched, even as it grants some exemptions for doctors to work in critical care situations.</p>

          <p>Former New York Congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to commence his 87-month prison sentence for fraud and identity theft. Santos pleaded guilty to a range of offenses, including fabricating his biography to defraud donors, creating a fake nonprofit, and running a credit card scheme. Prosecutors stated he used campaign donations for personal enrichment, funding luxury purchases and lavish accommodations. After his sentencing, Santos appealed to President Trump for a future chance, calling his more than seven-year sentence politically influenced, though the White House has not commented on any clemency request.</p>

          <p>A significant disagreement has surfaced between President Trump's political team and that of Georgia Governor Brian Kemp concerning the state's 2026 Republican Senate primary. Sources report that a mutual understanding to collaboratively select a candidate to challenge Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff dissolved after Kemp independently promoted his preferred choice, Derek Dooley. This action reportedly angered Trump's advisers, who viewed it as a unilateral move potentially aimed at positioning Kemp for a 2028 presidential bid. The internal conflict complicates the GOP's efforts to present a unified front in a strategically critical race.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the widespread public ridicule of the executive and HR head caught on a 'kiss-cam' at a Coldplay concert, while seemingly harsh, reflects a healthy societal respect for marriage. The author, referencing George Orwell, suggests that such humor is not a sign of decadence but of a culture that still takes marital fidelity seriously, contrasting it with elite rationalizations for infidelity. The piece contends that the laughter is one of recognition of shared human fallibility. It concludes that the public shaming, though personally damaging, serves as a reinforcement of social norms regarding loyalty and discretion.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military's role at the southern border has markedly increased under an emergency declaration by President Trump, with troop deployments tripling to 7,600. These soldiers are now operating within designated militarized zones, collaborating closely with Border Patrol to deter migrant crossings through enhanced surveillance and rapid-response capabilities in remote terrains. While attempted illegal crossings have reportedly dropped to a 60-year low, military leaders assert the mission is vital for stopping those who evade capture and maintaining pressure on smuggling networks. Critics describe this expanded role as an unusual use of the military for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following his 38th Test century against India, England's Joe Root has climbed to second on the all-time Test run-scorers list, sparking serious discussion about his potential to surpass Sachin Tendulkar's record. The article analyzes Root's current form and England's future schedule, projecting that at his recent scoring rate, he could break the record of 15,921 runs within the next few years. Now 34, Root is averaging over 100 runs per match since a much-discussed change in his batting approach last year. The pursuit of this historic milestone is seen as the final chapter in an already illustrious career.</p>

          <p>A significant cross-party coalition of 220 Members of Parliament has formally requested that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer officially recognize a Palestinian state. The letter, signed by representatives from nine political parties, posits that UK recognition would be a crucial step toward a viable two-state solution and would send a powerful message of support for Palestinian rights. This initiative amplifies pressure on the government, particularly following France's recent commitment to recognize Palestine. Prime Minister Starmer responded by stating that recognition must be integrated into a wider, practical plan for achieving lasting peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Marvel's “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” attempts to inject a bright, retro-futuristic style into the franchise but ultimately gets bogged down by its own portentous, world-ending plot. The film, directed by Matt Shakman, dispenses with a lengthy origin story but also fails to establish the team's signature family chemistry, instead diving immediately into a crisis involving the planet-eating villain Galactus. While visually handsome and featuring a capable cast including Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby, the movie's relentless focus on menace leaves little room for the playful banter and character dynamics that define the source material, resulting in a surprisingly joyless adventure.</p>

Video of the event shows staffers telling agents to leave as they did not have a warrant.

According to their club coach, Messi was absent due to fatigue, while Alba was dealing with a minor injury. However, because their absences were not approved by the league, they were subject to sanction under a long-standing MLS policy. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the difficulty of the decision but stated the rule had to be enforced, though he committed to reviewing the policy with players for potential future amendments.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical account of how Adolf Hitler systematically dismantled the independence of Germany's central bank, the Reichsbank, upon becoming chancellor in 1933. It details the conflict between Hitler and the fiscally conservative Reichsbank President, Hans Luther, who initially resisted the Nazi regime's attempts to control the institution and fund its massive rearmament program. Despite legal safeguards designed to protect the bank's autonomy, Hitler used extralegal threats and political pressure to force Luther's resignation. He then installed his ally, Hjalmar Schacht, who promised to provide unlimited financing, effectively ending the bank's independence and paving the way for Hitler's economic agenda.</p>

          <p>This article explores the possibility of closing on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in under two weeks, a timeline much faster than the typical two-to-six-week process. While not common, a rapid closing can be achieved if the borrower is well-prepared with all necessary financial documents, such as tax returns and pay stubs. The speed also depends heavily on the lender's efficiency and their ability to use an automated valuation model instead of a full, time-consuming appraisal. Even with a streamlined process, a federally mandated three-day rescission period makes a same-week closing nearly impossible. (not investment advice)</p>
