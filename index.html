          <h2>Supreme Court Asked to Consider Trump Administration's Convention Against Torture Interpretation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 18:45:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow it to deport immigrants to countries where they fear torture, even if an immigration judge has not previously considered deportation to those countries. The administration claims a loophole exists that allows them to bypass legal protections provided by the Convention Against Torture, arguing they can deport individuals to countries offering diplomatic assurances against torture without further procedures. This case, Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D., involves immigrants who have already undergone deportation proceedings, with some having been convicted of serious crimes, according to the administration. Critics argue that the administration's interpretation would deny due process to individuals facing potential torture, while the administration asserts that existing federal law limits judicial review in such cases. The Supreme Court's decision could significantly impact the rights of non-citizens facing deportation.</p>

          <p>Amidst protests in Los Angeles against immigration sweeps, U.S. officials stated that the deployed Marines and National Guard personnel will operate under specific rules of force, primarily focused on protecting federal buildings and personnel, and they are instructed to de-escalate situations. The troops will carry weapons, but without ammunition loaded unless self-defense is required, and they will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the need for clear communication between all agencies to maintain order and safety during this critical time. The deployment includes 2,800 troops led by Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman. The situation has prompted concerns about potential escalation and the need for coordinated responses. Optimism regarding the situation is tempered by the potential for unrest and the importance of maintaining open communication between law enforcement and the community.</p>

          <p>The Rodon Group, a plastics injection molding company in Pennsylvania, is experiencing a surge in business due to the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. As companies scramble to navigate the changing tariff landscape, demand for Rodon's products, including K'nex toy sets, has increased by nearly 50%. While a U.S. agreement with China aims to reduce tariffs, uncertainty remains due to ongoing trade tensions and legal challenges. The Rodon Group has avoided tariff-related disruptions by investing in automation, enabling them to compete with overseas manufacturers. CEO Michael Araten emphasizes the importance of investing in STEM education to support domestic production. The stability of the industry is somewhat dependent on the future of the tariffs.</p>

President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guardsmen to address what the White House describes as "lawlessness." California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta are suing the Trump administration, arguing that the federal government unlawfully federalized the California National Guard, trampling over the state's sovereignty. The Marines are expected to arrive in the next 24 hours. The protests have been largely attributed to President Trump's policies on immigration.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni had accused them of civil extortion and defamation after Lively filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment and retaliation, accusations Baldoni denies. The judge also dismissed Baldoni's defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's allegations. Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, have the option to amend some claims by June 23. The legal battle followed the release of "It Ends With Us," a film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's novel, with rumors of a feud swirling during its promotion.</p>

Kennedy stated that the move aims to restore public trust by ensuring unbiased science guides health agency recommendations. Critics, including major health advocacy organizations, have expressed concern that this action undermines a trusted process and could fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses.

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are engaged in a dispute over the handling of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles. Trump criticized Newsom's leadership and deployed National Guard members to the city, while Newsom accused the White House of exploiting the situation for political gain and is suing the Trump administration for illegally federalizing the National Guard. Trump suggested it would be a "great thing" to arrest Newsom, prompting Newsom to accuse Trump of authoritarianism. The conflict highlights the political tensions between the Trump administration and Democratic-led states, particularly California, and the ongoing debate over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson federalized Alabama's National Guard to protect civil rights advocates marching from Selma to Montgomery, a move reminiscent of President Trump's recent federalization of the California National Guard amidst immigration protests. Johnson's decision came after Alabama Governor George Wallace refused to ensure the safety of the activists. This action, though rare, was taken to enforce federal laws and prevent domestic violence, highlighting the historical use of presidential power in civil rights crises. The events of 1965 serve as a precedent for understanding the complexities of federal-state relations during times of social unrest.</p>

Cameco, a major uranium miner, is expected to benefit from rising uranium prices driven by demand from cloud and AI markets.
