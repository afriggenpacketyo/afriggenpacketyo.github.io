          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted the Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, under tight security following Ukrainian strikes. The event, attended by over 20 international leaders including China's Xi Jinping, was marked by a three-day ceasefire announced by Russia, though Ukraine rejected it as a "theatrical show." Ukraine accused Russia of thousands of truce violations, reporting numerous clashes and casualties, while Russia claimed adherence and accused Ukraine of similar violations. Zelensky stated Ukraine's readiness for a genuine ceasefire, demanding an end to strikes and assaults.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir's Pahalgam area in April has escalated tensions between India and Pakistan, bringing the two nations to the brink of war. Both countries have engaged in missile and drone attacks, prompting international concern. Pakistan accuses India of killing dozens, while India claims to have neutralized 100 terrorists in retaliation for the April attack. The conflict stems from a decades-old dispute over the Kashmir region, with both nations claiming the territory. The article explains the historical context of the conflict, tracing it back to the partition of India in 1947 and subsequent wars over Kashmir.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a potential shift from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on Indian exports, which are currently suspended. Experts suggest that a trade deal with the U.S., India's largest trading partner, could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its access to global markets. However, concerns remain about the impact on domestic manufacturing and the potential for a flood of U.S. goods.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced a surge in April, propelled by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, effectively offsetting a sharp decline in exports to the United States due to newly implemented tariffs. Overall exports jumped by 8.1% compared to the previous year, while imports saw only a slight decrease. However, exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, highlighting the impact of trade tensions. The rise in exports to ASEAN countries suggests a redirection of trade flows, with factories in the region utilizing Chinese intermediate goods to fulfill orders destined for the U.S.</p>

          <p>Albania is set to hold parliamentary elections on May 11, marking its first vote since formally beginning EU accession negotiations in 2022.

          <p>A West Point philosophy professor, Graham Parsons, resigned after 13 years, citing the academy's shift away from its educational principles due to the Trump administration's influence. Parsons claimed the academy was eliminating courses and censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology. Pete Hegseth responded to Parsons' resignation by saying he would not be missed. Parsons' resignation followed an executive order and memos restricting faculty members' teaching content at military educational institutions, leading to what he described as a sweeping assault on the school's curriculum and faculty research.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American in the role, following criticism from a conservative group. The American Accountability Foundation accused Hayden of promoting "radical" content and material from Trump opponents. Democrats condemned the firing, calling Hayden a trailblazer and public servant. Trump has been removing officials he perceives as not aligning with his agenda across various government departments. Hayden's tenure was marked by efforts to modernize the Library and increase accessibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump hinted at a possible reduction in U.S. tariffs on goods from China as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks. He referenced the current tariff rate of 145%, implying it would decrease. Trump made these remarks while unveiling a tariffs deal with the UK. The meeting in Switzerland signifies a willingness from both sides to de-escalate trade tensions. Experts warn that any tariff cuts resulting from the meeting will likely be minor.</p>
