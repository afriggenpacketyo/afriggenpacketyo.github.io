          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to television on Tuesday, nearly a week after it was indefinitely suspended. The show was pulled following comments Kimmel made regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which Disney described as "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The company stated the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense national situation and that the decision to reinstate the show came after thoughtful conversations with Kimmel. The controversy had drawn criticism from conservatives and prompted several major station owners to preemptively pull the show.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 16:53:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily permitted President Donald Trump to dismiss Democratic Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, while agreeing to hear arguments on the case in December. The ruling sets the stage for a major examination of presidential authority over independent government agencies. Slaughter had sued to challenge the firing, citing a 90-year-old precedent that protects FTC commissioners from being removed without cause. The Trump administration argues that the modern FTC's expanded powers mean its members should serve at the president's will, a position that could significantly alter the independence of various federal bodies.</p>

While the Justice Department shut down the initial bribery investigation, Democrats are now calling for scrutiny into whether Homan properly reported the income to the IRS.

In contrast, a home equity loan offers a fixed rate, providing predictable monthly payments over the life of the loan. Homeowners are advised to weigh the stability of a fixed-rate loan against the immediate, but potentially temporary, savings of a variable-rate HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to stop construction on the Revolution Wind farm, a major offshore project being developed by Danish company Orsted. The judge granted a temporary injunction, allowing Orsted to resume work on the nearly completed project off the coast of New England, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. The Interior Department had issued a stop-work order in August, reflecting President Trump's broader policy goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry. The ruling is a significant victory for renewable energy proponents and a setback for the administration's anti-wind agenda.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, has withdrawn from a scheduled WABC-TV town hall to protest the network's suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". Mamdani characterized ABC's decision, which followed pressure from the FCC chairman, as corporate cowardice in the face of government bullying and an attack on freedom of the press. He stated that his protest was not aimed at local journalists but at corporate leaders who prioritized their bottom line over constitutional principles. The move highlights the political fallout from the Kimmel controversy, turning it into a broader debate about free speech and media independence.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, has declared that his party has a moral obligation to prevent Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party from gaining power. Speaking at his party's conference, Davey positioned the Liberal Democrats as a viable alternative for voters disillusioned with both the Conservative and Labour parties. He accused Farage of wanting to transform the UK into a version of "Trump's America," which he argued would be harsh and contrary to British values. Davey asserted that his party offers a vision for a "decent, caring country" that is in tune with those traditional values.</p>

The loss of Bosa, a five-time Pro Bowl selection and a cornerstone of their defense, is a major blow to the undefeated 49ers' Super Bowl aspirations.

          <p>Christian Horner has officially left his position as team principal of the Red Bull Formula 1 team, reportedly securing a severance package worth 60 million euros. His departure follows a tumultuous period that included allegations of inappropriate behavior, which he has denied, and an internal power struggle that led to the exit of chief designer Adrian Newey. Horner, who led the team to numerous championships over nearly two decades, is now free to pursue other projects in F1. The significant payout reflects a negotiated settlement ending his contract, which was set to run until 2030.</p>

          <p>The Sacramento District Attorney has suggested that the recent shooting at the KXTV ABC10 station may have been politically motivated and linked to ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show. The suspect, a former lobbyist, allegedly left behind disturbing handwritten notes, including one referencing Jeffrey Epstein and expressing animus toward top Trump administration law enforcement officials. The DA pointed to the choice of an ABC affiliate as the target, combined with the notes and the timing of the Kimmel controversy, as circumstantial evidence of the shooter's motive. The suspect faces both state and federal charges for the attack.</p>

It argues that efforts by political leaders to retaliate against artists and journalists for their speech strike at the core of American freedoms.

Buyers should also begin comparing lenders now to understand the rates, costs, and terms available, which will enable them to make a quick and informed decision in a potentially more competitive market.

Kenvue, Tylenol's manufacturer, stated that sound science shows no causal link and that the medication remains the safest pain relief option for pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical professionals have cited major studies, including one following 2.5 million children, that found no increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of 25 studies has found that while various interventions can temporarily reduce partisan animosity, these effects almost completely disappear within two weeks. Researchers discovered that methods like correcting misperceptions about political opponents or fostering inter-party contact produced only modest initial changes in attitude. The study also found that combining multiple interventions or repeating them over time did not lead to more significant or lasting reductions in hostility. The findings suggest that tackling deep-seated political polarization may require systemic changes to the incentives that drive conflict among political and media elites, rather than focusing solely on individual-level approaches.</p>

While Trump has embraced a role as a peacemaker, his administration's bellicose rhetoric and use of economic leverage have frayed ties with traditional allies.

Such actions are a felony because a laser beam can disorient or temporarily blind a pilot, posing a significant risk to the aircraft and its occupants. According to the court filing, the suspect later told investigators he did not know he couldn't point the laser at Marine One.</p>
