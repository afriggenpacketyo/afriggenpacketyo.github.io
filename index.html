        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil giant BP announced a 49% drop in first-quarter profit, reporting $1.38 billion, which is below analyst expectations. This decline is attributed to weaker crude prices and follows a recent strategic reset by the company. Despite the profit decrease, BP highlighted strong operational performance, including record upstream operating efficiency and refinery performance, and announced a dividend of 8 cents per ordinary share along with a $750 million share buyback. Net debt rose to $26.97 billion during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a 39% jump in first-quarter profit, reaching 1.775 billion euros, exceeding analyst expectations.

          <p>The UK government is considering extending the sugar tax to include milk-based drinks like milkshakes and lattes, alongside proposals to reduce the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the levy applies. The Treasury argues that the health benefits of calcium in these drinks do not outweigh the harms of excess sugar. The consultation period runs until July 21, with the government estimating that most soft drinks are already exempt due to reformulation efforts since the tax's introduction in 2018.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 is changing its regulations for 2026 to attract new manufacturers and refine chassis rules. The changes include retaining 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids but simplifying them by removing the MGU-H and increasing electrical capacity. This has led to Audi entering the sport and Ford partnering with Red Bull, while Honda is staying after initially planning to withdraw.

          <p>Following a deadly terror attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, India has renewed its accusations against Pakistan, citing "cross-border linkages." India claims the attack was orchestrated by a proxy group for Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terrorist organization based in Pakistan. Pakistan denies involvement and calls for an international investigation. The dispute over Kashmir dates back to the 1947 partition of British India, with both countries claiming the territory.</p>
