          <p>A Black, British pro-Palestinian activist and doctoral student at Cornell University recounts his experience of being targeted by U.S. immigration authorities after participating in a campus protest. He describes being banned from campus, going into hiding, and ultimately self-deporting after learning he was under surveillance and that his data had been handed to the Department of Homeland Security. The article connects his personal ordeal to a broader investigation by Amnesty International into the U.S. government's use of AI surveillance technology, like Babel X and Palantir’s ImmigrationOS, to monitor non-citizen students and immigrants. This surveillance is framed within the context of post-9/11 policies and racial profiling, raising concerns about the erosion of civil liberties.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that police forces will receive new powers to impose conditions on recurring protests, allowing them to consider the cumulative impact on communities and infrastructure. Under the new rules, senior officers can direct organizers to relocate demonstrations if a site has been repeatedly used, with breaches leading to potential arrest and prosecution. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the measures are necessary to balance the right to protest with residents' freedom from intimidation, particularly citing the Jewish community's recent feelings of insecurity. The move follows a recent day of protests where nearly 500 people were arrested, many for suspected support of a proscribed organization.</p>

          <p>Investigators in the murder case of Kenneth Fandrich faced a critical setback when a key piece of evidence, a maroon minivan, was discovered at a metal scrapyard. Police believed the van was the primary crime scene where Fandrich was killed by a masked assailant in a parking garage at the Intel campus in Hillsboro, Oregon. The suspect, later identified as Dr. Steven Milner, a former veterinarian who had been stalking the victim, allegedly used the vehicle to stage the crime. By the time Detective Devin Rigo located the van, he was too late and could only watch a video of it being crushed, losing crucial forensic evidence.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, though not without challenges. The club has seen on-field success, including winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, driven by manager Eddie Howe and new player acquisitions. Off the field, revenues are projected to soar, and major investments have been made in facilities, the academy, and the women's team. However, the club's growth is constrained by financial regulations, and the ownership continues to face scrutiny from human rights organizations like Amnesty International over sportswashing concerns related to Saudi Arabia's record.</p>

This approach marks a shift from traditional state-led media campaigns to a more direct and relatable method of engaging with younger Africans.

The famously shy artist was training for the priesthood during college when a pivotal moment occurred while performing with his band, The Commodores. An enthusiastic woman in the audience shouted, "Sing it, baby!," which he described as a profound acknowledgment that changed his perspective and life's direction. Shortly after, he contacted the church to inform them he would not be pursuing the priesthood, realizing his true calling was to write songs, which he considers his "real sermons."</p>

It also points to counterproductive actions against Brazil and Colombia, which have spurred a regional backlash against perceived U.S. meddling.

Analysts and auto executives from companies like Ford and GM now expect demand to drop significantly without the subsidy.

          <p>After decades in business, the pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced it is closing all of its locations. The decision follows the company's second bankruptcy filing in under two years, with the first occurring in October 2023. The company had been attempting to restructure its significant debt while also dealing with declining sales and costly litigation related to the opioid crisis. Since its first bankruptcy filing, Rite Aid had already closed over 520 pharmacies, and this final move marks the end for the once-prominent national chain. The company's website now directs former customers to services for transferring their pharmacy records.</p>

          <p>Significant diplomatic movement is underway to secure a Gaza ceasefire, with U.S. envoys, including Jared Kushner, traveling to Egypt to finalize details. The progress comes after Hamas announced its agreement to key parts of a peace plan proposed by President Trump, who stated that a deal is "very close." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope of bringing all remaining hostages home within days and has sent a delegation to the talks. While Hamas accepted the hostage release and an end to the war, questions remain over other aspects of the plan, such as the group's potential disarmament.</p>

          <p>A Birmingham woman named Liv Heeney, who at 28 discovered she carries a faulty gene that will likely cause early-onset frontotemporal dementia (FTD), is taking proactive steps for her future. This rare, hereditary form of the disease has affected 13 members of her family, including her mother, who passed away at 54. Faced with the high probability of developing the condition in her 40s, Liv has decided to use her knowledge to ensure any children she has are born free of the gene. She and her partner plan to use IVF with embryo screening to break the genetic cycle and protect the next generation.</p>
