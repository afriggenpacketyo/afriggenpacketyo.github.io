        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance regarding the disclosure of crime suspects' immigration status and ethnicity needs to change. This call for greater transparency follows a specific case in Warwickshire involving two Afghan men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. While police currently follow national guidance that restricts sharing such details, both Cooper and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch argue that more public information is necessary to maintain faith in the justice system and counter misinformation, referencing past riots fueled by false rumors.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has made a formal offer for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, with the total package potentially reaching 85 million euros (£73.8 million).

United is reportedly confident that the player is interested in a move to Old Trafford and is considering letting Rasmus Hojlund leave to accommodate the new signing.

          <p>Recently circulated photographs appear to show a new Chinese sixth-generation stealth aircraft, sparking analysis among military experts. The images reveal a plane with a slimmer fuselage and smaller size compared to the known J-36 fighter, suggesting it may be capable of higher speeds. Analysts are debating whether it is a new piloted fighter, a drone optimized for stealth, or a collaborative combat aircraft designed to work with other planes. The design features a lambda-wing layout, similar to another Chinese stealth fighter currently in development.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who fled to break quorum and prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. The plan, supported by former President Trump, aims to create five new GOP-leaning districts. The Democrats' absence stalled the legislative session, prompting House Republicans to approve a motion for their arrest to compel their return. While Texas law enforcement lacks jurisdiction outside the state, the move represents a significant escalation in the political standoff over the state's congressional maps.</p>

          <h2>Microsoft Report Identifies Top 10 Occupations Most Susceptible to AI Disruption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 09:32:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Microsoft, titled "Working with AI," has identified the jobs most exposed to disruption from generative artificial intelligence. The analysis, based on user interactions with Bing Copilot, found that roles involving information gathering and writing are highly susceptible. The top 10 least AI-safe jobs include interpreters, translators, writers, and several customer service positions. Conversely, jobs requiring physical or hands-on work, such as in the medical and blue-collar fields, were deemed the most AI-proof. The article suggests workers focus on developing human-centric skills to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>This article provides a timeline of President Donald Trump's public remarks about the possibility of running for a third term, a move that would violate the U.S. Constitution's two-term limit. While Trump has repeatedly joked about or suggested he might be "entitled" to another term, he has also recently downplayed the idea, stating he will be a "two-term president." Despite the constitutional barriers, some allies have floated ways to make it possible, but experts consider such a change extremely unlikely.

          <p>More than £100 million in Premium Bond prizes, including eleven awards of £100,000, are currently unclaimed in the United Kingdom. Critics argue that the operator, the government-owned National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to trace the winners, particularly for older bonds with only paper records. The issue is compounded for people who were gifted bonds as children or are trying to trace the accounts of deceased relatives. While NS&I states it has paid over 99% of prize winners, consumer groups are calling for reforms to make the tracing process less bureaucratic.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska encountered a hostile and raucous crowd during a town hall in Lincoln. The audience repeatedly booed and heckled the congressman as he attempted to defend his vote for a major policy and tax bill signed by President Trump. The forum was dominated by angry questions about the bill's impact on health care and its tax provisions, with audience members chanting "Tax the Rich!" and "vote him out!" Flood argued the bill was a middle-class tax cut and defended changes to Medicaid, but was largely drowned out by the angered crowd.</p>

          <p>The family of Abu Sayed, a 24-year-old student shot and killed by police during nationwide protests in Bangladesh in 2024, is still demanding justice one year later. Sayed's death, captured on live television, became a pivotal moment that helped galvanize the movement that ultimately led to the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. While a tribunal has been established to investigate the deaths of as many as 1,400 people during the unrest, the process is slow. The article also touches on a growing sense of disillusionment with the new interim government's progress.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his search for the next Federal Reserve chair has been narrowed to four potential candidates, and that current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer under consideration. In a recent interview, Trump stated that Bessent expressed a desire to remain in his current role. The announcement comes after the surprise resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, which gives Trump another opportunity to appoint a new member to the board.

          <p>The cleanup is ongoing in Scotland after Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, left thousands of homes without electricity. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) reported that while power has been restored to 50,000 homes, 22,000 were still disconnected as of Tuesday morning. The storm caused widespread disruption with gusts up to 90mph, felling numerous trees and forcing the cancellation of trains and flights.

          <p>Independent MP and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has publicly criticized his former colleague, Communities Secretary Angela Rayner, for authorizing the sale of land at eight allotment sites since the general election. Allotments, which are small plots for residents to grow produce, are protected by law, and their sale requires ministerial approval. Corbyn, a well-known allotment enthusiast, argued that these green spaces are vital for communities and should not be sacrificed for development, even for needed social housing. The government stated that sales are only approved when "clearly necessary."</p>

This criminal probe, which follows referrals from Trump administration intelligence officials, revisits the highly scrutinized investigation into Moscow's interference in the 2016 election. The move is likely to intensify concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department, as President Trump has long voiced grievances about the original investigation and called for the jailing of his perceived political adversaries.</p>
