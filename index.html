          <p>Former President Donald Trump has proposed holding a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the 2026 celebration for America's 250th anniversary. During a speech in Iowa, Trump stated that he had discussed the idea with UFC CEO Dana White, envisioning an event for 20,000 to 25,000 people. This would be an unprecedented use of the White House grounds, which has never before hosted a major professional sporting event. The proposal reflects Trump's long-standing relationship with the UFC and his penchant for large-scale, unconventional events.</p>

          <p>Google is rolling out "Ask Photos," a new feature in its Google Photos service that uses the Gemini AI model to allow for complex, natural language searches. Instead of simple keywords, users can now ask conversational questions like "Show me the best photo from each national park I've visited." The AI analyzes image content, context, and metadata to provide more intuitive and comprehensive results. After a brief pause to improve speed and quality, the feature is now more widely available to eligible users in the U.S., aiming to change how people interact with their digital memories.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders gathered in Chisinau for the first-ever EU-Moldova summit, signaling strong support for the country's bid to join the bloc. The meeting focused on bolstering Moldova's resilience against Russian hybrid warfare, including disinformation campaigns, particularly ahead of its upcoming elections. While Moldova and Ukraine formally opened accession talks last year, progress has been stalled, partly due to opposition from Hungary regarding Kyiv's advancement. The summit aims to reassure Moldova of its European future without alienating Ukraine, as both nations seek to move away from Russian influence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose 17% tariffs on all food and farm produce imported from the European Union, a move that would impact a wide range of popular products. The warning was delivered to the EU's trade commissioner during meetings in Washington, escalating trade tensions as a July 9 deadline for a new tariff deal approaches. While EU officials remain hopeful for a negotiated solution and noted progress in recent talks, they are also preparing retaliatory measures. The threat signals the U.S.'s aggressive negotiating stance under President Trump, who has previously called the EU "nastier" than China on trade.</p>

While Corbyn welcomed her decision, he indicated that the foundations for a new party are still being developed. Polling suggests such a party could capture up to 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters. This development creates a potential challenge for Labour leader Keir Starmer, as it could split the progressive vote and highlight dissatisfaction on the left of British politics.</p>

          <p>Health experts are outlining the significant physiological stresses that competitive eating places on the human body. The practice can cause the stomach to become permanently stretched, potentially impairing its ability to contract and process food normally. A University of Pennsylvania study showed a competitive eater's stomach distended into a massive, food-filled sac with little digestive movement. Beyond stomach issues, the massive intake of sodium and fat from foods like hot dogs can spike blood pressure, strain the kidneys, and cause severe gastrointestinal distress. Choking and esophageal tears are also serious, immediate dangers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has been condemned by Jewish advocacy groups for using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax changes, Trump used the slur, which originates from a villainous Jewish character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," to refer to predatory lenders. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," stating it reinforces harmful stereotypes. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he only understood it to mean a moneylender charging high rates.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint alleging that scammers fraudulently obtained over $250,000 in cryptocurrency by impersonating the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. The perpetrators used deceptive email addresses, substituting a lowercase 'L' for an 'i', to trick a victim into sending a large donation of USDT stablecoin. The complaint states the emails appeared to be from the committee's co-chair, Steve Witkoff. The U.S. government is now seeking the forfeiture of nearly $40,400 of the stolen funds that have been recovered from a cryptocurrency exchange account.</p>

          <p>The UK Attorney General's Office will refer the sentence of a 15-year-old boy who killed an 80-year-old man to the Court of Appeal, citing it as potentially unduly lenient. The boy was sentenced to seven years in custody for the manslaughter of Bhim Kohli, who was racially abused and attacked in a park in Leicestershire. The victim's family expressed disappointment with the original sentence, arguing it did not reflect the severity of the crime. The court will now determine if the sentence should be increased, a move welcomed by local MPs and the victim's family.</p>

          <p>Russia unleashed its largest aerial attack on Kyiv since the war began, launching approximately 550 drones and 11 missiles at the Ukrainian capital. The assault, which killed at least one person and injured over 20, occurred shortly after President Trump held separate, unproductive phone calls with both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy described his conversation with Trump as "important and useful," focusing on Ukraine's air defense needs, especially after the U.S. paused critical weapons shipments. The Kremlin stated that Putin told Trump the war would continue until Russia's goals are achieved.</p>

          <p>The ACLU has filed a class-action lawsuit against federal immigration authorities, alleging that agents in Southern California are engaging in widespread racial profiling during deportation crackdowns. The suit claims that agents are targeting people based on their skin color and appearance, raiding known hubs for Latino workers and arresting individuals without reasonable suspicion. The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, stating its operations are highly targeted. The lawsuit argues these sweeps violate constitutional protections and are driven by the Trump administration's ambitious daily arrest quotas.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign a landmark 870-page policy bill that includes key parts of his agenda, such as extending his first-term tax cuts and providing $100 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The package also features a $150 billion defense budget increase, new tax breaks for certain income types, and steep cuts to Medicaid. The bill passed Congress by a narrow margin, with Republicans divided over its impact on the national debt and Democrats united in opposition, warning it disproportionately benefits the wealthy. The White House claims it will stimulate strong economic growth.</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to save Miami's reefs, scientists are transplanting fragments of crossbred coral onto a reef devastated by bleaching. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami and other partners, involves breeding Florida's iconic Elkhorn coral with a more heat-tolerant variant from a naturally warmer reef in Honduras. The goal is to create a more resilient coral population capable of surviving rising ocean temperatures driven by climate change. This is the first time such international crossbreeding has been permitted for planting in the wild, offering a potential blueprint for reef conservation across the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>The UK government will offer compensation of up to £4,000 to each of the 277 Afghan nationals whose personal information was exposed in a 2021 Ministry of Defence data breach. The breach occurred when an email was sent to people eligible for relocation, including interpreters, with their email addresses mistakenly placed in the 'To' field instead of 'Bcc'. This error exposed their identities at a time when many were in hiding from the Taliban. The compensation scheme, expected to cost around £1.6 million, follows a fine from the data watchdog, which stated the error could have led to a "threat to life."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's historic decision to significantly increase its defense spending is fueling a debate over whether the investment will stimulate broad economic growth. While arms manufacturers like Rheinmetall are seeing record orders and soaring stock prices, some economists are skeptical. A study from the University of Mannheim suggests that military spending has a low return on investment compared to infrastructure or education, with each euro spent generating only 50 cents of economic activity. The debate centers on whether the spending will primarily boost arms company profits or successfully offset losses in other struggling sectors of the German economy. (not investment advice)</p>
