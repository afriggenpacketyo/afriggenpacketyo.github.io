          <p>Witnesses have described a deadly attack outside a synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester, during Yom Kippur observances. A man drove a car into members of the public and then began a stabbing rampage before being shot dead by police. Two people were killed and three others were injured in the incident, which prompted a major police response including a bomb disposal team due to a suspicious device worn by the attacker. The community has been left shocked and terrified by the violence on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning of increasing attacks against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel and facilities. The memo highlights that domestic violent extremists have conducted pre-planned, targeted attacks in at least three states, representing an escalation from property damage to direct violence. It cites recent incidents, including a fatal shooting at a Dallas ICE facility and another at a Texas detention center, as evidence of this evolving threat. The bulletin advises state and local law enforcement to remain vigilant as immigration enforcement activities continue to be viewed as targets.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Apple has removed applications from its App Store that could be used to track the locations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The company stated the decision was based on information from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with an app called ICEBlock and similar software. Attorney General Bondi confirmed that the Department of Justice had demanded the app's removal, calling it a tool designed to put federal agents at risk. The move highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the role of technology platforms.</p>

          <p>Alpha School in Austin, Texas, is pioneering an educational model where artificial intelligence guides every lesson for its students, who pay up to $40,000 annually in tuition. In this system, students spend mornings on core subjects using personalized, AI-driven software, while adults in the classroom act as motivational 'guides' rather than traditional teachers. Afternoons are dedicated to life skills such as financial literacy and public speaking. While the school boasts that its students achieve top scores on standardized tests, the AI-centric model has drawn skepticism from educators who argue its effectiveness is unproven.</p>

          <p>Actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, have separated after nearly 28 years of marriage. A representative for Loughlin confirmed the couple is living apart but stated that no legal proceedings for divorce are currently underway. The separation follows their involvement in the high-profile Varsity Blues college admissions scandal in 2019. Both Loughlin and Giannulli served prison sentences after pleading guilty to fraud charges for paying to have their two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as rowing recruits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new rapid attribution study from Imperial’s Grantham Institute has concluded that climate change made the impact of Super Typhoon Ragasa significantly more destructive. According to the research, such an event was approximately 49% more likely to occur compared to pre-industrial times. The scientists estimated that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, was directly responsible for about 36% of the damage in southern China. Furthermore, the study determined that the typhoon's winds were boosted by 7% and its rainfall by 12% at landfall due to the planet's warming.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General and Secretary of State have issued a warning that ballots mailed on Election Day, November 4, may not be counted due to U.S. Postal Service processing delays. The issue primarily affects voters living 50 miles or more from six regional mail processing facilities, as their ballots may not receive a postmark on or before Election Day. This represents a significant shift for a state that has widely adopted mail-in voting, with all registered voters automatically receiving a ballot. Officials are urging voters in affected areas to mail their ballots early or use a drop box to ensure their vote is counted.</p>

          <p>The FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, has praised the White House's new TrumpRx initiative as a significant advancement in making prescription drugs more affordable for Americans. The plan involves a direct-to-consumer government platform where pharmaceutical companies, starting with Pfizer, will offer medications at substantial discounts. According to the administration, this will allow patients to purchase drugs at prices aligned with the lowest paid in Europe, with some medications seeing savings of up to 85%. While critics question the program's overall impact, Makary argues it is a major first step in addressing the broader issue of high healthcare costs.</p>

Despite the Eagles' undefeated 4-0 start, Brown appeared to vent about his limited targets in a cryptic online post. On the "New Heights" podcast, Kelce questioned the need for such public complaints when the team is successful, stating, "You’re 4-0, boss. Come on, man." Brown has since addressed the post, taking accountability for letting his emotions boil over and clarifying it was not directed at anyone in the Eagles organization.</p>

These suggestions led to content including simulated masturbation and embedded pornographic films.

COVID-19 can present similarly to the flu but may also feature distinct symptoms like a loss of taste or smell and, with newer variants, a "razor-sharp" sore throat.

The administration has already paused billions in funding for projects in Democratic-led states.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors currently hold approximately $21 billion in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as the precious metal's price continues a significant rally. Analysts from several Swiss banks predict that gold prices could rise further in the next year, potentially reaching $4,000 per ounce. This surge is attributed to robust demand, including increased buying from global central banks seeking to diversify reserves and hedge against economic and political risks. The performance of these 13 gold ETFs, which have returned 42% this year, contrasts with the declining US dollar index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked nine prominent U.S. universities to sign a "Compact for Academic Excellence," which ties preferential access to federal funding to adherence to a list of administration priorities. The agreement demands that schools freeze tuition for five years, ban sex and gender as factors in admissions, and abolish institutional units perceived as hostile to conservative ideas. A White House official indicated that while funding would not be limited exclusively to signatories, those who sign the compact would receive priority for grants and partnerships. The move is seen as the administration's latest effort to reshape higher education.</p>

          <p>Balin Miller, a 23-year-old mountaineer from Anchorage, died after falling from El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. According to witnesses, Miller had already reached the summit of the 3,000-foot rock face but was descending to retrieve a stuck gear bag when the accident occurred. It is reported that he rappelled off the end of his rope, a common and often fatal climbing mistake. Miller was an admired climber known for impressive ascents, including a solo climb of a difficult route on Denali. The tragic fall was reportedly captured on a social media livestream.</p>

          <p>The recent inquest into the death of Paloma Shemirani has raised questions about the UK's ability to protect children from the influence of conspiracy-theorist parents. The coroner found that Paloma, who died from lymphoma after rejecting chemotherapy for alternative treatments, was "highly influenced" by her mother, a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist. The case underscores a broader issue, as legal experts note the high threshold for state intervention when parental beliefs, even those based on misinformation, are perceived to be causing harm. This has sparked a debate over balancing parental rights with child protection, especially in an era of rampant online disinformation.</p>

          <p>Google is facing accusations of censorship after its AI functions appeared to block results for searches related to President Trump's cognitive health. Queries such as "does trump show signs of dementia" reportedly return a message stating that an "AI Overview is not available," while similar searches for other political figures provide AI-generated summaries. This disparity has raised concerns about a potential double standard and whether the tech giant is selectively filtering information about the president.

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that American pessimism about the U.S. economy and job market continues, with negative ratings persisting for years. The high cost of goods and services remains the primary driver of this sentiment, and most Americans expect prices to continue rising. The survey also reveals significant public concern about the impact of artificial intelligence on employment, with a majority believing AI will have a net-negative effect on job availability in their fields over the next decade.

          <p>An analysis of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's tenure reveals a chaotic and unorthodox leadership style at the Pentagon. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, is described as being more preoccupied with public image and branding than with policy, and his leadership has been marked by personnel issues, leak investigations, and a reliance on a small circle of personal associates. Sources suggest that after an early security incident, his approach shifted from curiosity to paranoia, leading the department to become a mere mechanism for implementing executive orders. His selection is seen as a reflection of President Trump's preference for loyalty over experience.</p>

          <p>A new study from Goldman Sachs reveals that a growing number of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, making it increasingly difficult to save for retirement. The report found that 42% of younger workers have no spare savings after covering essential expenses, a significant increase from 31% in 1997. This financial pressure is driven by the rising costs of housing and healthcare, which consume a larger portion of income than in previous decades. The study suggests that traditional advice to simply "save more" is out of touch with the financial realities many workers currently face. (not investment advice)</p>
