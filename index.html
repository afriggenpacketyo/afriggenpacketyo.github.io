            <p>This article posits that China is preparing for a protracted economic conflict with the United States, shifting its focus from merely rebalancing trade to systematically countering China's economic ascent. Despite facing challenges such as a fragmented domestic market, China aims to leverage fiscal stimulus and address internal weaknesses to mitigate the impact of tariffs. The author suggests that, historically, China has overcome larger opponents through superior inner balance and core strength, implying that Trump's tariffs could ultimately make China more resilient. The article notes that the US is restricting exports of semiconductors, which is hurting US sales to China. Optimism score: 60 (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A BBC report highlights the ongoing challenges faced by parents in Britain regarding access to affordable childcare, despite the government's "free hours" scheme. Many parents are finding it difficult to secure nursery places, particularly in deprived areas, leading to "childcare deserts." While the government aims to increase childcare availability, private nurseries face rising operating costs and potential funding shortfalls, and the scheme's eligibility criteria exclude some families. The report suggests that the current system may widen the gap between disadvantaged children and their more affluent peers.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized the Salvadoran government for initially obstructing his access to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Van Hollen accused the government of staging a photo opportunity during their meeting to portray Abrego Garcia as being in a tropical paradise, despite being held in a notorious prison. He emphasized that Abrego Garcia's case is a matter of constitutional rights, urging the Trump administration to provide evidence linking him to MS-13 or other terrorist activity.</p>
