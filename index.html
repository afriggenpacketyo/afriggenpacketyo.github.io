          <p>A major fire in Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire expanded rapidly due to high winds, also damaging a water treatment facility and causing a chlorine gas leak that forced firefighters to evacuate. Meanwhile, smoke from extensive Canadian wildfires is causing unhealthy air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest. These events highlight an intensifying wildfire season exacerbated by dry conditions and extreme heat across North America.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has experienced the final day of a significant heatwave, with temperatures reaching a high of 31.2C in Scotland. The extreme heat led to multiple deaths, including a 15-year-old boy and three other adults in separate water-related incidents across the country. While many people flocked to beauty spots to cool down, emergency services issued urgent warnings about water safety and the increased risk of wildfires. The heatwave is expected to end as cooler temperatures and heavy rain are forecast for the coming week.</p>

          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, according to reports. The hospital has seen a surge in seriously ill children with the virus, admitting seventeen since June amid a regional rise in cases. Health officials attribute the outbreak to a decline in MMR vaccine uptake, with vaccination rates in the area falling well below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization. This is believed to be the second measles-related child death in England in the past five years.</p>

          <p>Search operations for the 161 people still missing after the deadly July 4 floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been suspended due to new flood threats. Heavy rainfall over the weekend has caused the Guadalupe and San Saba rivers to rise again, prompting fresh flash flood warnings and evacuations. The original disaster killed at least 129 people statewide after the Guadalupe River swelled over 20 feet in under an hour. This ongoing danger significantly complicates the massive recovery and search effort in the flood-ravaged region.</p>

However, his presidency was characterized by significant economic decline and widespread insecurity, despite some gains against the Boko Haram insurgency.

          <h2>European Union Postpones Retaliatory Tariffs on U.S. Goods to Allow for Negotiations</h2>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend the implementation of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, which were set to begin on Monday. The move is intended to create space for negotiations after President Trump threatened to impose new 30% tariffs on EU products starting August 1. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU prefers a negotiated solution but will continue preparing countermeasures in case a deal is not reached. The ongoing trade dispute creates uncertainty for the €1.7 trillion EU-U.S. trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Government Data Shows Most ICE Detainees Have No Criminal Record, Contradicting Trump's Rhetoric</h2>

          <p>An analysis of U.S. government data reveals that the majority of immigrants currently detained by ICE have no criminal convictions, a fact that contrasts with President Trump's rhetoric about deporting dangerous criminals. As of late June, over 71% of the 57,861 people in ICE detention had no criminal record, though some have pending charges. Critics and immigration law experts argue there is a significant disconnect between the administration's public justification for its aggressive enforcement and the reality of who is being targeted for arrest.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that President Trump's goal is to have the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) "remade," rather than eliminated. Speaking amid criticism of the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, Noem defended the administration, calling the response the "best in years." Her clarification follows previous statements from both herself and the president suggesting the agency should be phased out. Critics argue that FEMA's capacity has been eroded under the current administration, potentially leaving it unprepared for future large-scale disasters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week as the administration plans to sell weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy is seen as a way to expedite military aid to Kyiv as it defends against Russian aggression. The meeting comes as the White House faces bipartisan pressure to take a harder line on Russia, including implementing a new, sweeping sanctions package. The plan to sell weapons represents a significant development in U.S. policy toward the conflict.</p>
