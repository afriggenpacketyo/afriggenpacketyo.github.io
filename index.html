          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle reportedly believed that delays in their children's U.K. passport issuance were linked to King Charles' reservations about their royal titles. The couple considered changing their family name to Spencer out of frustration, even discussing it with Earl Charles Spencer, Princess Diana's brother. Ultimately, the name change idea was abandoned when the passports for Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet arrived after a six-month wait, far exceeding the standard three-week processing time. Buckingham Palace denies any involvement from Charles or palace officials in the passport delay, despite claims that British officials were hesitant to include the HRH titles on the documents.</p>

This incident occurs amid pressure on ICE from the White House to increase arrests, with reports suggesting a target of 3,000 arrests per day.

          <p>Palestinian health officials and witnesses claim that at least five people were killed and others wounded by Israeli fire near aid distribution points in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military stated that they fired warning shots at individuals approaching their forces, but witnesses recount tanks firing directly at them. The incidents have raised concerns about the safety of aid distribution efforts, with one witness describing the situation as a "trap, not aid." The new aid hubs are set up inside Israeli military zones and are run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, intended to replace the UN coordinated system.</p>

Tice insisted the party knows "exactly what it is doing" and that the reorganization was necessary due to the demanding nature of the chairman's position.
