          <p>Following its highly successful initial public offering, design software company Figma has created immense paper wealth for its key venture capital backers, including Index Ventures and Sequoia. These firms collectively hold stock valued at approximately $24 billion after shares surged 250% on the first day of trading. The IPO's success is particularly notable after a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe fell through in 2023 due to regulatory opposition. This event marks a significant positive turn for the tech IPO market, which has been sluggish since late 2021, providing substantial potential returns for venture firms and their investors.

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized its new trade policy by signing an executive order that imposes higher tariffs on more than 60 countries, set to take effect in seven days. The duties range from 10% to over 40%, with nations like Syria, Laos, and Myanmar facing the highest rates. This move follows a self-imposed deadline for striking new trade deals, though some partners like Japan and the European Union secured agreements with lower rates. The order also increases duties on Canadian goods to 35% and grants Mexico a 90-day reprieve, signaling a significant and widespread restructuring of U.S. trade relationships.

The New York Yankees overhauled their bullpen by adding three new relievers, while the New York Mets also bolstered their pitching staff and acquired center fielder Cedric Mullins.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is advancing legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire fund, which compensates victims of fires caused by utility equipment and is at risk of depletion. The proposal would source half the amount, $9 billion, from customers of the state's largest utilities by extending a monthly surcharge for an additional decade. The remaining $9 billion would be contributed by the shareholders of Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric. The plan aims to ensure financial stability for the fund amid increasingly destructive wildfires driven by climate change, though it faces criticism from both consumer advocates and utility companies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a ruling that temporarily blocks the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The decision postpones the terminations, which were set to begin in August, until a hearing can be held in November. In her ruling, Judge Trina Thompson criticized the administration's motives, suggesting the decision was predetermined rather than based on an objective review of country conditions. This provides a temporary reprieve for individuals who have lived in the U.S. for many years under the program, which was initially granted due to natural disasters and civil unrest in their home countries.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that a majority of the 109,000 arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the first five months of President Trump's second term occurred in Southern and border states. Texas accounted for nearly a quarter of all arrests, followed by Florida, California, and Georgia, continuing a geographic trend influenced by demographics and local law enforcement cooperation. The data also shows that arrests have increased by 120% compared to the same period in the previous year. Most of the individuals arrested were from Latin American countries, primarily Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, reflecting the administration's intensified focus on interior immigration enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Genetic Research Reveals Potato Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has uncovered the surprising evolutionary origin of the potato, tracing it back to a tomato ancestor. Researchers discovered that the modern potato emerged from a hybridization event around nine million years ago between a non-tuber-producing wild potato species and an ancient tomato. This interbreeding provided the crucial genes necessary for the potato to develop its characteristic starchy tubers, solving a long-standing botanical puzzle. The findings, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, demonstrate how hybridization between different species can lead to the evolution of entirely new traits and the emergence of new plant varieties.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has exposed a covert operation where China is evading U.S. sanctions by purchasing Iranian oil through a network of untraceable tankers known as the "dark fleet." These ships conduct transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, switching off their transponders and obscuring their names to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which reportedly generates billions for Iran, undermines international sanctions aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program. Despite new U.S. sanctions, the activity appears to be increasing, highlighting the challenges of enforcing such measures when a major economic power like China does not recognize them.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially increased tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35%, a move that took effect Friday. The executive order applies to all products not covered by the existing US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. The White House cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of illicit drugs as the reason for the hike, although President Trump also linked the decision to Canada's recent recognition of a Palestinian state. This escalation in trade tensions comes after months of threats and has been met with concern in Canada, which sends approximately 75% of its exports to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of a 79-year-old woman killed in a car crash in Cornwall is advocating for an overhaul of the driving regulations for older adults in the UK. They believe the current system, which relies on self-declaration of medical fitness for drivers over 70, is inadequate and contributed to the fatal accident. Statistics show that while older drivers are a growing demographic, they are overrepresented in serious collisions, often due to medical issues or errors in judgment. The incident has intensified the debate around mandatory medical checks and vision tests for elderly drivers, a measure supported by some safety groups and optometrist associations to improve road safety.</p>

The crash occurred when a Model S owner, using Enhanced Autopilot, accelerated through an intersection and struck two pedestrians, killing one and severely injuring the other.

          <p>Social media platforms like X and Reddit are blocking a wide range of content, including posts about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as they attempt to comply with the UK's new Online Safety Act. The legislation, aimed at protecting minors from harmful material, has resulted in the restriction of legitimate public interest content for users who have not verified their age. BBC Verify found that parliamentary debates on grooming gangs and even historical artwork have been restricted, sparking concerns from experts that companies are over-applying the law and stifling important public discourse. The act imposes heavy fines for non-compliance, creating pressure that may lead to overly cautious content moderation.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Restrict Civil Service Internships to Students from Poorer Backgrounds</h2>

          <p>The UK government has announced a policy change that will restrict its main civil service internship program exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative is part of a broader effort to increase working-class representation within Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns from the program will also be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route. The reform, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to harness a wider range of talent and improve government decision-making by incorporating more diverse perspectives and experiences.</p>

          <p>Responding to questions about the company's artificial intelligence strategy, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the tech giant is "very open" to making acquisitions of any size to accelerate its AI roadmap. During an earnings call, Cook confirmed that Apple will significantly increase its investments in AI and is reallocating internal resources to focus on developing personal and private AI features. While Apple's capital expenditures are lower than its competitors, the comments suggest a more aggressive approach to catching up in the AI race, potentially through major strategic purchases to complement its internal development and hybrid investment model.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has provided new details on his plan to counter a potential Republican redistricting effort by calling a special election in California. He is considering a November 4 vote to ask Californians to approve new congressional district maps, which would be drawn by the legislature and remain in effect until 2030. Newsom frames this as a defensive measure against President Trump's call for GOP-controlled states to redraw their maps to maintain a House majority in the midterm elections. The governor stated the cost of a special election would be mitigated by consolidating it with existing local elections, arguing the price of preserving democracy is "priceless."</p>

          <p>Florida executed Edward Zakrzewski on Thursday, marking the ninth execution in the state this year and setting a new single-year record since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Zakrzewski was convicted of killing his wife and two young children in 1994 after his wife sought a divorce. His execution proceeded after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final appeal. Florida has carried out more executions than any other state in 2025, with two more scheduled for August. Opponents of the execution had highlighted Zakrzewski's military service and the non-unanimous jury recommendation for his death sentence, which would not be permissible under current state law.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet trade deadline, making only minor additions to their roster while other National League contenders made blockbuster deals. The team acquired veteran reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, addressing needs in the bullpen and outfield without giving up significant prospect capital. The front office's strategy reflects their stated confidence in the current roster, which they believe is talented enough to win another World Series. Rather than making a big splash, the Dodgers are betting on the return of injured players and improved performance from their established stars to carry them through the postseason.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing for its FICO credit scores, pushing back against criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In an interview, Lansing argued that the cost of a mortgage score, which he stated is under $5, is negligible compared to thousands in closing costs and is not an obstacle to homeownership. His comments follow the FHFA's decision to allow mortgage lenders to use a rival score from VantageScore, a move Lansing claims introduces risk to the market. He asserted FICO's dominance and superior predictiveness, stating it remains the industry standard in markets without a government mandate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic downtown Los Angeles restaurant, has delayed its planned closure by 45 days due to an overwhelming outpouring of community support. Since announcing its closure, the establishment, which claims to have invented the French dip sandwich, has seen massive lines of customers wanting one last meal. The surge in business, combined with advocacy from local groups, allowed owner Cedd Moses to negotiate a temporary extension with the landlord. While the extension provides a brief reprieve and keeps staff employed, Moses stated it is unlikely to be permanent and is actively seeking a new buyer who will respect the landmark's legacy.</p>

          <p>After an 18-month endeavor to forge a career in American football, Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has announced he is leaving the NFL to return to rugby union. The 24-year-old, who had spells with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars practice squads, never played in a regular-season NFL game. In a social media post, Rees-Zammit called the experience great but stated it was time to come home and do what he does best. His decision allows him time to secure a contract and prepare for the upcoming rugby season, where he was a celebrated international player with 32 caps for Wales before his departure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's aggressive tariff strategy has culminated in a series of new trade deals and unilaterally imposed duties, avoiding the immediate market panic seen in earlier months. The administration is framing this as a victory that will boost revenue and domestic manufacturing. However, this analysis suggests that while a full-blown trade war has been averted for now, the new global trade landscape comes at a high price, with U.S. consumers likely to face higher costs. The long-term repercussions remain uncertain, as the policies could prompt key allies to form new economic alliances that bypass the U.S., potentially undermining America's central role in the global economy.
