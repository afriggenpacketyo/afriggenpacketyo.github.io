          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:04:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, financial experts are analyzing the shifting landscape for savers. The reduction is expected to cause rates on high-yield savings and certificate of deposit (CD) accounts to continue their gradual decline. Consequently, the article suggests that opening a long-term CD now could be an advantageous move to lock in current, higher rates. This strategy would protect savings from potential future rate cuts and provide a guaranteed return in an otherwise unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the new range to between 4% and 4.25%. This marks the first rate reduction since December 2024 and is a response to a stalling labor market and slowing economic growth. The decision highlights the central bank's challenge of simultaneously curbing inflation while supporting employment. The move also occurs amid significant political pressure from President Trump, who has been advocating for more aggressive rate cuts to stimulate the economy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut is set to have a mixed but tangible impact on household finances across the United States. Borrowers with variable-rate products like credit cards will likely see their interest rates decrease almost immediately, providing some relief from high costs. However, the effect on fixed-rate loans such as mortgages and auto loans will be more gradual, while savers will likely see diminished returns on high-yield savings accounts and CDs. The change offers benefits for borrowers but presents challenges for those relying on interest income.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts project the storm will remain over open waters for several days and does not pose an immediate threat to any land areas. However, meteorologists predict it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it moves north of the Caribbean. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been less active than initially predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man was seriously injured in Yellowstone National Park after being attacked by a bear, believed to be a grizzly, on the Turbid Lake trail. The hiker suffered wounds to his chest and arm but was able to deploy bear repellent during the encounter; his injuries are not considered life-threatening. After being walked out by park medics, he was airlifted to a nearby hospital. Officials have closed the trail but stated the bear will not be euthanized as it was a surprise encounter and did not display unnatural behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day by eating fermented fruit. The study provides direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits chimps eat, supporting the 'drunken monkey' hypothesis that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary origins. Scientists clarified that the chimpanzees are exposed to a steady, low dose of alcohol rather than experiencing actual intoxication, which would require binging on large quantities of the fruit.</p>

          <p>According to CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, North Korean operatives are leveraging generative artificial intelligence to create sophisticated fake resumes and LinkedIn profiles to secure IT jobs within companies. Once hired, these covert agents gain network access, which can then be used for espionage or other malicious activities, a tactic Kurtz described as 'game over' for the infiltrated firm. This development underscores the escalating threat landscape, demonstrating how adversaries are using AI to democratize destruction and making advanced cybersecurity defenses essential for businesses.

          <p>President Donald Trump has arrived in the UK for an unprecedented second state visit, a formal trip typically not offered to second-term U.S. presidents. His three-day agenda is filled with royal pageantry, including a formal welcome by King Charles III at Windsor Castle, a state banquet, and a carriage procession. The visit also includes a substantive meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers to discuss a potential UK-US trade deal. The trip is taking place amid significant security and planned protests against the president in London.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that the reliability of official U.S. economic data is declining, creating a 'black box' for policymakers and businesses. Key statistics on jobs, income, and spending are becoming less accurate due to plummeting response rates for government surveys and chronic underfunding of federal statistical agencies. This issue was highlighted by a recent, unusually large downward revision of 911,000 jobs. The article argues that the government should supplement its outdated methods by incorporating more dynamic, real-time data from private sector sources to get a clearer picture of the economy.

          <p>After a remarkable surge of nearly 80% since early 2024, the price of gold may continue to climb, with some analysts predicting it could exceed $4,000 per ounce this month. This bullish outlook is fueled by several economic factors, including the potential for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which typically increases gold's appeal over interest-bearing assets. Additionally, persistent inflation and broader market uncertainty are driving investors toward the precious metal as a traditional safe-haven asset, which could push its price to new record highs.

Moreno, who now resides in Paraguay, claims the charges are a 'farce' and constitute political persecution orchestrated by his predecessor and political rival, Rafael Correa, as retaliation for past electoral defeats.</p>
