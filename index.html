          <p>Wealthy Gulf states have pledged significant investments in the United States, but declining oil prices may hinder their ability to fulfill these commitments.

This could impact Saudi Arabia's ambitious Vision 2030 modernization plan and regional projects like reconstruction efforts in Gaza. Experts suggest that Saudi Arabia may need to reallocate existing investments or borrow to meet its financial obligations, and previous pledges have largely gone unfulfilled.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has indefinitely banned chess, citing concerns that the game promotes gambling. The decision comes as officials assess the compatibility of chess with Islamic law. This restriction is the latest in a series of measures imposed by the Taliban, which have already limited women's participation in sports. The suspension of chess has raised concerns among cafe owners in Kabul who hosted informal chess competitions, impacting their businesses and limiting recreational activities for young people.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's reported willingness to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar's royal family, valued at approximately $400 million, has triggered accusations of bribery and corruption. The jet, potentially to be used as Air Force One, would later be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation. Critics argue the gift violates the Constitution's Emoluments Clause and raises ethical concerns. Trump's attorney general and White House lawyer have reportedly concluded the gift is legally permissible, but the move has sparked widespread condemnation.</p>

          <p>A recent Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Walton Goggins as a flirty waiter who is overly interested in middle-aged mothers falls short of challenging stereotypes. While the sketch attempts to subvert the idea that mothers are undesirable, it ultimately reinforces the notion that they are ridiculous for being the object of desire. The sketch's punchline hinges on the absurdity of a younger man being attracted to "silly, frumpy old moms," thus failing to provide a refreshing perspective on motherhood and sexuality.</p>
