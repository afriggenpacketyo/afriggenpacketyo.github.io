          <p>President Trump, while addressing questions after a Cabinet meeting, conceded that his trade war with China might lead to some Americans having to make do with less. He suggested that while there might be some disruptions, the impact would be more significant for China, which relies on the U.S. market. Trump insisted that many of the goods imported from China are not essential for Americans, arguing that the U.S. has been exploited by other countries, particularly China. The article highlights Trump's perspective on the trade imbalance and his resolve to secure a fairer deal, emphasizing that the long-term benefits would outweigh any short-term sacrifices.

          <p>President Trump addressed concerns raised by Joe Rogan regarding the aggressive deportation of migrants, emphasizing that his administration is being careful in its approach. Rogan had warned against becoming 'monsters' while fighting monsters, referring to the potential for violating due process. Trump claimed that those being deported are criminals and that a different standard applies to individuals entering the country illegally.

          <p>President Trump attributed the U.S. economy's contraction in the first quarter of 2025 to the policies of former President Joe Biden, suggesting he would also blame Biden for the second quarter's economic results. He claimed that the negative GDP and market declines were due to the situation he inherited upon taking office in late January. However, the Commerce Department report indicated that the GDP figure reflected a surge in imports ahead of Trump's promised tariffs, along with a decrease in government spending. The article contrasts Trump's blame-casting with his previous efforts to take credit for positive economic developments during Biden's term.</p>

          <p>European carmakers, including Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Volkswagen, are facing significant challenges due to tariffs introduced by President Trump on cars, steel, and aluminum. The tariffs have created chaos and uncertainty, making it difficult for these companies to assess the impact and plan for the future. Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis have suspended their financial forecasts for 2025, while Volkswagen has scaled back its profit expectations. The leading German automakers group welcomed Trump's move to provide some flexibility but called it a small step that only slightly eased the burden caused by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) during the first quarter of 2025, largely attributed to the chaotic start of President Trump's second term and the implementation of tariffs. The decrease was influenced by a surge in imports as consumers and businesses sought to purchase goods before the tariffs took effect. While underlying economic growth remained solid, the figures reflect the disruptive impact of Trump's trade policies. Economists anticipate further slowdown in the coming months due to the rising prices and uncertainty caused by the tariffs, though some positive news emerged regarding inflation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with the gross domestic product shrinking at a 0.3% annual rate, largely attributed to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The slowdown raises concerns about a potential recession, although economists caution that the figures may be distorted due to the surge in imports. The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has also impacted growth through agency closures and workforce reductions. Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Endangered axolotls, a unique amphibian species, have shown promising signs of survival and adaptation after being released into artificial wetlands near Mexico City. Scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls and tracked their progress, discovering that they successfully foraged and even gained weight in the restored habitat. This study offers hope for the long-term survival of the axolotl, which has been pushed to the brink of extinction due to urbanization and pollution. Researchers collaborated with local farmers and volunteers to create wetland refuges, installing natural filtering systems to clean the water.</p>

          <p>Snap shares experienced a significant drop after the social media company decided to withhold second-quarter guidance, citing macroeconomic uncertainties affecting advertising demand. The company acknowledged headwinds at the start of the current quarter and indicated a need to balance investment with revenue growth. Snap's finance chief noted that some advertisers are already feeling the impact of changes to the de minimis exemption, which allows shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. The company's ad revenues grew 9% year over year to $1.21 billion during the quarter.</p>

          <p>Recent attempts to redesign state flags in various U.S. states indicate a growing interest in state identities. Research shows that a majority of Americans consider their state to be important to their identity, similar to the importance placed on party membership, race, or religion. People are more likely to identify strongly with their state if they align with its partisan leanings. Strong state identities can improve trust in government and increase willingness to share resources with fellow state residents. The connection to one's state can serve as a proxy for national identity during times of political division.</p>

CEO Josh Silverman noted that Etsy is 'vastly less' dependent on products from China, which was hit by aggressive levies of 145%.

The court's conservatives argue that denying public funding to religious groups violates the First Amendment's protection for the 'free exercise' of religion.

The editorial argues that the bailout was influenced by Milei's close relationship with Donald Trump and raises concerns about the IMF's independence. It suggests that Milei's strategy of austerity and export-led recovery is dangerously optimistic and risks causing economic collapse. The editorial advocates for alternative approaches, such as taxing export windfalls and investing in state-led industry, to stabilize Argentina's economy.</p>

The resolution, led by Senators Ron Wyden and Rand Paul, seeks to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs.

Trump's administration has faced criticism over the economic impact of the tariffs, and anxieties continue to run high.

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first three months of 2025 due to an import surge at the start of President Trump's second term, influenced by his trade war policies. The gross domestic product fell at a 0.3% annualized pace, marking the first quarter of negative growth since 2022. Economists suggest that the contraction may be due to companies trying to front-run tariffs. Consumer spending slowed, while private domestic investment soared, potentially driven by tariff concerns. Trump blamed his predecessor for the economic downturn, while experts noted that the inflation data will reveal the price increases of tariffs on consumers.</p>
