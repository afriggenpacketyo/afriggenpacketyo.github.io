          <p>The European Commission has unveiled a proposed €2 trillion, seven-year budget framework, significantly increasing defense and space investment fivefold to €131 billion. This "era of rearmament" reflects growing geopolitical concerns and aims to enhance European competitiveness and strategic autonomy. The plan also allocates substantial funds for climate initiatives, migration management, and continued support for Ukraine. The proposal, which faces scrutiny from member states, seeks new revenue streams to avoid increasing national contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has publicly stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, contradicting earlier reports from a senior White House official. Those reports claimed Trump intended to dismiss Powell soon, having told Republican lawmakers of his plan and even drafted a letter to that effect. The administration has been pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates, and this latest development adds to the uncertainty surrounding the central bank's leadership and monetary policy. The situation remains fluid amid conflicting statements from the White House and Congress.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly denounced a segment of his own supporters who are demanding the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, labeling the controversy a "hoax." In a social media post, he called these backers "weaklings" and stated he no longer wants their support, urging them to focus on his administration's successes instead. This comes after the Justice Department announced no further files would be released and that a rumored "client list" does not exist, creating a rift within the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer of the CNBC Investing Club has indicated a readiness to sell more shares of Coterra Energy, the portfolio's only oil and natural gas stock. The move is prompted by concerns over falling oil prices and dissatisfaction with the company's operational performance. The club recently sold some shares and downgraded the stock, with Cramer suggesting that Coterra's decision not to cut its Permian rig count was a negative signal.

          <p>The Trump administration has deported five non-citizen convicted criminals to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini, a nation with which they have no prior connection. The deportees, originally from five different countries, were described by a Homeland Security official as individuals whose home countries refused to accept them. The move is part of a controversial "safe third country" policy and has sparked concern in Eswatini, with a pro-democracy group condemning the deal. The arrangement highlights the administration's aggressive and unconventional approach to immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A year after endorsing Donald Trump, Elon Musk's political influence has undergone a significant transformation, marked by controversy and a recent, public falling out with the president. The billionaire established a government efficiency task force and became a vocal supporter of the American and European right, but his popularity has declined. Recently, Musk has publicly criticized Trump's spending policies and hinted at forming a new political party, signaling the end of their alliance. This article chronicles his turbulent journey from presidential ally to a powerful and unpredictable political force.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old golfer, Simon John Mariani, has died from injuries sustained after being struck by lightning while playing at a golf course in New Jersey. The incident occurred last week during a competition where he was playing with his father. Fellow golfers and his father administered first aid before he was airlifted to a hospital, but he passed away on Monday. The tragic event serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of severe weather, cutting short the life of a young man remembered by his family as driven and dedicated.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister François Bayrou has proposed a controversial plan to eliminate two of the country's eleven public holidays to boost productivity and help reduce national debt. The proposal to make people work on Easter Monday and May 8th has drawn immediate protest from political opponents and unions. This is not the first time such a measure has been tried; in 2003, Whit Monday was converted into a "Day of Solidarity" to fund elder care. The debate highlights the tension between economic imperatives and cherished cultural traditions in France.</p>

          <p>A review by the UK's independent Prevent commissioner has found that the country's counter-terrorism program missed multiple opportunities to intervene with Axel Rudakubana, who later murdered three children in Southport. Teachers had referred him to the Prevent scheme three times due to his obsession with violence, but his case was closed each time because he lacked a specific terrorist ideology. The review concluded the program must be adapted to handle individuals fascinated by extreme violence, even without a clear ideological motive, to potentially avert future tragedies.</p>
