          <p>Charles Rangel, a former New York Representative and founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in the House from 1971 to 2017, chairing the House Ways and Means Committee for a time and earning respect for his dedication to Harlem and his legislative achievements.

          <p>Spain has requested that European countries suspend arms shipments to Israel amid growing international condemnation of its actions in Gaza. Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called for an immediate suspension of Europe's cooperation deal with Israel and an arms embargo at a meeting of the "Madrid Group." While Israel is a significant arms exporter, it also relies on imports, with the United States and Germany being its primary suppliers. While some EU nations have reduced or suspended arms exports, a major change in US foreign policy would be required to significantly impact Israel's arms capabilities.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed its sporadic eruption, sending lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing plumes of ash and volcanic material. The activity lasted for several hours, with lava fountains reaching heights of over 1,000 feet from the north vent and over 800 feet from the south vent. The lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera, posing no immediate threat to residential areas. The eruption also released a plume containing ash, volcanic rock, and Pele's hair, prompting warnings for residents and visitors to exercise caution due to potential hazards from wind-carried volcanic fragments.</p>

Trump's comments followed Russia's intensified aerial attacks on Ukraine. Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, stated that Ukraine's allies have removed range limits on supplied arms, potentially allowing Kyiv to strike military positions within Russia. The latest attacks were a response to Ukrainian actions against Russia's "social infrastructure," according to the Kremlin.</p>
