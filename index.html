          <p>Former Alabama football coach Nick Saban shared an anecdote about the team's 2018 White House visit during a commencement speech at the University of Alabama. Saban recalled how former Alabama linebacker Rashaan Evans pushed the red button on a box on President Trump's desk after being encouraged to do so, resulting in a lady bringing in a Coke on a tray. Saban expressed his gratitude to Trump for choosing the university for his commencement address and making time to speak to the graduates, highlighting Trump's graciousness as a host and the first president to invite the team back to the Oval Office. The speech preceded the school's official commencement ceremonies, which commenced the following day.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from a sharp sell-off in April, fueled by optimism regarding potential trade negotiations. The S&P 500 is nearing levels seen before President Trump's tariff announcements triggered market turmoil. Despite this recovery, the S&P 500 remains below its mid-February peak and has fallen since Trump's inauguration, with concerns lingering about the long-term impact of tariffs on economic growth, as many imports now face increased taxes, and volatility on Wall Street continues to be driven by concerns about the economic fallout from the Trump administration‚Äôs policies. The article indicates that even the prospect of talks has been enough to ease the worst of the anxiety that gripped investors a month ago (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A collision between a pickup truck and a tour van near Yellowstone National Park resulted in seven fatalities and eight injuries. The accident occurred near Henry's Lake State Park in eastern Idaho, a location known for heavy tourist traffic.

The surviving passengers were transported to nearby hospitals, and investigations are underway to determine the cause of the accident, which took first responders an unnervingly long time to arrive at due to the remote location.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a significant reduction in NASA's budget, cutting approximately $6 billion while reallocating $1 billion to Mars-focused programs. This shift aligns with the administration's goal of prioritizing a return to the Moon and putting the first human on Mars. NASA acting administrator Janet Petro acknowledged that the proposed budget would necessitate difficult choices, including streamlining operations, terminating some missions, and reducing spending on space science and Earth science. The changes would also see the retirement of the SLS rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the Gateway programs, as well as ending green aviation spending and the Mars Sample Return Program.</p>

The American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) aim to sustain the momentum of the next report, which is due in 2027. The NCA is a comprehensive report on the impacts of climate change in the United States, and its models are used to estimate future impacts, with its projections being used to make informed decisions. The Trump administration has publicly denied the science of climate change and dismissed the NCA report in the past, also withdrawing the United States from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>

          <p>Temu, known for ultra-discounted items shipped directly from China, has altered its business model in the U.S. due to the expiration of the de minimis rule, which allowed duty-free entry for items under $800. The company has shifted to displaying products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses and is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform. This change comes as the Trump administration's new rules on low-value shipments and tariffs on China take effect, forcing Temu to raise prices and suspend its aggressive online advertising campaign. The shift is part of the company's efforts to improve service levels, and Temu advertises that local products have ‚Äúno import charges‚Äù and ‚Äúno extra charges upon delivery.‚Äù</p>

          <p>Amid the largest measles outbreak in 25 years, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will direct federal health agencies to explore potential new treatments for the disease, including vitamins. This decision has sparked concerns among experts who fear it will undermine public confidence in vaccines, as studies show the M.M.R. shot is 97 percent effective in preventing the disease. Critics argue that Kennedy has focused too much on untested treatments and offered only muted support for the measles vaccine. The decision to prioritize treatments over vaccination could have grave consequences, especially in areas with low vaccination rates.</p>

The Rapid Support Forces (R.S.F.) claimed responsibility for the attack, stating they targeted Nahud, which was held by the Sudanese military.

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 25 million shares in the company over the next year, according to a financial filing. The stake would be worth about $4.8 billion at the current price. The disclosure follows Amazon's first-quarter earnings report late Thursday. The results show that Amazon is bracing for uncertainty related to President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs. The company landed in the crosshairs of the White House this week over a report that Amazon planned to show shoppers the cost of the tariffs.</p>

Harry said that, regardless of whether he is carrying out royal duties, the security risks he face remain the same - and have gotten worse in recent years.

          <p>America's largest shoe brands, including Nike, Adidas, Skechers, and Under Armour, are asking President Donald Trump for a tariff reprieve. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade group sent a letter to the White House this week asking for an exemption to Trump's so-called "reciprocal tariffs," which the association said pose an "existential threat" to the footwear industry. The letter is signed by 76 footwear brands. The group further warned that the tariffs won't result in bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., as Trump has promised, because they erase the certainty that businesses require in order to invest in sourcing changes.</p>

That followed an August ruling that Google has held a monopoly in its core market of internet search, the most-significant antitrust ruling in the tech industry since the case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago. Google is in a unique position as it tries to not only defend itself from antitrust allegations in court but also stay ahead of increasing competition in the generative AI market.</p>

          <p>NPR is seeking stories from individuals who are expected to start repaying defaulted student loans as the pandemic-era reprieve comes to an end. After a five-year pause enacted by President Trump in March 2020, his second administration is ending the pandemic-era reprieve and restarting forced collections on federal student loans starting on Monday, May 5. Millions of Americans will have to start repaying student loans that are in default, with that number potentially growing to almost 10 million in the coming months. Borrowers who are behind on payments could face repercussions like having their wages garnished and watching their credit scores plummet.</p>

The plan does give states more flexibility on how they can use that smaller pool of money, by sending it in the form of block grants. The impact of HUD cuts would ripple across local communities, affecting much more than housing.</p>

Although the amount of crude oil currently leaking out of the well is not yet known, a report from the U.S. Coast Guard's National Response Center earlier this week said "the amount discharged could potentially reach the threshold of a major spill for coastal waters (over 100,000 gallons)." The leak was first reported on Friday, April 26, as a "well blowout." The cause is not yet known.
