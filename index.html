          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has criticized the Home Office for failing to track whether foreign workers leave the country after their visas expire. The report highlights that since the skilled worker visa route was introduced in 2020, there has been no analysis of exit checks, leaving a significant data gap on the system's effectiveness. The committee also pointed to widespread evidence of worker exploitation, accusing the department of being slow to address issues like debt bondage and excessive working hours under the visa scheme.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has called for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys, raising concerns for market leader Pop Mart, known for its popular Labubu dolls. Despite a temporary stock dip, analysts believe the company will remain resilient as its primary demographic consists of young adults, not the children targeted by the proposed rules. The company's significant and growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, are also expected to cushion it from potential domestic regulatory impacts.

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed in the west Highlands of Scotland. The event, which occurred early Thursday, was witnessed by dozens of people who reported a bright orange glow and a loud bang. Using observational data, UKMON calculated that the meteor, originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, likely scattered pieces over a wide, remote area between Loch Treig and Loch Etricht. Hillwalkers are being asked to look for the fragments, though finding them is considered challenging.</p>

The man suffered severe injuries to his lower body after being run over by a small boat that fled the scene. His teenage daughter had to help rescue him before he was airlifted to a hospital in Miami for intensive care. The family is now seeking to identify the two men in the boat, which was operating illegally close to the shore.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially become the first state to formally recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, a move the Taliban's foreign minister called "courageous." The decision was conveyed by Russia's ambassador in Kabul and is seen by Moscow as a step toward developing bilateral cooperation in areas like energy and security. This recognition comes despite widespread international condemnation of the Taliban's human rights record, particularly its severe restrictions on women and girls. Russia, which maintained its embassy in Kabul after the 2021 takeover, had previously removed the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has again vowed to tackle the issue of overcapacity and excessive low-price competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a meeting with industry leaders, the Minister of Industry and Information Technology stated that outdated production capacity should be phased out to ensure healthy and sustainable development. This follows a directive from President Xi Jinping to address the problem. China's solar industry, a global leader, has been facing internal challenges due to rapid expansion leading to a glut of products and fierce price wars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day tour of rural counties in South Carolina, a key early presidential primary state, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. The visit, organized with the state's Democratic Party, will focus on economically challenged and environmentally vulnerable areas. While Newsom's political advisors deny the trip is about a presidential run, insisting the focus is on the 2026 midterms and highlighting issues in rural communities, the move is widely seen as an effort to build a national profile and make inroads in a crucial southern state.</p>

The scientific breakthrough involved reprogramming human stem cells to improve their survival and integrating them into pig embryos at an early stage. This research, which follows the team's previous success in growing humanized kidneys in pigs, represents a significant step forward in the field of chimera research. The ultimate goal of such studies is to grow human organs in animals for transplantation.</p>

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress have filed a legal brief supporting an NAACP lawsuit that challenges the Trump administration's overhaul of the U.S. Department of Education. The lawmakers argue that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish or dismantle a federal agency, a power that belongs to Congress. The move comes after the administration slashed the department's staff and paused over $6 billion in congressionally appropriated education programs, actions the lawsuit contends are illegal and harmful to students and educators nationwide.</p>

At a news conference, speakers argued that the mission places unprepared troops in inappropriate situations, pitting them against American citizens and straining military families. A retired lieutenant colonel described the situation as "making America militarized again," expressing fears that the administration is pushing the military dangerously close to violating the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

According to the Deportation Data Project, about half of all detainees have no criminal record, a group that has grown significantly in recent months amid the administration's mass deportation campaign. This trend contradicts official statements focusing on "the worst of the worst," and highlights the impact on long-term residents, including a pastor who was recently deported after living in the U.S. for 30 years without a criminal history.</p>
