          <p>A Fox News opinion piece claims that broadcast networks exhibit bias in their coverage of political books, favoring "tell-all" books about Trump while downplaying those about Biden. The article cites examples from 2018, when ABC, CBS, and NBC dedicated significant coverage to Michael Wolff's anti-Trump book "Fire and Fury" and Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged." In contrast, the piece argues, these networks gave limited attention to Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book about Biden after he left the White House. The author suggests that networks actively promote a Democrat-friendly narrative while neglecting to scrutinize it, and are now repeating the Democrat message of the day without seriously questioning it.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, a significant milestone in underwater communication. The project team, led by Professor He Chengbing at Northwestern Polytechnical University, developed a self-tuning system that maps signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement could pave the way for the real-life use of long-range undersea messaging, with profound civilian and military applications.

The article also connects Smith's story to broader societal trends, such as the trad-wife movement and pronatalism, which reduce women to their reproductive capacity.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic scrutinizes a report cited by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to justify an FDA safety review of mifepristone, a drug used in medical abortions. The report, published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, claims mifepristone is dangerous, contradicting numerous scientific trials. The author argues that the report lacks transparency, uses peculiar methodologies, and counts unrelated events as adverse effects. Experts criticize the report's rigor, suggesting it is part of a larger strategy to restrict access to mifepristone despite evidence supporting its safety. The article raises concerns that political influence could sway the FDA's review, regardless of scientific evidence.</p>

          <h2>Officials Warn Trump Administration is Minimizing White Supremacist Threat</h2>

          <p>Current and former state department officials are raising concerns that the Trump administration is downplaying the threat from white supremacists, both domestically and internationally. The article highlights a new style guide that bans the term "racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism" and proposed cuts to offices working on countering violent extremism. The coming changes at the state department follow a pattern of moving resources away from programs that work on the threat of the far right since Trump took office. Officials and experts suspect that the cuts to those programs, particularly to violence prevention programs, probably stemmed from a desire to just “move fast and break things” in the spirit of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), rather than a pointed agenda to upend the government’s ability to track and battle the far right.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread criticism, the "defund the police" movement has led to lasting changes in some cities, including Austin and Seattle, where funds were diverted from law enforcement to social services. Milwaukee also saw money redirected to affordable housing and youth programs. Seattle launched a third public safety department to respond to mental health crises, while Austin increased investment in homeless services. The article explores how these cities are reimagining public safety by prioritizing community needs. Political organizers acknowledge the challenges and backlash but emphasize that the movement sparked important conversations about city priorities.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that UK workers continue to work from home more than most of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week of remote work. Hybrid working has become the dominant model in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. The popularity of home working in the UK is attributed to the cost and length of commuting. While some companies have introduced strict return-to-office mandates, home working levels have stabilized in the UK since 2023. The study also finds that men and women work from home at similar rates, with a stronger preference for hybrid work among parents and for office work among younger employees.</p>

          <p>Critics are condemning the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" for making permanent tax cuts that primarily benefit wealthy Americans while cutting essential government assistance programs. The bill, which Republicans are trying to pass in Congress, extends tax cuts established in 2017, including deductions for pass-through entities and corporate tax rates. To offset the cost, Republicans are pairing the tax reductions with cuts to programs like Medicaid and Snap, as well as ending clean energy tax credits. Economists argue that the tax cuts have done little to help the middle class, while Democrats denounce the bill as a cruel and dangerous scheme that will harm working-class families.</p>

          <p>An article in Vox discusses the death of 4,000 chicks in the mail and highlights the broader issue of animal deaths during transportation in the meat industry. Animals raised for food are often transported multiple times throughout their lives, and they're typically treated like cargo rather than living, feeling animals. The article details the conditions on factory farms, the process of transporting chickens to slaughterhouses, and the lack of federal protections for animals during transport. The author argues that the meat industry prioritizes profit over animal welfare, leading to preventable deaths.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her colleagues found that the anatomy of ancient invertebrate armor resembled the teeth of vertebrates. By scanning fossilized bumps and analyzing the tooth-like scales of modern-day fish embryos, they discovered nerves, suggesting that ancient fish used their armor to sense the water around them. The article explores the evolutionary origins of tooth sensitivity and the surprising connections between ancient creatures and modern-day humans.</p>
