          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is conducting a three-day state visit to the U.K., marked by royal pageantry and high-level talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Discussions are focused on migration, defense, and trade, but are overshadowed by the looming threat of U.S. tariffs under President Trump. The European Union is uncertain about the extent of potential duties, creating economic anxiety as it rushes to negotiate a trade deal with Washington. This visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit, highlights the complex geopolitical and economic challenges facing both nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued without any visible injuries after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, part of the Clearwater Project, with the collapse happening several miles from the tunnel's only access point. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed its Urban Search and Rescue teams in a massive response effort. The workers managed to climb over a large pile of dirt to reach safety, averting a potential tragedy in the seven-mile-long construction project.</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has authorized Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-cutting measure. This reform to the Universal Service Obligation (USO) is a response to the declining volume of letter mail, which has driven up costs. Under the new rules, first-class letters will still be delivered six days a week, but second-class mail will be limited to every other weekday. Ofcom has also adjusted delivery targets to balance service and financial viability for the postal service.</p>

          <p>In an interview with the BBC, former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that his fellow Democrats allowed the US-Mexico border to be "under siege" during the Biden presidency. Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, remarked that "Trump was right" on the need for a protected border, a position he believes all public officials should have shared. His comments highlight an internal Democratic debate over immigration policy as the Trump administration ramps up deportation efforts. Kerry emphasized that a nation cannot exist without secure borders and wished President Biden had more forcefully articulated a commitment to enforcing the law.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the potential to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's institutional credibility and stable macroeconomic fundamentals. In a recent article, Sheng Songcheng noted that the yuan has shown resilience and reduced sensitivity to global risk indicators, such as the war in Ukraine and U.S. tariffs. The argument suggests that with greater capital-control flexibility and foreign participation, the yuan could offer an alternative to traditional safe-haven currencies. This debate gains relevance as confidence in the dollar is tested by U.S. debt and protectionist policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is witnessing the rapid emergence of a massive market for weight-loss drugs, estimated to be worth around $150 billion, as dozens of domestic producers compete for a share. This growth mirrors trends in the West, driven by rising obesity rates, the approval of new, more effective medications, and celebrity endorsements. Innovent Biologics, a Jiangsu-based firm, became the first domestic company to receive approval to market such a drug in the country.

          <p>Vienna is often cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its extensive and stable social housing system, which comprises about 43% of the city's housing stock. This system, originating from the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s, provides affordable, high-quality housing to a broad range of income levels, not just the poor. The large social sector helps to keep rent levels down across the entire market, including in the private sector. While the model faces challenges regarding accessibility for newcomers, it demonstrates how long-term political commitment to non-market housing can effectively address affordability crises.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology have successfully created a cyborg bee by developing the world's lightest insect brain controller. Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to the bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that command the bee's flight, allowing researchers to direct it to turn, advance, or retreat. In tests, the bee obeyed the commands with a 90% success rate, marking a significant advancement in micro-robotics and bio-integrated technology.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens about an increased risk of kidnapping, following multiple recent incidents targeting Chinese nationals. The warning urges Chinese women in particular to avoid going out alone, citing a serious threat to personal and property safety. Analysts suggest Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception that they carry large sums of cash and operate outside the formal banking system. This alert comes amid a general rise in kidnappings in South Africa and a recent fatal robbery targeting Chinese nationals.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Sues California Over State Regulations on Egg Production</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Trump administration has filed a federal lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's animal welfare laws for egg-laying hens are contributing to high egg prices nationwide. The lawsuit claims California's regulations, which mandate more space for chickens, constitute "unnecessary red tape" and unlawfully impact egg producers in other states. President Trump has frequently targeted rising egg prices, which have been largely driven by a major bird flu outbreak. The legal action contends that federal law requires national uniformity in egg safety standards, which California's rules allegedly violate.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked and sunk a second cargo ship in the Red Sea in one week, escalating threats to international shipping. The Greek-operated vessel, Eternity C, was hit by rocket-propelled grenades, leading to a search for its 25 crew members; six have been rescued, but at least three are confirmed dead. The Houthis claimed they attacked the ship because it was heading to Israel and have taken some surviving crew members to what they called a "safe location."

Ferrero, the owner of brands like Nutella and Kinder, has been actively expanding its portfolio in recent years.

In an upcoming speech, she will describe Britain's rising benefits bill as a "ticking time bomb" and criticize the Labour government's recent decision to water down its own planned cuts. The proposal aims to create a clear policy distinction with both Labour and Reform UK, which has pledged to scrap the two-child benefit cap.

While the broader economy has shown signs of slowing, the central bank is prioritizing financial stability over stimulating growth.

In contrast, the ferocity of the flood in Texas caught officials by surprise, resulting in at least 119 deaths.

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is expected to raise prices for a wide range of consumer goods, according to economists and industry experts. Copper is a vital component in electrical wiring, appliances, electronics, and vehicles, and the U.S. imports over half of its supply. The tariff, which Trump justified on national security grounds, could make home repairs, EVs, and appliances more expensive and increase costs for maintaining the nation's electrical grid.
