          <h2>Chicago Mayor Issues Executive Order to Counter Potential Federal Agent Deployment</h2>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks and requires them to display identifying information, such as badges. This preemptive measure reflects growing tensions between the city's leadership and the Trump administration over the use of federal forces in urban areas, with the mayor stating the city did not request such an intervention.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation suggests that famed Sheriff Buford Pusser, whose story inspired the movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his wife in 1967. Previously, it was believed Pauline Pusser was killed in an ambush intended for her husband. However, modern forensic analysis of her exhumed remains and the crime scene indicates the scene was staged, and a gunshot wound to the sheriff was likely self-inflicted, pointing to an act of intimate partner violence.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old shooter opened fire through the windows of a Minneapolis church during a school Mass, killing two children, ages 8 and 10, and injuring 18 other people. The assailant, armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Investigators found that the shooter was obsessed with past mass shootings and had legally purchased the firearms recently. The attack is being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs," deeming them illegal. The decision impacts levies on most countries, including those previously imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. However, sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, which were enacted under a different law, remain unaffected by the ruling, which the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.

          <p>A new stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds, according to UK researchers. The device records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds undetectable by the human ear, sending the data to an AI for instant analysis. A large study in London GP surgeries found the tool significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions, potentially leading to earlier and life-saving treatment for patients.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger" stars Peter Dinklage as the mutated hero and offers a more polished, well-made version of the Troma original. The review notes that while the film retains the gore and goofy parody of its source material, its higher production values and sincere emotional core create a different experience. The story centers on a janitor who, after being transformed by toxic waste, becomes a community hero by taking on a villainous pharmaceutical corporation.</p>
