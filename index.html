        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced a policy shift, allowing federal authorities to pursue reporters' phone records and compel testimony in leak investigations, reversing a Biden administration directive that sought to protect journalists. The internal Justice Department memo cites the need to safeguard a broad range of government secrets, including classified and privileged information. This move raises concerns among First Amendment advocates, particularly given President Trump's history of criticizing media leaks and his administration's confrontational approach to the press. The new policy requires the Attorney General's approval for questioning or arresting journalists. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering a health insurance executive in Manhattan, pleaded not guilty, prompting the presiding judge to caution the U.S. attorney general against politicizing the case. Mangione has garnered support from those critical of the for-profit health system, while Attorney General Pam Bondi has framed the case as part of President Trump's anti-crime agenda. The judge, Margaret Garnett, seeks to depoliticize the case amidst a charged atmosphere, with Mangione's supporters demonstrating outside the courthouse.

          <p>Several Democratic senators and representatives, including Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, have condemned the FBI's arrest of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on obstruction charges, alleging she shielded an indicted Mexican migrant from ICE agents.

The Democrats' outrage comes amid concerns about the Trump administration's use of federal law enforcement and ICE's actions.

These groups, though often banned in Pakistan, continue to operate with the alleged support of Pakistan's military intelligence, aiming to challenge control over Indian-administered regions of Kashmir. The article highlights the fluid nature of the militant landscape, with factions frequently changing allegiances and sharing fighters, making the insurgency difficult to track and contain.

          <p>The CBS newsmagazine "60 Minutes" is facing an unprecedented crisis following the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, who cited corporate interference related to President Trump's $20-billion lawsuit against CBS. Trump alleges the program was deceptively edited to favor then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The concern is that Paramount Global, seeking regulatory clearance for a merger with Skydance Media, may settle the lawsuit with an apology and payment to Trump, potentially undermining the program's journalistic independence. The staff fears that any willingness to placate the president could impact their ability to aggressively cover the Trump White House. Optimism score: 40</p>
