        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A German company, Moduleform, has designed an innovative vertical tiny home called the DQ Tower. This three-story prefabricated residence offers nearly 420 square feet of living space, including two bedrooms and two bathrooms, on a compact 13-by-13-foot footprint. Designed for urban lots or backyards, it features high-end finishes and large windows to maximize space and light. While currently priced at approximately $176,000 and not yet available in the U.S., this design presents a potential future for compact, sustainable urban living.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced an accelerated plan to increase the nation's defense budget, citing unprecedented threats to freedom since 1945. The annual defense spending is now projected to reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal previously set for 2030 and double the amount from when Macron took office in 2017. He attributed the need for a stronger military to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and uncertainties related to the United States. The Prime Minister is expected to provide further details on the budget adjustments soon.</p>

          <p>A serious incident involving a plane crash occurred at London Southend Airport, leading to the cancellation of all scheduled flights for the day. Emergency services, including police and fire crews, responded to reports of a 12-meter plane on fire shortly before 4:00 PM BST. An eyewitness described seeing the aircraft bank unusually after takeoff before it inverted and hit the ground, resulting in a large fireball. The airport has confirmed the incident and is working with authorities, promising to release more information as it becomes available.</p>

          <p>The latest 'Superman' film, directed by James Gunn, launched with a successful $122 million opening weekend in the U.S. and Canadian box offices. This marks a significant and much-needed victory for DC Studios, which has seen recent superhero films underperform. The movie is the first major release under the new leadership of Gunn and Peter Safran, intended to reboot the DC cinematic universe. Despite a high production cost of around $225 million and a weaker international opening of $95 million, the domestic debut is the third largest of 2025.</p>

          <p>A rapidly expanding wildfire in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire grew to over 500 acres, and firefighting efforts were complicated by a chlorine gas leak from a burned water treatment facility. Meanwhile, another large fire in Kaibab National Forest has forced evacuations. Concurrently, smoke from extensive wildfires in Canada is causing unhealthy air quality across the Upper Midwest, impacting states like Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.</p>

Graham described the legislation as a "sledgehammer" for President Trump, giving him the authority to place up to 500% tariffs on nations like China, India, and Brazil that purchase Russian goods. The move comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine.

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," has become a prominent defender of the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement policies. During a recent speech, he engaged with a heckler, and in subsequent interviews, he addressed controversy over his comments suggesting agents could question people based on "physical appearance." Homan clarified that physical description cannot be the sole factor for a stop but also admitted that U.S. citizens have been caught up in raids as "collateral arrests." His defense of the policies comes as the White House carries out large-scale deportation efforts and raids on communities, including farms.</p>

          <p>Two young men, 20-year-old U.S. citizen Sayfollah Musallet and 23-year-old Mohammed al-Shalabi, were killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in what their families describe as an attack by Israeli settlers. The families reported that the men were beaten and shot, with Musallet allegedly being lynched and left without medical aid for hours. The incident has drawn calls for an immediate investigation from the U.S. State Department. This event is the latest in a surge of settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which has become a daily reality since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A report from Iran's Fars news agency claims that President Masoud Pezeshkian was slightly injured during Israeli airstrikes last month. The attack on June 16 allegedly targeted a secret underground facility in Tehran where Pezeshkian was attending a meeting of the Supreme National Security Council. The strikes reportedly blocked all exits, and the president sustained leg injuries while escaping through an emergency shaft. This unverified report adds a new layer to the recent conflict, during which Israel launched a surprise attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that were set to begin on Monday, hoping to negotiate a trade deal with the Trump administration by August 1. The decision came after President Trump issued a letter threatening new 30% tariffs on EU goods if a more favorable trade relationship is not established. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will continue to prepare countermeasures in case a deal is not reached. The move provides a temporary de-escalation in the transatlantic trade dispute.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's rhetoric about deporting dangerous criminals, government data reveals that the majority of immigrants currently detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. According to the latest ICE statistics, over 71% of the nearly 58,000 people in detention have no criminal record. Of those who do have convictions, a small fraction are for high-level violent crimes. This data presents a stark contrast to the administration's narrative used to support its mass deportation agenda, suggesting that enforcement is not primarily targeting the violent offenders highlighted in political speeches.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem clarified that President Trump's goal is to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), not eliminate it entirely. Speaking amidst criticism of the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, Noem defended the administration, calling the handling of the disaster the "best response" in years. Her comments appear to shift the administration's rhetoric, which had previously included threats to phase out the agency. Critics argue that FEMA's capacity has been eroded under Trump, with thousands of staff departures and cuts to grant programs.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week, following the announcement of a U.S. plan to sell weapons to NATO allies for transfer to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military aid to Kyiv, as it is faster to move equipment from European countries than directly from U.S. factories. The meeting comes as the Trump administration signals a tougher stance on Russia, with growing bipartisan support in Congress for a sanctions bill that would heavily penalize Russia's economy and its international supporters. The moves indicate a potential turning point in the U.S. approach to the war.</p>

The Israeli military stated that a "technical error" caused a munition, aimed at an Islamic Jihad militant, to land dozens of meters off-target, resulting in unintended civilian harm. The military expressed regret for the incident and has opened a review. This strike occurred amid an escalation of Israeli attacks across Gaza and reports from the Red Cross of a surge in mass casualty events at its field hospital in Rafah.</p>

Regardless of development, the system will carry a tremendous amount of tropical moisture, threatening the northern Gulf coast with heavy, slow-moving downpours late in the week.</p>
