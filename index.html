          <p>Vance Boelter has been taken into custody as the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, which authorities believe were politically motivated. The shootings resulted in the deaths of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, while Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were injured and are receiving care after undergoing surgery. The manhunt for Boelter lasted over 36 hours, and he is now charged with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree attempted murder. Officials have expressed gratitude to law enforcement for their dedication in apprehending the suspect and ensuring justice for the victims and their families.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 01:15:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that Scotland's upcoming ban on sending "black bag" waste to landfills could lead to up to 100 truckloads of waste being exported to England daily. The ban, aimed at reducing methane emissions, is set to begin at the end of the year, but Scotland currently lacks sufficient incinerator capacity to handle the extra demand. Concerns have been raised about the environmental impact of transporting the waste and the logistical challenges of moving such large quantities across the border. The Scottish government views waste export as a short-term solution, while critics highlight the need to improve domestic recycling rates.</p>

          <p>The CEOs of Baker Hughes and Woodside Energy are closely monitoring the escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, but are hesitant to make definitive predictions about oil prices. The conflict has already caused significant effects on forward prices, and potential disruptions to supplies through the Strait of Hormuz could further impact the market. Both CEOs emphasized the close link between geopolitics and oil prices, referencing historical events such as World War II and the 1970s oil crisis. The companies are adopting a wait-and-see approach, acknowledging the rapid pace of developments in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Demonstrators in Barcelona, Mallorca, and other Spanish cities are using water pistols to protest against mass tourism, which they believe is driving up housing costs and eroding local culture. Protesters argue that the influx of tourists is leading to the displacement of residents and the replacement of traditional businesses with tourist-oriented establishments. Similar protests have also occurred in Venice and Lisbon, reflecting growing discontent with overtourism in popular European destinations. The Spanish government has taken some steps to address the issue, including ordering Airbnb to remove thousands of illegal holiday rentals.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, a move that further aligns the country with U.S. trade policy amid rising tensions with Beijing. The International Trade Administration of Taiwan included Huawei and SMIC, along with their subsidiaries, on its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List." This action requires domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these entities. This is likely aimed at reinforcing existing policies and tightening loopholes, as both companies are already on a U.S. trade blacklist and subject to export restrictions.</p>

One specific case involves a woman who was severely injured after being thrown from a ride that had previously been involved in a fatal accident in Australia. The investigation also uncovers instances of criminal convictions and safety warnings linked to one particular inspector, raising questions about the effectiveness of current safety schemes.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent actions, including its attacks on Gaza and Iran, have damaged its international reputation and escalated regional conflict, according to Nesrine Malik. The author argues that Israel's response to the October 7, 2023 attack has been disproportionate and has undermined the fragile status quo in the Middle East. The piece contends that Israel's actions are driven by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political agenda and a desire to restore the narrative of Israel as a victim, further destabilizing the region and eroding trust with key allies.</p>

          <p>Analysts are warning that Donald Trump's proposed "revenge tax" could threaten foreign investment into the United States. This provision, within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would allow the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions that levy "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. individuals and companies. The measure targets digital service taxes and diverted profits taxes, potentially alienating foreign investors and undermining the dollar's safe-haven status. UK companies are particularly exposed, potentially leading some to consider redomiciling in New York to avoid the tax.</p>

Trump stated that ICE officers must do all in their power to achieve the largest mass deportation program in history, citing the need to keep cities safe from illegal alien crime.

Many shared owners feel they have the obligations of renters without the rights of homeowners, leading to financial strain and difficulties in selling their properties. Complaints to housing watchdogs have soared in recent years, highlighting issues with transparency, affordability, and the level of service provided by housing providers. Experts suggest that the government should address fundamental inequities in the shared ownership system to improve the experience for shared owners.</p>

While some staff members express a commitment to patient choice, they also voiced uncertainty about the implications of legalizing assisted dying on their services and concerns about funding shortages for palliative care. The hospice relies heavily on charitable donations and faces increasing demand for end-of-life care. Some staff have observed that patients' initial desire to end their lives can change over time with proper palliative care.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, surged over 15% following a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer price of AU$8.89 per share represents a significant premium over the company's previous closing price. Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, assuming no superior proposal emerges. This takeover bid comes as XRG, ADNOC's investment arm, seeks deals in the natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, urging private firms to take proactive steps to protect key systems and sensitive industrial data. New legislation allows the government to track online communications and take early action against harmful servers. The government plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027. Japanese companies are being prompted to work with partners to exchange cyber threat information and adopt basic practices to improve their cyber defenses. NEC Corp. is using AI to combat cyberattacks and aims to elevate Japan's online safety to a level on par with the United States.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, boosted by government subsidies and online shopping events. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in May, exceeding analysts' estimates. This growth is attributed to the consumer goods trade-in program, a surge in online shopping, and an increase in foreign tourists. However, industrial output slowed, and property prices continued to decline, which could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

The author claims that the EU and its member states are adopting similar approaches to migration, climate change, and the treatment of civil society. The piece suggests that this convergence weakens Europe's ability to respond to the threats that should be uniting it, and calls for a compelling alternative to far-right messaging that champions EU-wide action on security, migration, and prosperity.</p>
