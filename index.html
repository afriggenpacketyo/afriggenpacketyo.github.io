          <h2>Trump Announces Ceasefire Agreement Between Israel and Iran</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a "Complete and Total" ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, intended to end the week-long conflict. According to Trump, the ceasefire was to begin at midnight ET, with a formal end to the war saluted by the world after 24 hours, though there was no immediate confirmation from either Israel or Iran. The conflict began on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets, prompting Iranian counterattacks, and the U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The terms of the ceasefire remain unclear, but Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of counterstrikes on a U.S. base in Qatar, which allowed for no lives to be lost. Optimism surrounding a potential resolution is tempered by the lack of official confirmation from the involved parties.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the federal government will fund Florida's effort to establish immigration detention centers, including a proposed site in the Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." FEMA will largely fund the facilities, which aim to expand the capacity to hold detainees awaiting deportation, reflecting the Trump administration's focus on mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier stated that the "Alligator Alcatraz" facility could house immigrants with criminal records, deterring escape with its surrounding wetlands. These facilities could collectively house up to 5,000 detainees, with operations potentially beginning early next month, illustrating a broader effort by Republican-led states to support the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

Lovelady, whose first name is Richard, has asked to be called Dicky by fans, staffers, and teammates. He was a 10th-round pick by the Kansas City Royals in 2016 and has pitched for multiple teams, including the Oakland Athletics, Chicago Cubs, and Tampa Bay Rays.

          <p>Veterinarians and animal charities are warning that rising vet bills are causing more pet owners to euthanize their sick animals or delay treatment, while some owners are giving up their pets to rehoming centers due to high costs. Treatment prices have increased after big corporations bought up practices, with many veterinary surgeons and nurses expressing concerns about the pressure to generate income. Animal welfare charity Blue Cross has seen a significant increase in applications for financial assistance, and the British Veterinary Union in Unite says more people are choosing euthanasia due to cost pressures. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether a lack of competition in the veterinary sector has contributed to soaring prices, with proposed changes including price caps on medicines and prescriptions.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for over three months, spoke about his experience and reaffirmed his commitment to advocating for Palestinian human rights. Despite facing the threat of deportation under the Trump administration, Khalil remains undeterred and believes his detention has advanced the cause of Palestinian liberation. He criticized the administration's portrayal of him as violent and rejected allegations of antisemitism within the Palestinian movement. Khalil was released after a judge barred the Trump administration from detaining him based on national security concerns, though the government continues to pursue the case based on alleged misrepresentations on his green card application.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's high-risk strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities could yield positive outcomes if Iran refrains from further retaliation. While Iran launched missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, reports indicate no American casualties or significant damage, and Trump claimed that a ceasefire had been agreed upon. If the ceasefire holds, Trump may be inclined to pursue negotiations with Iran, potentially leading to a resolution. A similar scenario occurred in 2020 after the killing of Qassem Soleimani, where measured responses prevented further escalation, however the situation is dynamic and further developments must be monitored.</p>

          <p>Before flying missions exceeding 40 hours in the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, pilots undergo weeks of preparation focusing on flight plans and nutrition. The B-2, which played a key role in strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, requires pilots to manage alertness and digestion during long flights. Pilots are trained on foods that affect digestion and are equipped with a small area for rest. Refueling, often done blind, poses significant challenges, especially at night, making human performance critical to mission success.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court lifted a lower court order preventing the Trump administration from deporting migrants to countries other than their origin without giving them a chance to raise fears of torture. This order allows the administration to resume these deportations while legal proceedings continue, prompting strong dissent from Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson. Sotomayor accused the government of unlawful conduct and undermining due process, while the Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety. The ruling enables the administration to approach nations like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent shift in rhetoric regarding Iran, including suggesting regime change, has caused division within the MAGA right. Despite previously advocating for non-interventionist policies, Trump now appears to be considering broader ambitions in Iran. This shift has surprised some of his aides, including Vice President J. D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who have emphasized the administration's lack of desire for regime change. Trump's transformation of "Make America great again" into "Make Iran great again" exemplifies the hubris of past foreign policy projects, such as the Iraq War.</p>

With the U.S. already heavily involved in supporting Ukraine, there are worries about the availability of resources and bandwidth to address potential aggression from Beijing.
