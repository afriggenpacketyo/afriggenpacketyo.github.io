          <p>Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has voiced her concerns regarding potential cuts to Medicaid and food benefits for Alaskans in President Trump's proposed reconciliation bill. While she hasn't set any absolute red lines, she has made it clear that cuts harming Alaskan beneficiaries are unacceptable, given the state's high healthcare costs and the significant number of children relying on Medicaid. Murkowski emphasizes the need to address entitlement spending but not at the expense of the most vulnerable, noting that 40% of Alaska's children are on Medicaid. Senate Majority Leader John Thune aims to pass the bill by July 4, but the deadline is approaching quickly, so the negotiations must be expedited. The senator will communicate her concerns every step of the way.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers blocked federal immigration agents from entering their stadium, as protests against immigration enforcement continue in the city. The team stated that ICE agents requested access to the parking lots but were denied, while ICE denied that its agents were at the stadium. However, the Department of Homeland Security clarified that Customs and Border Protection personnel were briefly present in the stadium parking lot unrelated to any operation or enforcement. Dodgers player KikÃ© HernÃ¡ndez voiced his criticism of the raids on Instagram, expressing sadness and anger over the treatment of the community and the raids are part of President Trump's wider crackdown on immigration.</p>

          <p>States are increasingly offering tax incentives to attract data centers, resulting in the forfeiture of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue. These incentives, such as sales tax exemptions on equipment and power, benefit tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. While states argue that data centers drive economic growth, watchdog groups raise concerns about the limited job creation and immense electricity consumption associated with these facilities. Virginia, known as the world's data center capital, generates only 48 cents in new state revenue for every dollar not collected in sales tax, leading to debates about the financial wisdom of these tax breaks.

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected a request from two toy companies to expedite their challenge to President Donald Trump's tariffs. The companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize Trump to impose tariffs on products from China. The ruling means the Trump administration has the standard 30-day period to respond to the challenge. This decision prolongs the legal battle over the tariffs, delaying a potential resolution for the companies involved.</p>

          <p>The increasing use of masks by immigration agents raises concerns about accountability and public safety, as these agents often target non-criminals. Department of Homeland Security regulations require immigration officers to identify themselves during an arrest, and masking practices seem to violate the intent of these directives. The inconsistency in face coverings worn by agents can confuse bystanders and targets, potentially leading to interference with enforcement actions that resemble kidnappings. The author argues that the need for accountability outweighs any rationale for agents' anonymity, and Congress should ban the use of masks by immigration agents.</p>

          <p>Top diplomats from the U.K., France, and Germany are engaging in last-minute diplomacy with Iran in Geneva, as the U.S. weighs the possibility of joining Israel's military campaign against Tehran within two weeks.

Trump is appealing the 2024 verdict, which ordered him to pay Carroll for defaming her in 2019 after she accused him of sexual assault. Trump's attorneys argue that they should be allowed to appeal the rejection of having the government substitute for him in the case before oral arguments take place, and DOJ lawyers contend that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role.</p>

It's important to shop around among private lenders for better rates, optimize your credit profile, and use a cosigner if possible. Taking advantage of rate discounts and incentives and considering shorter repayment terms can also help secure lower rates. Students should compare APRs, fees, and repayment terms to find the most affordable options.</p>

          <p>More than 50 community and religious leaders in Los Angeles have signed a petition calling on the Dodgers to take a public stand against ICE raids, which are causing terror in communities and separating families. The petition asks the team to issue a statement affirming that families are sacred and to support community organizations protecting immigrants. The petition was organized by PICO California after the Dodgers postponed their planned announcement regarding assistance to immigrant communities. The Dodgers' roughly 40% Latino fan base has increased pressure on the team to address the immigration raids.</p>

          <h2>Scottish Government to Ban WhatsApp on Government Phones</h2>

          <p>The Scottish government is ending the use of WhatsApp and other "non-corporate" messaging services for government business on its mobile devices to increase openness and transparency. This decision follows the UK Covid Inquiry, which revealed that officials and ministers had deleted WhatsApp messages exchanged during the pandemic. Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said the policy would increase "openness and transparency" in government, and ministers and staff should use corporate-approved apps like Teams and email. Opposition MSPs have said the new policy is a "clear admission" from the government that it was wrong to delete messages from during the pandemic.</p>
