          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has launched a strong attack on Reform UK, labeling the party's policies as "toxic divide and decline" ahead of the Labour conference in Liverpool. He accused Reform leader Nigel Farage of being "unpatriotic" and prioritizing personal gain over national interest. Starmer aims to position Labour as a patriotic alternative, contrasting with Reform's controversial proposals like abolishing indefinite leave to remain, which has divided public opinion. The article highlights Labour's strategy to challenge Reform's growing influence in opinion polls.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing "full force" if necessary, to protect ICE facilities from "Antifa and other domestic terrorists." This move follows the administration's expanded crackdown on political violence, including the recent designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. Democratic lawmakers and Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Mayor Keith Wilson, have strongly criticized the deployment, asserting that there is no national security threat and calling it an "authoritarian takeover."

Observers suggest this brazen approach, exemplified by his public directive to Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue political opponents, earns him perverse credit for authenticity and desensitizes the public. This article argues that the constant barrage of controversies and the lack of institutional checks from a Republican-controlled Congress have normalized actions that would typically be career-ending, with supporters viewing his rule-breaking as a form of anti-establishment defiance.</p>
