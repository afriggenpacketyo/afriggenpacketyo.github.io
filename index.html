        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California State Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin have introduced legislation, SB 627, to prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while interacting with the public. Dubbed the "No Secret Police Act," the bill also mandates officers to wear identifying information to promote transparency and accountability. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers wearing medical masks during natural disasters, and clear riot gear would be permitted. The proposal follows protests in Los Angeles against the Trump administration's immigration policies, during which National Guard troops were deployed without the California Governor's consent, with Wiener citing concerns about "secret police" behavior. Optimism surrounding the implications of this bill is moderate, as it aims to strike a balance between ensuring public safety and safeguarding individual rights.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their tax plan concerning the state and local tax (SALT) deduction as part of President Trump's spending package. The SALT deduction has been a contentious issue since 2017, particularly for lawmakers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. The current law caps the SALT deduction at $10,000, which is considered a "marriage penalty." Raising the SALT deduction cap has been controversial because benefits would primarily go to higher-income households, with most filers using the standard deduction and not benefiting from itemized tax breaks.

The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, has been charged with multiple counts of murder and allegedly targeted two other lawmakers; Senator Ann Rest said he was parked near her home.

          <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled that the state can proceed with a grand jury investigation into allegations of clergy sexually abusing children. This decision comes after the Camden diocese, which had previously opposed such proceedings, reversed its stance. The court found that the state has the right to present evidence before a special grand jury. The attorney general's office praised the decision, emphasizing its commitment to supporting survivors of sexual abuse, and the Camden diocese has pledged to cooperate with the effort.</p>

          <p>Over two dozen U.S. Air Force KC-135R and KC-46A tankers were detected on flight-tracking software heading east over the Atlantic, prompting speculation about their mission. The mass deployment of these jets at a time of heightened tensions in the Middle East suggests a potential shift in U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Possible explanations include providing aerial refueling support to Israel, preparing for direct U.S. involvement in the air war, countering Iran's potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, or establishing a robust air bridge to the Middle East for increased asset deployment.</p>
