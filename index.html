          <p>A "baby hatch" at San-ikukai Hospital in Tokyo has been used for the first time since its opening on March 31. This makes it the second medical institution in Japan to offer this service, following Jikei Hospital in Kumamoto Prefecture. The Tokyo hospital aims to be "the last line of defense" for babies' lives, addressing the rising number of unplanned pregnancies and infant abandonment cases. The hospital also runs a "confidential birth" system, allowing women to give birth anonymously. The baby hatch accepts infants up to 4 weeks old, and staff attend to them within one minute of being left, after which a child welfare center is notified.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reflects on the changing dynamics in Asia, fifty years after the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam, noting the growing influence of China. It contrasts the past when the US aimed to shape the world in its image, with the current reality of China's expanding presence through military bases and economic influence. The article highlights instances where the US has been slow to provide aid compared to China, leading some to question American intentions. Despite this, American ideals still resonate, even as countries like Cambodia turn to China for modernization while expressing concerns about the future of American democracy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers' season concluded with a 103-96 defeat against the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 5 of their first-round series.

The Timberwolves' Rudy Gobert dominated with 27 points and 24 rebounds, while the Lakers' offense faltered in the fourth quarter.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised its economic and inflation projections downward for fiscal year 2025, citing concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy. The central bank now expects the economy to grow by 0.5 percent, down from the previous projection of 1.1 percent, and core consumer prices are projected to rise 2.2 percent, compared to the earlier forecast of 2.4 percent. Despite these revisions, the BOJ maintained its benchmark interest rate at around 0.5 percent, expressing uncertainty about how trade policies will evolve and affect overseas economic activity. The BOJ expects inflation to range between 1.5 and 2.5 percent between fiscal years 2025 and 2027.</p>

          <p>Several European automotive giants, including Stellantis and Mercedes, have withdrawn or reduced their financial guidance for the year, citing uncertainties related to President Trump's trade tariffs. These companies reported significant drops in first-quarter profits, attributing the industry's challenges to the imposed tariffs. While some automakers welcomed Trump's move to ease car tariffs, analysts warn that the rapidly changing trade landscape continues to hinder long-term investment decisions. Other companies like Volkswagen and Volvo Cars also anticipate operating returns and net cash flow to come in at the lower end of their annual forecasts due to increasing trade restrictions and political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israeli reservists, including former Mossad head Danny Yatom, have signed letters demanding an end to the Gaza war, increasing pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. These reservists urge the government to focus on securing a deal to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Many signatories, like Yatom, are long-time critics of Netanyahu and believe he prioritizes his own interests over the hostages' welfare. The growing refusal of reservists to serve marks a looming crisis for the military, which heavily depends on them.

          <p>Mosquitoes are increasingly prevalent in Scotland, with over 20 different species now identified, including some in Shetland, the northernmost location recorded to date. This expansion is being tracked through the Mosquito Scotland project, which relies on public sightings and trapping. Glasgow University researchers initially suspected midges or clegs were responsible for reported bites, but analysis revealed mosquitoes were the primary culprits. The insects are most commonly found in woodland areas, but have also been spotted in urban settings like Glasgow. The public's help has been critical in guiding where traps are placed, sometimes catching over 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.</p>

Examples from Ukraine, Israel, and Yemen highlight the demands of modern warfare and reveal that the U.S. is short on artillery shells, precision-guided missiles, and recruits.

          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed an agreement to share profits and royalties from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals, establishing a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund. This deal, which Donald Trump said would provide an economic incentive for the US to continue investing in Ukraine's defense, follows months of tense negotiations. The Trump administration has stated that the fund will begin to repay an estimated $175 billion in aid provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian officials have described the agreement as equitable, allowing Ukraine to maintain control over its natural resources.</p>

          <p>Eleven students accused of participating in a hazing incident targeting younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team have turned themselves in after being threatened with kidnapping charges. The incident involved older players allegedly tying up a younger teammate, placing a pillowcase over his head, and throwing him into the trunk of a car. Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick described the incident as "hazing on steroids" and emphasized the potential for tragedy. The students who turned themselves in will likely face prosecution in family court to avoid criminal records.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs. The BOJ now expects the Japanese economy to grow by only 0.5 percent, a significant downgrade from the previous 1.1 percent forecast. This decision reflects concerns that tariffs are leading to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. The BOJ also kept interest rates unchanged, highlighting the complexities of reverting to more conventional monetary policies amid tariff-induced economic uncertainty. The article notes that Japanese companies are already warning of deteriorating earnings, exacerbating pressures on an already fragile economy.</p>

The prosecution alleges Patterson invited the group to lunch under the pretense of having cancer.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated there is a "very good chance" of reaching a trade deal with China, despite his own trade envoy, Jamieson Greer, acknowledging that no tariff discussions are currently taking place between Washington and Beijing.

          <p>A recent poll by the Asian American Foundation reveals that one in four non-Asian Americans consider Chinese-Americans a potential threat, particularly related to national security. Additionally, four in ten fear that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. These findings underscore concerns about the ability of Asian-Americans to assimilate at a time of growing social tension and deteriorating US-China relations. The poll highlights a disconnect between how Asian-Americans are perceived and their lived experiences, reinforcing the stereotype of the "perpetual foreigner."</p>

A survey of U.S.-based scholars suggests a shift away from liberal democracy towards authoritarianism. Many immigrants who sought freedom and safety in the United States are now experiencing fear and self-censorship, feeling trapped and unable to work freely.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill to end solar credits for rooftop solar system owners in California has been weakened by an Assembly committee. The original bill sought to limit the current program's benefits to 10 years, but this provision was removed. The amended bill would cancel the program only for those who sell their homes. The bill is driven by concerns that the financial credits given to rooftop solar owners are raising electric bills for those without panels, but faces opposition from solar owners, schools, and environmental groups, who argue that utility spending is the real cause of rising bills.</p>

Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region were below Wall Street projections for the first quarter.
