          <p>Court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the fatal shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and the wounding of another senator and his wife, was a "prepper" who had given his wife a "bailout plan." The plan included instructions to leave their home and go to her mother's in Wisconsin, as Boelter anticipated potential armed confrontations. Boelter's wife also told investigators that he had a business partner in Washington state and that they were involved in a security company and fishing outfit in Congo, Africa. Investigators found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffman family recounted the attack, emphasizing the need for civility in public service. The tragic incident underscores the risks associated with public service and the importance of fostering a more peaceful society. </p>

          <p>Sen. Jack Reed criticized President Trump's rejection of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggested that Trump's dismissal of the intelligence community's findings may be politically motivated, particularly as Trump contemplates potential military action against Iran. Reed argued that Trump needs to believe Iran has the intention and capacity to quickly develop a nuclear weapon to justify a potential attack. Reed noted that if Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made a false statement in her testimony, it should be corrected immediately, rather than dismissed following activity by the Israelis. The senator's remarks highlight the growing tension between the executive branch and the intelligence community regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Photographer Miora Rajaonary created a project called "Sahy Rano" to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of women and girls in Africa. The waterborne infection, spread by parasitic worms, can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and genital ulcers, often leading to suspicion and shame due to its STD-like symptoms. The women in the photos wear traditional Malagasy face masks, symbolizing their courage in breaking taboos and speaking about the disease publicly. The painted backdrop and laundry rope in the photos emphasize the inescapable presence of contaminated water in the women's lives, highlighting their bravery in returning to the water for their livelihoods. The project aims to break the silence surrounding FGS and promote awareness of its devastating impact.</p>

          <p>Amazon sellers are struggling with rising return rates and returns fraud, leading some to exit the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program or consider leaving the platform altogether. The issue stems from customers mistakenly receiving used or damaged products, with some cases involving soiled baby items. Amazon has started charging sellers for items exceeding certain return rate thresholds, which has led to rising prices as sellers try to offset the increased costs. Some sellers have implemented measures like installing camera systems to track outgoing items and returns, while others are outsourcing returns to specialists to ensure quality control. The situation highlights the challenges small businesses face in navigating Amazon's return policies and the need for greater accountability and fraud prevention measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent assassinations of senior Quds Force commanders, including Saeed Izadi and Behnam Shahryari, point to increasing vulnerabilities within Iran's intelligence apparatus. Izadi, responsible for coordinating with Palestinian armed groups, was reportedly killed in Qom, while Shahryari, head of Unit 190, was assassinated in western Iran. These incidents follow a series of targeted killings of Iranian military officials, raising concerns about breaches within Iran's intelligence community. Iranian authorities have arrested numerous individuals, including Afghan refugees, on espionage charges, leading to fears that these accusations are being used to suppress dissent. The covert conflict between Israel and Iran, characterized by sabotage, cyber-attacks, and targeted killings, continues to escalate, underscoring the fragile security situation in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms, citing its unconstitutionality. The court sided with civil liberties groups who argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. Republicans, including President Trump, have supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. Louisiana's Attorney General plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the Supreme Court. Similar laws are being challenged in Arkansas and await signature in Texas, setting the stage for further legal battles over religion in schools.</p>

          <p>President Trump's initial eagerness to engage in Israel's war with Iran has shifted to a more cautious approach, marked by a promise to decide on U.S. involvement within two weeks. This delay may reflect Trump's fear of accountability and unwillingness to commit to a potentially costly and complex conflict. The Iranian regime might exploit Trump's vulnerabilities by engaging in negotiations to delay action while reconstituting their nuclear program. Trump's lack of congressional authorization, competent leadership in defense, allied support, and public opinion further complicates any potential military intervention. Trump's hesitation suggests a recognition of the challenges and risks involved, potentially leading to a series of delayed decisions rather than decisive action.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a heart patient with an LVAD, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant to address dangerous heart rhythms and high antibody levels. The liver transplant aimed to reduce antibodies and prevent organ rejection. Despite facing complications like COVID-19 and pneumonia, Baker received the transplant in September 2024. Following the surgery, Baker became an advocate for other transplant patients, but faced financial hardship after her husband's sudden death. The success of Baker's surgery has paved the way for similar procedures, offering hope for other patients with complex medical conditions.</p>

Many Afghans, including those who assisted US forces, fear returning to Afghanistan due to the Taliban's control and the risk of persecution. Advocates and lawmakers are challenging the decision, citing the continued instability and human rights issues in Afghanistan. The loss of TPS, which provides work authorization, leaves many Afghans in a precarious situation, struggling to support themselves and their families.

          <p>Computer science enrollment is declining at many universities due to a grim job outlook for entry-level coders, with AI increasingly capable of writing code. This trend marks a potential end to the "Learn to code" era, as young people respond to layoffs and hiring freezes in the tech industry. Graduates from top programs are struggling to find work, and some are considering alternative careers like electrician apprenticeships. The situation is exacerbated by AI's ability to displace tech workers, leading companies to reduce hiring and eliminate entry-level positions. The decline in computer science enrollment reflects broader concerns about the impact of AI on the job market and the need for enduring, transferable skills.</p>

          <p>The rising cost of in-home elder care is a national crisis, with many families unable to afford the necessary support for their aging parents. Marian Sunabe spends $18,600 a month for her 100-year-old mother's care, using a combination of Social Security, rental income, pensions, long-term care insurance, and retirement savings. The United States lags behind other developed countries in providing affordable elder care, forcing many middle-class Americans to deplete their savings to qualify for Medicaid. The aging population and workforce shortage in caregiving exacerbate the problem, leading to reliance on undocumented workers and potential exploitation. The situation calls for public policy solutions to address the growing need for affordable and accessible elder care.</p>

          <p>SkinnyTok, a corner of the internet where thin women promote extreme dieting, has emerged as a backlash against the body positivity movement. Influencers like Liv Schmidt advocate for restricting food intake to achieve thinness, drawing both praise and criticism. The movement's emphasis on thinness and traditional femininity has attracted both progressive and conservative followers, with some linking it to alt-right ideologies. While SkinnyTok influencers claim to offer honest advice, critics argue that their content promotes disordered eating and unrealistic beauty standards. The rise of SkinnyTok reflects broader societal pressures on women to conform to narrow ideals of beauty and the complex interplay between social media, body image, and politics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested that Japan increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP). This request will likely prompt Tokyo to call off a planned high-level meeting with Washington. Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, made the request. Colby had previously pressed Japan to increase its defense spending to 3 percent of its GDP. Japan and the United States had not formally said such talks, as held in July last year in Tokyo, would take place. The increased demand will likely lead Japan to cancel a planned meeting of the countries' foreign and defense chiefs, which was scheduled in Washington before Japan's House of Councillors election, expected on July 20. The meeting would have been the first since Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump took office in October and January, respectively.</p>
