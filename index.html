          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving a life sentence for murdering her two children in Idaho, has been found guilty in Arizona of conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Prosecutors successfully argued that Daybell schemed with her brother, Alex Cox, to kill Vallow for a $1 million life insurance policy, invoking twisted religious beliefs as justification. Daybell represented herself in the trial, which included testimony from her other brother, Adam Cox, who asserted that the siblings conspired to commit the murder. Daybell is set to face another trial for allegedly conspiring to kill her niece's ex-husband.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previous criticisms and calls for lower interest rates. Trump has publicly pressured Powell to cut interest rates more aggressively, arguing it's a perfect time to do so to boost the economy. Powell has cited uncertainty as the reason for pausing rate cuts, warning that Trump's tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. Trump's ongoing feud with Powell has raised concerns about the Fed's independence and its ability to make economic policy decisions without political influence.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year.

The plan is contingent on an "understanding" with major food companies, urging them to transition to natural alternatives.

          <p>A federal judge in Denver has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the removal of migrants from Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU argued that two Venezuelan men were in danger of being deported to a prison in El Salvador. The order mandates that individuals subject to deportation under the Act receive 21 days' notice, information about their right to judicial review, and access to legal counsel. This follows the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to detain or deport noncitizens deemed "dangerous."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the restoration of Voice of America's worldwide news programming after the Trump administration effectively shut it down. The judge sided with VOA employees, finding that the administration's actions likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The ruling also impacts Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. The judge ordered the administration to reinstate network employees and restore grants to RFA and MEBN, citing the absence of analysis in the decision to shut down the networks.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting the food industry to voluntarily discontinue the use of synthetic food dyes, aligning with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals. This move falls short of an outright ban, instead relying on a "national standard and timeline" for the industry to switch to natural alternatives. The FDA claims the food industry is eager to remove artificial dyes, while industry representatives cite the importance of these dyes for consistency and visual appeal. The agency will also expedite the review and approval of new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>Six major policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are joining forces to lobby against the Trump administration's planned 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups argue that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many suppliers are already facing financial distress. They emphasize that the automotive sector supports millions of American jobs and contributes significantly to the economy. The groups are urging the administration to reconsider the tariffs, similar to relief granted for consumer electronics and semiconductors.</p>

          <p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has ruled that Amazon is obligated to collectively bargain with warehouse workers at its San Francisco distribution facility. The complaint alleges that Amazon illegally refused to negotiate after a majority of workers signed union authorization cards. Amazon disputes the claims, asserting that the legal theory behind the complaint is baseless. The case is likely to face challenges given the Trump administration's control of the labor board and its appointment of a new general counsel.</p>

Tesla's sales have taken a hit as the automaker's vehicles have increasingly become a symbol of the Trump administration, repelling some consumers. The stock has also plunged more than 50% from its most recent high in December.  Tesla shares jumped 4% to $247.53 after Musk vowed to scale back his work at DOGE.</p>

They know what Leonard has done behind the scenes during rehabilitation when the media is not around and on those days and nights when a lot of teammates are not around.  The culmination of all those days in the lab this season working to get his right knee healthy was Leonard’s dominance in Game 2 of the Western Conference playoffs against the Nuggets on Monday night in Denver.  He missed only four of 19 shots while pouring in 39 points over 39 minutes to help the Clippers even the series at 1-1 before they returned home for Game 3 on Thursday night and Game 4 on Saturday afternoon at the Intuit Dome.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year, despite the UK grappling with higher-than-expected inflation. The organization predicted UK inflation would be the highest in the world's advanced economies this year at 3.1%, largely due to higher bills, including for energy and water. The fund also said the UK economy would grow less than previously predicted, up 1.1% in 2025 instead of 1.6%, because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. Trump tariffs could also push down the pace of UK price rises as goods are diverted away from the US.</p>

Federal authorities said Henley, who helped launch rapper Nipsey Hussle’s career, had created an image of himself as an entertainment industry entrepreneur and someone giving back to the community.  Even in his short time in custody, he is up to his old tricks, once again trying to use some of those same celebrities for his personal gain.  He has even suggested that he can manipulate the President of the United States into intervening in the case and dropping the charges, even as he simultaneously derisively refers to the President as ‘the orange man’ while in custody.</p>

The US currency and its government debt are usually seen as a safe haven during times of market turmoil, but as the US itself has caused much of the recent volatility investors have been turning to another “port in the storm”, gold, in large numbers.

          <p>A jury has concluded The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for an error in a 2017 editorial she says damaged her reputation. The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control published after U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was wounded in 2017 when a man with a history of anti-GOP activity opened fire on a Congressional baseball team practice in Washington. The Times corrected the article less than 14 hours after it was published. The jury deliberated a little over two hours before reaching its verdict after lawyers for Palin and the newspaper delivered closing arguments at a Manhattan federal court civil trial that was in its second week.</p>
