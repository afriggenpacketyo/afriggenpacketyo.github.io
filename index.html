          <p>Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark appeared to express relief after successfully making a three-point shot early in a game against the Dallas Wings, an encouraging sign amid a recent shooting slump. Clark, who entered the game with a low three-point percentage for the season, has been navigating the challenges of her sophomore WNBA year. Despite her individual struggles, she was recently named a WNBA All-Star team captain for the second consecutive year, receiving the most fan votes. The game against the struggling Wings was an important matchup for the Fever as they aim to maintain their position in the playoff standings.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump details "stunning failures" by the U.S. Secret Service. The investigation, led by Senator Rand Paul, found a pattern of communication breakdowns and negligence, including the denial of multiple requests for additional security resources like counter-snipers prior to the Butler, Pennsylvania rally. The report also accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of making false statements to Congress regarding these denied requests and argues that disciplinary actions taken against personnel have been insufficient given the severity of the security lapses.</p>

According to their families and local residents, Musallet was beaten to death while al-Shalabi was shot during the confrontation near al-Mazra'a al-Sharqiya. The incident has prompted calls from Musallet's family for the U.S. State Department to lead an investigation, highlighting a surge in settler violence in the region since the war in Gaza began.

          <p>According to Iran's state-affiliated Fars news agency, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained minor leg injuries during an Israeli attack on a secret underground facility in Tehran last month. The report, which has not been independently verified, claims that multiple bombs targeted the facility where the Supreme National Security Council was meeting, trapping officials before they escaped through an emergency shaft. This allegation follows Pezeshkian's recent public accusation that Israel attempted to assassinate him during the 12-day war. The incident raises further questions about potential Israeli intelligence infiltration within Iran's highest security circles.</p>

This decision came after President Trump issued a letter threatening new 30% tariffs on EU goods starting August 1, citing persistent trade deficits as a national security threat. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU's countermeasures will now be delayed until the same date, emphasizing a preference for a negotiated solution. The move temporarily de-escalates a significant trade dispute between the world's largest economic blocs, with EU trade ministers scheduled to discuss their strategy.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's rhetoric focusing on deporting "the worst of the worst," an analysis of government data reveals a different picture of immigration enforcement. According to recent ICE statistics, the majority of detainees have no criminal convictions, and among those who do, few have committed high-level violent crimes. This data presents a stark contrast to the administration's public narrative, which often links migrants to violent crime to justify its large-scale deportation agenda. Critics argue this disconnect between rhetoric and reality fuels a false narrative, as research consistently shows immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born citizens.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing the final day of its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to reach 31°C (88°F) before a significant cool down. Amber heat health alerts remain active for central and southern England, while millions face hosepipe bans and Scotland is under an "extreme" wildfire warning. The heat has prompted water safety warnings following the death of a 15-year-old boy in a river in Glasgow. The Met Office forecasts that the heat will break on Monday, bringing heavy rain to many parts of the country, although the southeast may remain warm until Tuesday.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Critics, including prominent conservative figures, have accused Bondi of withholding information after a Justice Department memo stated there was no "incriminating client list" and that Epstein died by suicide. In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to let Bondi do her job and not to waste energy on the Epstein case. The situation has exposed a growing rift between factions within the administration's allies over the long-running and conspiracy-laden investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant move for player welfare, FIFA has agreed in principle with the global players' union, Fifpro, to introduce mandatory rest periods. The consensus includes ensuring a 72-hour gap between matches and providing a minimum three-week break for players at the end of each season. This agreement comes after Fifpro filed a lawsuit against FIFA, accusing it of expanding the fixture calendar, such as with the new 32-team Club World Cup, without proper consultation. While Fifpro sees this as a major first step, FIFA's statement also emphasized the importance of creating more global competitions to boost football development worldwide.</p>

          <p>Years before a deadly flood killed 27 children, buildings at Camp Mystic in Texas were reportedly removed from official flood-risk maps following appeals by the camp. According to media reports citing official records, FEMA maps from 2011 had designated the riverside camp as a high-risk flood zone. However, Camp Mystic successfully challenged these designations, which would have required flood insurance and stricter building regulations. This revelation raises serious questions about regulatory oversight and safety precautions at the camp, which was devastated by flash floods on July 4. Experts find it perplexing that a children's camp in a floodway received such exemptions.</p>

          <p>An outbreak of violence between local residents and migrants in the southeastern Spanish town of Torre Pacheco was incited by far-right groups on social media, according to a government official. The unrest, which resulted in five minor injuries and one arrest, followed the beating of an elderly man days earlier, allegedly by youths of North African origin. Groups armed with batons reportedly roamed the streets for a second night, with social media posts calling for a "hunt for migrants." Authorities deployed a heavy police presence to prevent further confrontations and are investigating potential hate crimes amid rising tensions in the town.</p>

          <p>David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of the Ruby on Rails web framework and CTO of 37signals, emphasizes two critical skills when hiring programmers: writing and coding ability. In a recent interview, he stated that a well-written, specific cover letter is non-negotiable, as strong writing is essential for effective remote collaboration. Equally important is a candidate's practical coding skill, which he evaluates through a take-home test that simulates real-world work. Hansson believes that directly evaluating an applicant's work product is a "superpower" in hiring, far more telling than a résumé, grades, or pedigree.</p>

          <p>The geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China over rare earth metals is boosting the strategic importance of electronic waste recycling. As China leverages its dominance over the global supply chain, the U.S. is looking for alternative sources, including reclaiming critical materials from discarded electronics. Next-generation recyclers are developing innovative ways to extract not only gold, copper, and lithium but also vital rare earth elements like neodymium from old computers, phones, and EV batteries. This growing "urban mining" industry is seen as a crucial way to build a more localized and secure U.S. supply chain for critical technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's recent large-scale military exercises are being closely watched by Beijing, prompting analysis on how China might respond to the show of force. According to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, Beijing's reaction will likely be carefully calibrated. While China consistently opposes any actions it perceives as asserting Taiwanese sovereignty, its response could range from heightened rhetoric and diplomatic protests to its own military posturing in the region. The key factor will be how Beijing interprets the scale and intent of the drills and whether it views them as a significant shift in the cross-strait military balance.</p>

          <p>The use of investigative genetic genealogy, a technique combining DNA analysis with family tree research, is proving to be a revolutionary tool for law enforcement in solving cold cases. This method, famously used to identify the Golden State Killer, involves uploading crime scene DNA to public genealogy databases to find a suspect's relatives and build a family tree. This article highlights how genealogist Barbara Rae-Venter used the technique to identify a notorious serial killer and help solve dozens of other violent crimes. While the practice has raised privacy concerns, it has also provided justice for victims in cases that were previously unsolvable.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has implemented significant security upgrades. The agency has deployed a new fleet of military-grade drones to improve aerial surveillance, a direct response to the fact that the shooter flew a drone over the rally site undetected. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement, fixing a critical failure from that day. These changes, along with the recent suspension of six personnel, are part of the agency's efforts to prevent a repeat of the incident.</p>

While the EU has temporarily paused its own retaliatory measures to allow for negotiations, Macron urged the bloc to accelerate preparations for credible countermeasures.

While she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants, she indicated that an announcement on affordability is forthcoming later in the week. The government has also allocated funds to improve charging infrastructure, including £63 million for charging hubs and £25 million for councils to install gullies for easier on-street charging. The move aims to boost EV sales, which are currently lagging behind mandated targets ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>
