          <p>President Trump and the first lady visited Kerrville, Texas, to survey damage and meet with families affected by catastrophic flash floods that have claimed over 120 lives. He expressed the nation's support and grief, praising the efforts of first responders while promising continued federal assistance. The president has signed a disaster declaration for the region, enabling FEMA to support the ongoing rescue and recovery operations. More than 170 people remain missing after the Guadalupe River swelled to historic levels, causing widespread devastation.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price reached a new record, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally was also fueled by a wave of short liquidations and investor expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. This week's performance marks a nearly 10% gain for the cryptocurrency, its best since late April. Analysts suggest that a major macroeconomic event would be needed to suppress the current upward trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the company deliberately uses addictive design features to exploit children and teens. The state's attorney general argues these features are intended to keep young users engaged for longer periods, increasing their exposure to ads and e-commerce. The court ruled the state's claims were specific enough to proceed, focusing on the app's allegedly dangerous features rather than its user-generated content. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions targeting the design and safety policies of major tech platforms.</p>

          <h2>Three Potential Ways for Seniors to Supplement Social Security Income</h2>

          <p>Amid concerns about the future solvency of Social Security, seniors may be seeking alternative income streams to supplement their retirement funds. This article explores three potential options for homeowners aged 62 and older to generate additional cash flow. These include reverse mortgages, which provide payments from home equity, and annuities, which offer guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum investment. A personal loan is also presented as a less favorable but viable option to cover financial gaps. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fastest Methods for Obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit This July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:22:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to quickly tap into their home equity, several strategies can accelerate the process of obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Applying with a fully online lender, which uses digital platforms for verification and appraisals, can reduce approval times to a matter of days. Homeowners might also consider low-documentation HELOCs, which minimize paperwork, or applying with their existing mortgage lender, who already has their financial information on file. While these methods offer speed, they may come with tradeoffs like higher rates or more conservative credit limits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The current season of the popular reality show 'Love Island USA' is being analyzed as a reflection of Gen Z's dating habits, characterized by emotional guardedness and a lack of deep romantic connection.

Despite this, the show remains a phenomenon, with viewers responding strongly to contestants who do show genuine emotion. The analysis posits that the show captures the generation's struggle with and desire for authentic connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports has caused outrage in Brazil, particularly because he linked the move to the ongoing trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump claimed the prosecution of Bolsonaro, a political ally, is a "witch hunt" and demanded authorities "leave Bolsonaro alone." Brazil's current president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, defended the independence of the judiciary and stated that unilateral tariffs would be met with a reciprocal response. The move is seen by many in Brazil as an unacceptable interference in the nation's sovereign affairs.</p>
