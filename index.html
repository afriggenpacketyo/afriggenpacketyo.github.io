        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage demand from homebuyers has increased for the second consecutive week, driven by an increase in available houses for sale. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, total mortgage application volume rose by 1.1% compared to the previous week, although the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.86%. Applications for home purchases rose by 2% for the week and were 18% higher than the previous year, indicating renewed interest despite economic uncertainty and concerns over tariffs. This increase in home inventory is supporting more transactions, particularly government purchase applications, which saw a significant gain.</p>

The meeting, also attended by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, signals a potential rebuilding of Syria's ties with the Western world.

          <p>A recent resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to pave the way for more "minerals for muscle" agreements, where minerals and geopolitics intersect. The agreement aims to strengthen economic ties, aid Ukraine's reconstruction, and establish the country as a strategic mineral supplier to the U.S. Experts suggest this deal could be the first of many, with potential agreements between the U.S. and countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, some analysts are skeptical about a widespread adoption of this model, citing resource nationalism as a countervailing trend. </p>

          <p>The United Nations is revisiting regulations on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS), often called "killer robots," amid growing concerns about AI-controlled weaponry. U.N. Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres reiterated his 2026 deadline for a legally binding solution to address threats posed by LAWS, emphasizing that machines should not have the power to take human lives without human control. The International Committee of the Red Cross also supports regulating LAWS, warning that technology is evolving faster than regulations. While AI is not a prerequisite for autonomous weapons, it could further enable these systems, raising ethical and human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock has released a report criticizing Republican proposals to implement work requirements for Medicaid eligibility, arguing that these requirements would reduce healthcare coverage for hardworking Americans. Warnock contends that these rules, which he calls "work reporting requirements," do not incentivize work but rather create bureaucratic hurdles that prevent eligible individuals from accessing care. He argues that providing healthcare without such requirements would encourage people to work and strengthen the economy. A Republican House budget resolution includes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid, with work requirements among the eligibility policies being considered.</p>

          <p>President Trump has hinted at finding ways to serve a third term despite the Twenty-Second Amendment, suggesting work-arounds like the "vice-presidential thing." This approach reflects his view of the Constitution as an obstacle to be overcome rather than a repository of values to be respected. Trump's willingness to promote such ideas highlights his desire to evade constitutional limits to maintain power. This is consistent with his past behavior, such as his administration's defense of accepting payments from foreign diplomats by arguing a technicality rather than respecting the anti-corruption intent of the emoluments clause.</p>

The attack, attributed to the DragonForce hackers, caused payment issues, widespread shortages, and compromised customer and staff data. The company is gradually bringing its systems back online and working with suppliers to restock stores. Experts caution that the reputational impact of the attack could linger, affecting customer trust and potentially leading to long-term financial consequences.</p>

          <h2>Migrants in UK Face Longer Wait for Permanent Settlement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New rules extending the wait time for migrants to qualify for permanent settlement in the UK to 10 years will apply to those already in the country. The government plans to implement this change, doubling the current five-year period, subject to a public consultation. The move aims to address concerns about a significant increase in settlement and citizenship applications due to the surge in immigration since 2020. While there will be exceptions for dependents of British citizens and those contributing to the UK's economy and society, the extended wait time has raised concerns among migrants and some Labour MPs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's family is profiting from his brand, with ventures including real estate, cryptocurrency, and a private club, raising ethical concerns about conflicts of interest. Deals involving foreign governments in Serbia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar create incentives for the president to favor his business partners with policy decisions. The family's cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, and real estate projects like a Trump-branded resort in Qatar and a hotel in Dubai are generating millions in revenue. Qatar is also planning to give a $400 million Boeing 747 aircraft to the president for use as a temporary Air Force One.</p>

Sinwar, the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, is a key military commander and a hard-line negotiator. While his elimination would be a tactical success, it's uncertain if it would lead to a strategic shift, as Hamas has survived the assassinations of numerous leaders. Some analysts believe the war's trajectory depends as much on Israel's position as on Hamas's leadership.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, to address the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy involves fully covering expenses for normal deliveries under the public medical insurance system. Currently, normal childbirth is not covered by insurance, leading to varying costs across prefectures. While the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen, delivery costs often exceed this amount. This move aims to standardize costs nationwide but raises concerns among obstetricians about potential financial strain on medical institutions.</p>

          <p>Recent market volatility is causing concern for college savers who may have seen their 529 college savings plans diminish in value. Financial experts advise checking asset allocations and assessing risk appetite, with age-based portfolios typically becoming more conservative as college nears. While de-risking a portion of the portfolio into cash equivalents can provide protection, experts caution against shifting the entire balance to cash. Strategies include using income or savings outside the 529 to cover immediate expenses and reimbursing later, allowing more time for market recovery. (not investment advice)</p>
