          <p>A federal judge has disqualified Alina Habba, former personal lawyer to President Trump, from her role as acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, ruling her appointment was not legally valid. The decision found that Habba exercised the duties of her office without lawful authority since July 2025, following a series of controversial personnel moves by the Trump administration to install her. While the judge noted her actions since that date could be declared void, the ruling does not automatically dismiss criminal indictments approved during her tenure. The decision has been stayed to allow the administration an opportunity to appeal the disqualification.</p>

Preliminary findings from the coroner's office suggest the cause of death was exposure to a toxic gas. The victims, mostly adults with one potentially being a 17-year-old, have not yet been publicly identified pending autopsies by officials. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched an investigation into the fatal incident, which authorities currently do not believe to be criminal in nature.</p>

          <p>Shares for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store experienced a significant drop of approximately 10% after the company unveiled a new, simplified logo as part of a broader brand revitalization effort. The redesign, which removes the iconic image of a man in a rocking chair and the phrase "old country store," has drawn considerable criticism on social media. Many, including some conservative figures, argue the change abandons the brand's traditional American identity in favor of a more generic, modern aesthetic. This backlash highlights the financial risks companies face when altering established branding that has a strong cultural connection with its customer base.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed his negotiating team to commence talks for a hostage release and ceasefire, but only on terms that are deemed "acceptable to Israel." This development comes as Hamas had previously agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal from mediators, which Israel has not accepted in its current form. Concurrently, Netanyahu's cabinet has approved military plans for a major ground assault on Gaza City, a move that faces significant international opposition. The Israeli military has warned international organizations to prepare for the evacuation of the city's one million residents ahead of the planned offensive.</p>

          <p>Brent Hinds, the influential guitarist and vocalist for the Grammy-winning metal band Mastodon, has died at the age of 51 following a motorcycle crash in Atlanta. According to police reports, Hinds was struck by an SUV whose driver failed to yield while turning. Hinds was a founding member of Mastodon in 2000, known for his complex riffs and contributions to the band's critically acclaimed albums before his departure from the group earlier this year. His former bandmates expressed their "unfathomable sadness and grief" over the loss of a unique creative force in the metal music scene.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering a petition from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to reclassify psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms. The proposal suggests moving the substance from a highly restrictive Schedule I narcotic to a less restrictive Schedule II classification, which would acknowledge its potential medical value despite risks. This move follows years of growing research indicating psilocybin's benefits in treating mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. While some researchers urge caution, the potential reclassification could significantly expand access for therapeutic use, a topic championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., the National Hurricane Center warns of life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast for several days. Storm surge warnings remain in effect for parts of North Carolina, where evacuation orders were issued for vulnerable areas like Hatteras and Ocracoke islands. The storm's large size, with hurricane-force winds extending 105 miles from its center, is creating hazardous marine conditions far from its direct path.</p>

The plan, which critics call a partisan gerrymander, must still pass the state Senate before being put to voters in a special election.

          <p>The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) has officially set a new single-season attendance record, with over 2.5 million fans attending games so far this year. The league achieved this milestone in just 226 games, surpassing the previous record set in 2002 over the course of 256 games. This achievement reflects the surging popularity of women's basketball and supports the WNBA's ongoing expansion plans. The league intends to grow from 15 teams to 18 by 2030, with new franchises planned for cities including Portland, Toronto, and Philadelphia to meet the increasing public demand for the sport.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates showing a downward trend, financial experts advise homeowners with high-interest loans to begin preparing for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key preparatory steps include reviewing credit reports for inaccuracies, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and estimating home equity levels. Homeowners should also gather essential documents like proof of income, insurance, and existing mortgage statements to expedite the process. Researching lenders in advance is also recommended to be able to move quickly when favorable rates become available to secure savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rainbow-colored crosswalk outside Orlando's former Pulse nightclub, a memorial to the 49 victims of the 2016 mass shooting, was painted over by the state of Florida. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer condemned the action as a "cruel political act," stating the removal was done without discussion and despite the crosswalk meeting safety standards. The move follows a Florida Department of Transportation memo prohibiting "surface art" with social or political messages, which has prompted similar removal orders in other Florida cities. Pulse survivors and local officials have expressed devastation over the erasure of the memorial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that the Trump administration's "America First" foreign policy is not isolationist but rather an interventionist strategy aimed at reshaping European politics. The article argues that recent actions, such as officials endorsing far-right parties in Germany and appearing to condition military support on election outcomes in Poland, reveal a desire to actively support ideological allies. This approach marks a significant shift from traditional transatlantic cooperation, replacing it with a more transactional and partisan relationship. This change is forcing European nations to reassess their dependency on the U.S. and confront differing geostrategic priorities, particularly regarding Russia and China.</p>

          <p>The lengthy and costly process of building new pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in the U.S. illustrates the difficulty the industry faces in quickly adapting to potential tariffs from the Trump administration. A new Fujifilm Biotechnologies facility in North Carolina, for example, has taken five years and over $3 billion to become operational, highlighting the complex regulatory and technological hurdles involved. While drugmakers were already increasing U.S. production due to favorable tax policies, the scale and time required mean they cannot rapidly shift supply chains to avoid new duties. This underscores the significant logistical challenges in the push to bring more drug manufacturing back to American soil. (not investment advice)</p>

Although the court initially rejected the dismissal request due to a related class-action complaint, legal experts believe this filing is a strong indicator that a resolution between the parties has been reached.

          <p>The Department of Justice is reportedly launching an investigation into Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, according to a letter sent to Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Governor Greg Abbott has proposed a rule that would strip any lawmaker of their seat if they miss seven consecutive days of legislative proceedings without an approved leave of absence. The original walkout by Democrats successfully stalled the redistricting bill for two weeks by breaking the quorum needed for the House to conduct business.
