          <p>The Prime Minister announced upcoming changes to the UK immigration system, including stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents, and extending the wait time for settlement from five to ten years. The reforms aim to create a controlled, selective, and fair system, but critics warn of potential family separations and negative impacts on migrants. The article highlights the government's intent to tighten immigration rules, potentially affecting tens of thousands of lower-skilled workers. The Liberal Democrats criticized the government's plan, saying the immigration system was in "tatters" and trust had been "shattered".</p>

The article explores the concerns of leaders and residents about the state's future, despite its past successes in overcoming adversity. The biggest difference today, compared to the difficult chapters California has weathered since its founding in 1850, is the presence of a president who has expressed hostility toward the state.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane, sources told CBS News. The plane, a 747-8, won't be ready to serve as Air Force One quite yet, and Mr. Trump won't be using it to fly back to the U.S. from the Middle East. The plane needs to be checked for security and spying devices before it is accepted, one of the sources told CBS News. The plane will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury plane described to be a “palace in the sky” being offered to the US president as a gift from Qatar’s royal family, almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism. The article reports that Trump toured the opulent plane in February while it was parked at the West Palm Beach international airport. If Trump continued using it out of office, it would give him access to a much more modern plane than Trump Force One,” which is a private Boeing 757 built in 1991 that belongs to the organization run by his sons.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that the United States had made “substantial progress” in talks with China after a weekend of meetings in Geneva, and that additional details would be announced on Monday. Any indication of a trade truce between the world’s two largest economies would lift financial markets and ease concerns among companies, investors and economists that the global economy was poised for a sharp downturn. Though the two governments have taken an outwardly tough position, officials in both countries have indicated they would like to find a path to bring the tariffs down. The tariffs are so punitive they are already disrupting the world’s supply chains.</p>

          <p>This opinion article discusses President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program and its potential impact on students with disabilities. The author argues that limiting federal oversight and providing states with greater flexibility could undermine the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and lead to unequal access to quality education. The article highlights the importance of federal oversight in ensuring that states meet the minimum requirements of IDEA and provide inclusive education for all students. Without a fully functioning Department of Education, states will not be held accountable for meeting even the minimum requirements of IDEA, and this landmark piece of legislation risks becoming essentially toothless, save for civil litigation.</p>

          <p>This news analysis explores the ongoing tensions within the British royal family, particularly the strained relationship between Prince Harry and his father, King Charles III. Harry’s emotional plea to be reconciled with his family — made in a recent interview with the BBC, in which he mused about how long his cancer-stricken father had left to live — resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family, which has yet to find its footing in the still-fledgling Carolean era. The article suggests that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign and undermine the monarchy's attempts to model unity.</p>
