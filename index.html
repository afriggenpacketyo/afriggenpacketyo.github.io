          <p>A White House envoy is making a final attempt to secure a peace deal with Russia before a deadline that would trigger severe sanctions against nations purchasing Russian oil, such as India and China. The diplomatic effort faces skepticism, as reports suggest Russian President Vladimir Putin is undeterred by the threat of secondary sanctions. The situation is further complicated by Ukraine's claim that it found Indian-made components in Russian attack drones, which have been used in deadly strikes against civilian targets. President Trump has also threatened to substantially increase tariffs on India for its role in fueling Russia's economy.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined former prominent fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm nearly £46 million following the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The collapse impacted around 300,000 investors who were unable to withdraw their money. The FCA determined that Woodford and his firm made "unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions," shifting into illiquid assets and failing to manage the fund's worsening liquidity. Woodford's firm disputes the findings, blaming the fund's liquidator for the investor losses and intending to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A weeklong manhunt has concluded with the arrest of Austin Robert Drummond, the 28-year-old prime suspect in the killing of four people in Tennessee. The victims were Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend; the couple's infant was found abandoned but safe in a nearby county. Drummond was captured in a wooded area in Jackson following the release of a home security camera image of him. He now faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder and one count of aggravated kidnapping, as the investigation into a motive continues.</p>

          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates, primarily due to struggles in its U.S. market. Both KFC and Pizza Hut experienced a 5% decline in domestic same-store sales, with executives citing that value messages and new products failed to resonate with consumers. In contrast, Taco Bell remained a strong performer with a 4% same-store sales growth, bolstered by popular menu items like its Crispy Chicken Nuggets. Despite the domestic challenges, the company's overall same-store sales grew 2%, supported by international performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has implemented a new phone-sharing system that reroutes calls from local offices to available staff nationwide, a change intended to reduce wait times. However, employees and advocates report that this system is causing significant problems, as callers are often connected with staff who lack the jurisdictional authority to resolve their specific cases. This creates delays and frustration, forcing issues to be referred back to the original office, undermining the system's goal of efficiency. Critics worry the change will erode public confidence and make it harder for individuals, especially those without representation, to access their benefits.</p>

At least 21 individuals have been infected with Campylobacter and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), with seven requiring hospitalization and two experiencing severe complications. Among the infected are six children under the age of 10. While selling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida, it can be sold as pet food, and officials have expressed particular concern over the farm's sanitation practices.</p>

          <p>A new book by Scott Anderson, reviewed in this article, argues that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was a result of historical contingency rather than an unavoidable outcome of Iran's culture or religion. The analysis posits that the revolution succeeded due to a convergence of factors, including the Shah's hubris, growing inequality, and critical miscalculations by the United States. The U.S. government was reportedly ill-informed and unfocused, failing to grasp the severity of the threat posed by Ayatollah Khomeini's movement. This perspective suggests the rise of the Islamic Republic was a 'freakish convergence of circumstances' that outmaneuvered the Shah and his American allies.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly stated that Republicans are "entitled" to five additional congressional seats in Texas, supporting a controversial mid-decade redistricting plan. The proposed maps have prompted Texas Democratic lawmakers to flee the state to deny a legislative quorum and block the measure. Trump also made unsubstantiated claims of gerrymandering in Democratic-controlled states like California and Illinois, where many of the Texas Democrats have taken refuge. The move sets the stage for a significant political and legal battle over voting maps ahead of the next midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former chief business officer at Google X, asserts that the notion of artificial intelligence creating more jobs than it destroys is "100% crap." He argues that AI is poised to eliminate a wide range of roles, from entry-level positions to C-suite executives, citing his own AI startup as an example of a project that required far fewer developers than in the past. While leaders like Mark Cuban advocate for learning AI skills to gain a competitive edge, Gawdat predicts a future requiring universal basic income as traditional work becomes obsolete.

          <p>Voting rights experts and civic groups argue that the new congressional map proposed by Texas Republicans illegally dilutes the voting power of Latinos, particularly in the Austin area. The map would dismantle a district currently held by a Latino representative and fails to create new Latino-majority districts despite significant Hispanic population growth. Critics contend the plan violates the Voting Rights Act by cracking and packing minority voters to secure a political advantage for Republicans.

          <p>This article examines whether buying an annuity at age 70 is a sound financial decision for retirees seeking guaranteed income. The primary benefit is that older buyers typically receive higher monthly payments, as the insurer's payout period is expected to be shorter. However, the main drawbacks include the illiquidity of the principal investment and the risk of not living long enough to recoup the initial cost, especially for those with health issues. Financial advisors suggest that while there is no single best age, the period between 70 and 75 can be a 'sweet spot' for purchasing immediate annuities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an unusual legal agreement, Rupert Murdoch will provide President Donald Trump with regular updates on his health to postpone a deposition in Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit against him. The lawsuit pertains to a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's lawyers had sought an immediate deposition, citing the 94-year-old media mogul's age and potential health issues. The deal stipulates that Murdoch will provide a sworn declaration of his current health and alert Trump's legal team to any material changes, delaying the deposition until a judge rules on a motion to dismiss the case.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance on releasing the personal details of crime suspects 'needs to change,' advocating for greater transparency. Her comments follow a case in Warwickshire involving the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, where the two suspects are reportedly Afghan nationals. Police have not confirmed their immigration status, citing national guidelines, which has led to accusations of a 'cover-up' from critics. The debate highlights the tension between public demand for information and legal requirements to ensure a fair trial, an issue currently under review by the Law Commission.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt remaining at historically high levels, financial experts are offering advice on how to qualify for debt settlement, also known as credit card debt forgiveness. To improve the chances of creditors forgiving a portion of debt, consumers should first organize their finances and obtain their credit reports to understand their total debt load. It is crucial to document evidence of financial hardship, such as job loss or medical bills, as this builds a stronger case for negotiation. Experts recommend either contacting creditors directly or working with a reputable, accredited debt settlement firm and always getting any final agreement in writing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has increased its support for former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, with the State Department publicly denouncing a court order placing him under house arrest. The order came after Bolsonaro allegedly violated a ban on using social media in connection with the ongoing investigation into a failed coup plot. The Trump administration has backed Bolsonaro, calling the trial a 'witch-hunt' and imposing sanctions on the presiding Supreme Court judge. This intervention has been celebrated by Bolsonaro's supporters, who hope U.S. pressure will lead to an amnesty for their leader, who faces a lengthy prison sentence if convicted.</p>

          <p>This satirical article imagines a near-future America where Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the Secretary of Health and Human Services, imposing a series of bizarre and pseudoscientific health policies. In this fictional 2029, citizens are mandated to wear health-monitoring wearables, use leeches before taking medicine, and consume 'Anti-Lemons' designed to induce scurvy to build character. The piece humorously critiques fringe health theories by depicting a society where government-funded science is replaced by anecdotal evidence and astrological compatibility determines one's profession. The narrative serves as a critical commentary on the potential consequences of abandoning evidence-based public health.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly preparing to propose a full military conquest and reoccupation of the Gaza Strip to his security cabinet. This potential escalation of the war aims to defeat Hamas and eliminate future threats, though it is said to be opposed by some senior military leaders. The news has alarmed the families of hostages still held in Gaza, who fear for their loved ones' safety, and would likely draw condemnation from international allies pushing for a ceasefire. Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert criticized the idea as 'outrageous,' warning it would lead to an 'endless war' with many casualties.</p>

          <p>A new report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicates that the adoption of artificial intelligence was directly cited as the reason for over 10,000 job cuts in the U.S. during the first seven months of 2025. The technology industry has seen the most significant impact, with layoffs increasing 36% from the previous year. While AI is an emerging factor, the report identifies federal budget cuts and economic uncertainty as the primary drivers of the more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts announced so far this year. The data suggests AI is beginning to reshape the labor market, particularly for entry-level corporate roles.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumers may soon face significant price increases on Swiss products as a 39% tariff is set to take effect, pending last-minute negotiations. The high tariff rate would impact iconic Swiss exports, including luxury watches, premium skincare, and artisan chocolates. For example, the retail price of a Rolex Submariner could jump from $10,000 to nearly $14,000. While large multinational corporations like Nestlé may mitigate the impact through local U.S. production, smaller businesses that rely on the 'Swiss-made' label for quality assurance are expected to be hit the hardest.
