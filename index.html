          <p>Nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, amidst ongoing dissatisfaction and the potential for strike action. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the award as inadequate, citing over a decade of pay erosion and rising numbers of nurses leaving the profession. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action over pay, adding to the pressure on the government's 10-year plan for the NHS. The outcome of the vote will significantly impact the future of nursing and healthcare services in the UK.</p>

          <p>Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon and Syria have weakened Iran's regional influence, according to analysts, following an Israeli operation that targeted key figures in the organization. The Mossad operation, which involved explosive pagers and walkie-talkies, disrupted Hezbollah's command structure and led to the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The subsequent ceasefire and the loss of strategic territories in Syria have diminished Iran's proxy war strategy, requiring a reevaluation of its regional objectives. The shift in power dynamics could potentially lead to a more stable and less volatile Middle East.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK energy firms are receiving substantial payments to halt electricity generation due to grid capacity limitations, raising concerns about energy bills and the government's net-zero promises. Wind farms in Scotland, for example, are often paid to restrict output because the grid cannot handle the generated power, while gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity. The government is considering a radical solution of regional pricing to improve efficiency and lower costs, but this has sparked controversy. The debate centers on whether a national or regional market will better deliver cheaper electricity and attract energy-intensive businesses.</p>

The call comes after the NHS issued an "amber alert" last year due to low supplies impacting patient treatment. The health service also emphasizes the need for more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types needed for treating sickle cell disease.</p>
