        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant drop after CEO Elon Musk engaged in a public dispute with President Donald Trump over a spending bill, leading to a 14% decrease in share value and a $34 billion reduction in Musk's net worth. The conflict arose from Musk's criticism of Trump's bill, which Trump responded to with threats to end government contracts and subsidies for Tesla. This fallout has raised concerns among investors and public officials regarding Tesla's governance and Musk's leadership, with calls for the board to ensure the company's interests are prioritized. The situation is further complicated by existing challenges facing Tesla, including increased competition and consumer backlash related to Musk's political stances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article discusses the significant decline in cancer death rates in the United States since 1991, attributing it to advancements in treatment, earlier screening, and anti-smoking policies. The age-adjusted death rate for cancer has decreased by approximately one-third, resulting in an estimated 4 million fewer cancer deaths, which the article attributes in large part to the HPV vaccine. Breakthroughs in treatments such as autologous stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have also contributed to increased survival rates, even for difficult cancers like multiple myeloma. While challenges remain, the future of cancer treatment is improving, offering patients more hope and a better quality of life.</p>

The article notes that Beijing has imposed export restrictions on rare earth elements, and that MP Materials plans to begin commercial production of magnets used in electric vehicles and humanoid robots.

          <p>An article discusses the increasing trend of television shows focusing on wealthy characters and their lifestyles, arguing that this focus creates unrealistic portrayals of everyday life and distorts our collective psyche. Shows like *And Just Like That* and others often prioritize showcasing luxury and privilege over meaningful narratives, leading to a lack of relatability and a disconnect from the realities faced by most Americans. The author contends that this obsession with wealth not only makes television less engaging but also reinforces the idea that wealth is the primary marker of a significant life, overshadowing the experiences and complexities of average people. By neglecting to depict the lives of the majority, television is failing to reflect the diverse realities of American society. </p>

          <p>This article addresses and debunks several false claims made by public figures regarding wind energy, including allegations that windmills are harming whales and killing birds. It cites scientific evidence and data to refute these claims, clarifying that there is no evidence linking wind turbine noise to whale deaths and that wind turbines account for a relatively small percentage of bird fatalities compared to other factors. The article also addresses concerns about the recyclability of wind turbine blades, highlighting ongoing efforts to improve recycling processes and reduce landfill waste.

          <p>The article examines the financial strategy of drawing down a 401(k) to delay receiving Social Security benefits, weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach. While delaying Social Security can result in higher monthly payments, the article cautions that this strategy overlooks the opportunity cost of 401(k) investments and the potential for compounding returns. It suggests that for some individuals, taking Social Security early and allowing their 401(k) to continue growing may be a more advantageous approach. The article emphasizes the importance of considering individual circumstances and consulting with a financial advisor to make informed decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article presents a timeline of the events surrounding the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native living in Maryland, to a mega-prison in El Salvador. Despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation, Abrego Garcia was deported due to the Trump administration's claim that he was a member of MS-13. After a series of court battles, including a Supreme Court ruling, Abrego Garcia was eventually brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges unrelated to his alleged gang affiliation. The timeline details the legal proceedings, the government's justifications, and the family's efforts to secure his return.</p>

          <p>The article explores the debate around time limits for federal rental assistance, using the Delaware State Housing Authority as a case study. Delaware's program includes a seven-year time limit, a work requirement, and a savings incentive, with tenants able to save money and build a savings account. However, housing policy experts warn that time limits and work requirements may not boost employment or help people move off subsidies, while the severe lack of affordable housing complicates the case for time limits. The success in Delaware hinges on the savings accounts and extra support provided to tenants, rather than the time limit itself.</p>

Chinese liquor brands are innovating their products to appeal to younger consumers, focusing on low-alcohol options. This shift reflects a broader trend where the younger generation prioritizes self-indulgent experiences over traditional social rituals, impacting the consumption patterns in China's alcohol market.</p>

It suggests that Musk's political interests are driven by his desire to defeat cultural progressivism and advance his career-shaping goal of human exploration to Mars. The author notes that the initial plan for Musk to assume a leading role in deregulatory efforts went into abeyance, and the reasons behind this shift are examined.

The editorial points to the cryptocurrency industry as a prime example, noting how Trump's involvement in the market has coincided with policy changes that benefit those who support him. The editorial argues that Trump's actions degrade public faith in government and undermine the rule of law, turning the U.S. into an executive kleptocracy.

His casting allowed the series to explore the ramifications of the Doctor's ability to look like anyone, confronting issues of racism and privilege. Gatwa's performance, combined with Russell T.
