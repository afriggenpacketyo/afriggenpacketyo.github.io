          <h2>Study Finds Sharp Increase in Accidental Nicotine Pouch Ingestion by Young Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 21:31:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a 763% increase in reports of children under six accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. While overall nicotine ingestions have decreased since 2015, the sharp rise related to pouches like Zyn is a significant concern for health experts. Researchers note that these incidents are more likely to result in serious medical outcomes compared to other nicotine products. The study highlights the danger posed by flavored products in colorful packaging that can be attractive to young children.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni strongly refuted what he called "bulls---" narratives suggesting quarterback Jalen Hurts was carried to his Super Bowl championship. Sirianni emphasized Hurts' selflessness and adaptability, stating he will do whatever is necessary for the team to win, whether it involves passing or handing off the ball frequently. He argued that winning in football is a team effort and that no successful quarterback or coach achieves victory without talented players around them. Sirianni praised Hurts as an elite, two-time Pro Bowl quarterback and the MVP of Super Bowl LIX.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested a man suspected of orchestrating a prank involving a teddy bear that appeared to be made of human skin, which was discovered at a gas station in Victorville, California. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department arrested Hector Corona Villanueva on suspicion of filing a false report and planting evidence. The coroner confirmed the bear was not made of human remains, and a South Carolina artist later identified herself as the creator of the macabre item, stating she had shipped it to a customer and was unaware of their intentions.</p>

          <p>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is reportedly considering resignation following a heated dispute with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The conflict stems from unfulfilled expectations within the MAGA movement regarding a supposed list of Epstein's powerful clients, which the DOJ has stated does not exist. Bongino, a former right-wing podcaster and a controversial appointee, clashed with Bondi in a high-level meeting, making his position within the administration appear uncertain. Despite the public squabbling, President Trump has publicly supported Bondi while also offering praise for Bongino.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Maxwell's lawyers argue that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement (NPA) should have prevented her prosecution. However, the DOJ contends the agreement was limited to the Southern District of Florida and did not bind other federal districts. The government's brief also states that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary and that prosecutors were not even fully aware of her role when the NPA was negotiated.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rallied after analysts suggested that the market overreacted to news of JPMorgan Chase potentially charging for customer data access. A report that JPMorgan was considering fees for data aggregators like Plaid had caused a sharp decline in fintech stocks. However, analysts from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley stated the potential costs would be negligible for large platforms and far from "business model-breaking." They noted that major fintechs rely more on debit, credit, or stored balances, and already have long-term pricing contracts in place for account verification services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent shift to a more aggressive policy toward Russia, including authorizing new weapons for Ukraine and threatening tariffs, is reportedly driven by personal frustration rather than a strategic change. According to White House insiders, Trump feels humiliated and made to look weak by Vladimir Putin's repeated defiance of his calls to end the war in Ukraine. After months of believing his personal relationship could broker a peace deal, Trump has grown angry as Putin escalated attacks. This change in posture is seen as Trump reacting to being personally slighted, not from a newfound support for Ukraine or transatlantic alliances.</p>
