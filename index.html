          <p>The Walt Disney Company has agreed to pay $10 million to settle allegations from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding the unlawful collection of children's personal data on YouTube. The FTC claimed that Disney allowed the collection of data from children viewing videos without parental notification or consent, violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule. The settlement requires Disney to pay the civil penalty, comply with data protection rules, and implement a program to review YouTube videos for child-directed content. This settlement highlights ongoing concerns about children's privacy online and the responsibilities of content creators and distributors. The company is still committed to investing in the tools needed to continue being a leader in this space. </p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul has voiced his disapproval of the Trump administration's decision to acquire a 10% stake in Intel, arguing it represents a move towards socialism. Paul expressed concern over the government's increasing involvement in the free market, especially after the Trump administration's recent interventions in other private sector deals, such as taking a stake in Nvidia and U.S. Steel. While some, like Senator Bernie Sanders, have supported the Intel investment, Paul maintains that government ownership is detrimental to the free market principles traditionally upheld by the Republican Party. This criticism highlights the ongoing debate about the appropriate role of government in the economy. Optimism remains low given the potential for government overreach. </p>

The next drawing will be on Wednesday night, with the jackpot's estimated cash value at $634.3 million before taxes. While the jackpot remained elusive, several tickets matched five white balls to win $1 million prizes, and some tickets doubled their winnings using the Power Play option. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 24.9. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's ruling that his deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles for law enforcement activities was illegal. The judge's ruling stated that the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement. This appeal comes as Trump considers deploying National Guard troops to other cities, raising concerns about the potential creation of a national police force under presidential control. The judge's ruling noted Trump's prior threats to deploy the Guard and troops in other cities, writing that doing so would create "a national police force with the President as its chief." </p>

          <p>A firm run by James Anderson, dubbed "Britain's kindest plumber," has been found to have breached multiple fundraising rules. The Fundraising Regulator investigated Depher Community Plumbing and Heating CIC following complaints about misleading information and misuse of funds. The regulator found that images of vulnerable people were used to encourage donations without context and that the firm did not have a system in place to learn from complaints. Anderson has denied some allegations but admitted to making mistakes. </p>

          <p>A High Court judge has criticized shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick for a social media post during a murder trial that could have potentially influenced the jury's decision. The post, related to the case of a gangland killer, was described as "ill thought through" by the judge. Jenrick's post was later removed, and the judge indicated that the post's deletion would be the end of the matter. The judge's comments highlight the importance of avoiding public commentary that could prejudice a jury. </p>

          <p>Topshop will return to the High Street in 2026, five years after closing all of its UK stores, with the brand to be available in 32 John Lewis shops. The brand disappeared after the collapse of Sir Philip Green's retail empire, but was bought by online retailer Asos. The partnership is seen as a canny move for both brands, with John Lewis hoping it will bring new customers through the department store's doors. Topshop will have to remember that high-street fashion "has come a long way" since the brand's heyday. </p>
