          <p>As Russia prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, the government is increasingly using Victory Day to consolidate its ideology, especially among the youth, with children participating in military parades and dressed in military attire. Political scientist Alexey Yusupov notes that the Kremlin has been militarizing this day to shape a new identity and ideology, drawing parallels between the Soviet Union and today's Russia to legitimize the current regime. While for many Russians, May 9 remains a day of mourning and remembrance, the state is instrumentalizing it as a tool for mobilization and propaganda, though some critics feel the parallels with the war in Ukraine are contrived.</p>

          <p>Single-family offices, facing economic uncertainties due to President Trump's tariffs, have reduced their direct investments, but artificial intelligence startups remain a focal point. According to Fintrx, AI-related startups accounted for half of the direct deals made by family offices last month. SandboxAQ, an AI firm using AI and quantum technology for large-scale predictions, finalized a $450 million Series E round with investments from billionaires and their family offices, including Ray Dalio's.

          <p>Senator John Fetterman reportedly exhibited alarming behavior during a meeting with representatives from a teachers union, raising renewed concerns about his mental health. According to sources, Fetterman repeated himself, shouted, and questioned why everyone was mad at him, slamming his hands on a desk, prompting a staff member to end the meeting and causing distress. This incident occurred shortly before a New York Magazine article detailed concerns from former staff about Fetterman's mental state, including a letter from his former chief of staff describing erratic behavior. Fetterman's office responded that the meeting was a 'spirited conversation' about education funding, while the union president declined to comment on the private discussion.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., following unified opposition from Senate Democrats and pushback from some key Republicans. Martin, a longtime Republican activist with no prior prosecutorial experience, had been serving as the interim U.S. Attorney. His nomination faced controversy due to his advocacy for defendants charged in the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol and his past praise for an alleged 'Nazi sympathizer.' Senator Thom Tillis stated he could not support Martin's confirmation due to his views on January 6th, highlighting the importance of condemning the events of that day.</p>

However, reports of thwarted drone attacks, strikes on air defense systems, and civilian panic in Jammu indicate a volatile situation where claims from both sides cannot be independently verified.</p>

          <p>Representative Buddy Carter of Georgia has announced his candidacy to challenge Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff in 2026, positioning himself as a staunch supporter of President Trump and focusing on cultural issues like transgender rights. Carter's entry into the race follows Governor Brian Kemp's decision not to run, potentially opening the door for other Republicans, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Carter is portraying Ossoff as out of touch with Georgia voters, criticizing his opposition to Trump's border policies and his stance on transgender athletes, while Ossoff's campaign suggests he will defeat any challenger.</p>

          <p>Despite the success of mRNA vaccines in combating Covid-19 and their potential in treating various diseases, mRNA therapies are facing a political backlash, with some lawmakers seeking to ban them and the government cutting funding. This resistance is fueled by vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and the Make America Healthy Again movement, leading to the cancellation of research into mRNA. Scientists and biotech leaders fear that the demonization of mRNA will stifle research into promising treatments and cures, potentially shifting innovation to other countries.</p>

Trump called Powell a 'fool' and suggested he may not be in love with him, while the Fed maintains its decision to keep rates steady is based on economic data and the balance of risks. The Fed's decision comes as other major global central banks have been reducing rates, and amid concerns that Trump's tariffs could spark inflation.</p>

The longer the Fed waits, the higher the odds that officials may have to lower borrowing costs more aggressively to shore up the economy, as uncertainty looms over trade policy and its effects on inflation and consumer spending.</p>
