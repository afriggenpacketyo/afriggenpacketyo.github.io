          <p>Australia's central bank maintained its benchmark policy rate at 3.6% despite inflation reaching its highest point in over a year, a decision consistent with economist expectations. This move follows earlier rate cuts this year aimed at controlling inflation, with the Reserve Bank of Australia governor noting a "clouded by uncertainty" economic outlook. Stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter provided room for the bank to prioritize inflation containment. The central bank continues to monitor global developments for potential impacts on the Australian economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition, comprising the CDU/CSU and SPD, faces record-low public satisfaction just four months into its term, prompting a closed-door meeting to address contentious issues. Key disagreements include the national budget, with debates over relaxing the "debt brake" for infrastructure and defense spending, and proposed tax increases versus austerity measures. Further internal conflicts exist on welfare payments, pension reforms for an aging population, and immigration policy amidst rising support for the far-right. The government also grapples with strengthening armed forces and reintroducing conscription, alongside lingering mistrust from past political missteps.</p>

The listing marks a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, which has seen significant year-on-year growth. Major investors included Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC and BlackRock Funds.

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan for Gaza, receiving welcomes from European and Middle Eastern leaders, as he urged Hamas to accept the terms. The proposal outlines an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for detained Gazans, and a future without Hamas governance. It also suggests an eventual Palestinian state and an "economic development plan" for Gaza's reconstruction. Former UK PM Sir Tony Blair is slated to be part of an international transitional body overseeing Gaza's temporary governance, which Trump himself would chair.</p>

          <p>Moroccan police detained dozens of individuals as youth-led protests, organized by anonymous online networks, entered their third day, calling for education and health reforms. Heavy security was deployed across major cities like Rabat and Casablanca to quell gatherings. Activists reported over 60 arrests in Rabat alone, criticizing the crackdown on free expression. Protesters expressed discontent over social inequalities and the government's focus on building World Cup stadiums while public health and education systems struggle. High youth unemployment rates and recent public hospital deaths have fueled widespread outrage.</p>

          <p>Major Chinese grocery retailers, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are implementing strategies similar to European discounters like Aldi and Lidl to appeal to cost-conscious shoppers. Amid economic uncertainty, these chains are focusing on private label brands and streamlining hypermarkets to offer lower prices and better value. This shift responds to Chinese consumers becoming more price-sensitive and rational in their spending habits. The move aims to reverse a slump in sales and store counts experienced by China's top operators last year. (not investment advice)</p>

Ambiguities within the framework allow both sides to appear to accept it while potentially sabotaging further negotiations.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Minnesota over its sanctuary city immigration policies, accusing state officials of jeopardizing public safety by not cooperating with federal immigration authorities. This action is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to crack down on "illegal immigration" and enforce mass deportations, targeting Democratic-led jurisdictions. The lawsuit alleges that Minnesota's policies lead to the release of "dangerous criminals" and violate federal law. This move aligns with previous legal threats and funding cuts against other sanctuary cities and states.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested a criminal investigation into former FBI Director Christopher Wray, based on a conservative media outlet's false claim that FBI agents were embedded in the Jan. 6 Capitol mob. Trump's call follows the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump publicly urged to prosecute. Wray, appointed by Trump, had left the bureau due to fears of turmoil and had drawn Trump's ire over investigations into election interference. The DOJ's Inspector General previously found no evidence of FBI agents encouraging illegal activity at the Capitol.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is on the brink of a shutdown after President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress failed to reach a budget agreement, with both sides entrenched in their positions.

The White House has indicated plans to use a shutdown to make permanent reductions in federal spending and employment.

          <p>Mumbai's long-delayed Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is nearing inauguration, aiming to significantly ease congestion and become India's first fully digital hub airport. Designed to handle 90 million passengers annually, it represents a major step in India's aviation ambitions amidst double-digit sector growth. However, NMIA faces substantial connectivity challenges, being 40km from the old city, potentially causing 2-3 hour travel times for passengers. Until direct metro links are established, the airport's ambition to rival global hubs like Singapore and Dubai will be hampered by "last mile connectivity" issues and regulatory hurdles.</p>
