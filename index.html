          <p>A report from Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office reveals that domestic violence cases reached a new record in 2024, with over 256,000 registered victims, a 3.7% increase from the previous year. This equates to a person experiencing mistreatment every two minutes on average, with women comprising 73% of the victims. Separately, a key railway line between Düsseldorf and Duisburg has reopened after suspected arson by left-wing extremists caused significant damage. Additionally, a German consumer group is suing several budget airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, arguing their fees for hand luggage violate a 2014 European Court of Justice ruling that deems such items a fundamental necessity for air travel.</p>

          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier Liu Guozhong has urged authorities in the southern city of Foshan to intensify efforts to control a Chikungunya outbreak as cases in Guangdong province rise. As of late July, Foshan, a major manufacturing hub, accounted for a majority of the nearly 5,000 cases reported in the province, with the total number later updated to over 6,500. Officials are focused on implementing strict port quarantines, enhancing prevention measures, and eliminating mosquitoes to cut off transmission channels. Fortunately, all reported cases have been mild, and there have been no fatalities associated with the current outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of individuals are choosing to live in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen while commuting daily to their jobs in Hong Kong, a trend driven by the significant cost-of-living difference. Commuters endure long journeys, often 90 minutes or more each way, involving multiple modes of transport and a border crossing. They trade this travel time for more affordable and spacious living arrangements, as renting an apartment alone in Hong Kong is often prohibitively expensive. This phenomenon is being widely discussed on Chinese social media, where people share tips on navigating the cross-border lifestyle to save money.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has described the transfer situation involving striker Alexander Isak as "complex" and "far from ideal." The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the 25-year-old Swedish player, whom they value at approximately £150 million. Isak was absent from the team's pre-season tour due to a minor thigh issue and has been training independently at his former club, a development Howe learned about through the media. Howe expressed his desire to keep Isak at Newcastle but acknowledged he is removed from the ongoing negotiations being handled back in England.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following the release of disappointing jobs data. Trump made unsubstantiated claims that the figures were "RIGGED" to make him look bad, a move that critics have condemned as undermining the integrity of government statistics. The dismissal occurred as US stock markets fell, rattled by both the weak jobs report and the president's ongoing tariff policies. Analysts suggest the labor market is deteriorating due to tariff-induced uncertainty, while the White House insists the economy is booming and the firing was justified. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump have caused significant disruption in global markets and elicited concern from key trading partners. The executive order imposes steep duties on imports from numerous countries, including Canada, India, and Switzerland, leading to sharp declines in US and European stock indices. Several nations, such as South Africa and India, are engaged in urgent negotiations to avert the economic impact before the August 7 implementation date. The French wine industry warned of a "brutal" impact, while allies like Canada expressed disappointment, signaling a period of heightened global trade tension and economic uncertainty.

The 33-year-old South Korean forward, who is reportedly in negotiations with LAFC, called it the "most difficult" decision of his career. Son scored 173 goals for Spurs and recently captained them to their first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League. He stated the need for a new environment to push himself, with his final appearance potentially occurring in his home country of South Korea during a pre-season friendly.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research team has discovered that the modern potato originated from an ancient hybridization event involving an ancestor of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists traced the plant's evolution back nine million years. The study, published in the journal *Cell*, found that a tomato-like plant hybridized with a tuberless, potato-like plant, leading to the development of tubers. This finding clarifies a long-standing question about how the potato, now the world's third most consumed food crop, developed its characteristic and economically vital underground tuber.</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages to the family of a woman killed and her boyfriend who was injured in a 2019 crash. The jury found Tesla partially liable because its Autopilot technology failed to prevent the collision, which occurred when the driver was distracted looking for his phone. The plaintiffs' attorney argued that Tesla deliberately chose not to restrict Autopilot's use to controlled-access highways, despite designing it for such environments. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, maintaining that the driver is solely responsible and that the system requires full driver attention.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police are searching for Efrain Villalobos, 28, the man suspected of shooting a driver who had plowed into a crowd outside an East Hollywood nightclub in July. The incident began when the driver, Fernando Ramirez, struck numerous people before crashing into food carts. As bystanders pulled Ramirez from the vehicle and began to attack him, Villalobos allegedly shot him in the lower back before fleeing. Authorities have released a description of Villalobos, who has distinctive tattoos, and are asking the public for help in locating him, warning that he should be considered armed and dangerous.</p>

          <p>Two Los Angeles County men, Ted Chien and Han Quan Jiao, have been charged with murder for their role in running an illegal cannabis extraction operation where five workers died in two separate incidents. Prosecutors allege the men oversaw a network of at least nine locations. In October 2023, an explosion at a warehouse in Irwindale killed four workers. A year later, another employee died in a fire at a lab in South El Monte. The district attorney stated the case highlights the deadly results of illegal operations that prioritize greed over safety.</p>

          <p>A significant traffic disruption occurred on a Pennsylvania highway when a truck carrying hot dogs experienced a mechanical failure. The truck's trailer was ripped open after scraping against a concrete divider, spilling its entire cargo of sausages across the road during the Friday morning commute. The incident created a slippery and unusual cleanup challenge for the Shrewsbury Fire Company. A front-end loader was required to scoop the discarded wieners off the highway and into a dump truck, providing a memorable and inconvenient experience for local motorists.</p>
