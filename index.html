Sources suggest that his experience covering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan makes him well-suited to assist the new American ambassador, David Perdue, particularly as Beijing and Washington engage in high-stakes trade talks. May's efforts in maintaining business, academic, and people exchanges in Hong Kong, despite sanctions, are also considered valuable for the new role. His pragmatism and resourcefulness are assets during this critical time in U.S.-China relations.</p>

Newsom claimed Trump's immigration crackdown has gone beyond arresting criminals, detaining individuals outside a Home Depot and sending unmarked cars to schools. He criticized Trump's decision to deploy the California National Guard without his support as governor, warning other states that they could be next. Newsom's address represents a significant escalation of tensions between California and the White House.</p>
