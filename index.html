            <p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has reported a record-breaking fundraising quarter, amassing $9.6 million as she and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) conduct "Fighting Oligarchy" rallies across the United States, criticizing President Trump's policies and the influence of billionaires. A significant portion of the donations came in small amounts from first-time donors, highlighting grassroots support. The funds will support organizing efforts in AOC's district and rallies nationwide, ensuring independence from lobbyists and corporations. AOC is also being considered as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer in 2028 due to discontent within the Democratic Party following recent election losses.</p>

            <p>During Meta's antitrust trial with the FTC, an email from 2018 revealed that CEO Mark Zuckerberg contemplated spinning off Instagram due to rising antitrust litigation concerns against Facebook.

            <p>A historic church on Chicago's South Side, Greenstone United Methodist Church, is facing closure due to a large unpaid gas bill. The community is coming together to raise $20,000 to save the church, which serves as a vital community center. The church typically hosts community dinners, clubs, and lectures, but programming has been suspended due to the gas being shut off. Neighbors are hopeful that the church can re-open its doors year-round with the community's support.</p>
