          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded in what authorities are calling a deliberate ambush in Idaho. The incident occurred as they were responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain, which investigators believe was intentionally set by the suspect to lure them to the location. A tactical team later found the body of the suspected lone gunman, Wess Roley, near the rapidly spreading fire, along with a rifle. The Kootenai County Sheriff stated that the attack was intentional and the firefighters "did not have a chance."</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its digital services tax (DST) on large technology firms, a move made just before the first payments were due. This decision came after the U.S. administration called the tax a "blatant attack" and threatened to halt trade deal negotiations. The 3% tax on Canadian revenue would have affected major U.S. tech companies like Google and Amazon, and was projected to generate C$5.9 billion over five years. The reversal aims to restart crucial trade talks between the two North American neighbors. (not investment advice)</p>

Both banks saw their stress capital buffer requirements lowered more significantly than their peers, indicating improved resilience in hypothetical economic downturns. This easing of capital requirements could allow the banks to increase shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, as well as pursue more loan growth. The results are seen as part of a broader trend of a more favorable regulatory environment for large banks. (not investment advice)</p>

The case, which could result in a life sentence, involves seven weeks of testimony, including from former girlfriends who alleged he was violent and forced them into sexual encounters. Prosecutors argued that Combs used his power and wealth to operate above the law, while his defense team contended the case is about money and that the sexual acts were consensual.

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered significant disparities and failings in how police forces across England and Wales handle cases of coercive or controlling behaviour (CCB), a decade after it was made a crime. The report highlights that victims often have to act as their own detectives due to poor police response, with some forces logging three times more CCB offenses than others. Many forces are not using the recommended risk-assessment tool, indicating a lack of priority and understanding of the offense. The findings have prompted calls for radical change to address what legal experts describe as "horrendous attitudes."</p>

Israeli officials are in Washington for meetings on the war, and some, like Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, have echoed the desire to add more countries to the peace agreements.

The bill would end the credits for projects placed in service after 2027, a change from previous versions that allowed projects already under construction to qualify.

          <p>Luckin Coffee, a major coffee chain from China and a significant rival to Starbucks in Asia, has opened its first two stores in the United States, both located in Manhattan. The company, known for its rapid growth and app-based, cashier-less model, is setting out to compete in the crowded U.S. coffee market. While Luckin's model in China relies on being significantly cheaper than Starbucks, its initial U.S. prices appear to be roughly on par with its American competitor. The move represents a direct challenge to Starbucks on its home turf.</p>

This case follows the court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which removed limits on independent spending, and could significantly alter the landscape of money in politics by allowing for greater direct party influence on campaigns.</p>

Instead of relying on litigation, the piece suggests progressives should recalibrate their strategy to focus on building support through democratic and political arenas.

The Treasury Department has already issued guidance to roll back some financial restrictions to encourage new investment.

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been convicted of the 1967 sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol, in what is believed to be the UK's oldest solved cold case. Dunne was found strangled in her home nearly six decades ago, but the case went unsolved despite a massive investigation. The case was cracked decades later when DNA from a semen swab taken at the scene was finally linked to Headley, a convicted rapist with a history of similar attacks. The conviction represents a landmark achievement in forensic science and cold case investigation.</p>

          <h2>Minimum Wage to Increase in Two States and Over a Dozen U.S. Cities on July 1</h2>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these hikes will benefit over 800,000 workers, with women and minority workers disproportionately seeing a pay raise. The increases are the result of ballot measures and automatic inflation adjustments. The federal minimum wage, in contrast, has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009, prompting many states and localities to enact their own higher baseline wages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Vacates Lower Court Rulings That Favored Transgender Rights</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following its recent decision upholding a Tennessee law banning certain medical treatments for transgender youth, the U.S. Supreme Court has thrown out several lower appellate court rulings. The vacated decisions had previously favored transgender people in cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, primarily concerning access to medical care and the right to change birth certificates. The Supreme Court has ordered the appellate courts to reexamine these cases in light of its new precedent. This action represents a significant setback for transgender rights advocates in those states.</p>
