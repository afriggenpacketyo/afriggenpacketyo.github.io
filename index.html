          <p>A wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed approximately 12,000 acres and is 35% contained, prompting a state of emergency declaration. The blaze, which threatened 1,300 homes, destroyed at least one business, but caused no injuries or loss of life. Authorities attribute the fire's rapid spread to dry conditions and expect the acreage to increase as they continue containment efforts. Evacuations have been lifted, and power is being restored to affected areas, with the cause of the fire still under investigation.</p>

His comments come amid rising Treasury yields and a weakening dollar, indicating investors are moving away from the U.S. as a safe investment destination. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has closed its main border crossing with Pakistan, cancelled visas for Pakistanis, and suspended a water-sharing treaty. The attack, which killed tourists in Pahalgam, has triggered mourning and anger in India. India has signaled that it holds Pakistan indirectly responsible for the attack, accusing Islamabad of supporting armed groups in the region, a claim Pakistan denies.
