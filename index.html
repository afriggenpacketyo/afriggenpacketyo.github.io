          <p>Amidst ongoing daily attacks between Israel and Iran, Israel has reported conducting strikes that killed three Iranian generals and targeted the Isfahan nuclear site. European leaders convened with Iranian diplomats in Geneva in an attempt to diplomatically resolve the situation and prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear weapons program. French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the real risk of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, and while no major breakthroughs were achieved during the talks, both European leaders and the Iranian foreign minister expressed a willingness to continue discussions in the future. The situation remains tense as diplomatic efforts continue alongside military actions.</p>

          <p>A recent Fox News poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, agree with President Trump's stance that Iran poses a real security threat to the United States. The poll, conducted amidst escalating attacks between Israel and Iran, shows that nearly three-quarters of registered voters believe Iran is a threat, with a large percentage expressing concern about Iran obtaining nuclear weapons. Political scientist Wayne Lesperance suggests that Trump's support for Israel's actions against Iran could be politically advantageous, but cautions that success depends on the attacks being successful and Americans being tolerant of the repercussions. This poll reflects a heightened sense of risk given the current climate.</p>

          <p>Recently unsealed court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a "prepper" who had given his wife a "bailout plan." Boelter's wife told investigators they were preparing for major incidents, and Boelter had directed her to go to her mother's home in Wisconsin. Investigators found empty rifle cases and gun-cleaning supplies in a storage locker rented by Boelter.

          <p>Senior Israeli officials suggest their military campaign against Iran could lead to the fall of the regime, which would have significant consequences for the global oil market. Despite the ongoing conflict, oil prices have remained relatively stable, but analysts warn that the risk of supply disruption and price spikes is increasing. While Prime Minister Netanyahu denies regime change is the official goal, Defense Minister Katz has ordered intensified strikes to destabilize the regime. JPMorgan analysts note that historical regime changes in major oil-producing countries have led to substantial oil price spikes, potentially triggering economic recession.</p>

Families often deplete their savings to afford care, and the United States lags behind other developed countries in providing affordable options. The Public Policy Institute of California projects a significant increase in the number of older adults by 2040, necessitating more families to rely on personal savings or unpaid help. The lack of a universal healthcare system exacerbates the problem, leaving many elders and their families in a precarious financial situation.</p>

          <p>SkinnyTok, a corner of the internet where thin women promote staying skinny, has sparked controversy with its harsh approach to dieting and body image. Influencers like Liv Schmidt, known for her restrictive eating habits, have gained popularity and criticism, leading to bans on related hashtags. The movement reflects a backlash against body positivity, with some women feeling that skinny is back and that SkinnyTok offers a more honest approach. However, the content has been linked to disordered eating habits and potentially leads viewers down a pipeline of tradwife content and conspiratorial alt-right viewpoints.</p>

Japan had previously decided to double its defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027, but Trump continues to argue that the U.S.-Japan security treaty is one-sided.

The author argues that the incident reveals the influence of Trump-era politics, where truth is often distorted for personal gain, and hateful rhetoric can incite violence.

The blurred lines between business and politics raise concerns about conflicts of interest and the use of the presidency for personal profit. While Trump's supporters view his business ventures as proof of his self-made success, critics argue that he has redrawn the boundaries between commerce and the office of the president. The sale of the family name continues despite ongoing dramas, and the Trump administration claims transparency, but analysts see a calculated effort to turn political fandom into profit.</p>

          <p>Celine Song's film Materialists, a romantic drama set in New York City, follows a matchmaker who is torn between two men and forced to confront the harsh realities of her profession when a client is sexually assaulted. The movie attempts to explore complex themes of love, ambition, and capitalism but ultimately falls short due to its uneven execution and reliance on problematic tropes. The use of sexual assault as a plot device to further the protagonist's emotional growth feels cynical and undermines the film's potential, especially given its marketing as a rom-com.
