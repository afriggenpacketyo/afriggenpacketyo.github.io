          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The State Department has informed a federal judge that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man erroneously deported to El Salvador, is "alive and secure" in a Terrorism Confinement Center. The Supreme Court has ordered the U.S. government to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return to America after a court order barring his deportation was ignored. Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue he escaped political violence in El Salvador in 2011, while the Trump administration claims he was a member of the MS-13 gang, claims his lawyers and wife deny. The government has been ordered to aid in his return, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>

            <p>ESPN commentator Rece Davis predicts that Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning will become a polarizing figure in college football. Davis suggests that Manning's high profile will lead some fans to appreciate him, while others will resent him. Manning appeared in 10 games last season, including two starts, finishing with 939 passing yards, nine touchdowns, and two interceptions. Texas is set to open the 2025 season against Ohio State, the reigning national champions.</p>

The attack occurred in a separation center for the country's most dangerous extremist prisoners. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the attack, promising the strongest possible punishment, while the Prison Officers' Association called for a review of freedoms given to prisoners in these centers.</p>

            <p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus's recent visit to China signals a potential shift away from India's dominant foreign policy grip. China committed $2.1 billion in investments, loans, and grants, including modernization of Mongla Port and development of an industrial zone. This move is seen as an effort to diversify Bangladesh's foreign policy and strengthen ties with Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region. Previously, Bangladesh had strengthened economic and strategic ties with India, including allowing access to its ports and extending credit lines.</p>

            <p>More than 100 people, including children and aid workers, have been killed in attacks on famine-hit camps for displaced people in Sudan's Darfur region, according to the UN. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias launched a two-day offensive on the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher. The attacks have forced thousands to flee, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the region, where millions face extreme hunger.</p>

            <p>President Trump's rapidly changing tariff policies have created uncertainty and volatility in the US market. Consumers are experiencing pressure to stock up on goods before prices rise, while others feel paralyzed by the constant changes. Trump has altered his tariff plans repeatedly, initially scaling back duties on some countries before exempting smartphones and other electronics. The moves have led to concerns about potential price increases and shortages, with some analysts predicting significant impacts on clothing, pharmaceuticals, and food prices.
