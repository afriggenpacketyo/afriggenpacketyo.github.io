          <p>The White House budget chief has announced an immediate pause on over $11 billion in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects, citing the ongoing government shutdown. These funds, designated for what are termed "lower-priority projects" in major cities, may be subject to cancellation. This move is part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to leverage the shutdown to reduce the federal bureaucracy, following previous freezes on infrastructure and climate-related funding in Democratic-leaning states. A federal judge has, however, temporarily blocked the administration from proceeding with planned layoffs of government workers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent selloff in regional bank stocks has highlighted growing investor anxiety regarding loans made to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs). The concerns were triggered after Zions Bancorporation disclosed a significant loss on a $60 million loan, followed by a lawsuit from Western Alliance against the same borrower for alleged fraud. This has drawn parallels to the 2023 banking crisis, focusing attention on the fast-growing $1.14 trillion NDFI lending sector, which operates outside of traditional banking regulations. Analysts note the difficulty in assessing the true risk of these loan portfolios, leading to a hunt for potential hidden exposures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that President Donald Trump has a "big chance" to end the war with Russia. Zelenskyy is in Washington to advocate for military aid, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, which he believes could pressure Russia into negotiations. Trump expressed a desire to end the conflict quickly but also voiced concerns about depleting U.S. weapon supplies, though he seemed open to a potential exchange of Ukrainian drones for the missiles. The meeting occurred after Trump's lengthy phone call with Vladimir Putin, with plans for a face-to-face summit between the two leaders in the near future.</p>

          <p>After more than six decades, CBS News is closing its workspace in the Pentagon, joining most major news organizations in refusing to sign new press requirements. The new policy mandates that journalists receive formal authorization before publishing certain information, even if it is unclassified, a move press associations argue could infringe on First Amendment rights. Veteran correspondents like David Martin emphasized that being physically present in the Pentagon was crucial for building trust and breaking stories over the years. Despite losing their building credentials, the network has affirmed its commitment to continue reporting on the military and the Department of Defense.</p>

          <p>The athletic shoe company On is being sued by customers who allege its popular "CloudTec" sneakers produce a "noisy and embarrassing squeak" with every step. The class-action lawsuit claims that consumers, including nurses who wear the shoes for long periods, would not have purchased the premium-priced footwear had they known about the issue. The plaintiffs accuse the company of deceptive marketing and are seeking refunds and damages, stating that the design flaw makes the shoes unwearable without modifications. On, which is backed by tennis star Roger Federer, has declined to comment on the allegations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent confirmation of authorized CIA covert operations within Venezuela has revived concerns about the history of U.S. intervention in Latin American politics. President Trump has increasingly focused on Venezuela, linking President Nicolás Maduro to drug cartels and escalating actions from sanctions to naval strikes against alleged smuggler boats. While some experts view this as a "special case" driven by migration and drug concerns, others see it as part of a broader strategy to counter rivals like China and secure U.S. interests in the resource-rich nation. The approach marks a significant shift, with Trump declaring a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels.</p>

The issue stemmed from a staffing shortage in the sterile processing department, which was overwhelmed after the hospital opened new operating rooms.

          <p>The British government has stated it is "doing everything" possible to reverse a decision banning Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. The city's Safety Advisory Group imposed the ban due to safety concerns, citing intelligence and previous incidents of violence involving the club's fans. The move has been widely criticized by political leaders as discriminatory. The Home Office is now working with police to explore what additional resources would be needed to allow the game to proceed safely with all fans present.</p>

          <p>As President Trump prepares to visit his home state of Florida, polling data from Morning Consult shows his job approval rating there remains net positive, with 51% of voters approving versus 45% disapproving. This contrasts with his national standing, where his approval has become net negative in every 2024 swing state. Nationally, polling aggregators show Trump's approval rating is around 44-45%, which is historically low compared to previous presidents at the same point in their first term. The visit coincides with planned "No Kings" protests against his administration's policies near his Mar-a-Lago club.</p>

          <p>U.S. electricity providers are facing a significant challenge in determining the actual future power demand from the artificial intelligence industry. While AI companies are announcing plans for massive data centers that could consume enormous amounts of energy, they are often shopping the same projects to multiple utilities, making it difficult to distinguish real projects from speculative ones. This uncertainty complicates grid planning and could lead to billions in unnecessary infrastructure investment. Experts agree that a substantial increase in electricity consumption is coming, but the exact scale remains a multibillion-dollar question for the energy sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While many homebuyers await the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut at the end of October, there is a possibility that mortgage rates could fall before the official announcement. Historically, lenders often "price in" expected Fed cuts in advance, leading to rate drops before the meetings themselves, as seen in both 2024 and earlier in 2025. This pattern suggests that a window of opportunity for lower rates may open for borrowers in the coming days or weeks. To prepare, prospective buyers and refinancers are advised to improve their credit scores and monitor daily rate fluctuations closely. (not investment advice)</p>

After killing Willard Tietjen, Bryant wrote "catch me if u can" on a wall using the victim's blood. Bryant, who was also linked by prosecutors to two other killings, will be the 50th person executed in the state since 1985. His lawyers' request for a delay due to the federal government shutdown was denied. Bryant will have the choice to die by lethal injection, firing squad, or the electric chair.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the recently leaked racist and antisemitic text messages from Young Republican leaders are more than just expressions of bigotry; they represent a profound moral collapse within the MAGA movement. The author contends that the embrace of hateful rhetoric, such as professing love for Hitler, signifies a deliberate rejection of basic decency, enabled by the political climate. The article criticizes the partisan relativism that excuses such behavior, suggesting that a successful opposition must appeal to universal values of respect and common decency that have been abandoned. The dehumanization of any group, the author concludes, ultimately degrades all of society.</p>

          <p>A potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in Budapest faces significant logistical challenges, primarily due to the EU's ban on Russian aircraft in its airspace. For Putin to fly to the landlocked nation of Hungary, he would require special permission from individual EU and NATO member states to cross their territory. While Hungary's government has said it will ensure his passage, the route would likely be circuitous, avoiding nations like Ukraine and Poland. The situation highlights the diplomatic complexities of engaging with the Russian leader amid ongoing sanctions and international tensions.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against three major plastic bag manufacturers, accusing them of deceptively marketing their products as recyclable when they are not processed by the state's facilities. The lawsuit alleges that Novolex, Inteplast, and Mettler Packaging sold thicker plastic bags that overwhelmingly end up in landfills rather than being recycled. In a separate action, the state announced a $1.7 million settlement with four other producers who agreed to halt sales of such bags. This legal action is part of a broader state investigation into the plastics industry for its role in the global pollution crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent record-high price of gold is accelerating a shift away from the classic 60/40 stock and bond investment portfolio. Some strategists now advocate for a 60/20/20 model, reducing bond allocation in favor of a 20% share for alternatives like precious metals and cryptocurrencies. This change is driven by the belief that bonds no longer provide adequate protection against inflation and geopolitical risk, as they increasingly move in tandem with stocks. The surge in gold, fueled by central bank buying and economic uncertainty, is leading investors to view it as a core holding rather than a fringe asset. (not investment advice)</p>

Parke was previously arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after a client, Alice Webb, died last year following a non-surgical butt lift procedure he performed. Webb's family has expressed outrage that he continues to operate in the cosmetics industry while still on bail. Lab tests confirmed the drugs he is selling contain semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, which can be dangerous if not prescribed and administered correctly by a medical professional.</p>
