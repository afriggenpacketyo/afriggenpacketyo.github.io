          <p>Two teenagers in Ruislip, west London, have admitted to torturing and killing two kittens. The police investigation started after a kitten was found hanging from a tree near Ruislip Golf Club, and another was found nearby on May 3rd. The 16-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to protected animals by mutilating and killing them; they also admitted possessing a knife at the golf course. The kittens were found with ropes attached and had been cut open, and knives, blowtorches, and scissors were found at the scene.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that the company will launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service will start with approximately 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Unsupervised, and will rapidly scale to thousands if the initial launch is successful. These robotaxis will be geofenced initially, meaning their operation will be limited to specific areas in Austin, but there will be no human safety driver in the vehicles. Tesla employees will remotely monitor the fleet, gradually reducing the level of oversight as confidence grows.</p>

Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, stating that habeas corpus is the foundational right separating free societies from police states. Noem's remarks come amid an unprecedented campaign of detentions and deportations, and after White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller suggested suspending habeas corpus for migrants by claiming an invasion. A DHS assistant secretary defended Noem by saying presidents have suspended habeas corpus in practice during crises.</p>

          <p>Maryland lawmakers have introduced a bill to posthumously award Henrietta Lacks a Congressional Gold Medal for her contributions to medical research through her HeLa cells, which were taken without her consent. The Henrietta Lacks Congressional Gold Medal Act, introduced by Maryland Rep. Kweisi Mfume and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, would honor Lacks for her contribution to life-saving research, even though her cell samples were taken without her consent. Research involving HeLa cells has led to treatments for polio, HIV/AIDS, leukemia, and Parkinson's disease. The Lacks family has sued several pharmaceutical companies over using HeLa cells without consent.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland could receive up to £70 each following a court ruling that historic fees administered by Mastercard were unfair. The legal case, initiated by a former financial ombudsman, argued that shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on transactions between 1992 and 2008. Consumers are eligible if they lived in the specified regions for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008 and purchased goods or services from UK businesses accepting Mastercard. The settlement is for £200m, with £100m ringfenced for consumers who have until the end of the year to claim.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail has been arrested for allegedly helping ten inmates escape after claiming he was forced to assist. Sterling Williams, 33, is accused of turning off the water to the cell used for the escape, which involved removing a toilet from the wall. Williams said an inmate threatened him with a makeshift knife if he did not comply. Three of the escaped inmates were captured the same day, and a fourth was apprehended later.

          <p>The fetus of a brain dead Georgia woman being kept alive is continuing to grow, her mother reported, sparking questions about the ethics of using the state's anti-abortion law to maintain life support. The woman, Adriana Smith, was declared brain dead after suffering blood clots in her brain while pregnant. Under Georgia law, abortion is banned after about six weeks, with provisions strengthening "fetal personhood." Doctors told the family the law requires keeping Smith alive to preserve the pregnancy, a decision the family says should have been left to them.</p>

Other points of contention include proposed cuts to Medicaid and a tripling of a local tax deduction. Trump met with dissenting Republicans, but was unable to convince all the holdouts.</p>

Less experienced investors should avoid gold mining stocks and consider gold bars, coins, or gold IRAs. Monitoring the economic climate will help investors determine potential selling opportunities.

They devised a score of 28 blood markers and up to 33 urine markers that reliably predicted ultraprocessed food intake in people consuming typical diets.

          <p>Simon Daniel, a freshman at California State University, Fullerton, drowned in an accidental drowning while on vacation in Arizona. Daniel entered Lake Havasu River alongside three fraternity brothers and two visiting sorority members. The group found themselves in distress due to recent heavy rains that had significantly increased water flow, creating hazardous conditions. While several fraternity members risked their own lives to rescue the students, Daniel was swept away by a wave and did not resurface.</p>
