          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States successfully attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, specifically targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan. According to Trump's social media posts, the operation was completed without any aircraft remaining in Iranian airspace, and a full payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site at Fordo. Trump congratulated the American military for their achievement and stated that now is the time for peace. He also mentioned that he would address the nation later that evening to provide more details regarding the situation. Optimism surrounding the potential for peace is tempered by the reality of military action.</p>

          <p>Congressional leaders have expressed mixed reactions to President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, with some Republicans supporting the move and some Democrats questioning the president's authority. Senator Lindsey Graham praised the action as the right call, while Senator Bernie Sanders criticized it as unconstitutional, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war. Representative Rick Crawford stated he was in contact with the president before the attack, while other members of Congress, such as Representative Tom Massie, raised concerns about the lack of congressional approval for the strikes. The differing opinions reflect the ongoing debate about executive power and military intervention.</p>

          <p>Most Republicans are willing to give great deference to President Donald Trump to strike Iran â€” without Congressional authorization to hit inside sovereign territory inside another country. There are some concerns that the Presidentâ€™s aggressive action could peel off some pro-MAGA supporters â€” simply because Trump campaigned against getting involved in overseas conflicts. There are also divisions among Democrats. Regardless, lawmakers from both sides are concerned about retaliation from Iran and its proxies. Even possible strikes in the U.S. from sleeper cells. Expect a Senate-wide briefing on Iran to come Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Stephanie Fagan and Jessica Pelley, childhood friends, were separated by the tragic murders of the Pelley family in 1989, an event that deeply impacted both of their lives. Jessica, who survived because she was at a sleepover, was moved away by relatives, cutting off contact with Stephanie, who mourned the loss of both the family and her friend. Years later, Stephanie diligently maintained the Pelley family's gravesite, hoping to reconnect with Jessica, while Jessica lived a difficult life in foster care, unaware that Stephanie was searching for her. The two finally reunited in 2009 through Facebook, rekindling their friendship and discovering a shared connection to the past, symbolizing resilience in the face of tragedy.</p>

          <p>The Israel-Iran war entered its second week with additional strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility, as Iran warned against U.S. involvement in the conflict. Israel claimed to have killed three senior Iranian commanders, including one who allegedly financed and armed Hamas, while Iran launched a new wave of drones and missiles at Israel. The U.S. State Department confirmed that several U.S. citizens were lightly wounded in an Iranian missile strike, and the U.S. began assisting with the evacuation of Americans and green card holders from Tel Aviv. The escalating conflict raises concerns about broader regional instability and potential international involvement.</p>

It was not immediately clear what types of weaponry the U.S. used in the strikes on Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. According to an Israeli official, the U.S. notified Israel ahead of the strike, while sources said House Speaker Mike Johnson was also briefed ahead of time. Trump posted on Truth Social that a full payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site, Fordow, and that all planes were safely on their way home.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities, potentially stripping them of tens of millions of dollars in research funding. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, agreeing with the universities' argument that it threatened critical work in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Similar caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health have also been blocked by judges, highlighting concerns over the administration's approach to research funding.</p>

          <p>Israel's strikes against Iran have damaged nuclear facilities, but the complete destruction of Iran's ability to produce weapons-grade uranium may require U.S. assistance, particularly to target the Fordo facility. The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a 30,000-pound "bunker-buster" bomb, could be used to destroy deeply buried targets, but can only be deployed by the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. The B-2's stealth capabilities allow it to evade air defenses and reach heavily defended targets, making it a crucial asset in a potential U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear program. The use of these weapons is controversial, but deemed necessary by some to address the threat of Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

Weeks ago, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified that the intelligence community continues to assess "Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003." On Friday, Trump said both Gabbard and his intelligence community are flat out "wrong." Trump is "in a position now where he's contemplating an attack against Iran, and he has to have the conclusion that they do in fact have a nuclear â€“ or the capacity to develop a nuclear weapon very quickly and the intent to do so â€“ so that I think is prompting him to reject the intelligence community's conclusions," Reed said.</p>

          <p>Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a new law, making it the largest state to attempt such a mandate. The bill, signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, is expected to face legal challenges from critics who view it as an unconstitutional violation of the separation of church and state. Supporters argue that the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents, including faith leaders, contend it infringes on religious freedom. The law reflects ongoing efforts in conservative-led states to integrate religion into public schools.</p>

          <p>Social media is flooded with advice on lowering cortisol levels, a stress hormone, but experts warn that quick fixes often fail to address the root causes of stress. While cortisol plays a vital role in the body, too much can cause health problems, leading many to seek solutions online. Experts emphasize that simplistic solutions, such as cortisol cocktails and supplements, are unlikely to be effective and can prevent individuals from seeking proper medical treatment. Instead, addressing the underlying causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes is recommended for long-term well-being.</p>
