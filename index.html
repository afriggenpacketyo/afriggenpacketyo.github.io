          <p>A significant far-right demonstration, organized by activist Tommy Robinson, drew over 100,000 participants to central London, advocating for free speech and British heritage. The event, which included speeches from figures like Elon Musk via videolink, saw some violence against police officers, leading to nine arrests. Simultaneously, about 5,000 anti-racism campaigners held a counter-protest nearby, separated by a large police deployment. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the attacks on officers, emphasizing that criminal activity would be met with the full force of the law.</p>

          <p>Israel has escalated its airstrikes across Gaza City, resulting in at least 32 deaths, including 12 children, as reported by Shifa Hospital. The military claims it is targeting Hamas strongholds and surveillance equipment in high-rise buildings, urging residents to evacuate south to a humanitarian zone. However, hundreds of thousands remain, facing famine and displacement challenges. Relatives of Israeli hostages are rallying, criticizing Prime Minister Netanyahu's approach after a failed assassination attempt on Hamas leaders, fearing it jeopardizes negotiations for their loved ones' release.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, his widow Erika Kirk expressed defiance and pledged to continue his mission, while former President Trump praised the FBI's swift arrest of suspect Tyler Robinson. The incident triggered varied responses, including Nasdaq and a hospital firing employees over social media posts celebrating Kirk's death, an Office Depot employee refusing to print Kirk posters, and a debate between Bill Maher and Ben Shapiro over the alleged killer's political leanings. A London rally also honored Kirk, highlighting the widespread impact and political polarization surrounding his death.</p>

          <p>An explosion at the "Mis Tesoros" bar in Madrid's Puente de Vallecas district injured at least 25 people, with two in serious and three in potentially serious condition. While local media pointed to a gas leak, deputy mayor Inmaculada Sanz stated it was too early to confirm the cause, though additional victims under rubble were ruled out. The building where the bar is located is currently unstable, necessitating the temporary rehousing of residents from nine housing units. Authorities are continuing their investigation into the incident and ensuring the safety of the surrounding area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand has lifted a decades-long ban, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term Myanmar refugees residing in border camps. This policy shift comes after significant cuts in humanitarian aid, particularly from the US under President Trump, which had forced charities to cancel food rations. The UN Refugee Agency welcomed the move as a potential regional benchmark for rights-based solutions, allowing refugees to become self-sufficient and stimulate the local economy. The decision also helps address a sharp decline in Thailand's migrant labor force, with refugees expected to fill "3D jobs" in agriculture and services.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, including Sasha from Mariupol, have been forcibly relocated to Russia since the 2022 invasion, with many placed in orphanages or adoptive families. Russia denies these abductions, claiming to have "rescued" the children, despite mounting international pressure and an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for President Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova. Efforts by NGOs like Save Ukraine are slowly repatriating children, but the process is complex due to Russian citizenship grants and bureaucratic hurdles. The exact number of affected children remains contested, with various organizations providing differing figures.</p>

          <p>Nepal's eight major political parties have united to demand the reinstatement of the parliament, which President Ram Chandra Poudel dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests. They argue Poudel acted unconstitutionally by dissolving the House of Representatives at the recommendation of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki. The dissolution was a key demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement, which saw over 50 deaths in clashes. While Karki's appointment is supported by student leaders, her government faces challenges in restoring order and addressing protester demands through democratic institutions. The president urged restraint and cooperation for upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez and other officials are demanding an investigation into the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by ICE agents during a traffic stop in a Chicago suburb. The killing, which occurred near a school, is viewed by critics as a consequence of the Trump administration's "anti-immigrant agenda" and "inevitable violence." DHS claims Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged an officer, but surveillance video shows a struggle. This incident is part of ICE's "Operation Midway Blitz" and follows previous legal challenges against the agency's warrantless arrests and traffic stops in Illinois.</p>

          <p>California's State Assembly has passed SB 53, a bill requiring transparency reports from developers of powerful "frontier" AI models to address "catastrophic risks" like AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks. The bill, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature, defines catastrophic risk as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages. It mandates safety frameworks, incident reporting, and whistleblower protections, aiming for public accountability with potential $1 million fines. While some industry groups oppose it as burdensome, proponents see it as a crucial step to regulate rapidly advancing AI before widespread disasters occur, potentially influencing federal legislation.</p>

Legal experts, however, suggest such an arrest would be practically impossible and could lead to conflict with the federal government, which does not recognize the ICC's authority. Mamdani's stance reflects a shift in New Yorker sentiment towards Palestinians, but is expected to provoke strong reactions in the city's large Jewish community.</p>

Fulton County tax records show she never claimed a homestead exemption on the condo.

          <p>Georgia prosecutors' high-profile "Cop City" RICO conspiracy case has collapsed, with a judge dismissing charges against 61 defendants opposing the police training center. The judge ruled that the attorney general lacked authority to bring the RICO case without the governor's permission, highlighting "prosecutorial sloppiness." This decision, which dismisses most of the indictment, is seen by defense attorneys as proving the case was "fundamentally flawed." Critics argue the state overreached by criminalizing a protest movement, drawing comparisons to the J20 protesters, and raising concerns about the use of law as a political tool.</p>
