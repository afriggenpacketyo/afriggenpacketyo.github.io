          <p>Jane Dorotik's 2001 conviction for murdering her husband, Bob, has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison maintaining her innocence. New testing of evidence, prompted by the Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed inconsistencies and previously untested blood spots in the couple's bedroom. Dorotik always asserted her innocence, claiming authorities focused on her from the start. Despite the overturned conviction, the case raises questions about the initial investigation and the pursuit of justice for Bob Dorotik, as Jane has filed a civil suit against the County of San Diego.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation to announce that the U.S. military had launched strikes against three Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, describing the operation as a "spectacular military success." Trump warned that "far greater" attacks would follow if Iran does not "make peace," stating the objective was to end the nuclear threat. He thanked U.S. service members and the Israeli military for their cooperation, and indicated that further updates would be provided the following morning. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes, but stated that the attacks would not halt Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The United States, under President Trump's orders, conducted airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities: Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, marking a significant escalation in the conflict between Iran and Israel. The U.S. reportedly used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs), also known as "bunker busters," to target the deeply buried Fordo facility. While the extent of the damage is unclear, Iranian officials claim the sites were evacuated beforehand, minimizing the impact. The strikes have heightened tensions in the region, with Iran threatening retaliation against U.S. bases and potentially disrupting critical shipping routes. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the US military attacked three sites in Iran, joining directly to the Israeli effort to behead the country's nuclear program in a risky tactic to weaken an old enemy amid the threat of reprisals from Tehran that could unleash a wider regional conflict. The decision to involve the United States directly in the war comes after more than a week of Israeli attacks against Iran, whose objective was to systematically eradicate the air defenses and the capacity of offensive missiles of the country, in addition to damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities. The Iranian government did not immediately recognize the realization of any attacks.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that the U.S. military attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, directly engaging in Israel's effort to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. The decision to involve the U.S. military comes after weeks of Israeli strikes targeting Iran's air defenses and nuclear facilities. Trump stated that B-2 stealth bombers were used, and that a "full payload of bombs" was dropped on the Fordo nuclear plant. The attacks are a dangerous move as Iran has promised retaliation if the U.S. joins the Israeli attack, and it is also a risk for Trump, who came to the White House promising to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts.</p>

          <p>On Thursday Donald Trump gave the Iranians a deadline if they wanted to avoid a US strike on their nuclear facilities, but that deadline turned out to be much shorter than expected. Two days later, the US president announced on Saturday evening that US warplanes had bombed three nuclear sites, in an attack he said was "very successful". Trump appears to be hoping the US strikes force Iran to make greater concessions at the negotiating table, but it seems unlikely that a nation unwilling to talk while under Israeli attack will be more inclined when American bombs are also falling. Saturday's attack was an aggressive move for a president who boasted of starting no new wars during his first presidential term and who regularly railed against predecessors who had drawn the country into foreign conflicts on the campaign trail last year.</p>
