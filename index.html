          <p>Chinese authorities are employing stringent, pandemic-style measures to combat a chikungunya outbreak, a mosquito-borne disease, in the southern province of Guangdong. This response has included intrusive actions such as task forces forcibly entering homes to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds and demanding blood samples from residents, including children with fevers. These tactics have sparked public concern and complaints, drawing parallels to the heavy-handed methods used during the country's zero-COVID policy. The measures reflect a continued reliance on top-down control for public health crises, even for less severe diseases.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing former congressman Beto O'Rourke and his nonprofit, Powered by People, from funding the personal expenses of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state. The Democrats left Texas to break a legislative quorum and block a Republican-led vote on a contentious redistricting plan. The ruling, issued by a Republican-appointed judge, sides with Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argued the funding for travel, lodging, and fines constituted an unlawful use of political contributions. O'Rourke has condemned the move as a political attack on voting rights.</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was killed following a shooting incident near the CDC headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta. The suspect opened fire, striking the officer who later died at a hospital, and also shot at the CDC building, breaking windows. The suspect was later found dead from what authorities believe may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound. No civilians were injured in the event, which prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order for the university campus and a remote workday for CDC employees.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is demanding a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and has suspended hundreds of millions in federal research grants. The action follows a Department of Justice investigation that concluded UCLA was "deliberately indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students" during pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. University and state officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have decried the move as extortion and an attack on academic freedom. The administration has previously used similar tactics against private universities to resolve civil rights investigations.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska next week to hold talks regarding the war in Ukraine. The announcement followed Trump's suggestion that a peace agreement might require Ukraine to cede some territory, potentially involving a swap where Russia would keep the Donbas region and Crimea. This high-stakes diplomatic effort aims to broker a peace deal, though it is unclear if Ukraine or European allies would accept such terms. The meeting marks the first in-person discussion between the two leaders since Russia's full-scale invasion.</p>

He was also a crew member of Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the moon. Lovell's legacy is defined by his courage under pressure and his pivotal role in one of space exploration's most dramatic survival stories.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted two raids at a Home Depot in Los Angeles, detaining several day laborers and prompting accusations of violating a recent court order. Activists and lawyers argue the operations flout a temporary restraining order that prohibits agents from targeting individuals based on race, location, or vocation without reasonable suspicion. The raids, part of a series of similar actions in the area, have intensified the conflict between the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics and legal challenges from civil rights advocates. The L.A. City Attorney's office is investigating whether the actions constitute contempt of court.</p>

While retailers maintain their models are healthy, the ASA has ruled that specific styling, poses, and lighting can create an irresponsibly thin appearance.

          <p>A new, deeply critical biography of Prince Andrew, titled "Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York," presents an unflattering portrait of the royal, detailing his arrogance and links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The book, by author Andrew Lownie, compiles numerous anecdotes about his behavior, questionable financial dealings, and lack of self-awareness, effectively sealing his fate for any potential return to public life. While depicting his authentic courage during the Falklands War, the biography primarily focuses on a character arc defined by privilege, poor judgment, and scandal.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check Debunks Claim of Trump's Plane Flying to Epstein's Island 37 Times</h2>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times is unsubstantiated. A fact-checking investigation found no evidence to support the claim and noted several inconsistencies. Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip capable of landing a plane like Trump's, with visitors typically arriving by boat or helicopter. Furthermore, the Facebook user who originated the claim used a photo with a pin from a commercially available pilot costume, casting doubt on his credentials.</p>

          <p>Rapper Busta Rhymes has denied allegations in a lawsuit filed by a former assistant, Dashiel Gables, calling the claims a "shake-down." Gables' lawsuit accuses the rapper of wage violations, assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, alleging he was underpaid and overworked. The complaint also claims Rhymes repeatedly punched Gables in the face, leading to his constructive termination. Rhymes, whose real name is Trevor Smith Jr., stated that Gables worked for him briefly and is now manufacturing claims after being let go, announcing plans for a countersuit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has stated that he "can't involve" striker Alexander Isak with the first-team group at present. The decision comes after the club rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool and the player subsequently trained alone at his former club. While Howe has not permanently closed the door on Isak's return, he emphasized the situation is not currently right for his reintegration. The standoff leaves Newcastle with limited attacking options just before the season opener, compounding a frustrating transfer window for the Champions League-bound club.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has started issuing licenses allowing Nvidia to export its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, according to a U.S. official. This move reverses a previous ban and removes a major obstacle for the chipmaker's access to the critical Chinese market, which had been affected by broad U.S. export controls aimed at curbing Beijing's technological and military development. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with U.S. regulations after stricter curbs were imposed. The company has warned the restrictions could significantly impact its sales revenue.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would permit 401(k) plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. Proponents argue this could democratize retirement savings and offer potentially higher returns, while experts caution about the increased risks, higher fees, and lack of transparency associated with these assets. The implementation timeline is uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether employers will adopt these new, more complex options for their workers' retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley," offers an intimate look at the life of the influential musician, who died in 1997 at age 30. The film, directed by Amy Berg, moves beyond the narrative of a doomed artist to present a more nuanced portrait through archival material and interviews with his mother, friends, and bandmates. It explores his turbulent upbringing, his creative blossoming in New York City, and his conflicting feelings about the fame that followed his iconic album "Grace."

          <p>A BBC documentary explores the negative psychological impacts that hook-up apps like Grindr can have on young gay men. Users describe an addictive cycle of seeking validation through casual sexual encounters, which often leads to feelings of objectification, emptiness, and damaged self-esteem. The article highlights how the ease of access to sex has normalized a culture that can be toxic and challenging for those seeking more meaningful connections. For some, the constant pursuit of a "dopamine hit" from messages and encounters exacerbates anxiety and depression, making them feel isolated within their own community.</p>
