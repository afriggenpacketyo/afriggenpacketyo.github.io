          <h2>NYC Mayor Adams Oversees Destruction of Seized Illegal Firearms</h2>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch oversaw the destruction of over 3,500 seized illegal firearms, including handguns and rifles, through a gun chipper. These firearms represent a portion of the over 21,400 firearms seized since Adams took office, with over 1,400 identified as ghost guns, which are unserialized and untraceable firearms often acquired through 3-D printers. The recycled material will be used by Coop Tech students to create a memorial for victims of gun violence, and this initiative is part of Adams' broader "Blueprint to End Gun Violence" which aims to address the crisis of guns on New York City streets.</p>

          <p>The president of the US-China Business Council, Sean Stein, cautioned that the U.S. may overestimate its leverage in tariff negotiations with China, as Beijing has been preparing for this scenario since mid-2018. Stein noted that China may not feel the same urgency for a deal and is wary of appearing bullied on the world stage. He also highlighted a misjudgment by Washington in expecting Beijing to initiate contact after the first round of tariffs, which Beijing views as part of a broader US strategy to contain China's growth, making a quick resolution unlikely.</p>

To bolster domestic consumption and drive economic growth, Beijing aims to increase the income of lower and middle-income groups and vigorously develop service consumption, while promptly removing restrictive measures in the consumption sector.</p>

Examples include a Salvadoran man mistakenly sent to a brutal prison in El Salvador based on flimsy evidence, a Turkish PhD student detained for criticizing Israel, and a U.S. citizen wrongfully arrested for illegally entering the country. These cases underscore concerns about due process and the potential for abuse within the immigration system, raising questions about the fairness and legality of the administration's approach.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Caral, Peru, have unearthed the 5,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman from the Caral civilization, indicating that women held valued positions in the ancient society.

Preliminary findings suggest she was between 20-35 years old and about 5 feet tall, and the funeral trousseau included a toucan beak, a stone bowl, and a straw basket, which suggest the Caral civilization valued women highly.</p>

He emphasizes that the recognition from the Oscars did not shield him from the realities of his life and community, where his struggles continue despite the international attention.</p>

          <p>The Post Office has paid over £600 million to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system, despite deciding to replace it over a decade ago, due to the terms of the original 1999 deal with Fujitsu. The Post Office did not own the computer code for the core part of the Horizon system, and buying the rights or building a new system was deemed too expensive. The system contributed to one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice, as the Post Office prosecuted about 700 sub-postmasters for theft, fraud, and false accounting based on Horizon data.</p>
