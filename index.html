          <p>After weeks of anticipation, Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, has taken its first flight from the nest. The flight occurred around 8:27 a.m. local time, with Gizmo initially flapping its wings on a branch before soaring into the air. Gizmo, who is nearly 13 weeks old, had been practicing for this moment, along with its sister Sunny, who took her first flight earlier in the week. While the eaglets will eventually venture off on their own, they are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months, frequently returning to the nest during this transitional period. The event marks a significant milestone in the lives of these young bald eagles.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Washington state have deployed the National Guard to aid in the search for Travis Caleb Decker, who is accused of murdering his three young daughters. The girls were found dead at a campground, with authorities believing they died from asphyxiation. Decker, a survivalist and former military member, is considered dangerous, and the public is urged to avoid approaching him and call 911 immediately if sighted. The Chelan County Sheriff's Office is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his arrest, as the community mourns the loss of the young victims and law enforcement intensifies their efforts to bring Decker to justice.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team, under new head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, completed a clean sweep over a depleted West Indies side in both T20 and one-day international series. While the series win provides a positive start, it's important to note that England has historically dominated home bilateral series, often faltering on the bigger stage. Tougher tests lie ahead, with India's arrival and the upcoming 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka presenting significant challenges.

          <p>Cardiologists are warning that excessive scrolling on phones, often perceived as a relaxing habit, can actually harm heart health. Doomscrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior. It may also lead to neglecting heart-healthy habits like exercise, proper sleep, and stress regulation. To mitigate these risks, experts recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, and replacing the habit with healthier alternatives.</p>

While these symbolic gestures have been met with mixed interpretations, they highlight a willingness to take historical responsibility and address past wrongs.
