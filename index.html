          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has announced a new action plan to manage its strategic non-ferrous metals sector. The plan aims to curb rampant competition by reducing the projected output growth from 4.3% to 1.5% this year. Instead of focusing on volume, the government will prioritize optimizing the industrial structure and increasing value-added output. The initiative also calls for advancements in exploring key resources like copper and lithium, developing advanced materials, and enhancing recycling efforts for items such as batteries and solar panels.

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding legislation for federal agencies before the fiscal year begins on October 1. This constitutional requirement forces all non-essential government functions to cease until a funding agreement is reached. Essential employees, such as active-duty military and air traffic controllers, must continue working without immediate pay, while non-essential workers are furloughed. Programs like Social Security continue, but services may be delayed, and past shutdowns have cost taxpayers billions in lost productivity and back pay.</p>

          <p>West Ham's new manager, Nuno Espirito Santo, emphasized that his "main priority" is to unite the club's players and fans following a 1-1 draw against Everton. The match, his first in charge, featured continued fan protests against the club's board. After Jarrod Bowen secured a point with a second-half equalizer, Nuno led his players to acknowledge the traveling supporters in a gesture of togetherness. He stated that his initial approach involves making simple, incremental improvements rather than drastic tactical changes to help the team compete better.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 National Guard members to Portland. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that the president lacks the authority to federalize the Guard for this purpose, calling the move a political flex rather than a public safety necessity. The deployment was authorized for 60 days to protect federal property amid protests. Governor Tina Kotek and other local officials have asserted that local law enforcement is capable of managing the situation without federal military intervention.</p>

In contrast, the U.S. approach under Captain Keegan Bradley was criticized as being more individualistic and emotionally driven.

          <p>The superintendent of Des Moines public schools, Ian Roberts, has had his education license revoked by state officials after he was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Roberts, a native of Guyana, was detained for having a final order of removal and no work authorization. The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners stated that Roberts no longer possesses legal presence in the U.S. and is therefore ineligible to hold a license. The school board has placed him on administrative leave while it determines its next steps.</p>

          <p>Toni Atkins, a prominent San Diego Democrat and former leader of the California state Senate, has dropped out of the 2026 race for governor. In a letter to supporters, Atkins stated that despite strong support, there was "no viable path forward to victory." A trailblazer in California politics, she was the first openly LGBTQ+ person to lead the state Senate and also served as Assembly speaker. Her exit reshuffles the Democratic field, which could help consolidate support among the remaining candidates in the state's top-two primary system.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 53, a landmark piece of legislation creating new transparency and safety requirements for large artificial intelligence companies. The new law mandates that AI developers publicly disclose their safety protocols and report critical incidents, such as cyberattacks or unsafe system behaviors, to the state. Authored by Senator Scott Wiener, the bill aims to establish "commonsense guardrails" for the rapidly advancing technology. The law, which strengthens whistleblower protections, was opposed by some tech industry groups who argued it focuses on hypothetical rather than actual harms.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has renewed his threat to impose a 100% tariff on all movies not made in the United States, arguing that the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries. In a social media post, he claimed the levy would solve the long-standing problem of production moving overseas, which has particularly hurt California. It remains unclear how such a tariff on a service-based industry would be implemented or when it might take effect. The proposal has raised concerns within the industry, particularly in Canada, about increased costs and potential damage to cross-border production partnerships.</p>

          <p>A year after devastating floods from Hurricane Helene ravaged eastern Tennessee, whitewater raft guides are leading a major cleanup effort on the Nolichucky River. The 2024 storm caused massive debris flows that made the popular rafting river unsafe, forcing most outfitters to close for the season. Through state-funded grants, many out-of-work guides have been hired for cleanup missions, removing debris like car parts and sheet metal from the riverbanks. Officials are optimistic that the restoration work will allow the river, informally dubbed the "New-lichucky," to reopen for the 2026 season.</p>

          <p>The article examines the decades-long trend of film and television production moving out of Hollywood to other states and countries in pursuit of tax incentives and lower labor costs. This "runaway production" has led to hubs in places like Georgia, Canada, and the U.K., which offer significant financial benefits that California has struggled to match. President Trump's proposal of a 100% tariff on foreign-made films aims to address this, but experts question its feasibility and warn of potential chaos. The industry faces complex challenges as it navigates tighter budgets and a changing media landscape.</p>
