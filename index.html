            <h2>Consumer Sentiment Declines Sharply Amid Rising Inflation Fears</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 11:54:22 EDT</div>

            <p>The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey revealed a significant drop in April, falling to 50.8, the second-lowest reading in the survey's history. This decline is attributed to a surge in inflation expectations, with respondents anticipating a 6.7% inflation rate in one year and 4.4% over the next five years, the highest levels since the early 1980s and early 1990s, respectively. The survey indicated a broad deterioration across various economic measures, including current conditions, expectations, and rising unemployment fears, suggesting an increased risk of recession. These findings contradict market-based expectations of low inflation, raising concerns among Federal Reserve officials about the potential for consumer expectations to become self-fulfilling. </p>

The event featured a mix of far-right figures and mainstream researchers, exploring various ideas to boost birth rates, some of which were deliberately provocative.

            <p>Jim Cramer is questioning his long-held positive stance on Apple (AAPL) due to escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products and the fact that China is Apple's second-largest market and primary iPhone manufacturing location pose significant challenges. Without an agreement between the U.S. and China or an exemption from the Trump administration, Apple may face increased costs or need to raise prices, potentially softening demand. Apple's stock performance has lagged the S&P 500 amid trade concerns, making it difficult to defend the stock in the current environment. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's boasts that foreign leaders are complying with his tariff demands, China's leader Xi Jinping is retaliating against the U.S., escalating the trade war. Xi, who has consolidated power by promoting Chinese nationalism, cannot be seen as kowtowing to foreign pressure. China views Trump's tariffs as an attempt to suppress its economic success and is prepared to resist. While the trade war poses risks to China's economy, the country also has leverage, including reliance on Chinese imports by American companies and consumers and the ability to restrict exports of rare-earth metals.</p>

Generic drug manufacturers, which rely on ingredients made in China and India, could be particularly affected. While Trump hopes the tariffs will encourage domestic production, experts say it would take years and billions of dollars for drugmakers to shift operations to the U.S. and may not be economical.

The challenges include finding and paying a U.S. workforce, importing parts, and building the necessary infrastructure.

            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes the U.S. economy is nearing or already in a recession, citing weakened growth and rising uncertainty. He attributes this to President Trump's widespread tariffs, which have sparked a sell-off in the stock market. Fink expects a broad economic slowdown until there is more certainty, even with the 90-day pause on some tariffs. He also noted that other CEOs share his concerns about the U.S. economy being in a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A leading U.S. economist, Adam Posen, has likened President Trump's trade war with China to the Vietnam War, suggesting that both sides will be caught in a quagmire with no easy exit. Posen argues that Trump's tactics are misguided and that the administration misunderstands the mechanics of international trade. He criticizes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's view that the U.S. holds all the cards, arguing that trade is a positive-sum game and that the U.S. is more vulnerable due to its reliance on Chinese imports.</p>

            <p>China has raised tariffs on imports from the U.S. to 125% in response to President Trump's tariffs, impacting a range of American products. The top imports from the U.S. to China include oilseeds and grains, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and aerospace products. The tariffs could significantly impact U.S. producers, particularly in the agricultural sector, as China is a major export market for American goods. Texas is the largest exporter of goods to China among U.S. states, followed by California and Louisiana.</p>

            <p>Senate Democrats are calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate President Trump and others for potential securities law violations related to his announcement of a pause in reciprocal tariffs. The Democrats are concerned that Trump's statement that it was a 'GREAT TIME TO BUY' into the stock market, made shortly before the tariff pause announcement, may have constituted insider trading or market manipulation. The SEC has declined to comment on the request, while the White House dismissed the concerns as partisan games.</p>

The results of the exam, led by presidential physician Sean Barbabella, will be closely watched given past accusations of a lack of transparency about Trump's health. While Trump is a golfer who abstains from alcohol and cigarettes, he is also known for indulging in fast food.</p>

            <p>As the Trump administration's tariffs take effect, some U.S. companies are implementing 'tariff surcharges' to pass along the increased costs to consumers. These surcharges are being added to online shopping carts and announced in letters to customers, with companies like Labucq and Dame citing the need to remain sustainable. Other companies are using the situation as a promotional opportunity, offering 'pre-tariff sales' to encourage consumers to purchase goods before prices potentially rise. Consumers, already battling inflation, are likely to be sensitive to these price increases.</p>
