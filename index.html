          <p>Authorities in Kent have arrested three teenagers—a 16-year-old girl and two boys aged 14 and 15—on suspicion of murder. The arrests followed the death of a man in his 40s who was found with serious injuries in Leysdown-on-Sea on the Isle of Sheppey after reports of an altercation. Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were called to the scene near a caravan park, but the man was pronounced dead. A large police cordon has been established as specialist officers and a police dog conduct a search for evidence. Kent Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward with any information regarding the incident.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New York has forcefully rejected the Trump administration's motion to unseal grand jury testimony from the Ghislaine Maxwell case. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer criticized the Department of Justice's reasoning as "demonstrably false," stating the materials would not reveal any significant new information about the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell. The judge suggested the request might be a political "diversion" rather than a genuine effort for transparency, noting the public would feel "disappointed and misled" by the lack of new substance. This ruling is the second such denial the administration has faced in its efforts to release Epstein-related grand jury files.</p>

          <p>Illinois Democrats, including Rep. Jesus Garcia and Sen. Richard Durbin, have formally requested that the federal government cease challenging the state's immigration policies. In a letter to the Department of Justice and Homeland Security, they defended Illinois's TRUST Act and Chicago's Welcoming City Ordinance, which limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration agents. The lawmakers argue these policies are constitutional, enhance public safety by fostering community trust, and allow federal authorities to conduct their own enforcement without commandeering local resources. They assert that the state is upholding the law, not obstructing it, and asked the federal government to stop trying to "usurp" their authority.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared a public safety emergency in Washington, D.C., placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to address what he termed "crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor." In a news conference, Trump appointed Attorney General Pam Bondi to command the police force, part of a broader initiative to also clean up the city and relocate homeless encampments. The move follows Trump's criticism of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's handling of crime, despite official statistics showing a year-to-date decrease in overall and violent crime. Bowser has defended her administration's efforts, stating that violent crime has been driven down to a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>In an interview for her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that individuals who commit heinous male crimes against women, such as the case of Isla Bryson, "probably" forfeit the right to choose their gender. This marks a significant shift from her previous position during the heated debate over Scotland's gender recognition laws, which she now admits she should have paused. Sturgeon acknowledged that the debate had lost all rationality, taking partial responsibility for the situation. Her revised stance has drawn criticism from political opponents and former allies, who argue the change of heart comes too late after the damage caused by the original policy push.</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a landmark $2 billion investment to completely transform its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant into a dedicated facility for producing a new generation of affordable electric vehicles. This strategic pivot is central to the company's "Universal EV Program," designed to directly challenge the growing dominance of Chinese EV manufacturers and other new competitors in the market. The first vehicle from this initiative will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck scheduled for a 2027 launch, with an ambitious starting price of approximately $30,000. The investment secures around 2,200 jobs and marks a critical step in Ford's effort to make electric vehicles more accessible to the average American consumer.</p>

          <p>The online retail landscape is on the verge of a seismic shift as generative AI platforms like ChatGPT move towards integrating direct checkout functionalities. This would allow consumers to complete purchases within the AI chat interface, bypassing the need to click through to a merchant's website. Experts believe this will significantly shorten the sales cycle but also poses a disruptive threat to the existing e-commerce value chain, particularly for payment processors and large online marketplaces like Amazon that monetize user browsing time through ads. The new competitive frontier will be about controlling the pre-sale discovery and recommendation phase, where AI assistants are set to become the dominant force.</p>

          <p>The federal program that compensates private attorneys for representing indigent defendants has run out of money, creating a financial crisis that threatens to disrupt the justice system. Due to a congressional funding shortfall, these lawyers, known as CJA panel attorneys, are not being paid for their constitutionally mandated work and will not be until at least October. This is causing some attorneys to turn down cases and could lead to a shortage of qualified counsel, potentially causing case backlogs and violating defendants' rights to a speedy trial. The judiciary requires an estimated $116 million to cover the gap, but the situation highlights the severe consequences of inadequate funding for essential defender services.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deal requiring Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of their China-related AI chip revenue with the U.S. government is being viewed by investors as a net positive. Analysts suggest that securing 85% of revenue from the massive Chinese market is far better than being completely shut out, which would cede ground to Chinese competitors like Huawei. While the arrangement is described as unusual, it is seen as a pragmatic, deal-making approach typical of the current administration. The move provides short-term certainty for the chipmakers, though questions remain about whether this sets a precedent or if the government might seek a larger share in the future, creating long-term uncertainty.</p>

The agreement allows the companies to resume sales to the lucrative Chinese market while providing the U.S. government a direct financial return.

One provider, Aid Access, shipped nearly 120,000 packs of abortion pills between July 2023 and August 2024, with the vast majority going to residents in states with abortion bans. The research, which examined provision at the county level, found that requests were highest in states with abortion bans and in poorer counties.

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a significant rally following a report that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule. Currently a Schedule I substance alongside heroin, a move to Schedule III would be a game-changer for the industry, enabling companies to operate under more favorable tax regulations and attracting institutional investment. The potential policy shift, reportedly discussed by Trump at a recent fundraiser, has generated optimism in a sector where many stocks have been trading at very low prices. Analysts note that such a change appears to have bipartisan support, signaling a major potential shift in federal cannabis policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's performance in the Community Shield highlighted a team in transition, with new offensive signings showing great promise while the defense appeared worryingly open. Newcomers Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz integrated well into the attack, contributing to a dynamic offensive display. However, the team's shift to a new 4-2-3-1 formation, combined with the absence of key defensive midfielders, left the back line exposed, a problem that has persisted throughout the pre-season. While the new system offers exciting attacking possibilities, the team's defensive vulnerabilities indicate that there will likely be a period of adjustment and potential teething troubles as the season begins.</p>

          <p>Amid a flood of complex advice on managing children's technology use, many psychologists and pediatricians are converging on one simple, powerful rule: no screens in the bedroom, ever. This guideline is praised for its effectiveness in protecting sleep, which is crucial for adolescent mental health and cognitive function. Beyond improving sleep, keeping devices in common areas helps children develop a healthier relationship with technology by fostering better decision-making and reminding them that online activities can become public. Enforcing this rule can also encourage more family interaction and prevent the isolating habit of children retreating to their rooms with their devices, making it a foundational step for digital wellness.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to proscribe the group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, stating some of its supporters may not know its "full nature." Her comments came after over 500 people were arrested for showing support for the group during a protest outside Parliament. Cooper stressed that Palestine Action is "not a non-violent organisation," citing security advice and involvement in violent attacks and criminal damage. The ban, which is being legally challenged by the group, has been criticized by human rights organizations like Amnesty International as a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>A Labour councillor from Dartford, Ricky Jones, is on trial for allegedly encouraging violent disorder during a counter-protest in Walthamstow. Prosecutors claim Jones was "rabble rousing" a large crowd when he called far-right protesters "disgusting Nazi fascists" and said their throats needed to be slit, gesturing with his hand. The court was shown video of the speech, which was made at an event organized in response to a planned protest by activist Tommy Robinson. The prosecution argues that Jones made these remarks in a "tinderbox" atmosphere where violence was a real possibility, despite having been advised by the Labour Party not to attend such protests.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Gaza has killed five Al Jazeera journalists, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif, who had recently expressed fears for his life. Israel claimed responsibility for the strike, alleging al-Sharif was a Hamas leader, a claim Al Jazeera and the journalist had previously denied. The incident has been condemned by the Foreign Press Association and the Committee to Protect Journalists, who note that at least 178 Palestinian media workers have been killed during the conflict. Al Jazeera described the attack as a "targeted assassination" and part of a pattern of targeting journalists who are providing essential on-the-ground coverage from within the besieged territory.</p>

          <p>Parts of the Midwest are grappling with severe flash flooding after a storm system brought heavy rain, high winds, and hail to at least six states over the weekend. The extreme weather has resulted in at least one death in Nebraska, knocked out power for thousands, and forced numerous road closures. The Milwaukee area was particularly hard-hit, receiving up to 14 inches of rain, which caused significant river flooding and prompted dozens of water rescues. The severity of the flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair and the USA Triathlon National Championships as emergency crews continue to respond to the ongoing situation.</p>

While water flow has been re-established, allowing for household uses like showering and flushing, a boil water notice remains in effect.

          <p>Ford is investing $2 billion to transform its Louisville plant with a revolutionary production system designed to manufacture affordable electric vehicles in America. To compete with Chinese automakers, Ford is abandoning the traditional moving assembly line for a new "universal production system" developed by a skunkworks team. This system uses a three-branched assembly tree where the vehicle's front, rear, and a structural battery unit with the interior are built separately and then combined. This innovative approach, which will be used to build a $30,000 EV pickup starting in 2027, is expected to use 20% fewer parts and be 15% faster, a high-stakes bet on preserving U.S. manufacturing jobs.</p>

He praised Tan's past success in turning around Cadence Design Systems and asserted there is no one better equipped to lead Intel's transformation. The defense comes as Tan faces scrutiny from the White House and some Republicans over his ties to Chinese companies, highlighting the intense political pressure now being exerted on corporate leadership in the tech sector.</p>
