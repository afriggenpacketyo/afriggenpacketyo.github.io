          <p>Despite the LA Galaxy's historically poor start to the 2025 MLS season, the team has extended coach Greg Vanney's contract for three more years, through 2028. The Galaxy, the reigning MLS Cup champions, have yet to secure a win this season, suffering multiple defeats. The team's management expressed confidence in Vanney's leadership, citing his role in the 2024 championship victory and his ability to navigate challenging times. The announcement comes ahead of a match against their rivals, LAFC, and the team hopes to turn their season around.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is preparing for a potential influx of mainland Chinese companies seeking to list on its stock exchange, as the US government considers delisting Chinese stocks from American exchanges. Deloitte China CEO Patrick Tsang has submitted proposals to the Chief Executive’s Policy Unit outlining strategies to bolster Hong Kong’s financial preparedness. These strategies include simplifying listing procedures and finding funding for these companies. The move aims to capitalize on the decoupling concerns and attract Chinese firms seeking alternative listing venues.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense scientists are developing a guided rocket, the Tianxing-1, designed to strike aerial targets. Unlike conventional rocket artillery, this guided munition features wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and powerless-flight maneuverability. The rocket rises to a designated altitude before transitioning into a glide phase, where it autonomously adjusts its trajectory to engage targets. While operating on principles similar to hypersonic glide missiles, it travels at a slower pace and may struggle to chase high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg's article in the New York Times discusses the Democratic Party's reckoning with Joe Biden's declining health and cognitive abilities during his presidency. The article suggests that many Democrats were aware of Biden's infirmity but chose to ignore or downplay it for political expediency. The author argues that the party's leadership needs to be honest about their missteps and address the groupthink and risk aversion that led to their support for Biden's candidacy, especially with the new book that details how bad his condition was behind the scenes. The article also suggests that a reckoning is due for the disastrous missteps that paved the way for Trump’s return.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans early Friday morning, prompting a manhunt and internal investigation. The inmates, considered armed and dangerous, exploited security lapses, including defective locks and doors, and may have received assistance from jail staff. The escape involved breaking open a cell door, removing a metal toilet and sink, and exiting through a loading dock before scaling a wall. Authorities are investigating multiple security failures and whether the escape was an inside job, while the FBI and Crimestoppers GNO are offering rewards for information leading to the arrest of the escapees.</p>

          <p>Former FBI director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service after he shared and then deleted a social media post that Republicans alleged was an incitement to violence against US President Donald Trump. Comey voluntarily participated in the questioning. The post was a photo of seashells that spelled the numbers "8647". The number 86 is a slang term whose definitions include "to reject" or "to get rid of", however, it has more recently been used as a term to mean "kill". Trump is the 47th US president.</p>

It also references the Ghorman Massacre. In the hands of Gilroy and Luna, “Andor” billed itself over two seasons as the begrudging rise of a revolutionary. The series also grounds him in the indigenous world of Kenari and that he is quite at home in the lush jungles of Yavin IV.</p>

          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency is considering introducing artificial intelligence into weather forecasting to improve accuracy by using deep learning. A new team has been established to lead infrastructure and technological development, combining AI predictions with existing numerical forecasting models. The AI system would analyze vast amounts of data to generate forecasts for temperatures and rainfall, potentially improving typhoon path prediction. Humans will still play an oversight role and issue final forecasts, even with AI predictions.</p>

          <p>Fujii Shuzo, a sake brewery in southwestern Japan with over 150 years of history, has begun offering a seminar for foreign sommeliers on traditional sake-making techniques. The five-day seminar is part of a course organized by the British-based Sake Sommelier Academy, aiming to spread awareness and appreciation about sake beyond Japan. The brewery hopes that opening up to people from overseas will eventually lead to increased exports to Europe. While domestic sake consumption has declined, exports have recently increased due to growing popularity abroad.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump faced setbacks in the courts and Congress on Friday, as his administration's request to remove a block on deportations of Venezuelans was rejected by the Supreme Court. Rightwing lawmakers also derailed Trump’s signature legislation in the House of Representatives. The bill aimed to extend tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term. These events occurred as Trump finished a visit to the Middle East, which included stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, but not Israel.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown in Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen. The life-size statue, which had replaced a wooden version set on fire in 2020, disappeared from its perch this week. Local residents suspect it may have been an act of vandalism or melted down for cash. The statue, which never quite captured the hearts of Sevnica's residents, was commissioned by an American artist as an interrogation of President Trump's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>As the Democratic Party faces record low approval ratings, many top Democrats are trying to reposition themselves from Biden boosters to truth-tellers of what really happened in 2024. Several Democrats who had previously supported Biden's campaign are now admitting that he suffered cognitive decline while in office and was not fit to run for re-election. This shift reflects a desire to rebuild trust in the Democratic brand and confront how the party handled the 2024 race. Some governors, potentially eyeing presidential runs, are dodging questions about Biden's fitness, while others suggest he should have dropped out earlier.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" package of tax breaks and spending cuts, has failed to pass, starkly exposing the party's budgetary divisions. The bill failed to advance through the House budget committee, the final hurdle before a full floor vote. Several Republicans argued the cuts did not go far enough and torpedoed the measure. Among the primary sticking points in the negotiations is just how much to slash from the budget bill, with several conservative congressmen demanding steeper cuts.</p>
