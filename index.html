          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, one of the world's most active, has erupted for the 31st time since December. The eruption, contained within the summit crater, poses no threat to homes but offers a spectacular view for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists are monitoring the volcano's activity, noting that while the lava fountains have been shorter recently, the eruption's future behavior remains uncertain. The event holds cultural significance for Native Hawaiians, who see the lava as a natural resource connected to the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

          <p>Multiple national postal services in Europe and India have suspended merchandise shipments to the United States. This action is a response to a new U.S. decree, effective August 29, that subjects previously exempt international goods valued under $800 to import duties. Postal operators cite a lack of clarity on the new rules and insufficient time to implement necessary procedural and system updates. The suspension is temporary as they seek solutions with U.S. authorities, but it significantly disrupts international commerce.</p>

          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed in Gaza by Israeli strikes and gunfire as the world's leading food crisis authority declared a famine in Gaza City. The announcement has intensified international pressure on Israel to halt its offensive, which was initiated after the Hamas attacks of October 2023. Israeli strikes targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis and aid-seekers in northern Gaza. Israel has denounced the famine report while preparing for a major operation in Gaza City, as ceasefire negotiations remain stalled.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal grant funding from 34 cities and counties designated as "sanctuary" jurisdictions. The ruling halts the administration's attempt to penalize these localities for their policies of non-cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The decision affects hundreds of millions of dollars in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants. This legal setback for the administration comes as the Department of Justice continues to challenge sanctuary policies in various states and cities across the country.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a contentious Republican-led redistricting bill, sending it to Governor Greg Abbott, who has promised to sign it swiftly. The proposal, which aims to create five new GOP-leaning congressional districts, follows a request from President Trump to secure more Republican seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. The bill's passage came after House Democrats fled the state for weeks in an attempt to block it by denying a quorum. Democrats have vowed to challenge the new map in court, arguing it dilutes minority voting power and undermines fair representation.</p>

          <p>President Trump engaged in high-stakes negotiations concerning the Russia-Ukraine conflict, meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders. The administration is considering options like sanctions or tariffs to deter Russian aggression, with a decision expected within two weeks. Domestically, Trump joined law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., as part of a federal effort to crack down on crime. The White House also announced that the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will be held at the Kennedy Center in December.</p>

While both expressed remorse for the killings, the boards concluded they still exhibit anti-social traits like deception and rule-breaking.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has found that users on the popular gaming platform Roblox are bypassing moderation to spread hate speech, including swastikas and racist slurs. In games like "Spray Paint!", players can draw hateful messages instead of typing them in filtered chats, exposing the platform's large youth user base to extremist content. Despite Roblox's statements about its 24/7 moderation and safety systems, the platform faces numerous lawsuits over inappropriate content and potential for child predators. The findings raise serious questions about the effectiveness of content moderation on platforms with millions of young users.</p>

Using structures like Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) can protect the property from lawsuits and creditors. It is also crucial to create a detailed operating agreement for shared properties and set aside liquid assets to cover maintenance costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new, sprawling tent facility for detaining immigrants at Fort Bliss military base in Texas is drawing calls for its immediate closure from Democratic lawmakers and human rights advocates. The camp, dubbed "Lone Star Lockup" by Republicans, is set to become the largest immigration detention site in the U.S. and a major deportation hub for the Trump administration. Critics raise concerns about the lack of oversight, harsh conditions in the desert climate, and inadequate access to legal services for detainees. The facility's opening is seen as a key part of the administration's hardline anti-immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>A wave of younger, social media-savvy Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents. Frustrated by what they see as a complacent and out-of-touch party establishment, these challengers argue that longtime lawmakers have failed to respond with sufficient urgency to the threats posed by the Trump administration. They are calling for new energy, a clearer vision, and a more aggressive strategy to connect with voters, especially younger generations. This push for generational change is creating intraparty friction and signals a broader identity crisis within the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old man has received his high school diploma decades after his education was cut short by the severe abuse he suffered at the Dozier School for Boys. Eddie Horne, who was sent to the notoriously brutal state-run reform school as a teenager in the 1960s, dropped out to support his family after the traumatic experience. He was able to complete his education through a compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. Horne's graduation fulfills a lifelong promise to himself and serves as an inspiration for overcoming adversity.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Zoo experienced a difficult week with the deaths of three beloved animals: Kalluk, a 24-year-old polar bear; Nicky, a 28-year-old giraffe; and Maka, a 30-year-old gorilla. Both Kalluk and Nicky, who had exceeded their typical lifespans, were euthanized due to declining health, while Maka suffered a sudden cardiac event during a medical exam. The nearly simultaneous losses of these longtime residents, who were favorites among visitors and staff, have been challenging for the zoo's care teams. The zoo has received an outpouring of support from the public and other institutions.</p>

          <p>A former elementary school teacher in Sacramento has been sentenced to 215 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting numerous students over several years. Kim Kenneth Wilson, 64, used his position as head of the school's broadcast club to groom and assault children in a private, soundproof room, often filming the acts. The abuse came to light after a police search of his home uncovered vast amounts of recorded material and other disturbing items. The school district is also facing civil lawsuits alleging it failed to protect students from the longtime teacher.</p>

          <p>Thousands of impoverished South Africans, known as "zama zamas," are forced to work in perilous conditions as illegal artisanal coal miners in abandoned mines. Facing risks like toxic gas, tunnel collapses, and police crackdowns, these miners salvage coal to support their families and supply local communities that rely on it for fuel. This article highlights the legacy of industrial mining, which has left behind environmental damage and widespread unemployment without benefiting local populations. Despite the government viewing them as criminals, the miners see their work as a desperate act of survival in a system that has failed them.</p>

          <p>In newly released transcripts of a prison interview, Ghislaine Maxwell told U.S. officials she never witnessed inappropriate conduct by either Donald Trump or Bill Clinton in connection with Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, also claimed that a rumored Epstein "client list" does not exist and called allegations against Prince Andrew "inconceivable." The interview was conducted as Maxwell seeks a presidential pardon and the Trump administration faces pressure for transparency regarding the Epstein case. Maxwell also stated she does not believe Epstein died by suicide.</p>

          <p>Americans are facing higher utility bills, with electricity costs up 5.5% over the last year, largely due to a surge in demand from data centers, AI, and electrification. After years of flat demand, the nation's power grid is struggling to keep up, and a massive backlog of new energy projects, mostly wind and solar, are waiting for transmission connections. The Trump administration has blamed renewables and enacted policies to curtail their development while ordering some uneconomic coal plants to remain open, with the costs passed on to consumers.

When the Coast Guard boarded the vessel, they found it in order, with a half-drunk coffee and unfinished breakfast, suggesting a sudden and unexpected event.

Authorities now believe the infant is deceased and that his parents, Rebecca and Jake Haro, fabricated the story of his kidnapping. The mother had initially told police she was attacked and knocked unconscious while her son was taken. Investigators say they found inconsistencies in her statements, leading to the couple's arrest after a week-long search for the child, whose body has not yet been found.</p>
