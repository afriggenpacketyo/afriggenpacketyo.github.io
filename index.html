        <h2>The Jewish holiday of Purim: A celebration for both believers and skeptics.</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-13 07:00:37 EDT</div>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>Purim, a Jewish holiday, is celebrated with joy and revelry, but also contains deeper layers of meaning. The story of Esther, found in the Bible, lacks explicit mention of God, leading to diverse interpretations.  The holiday's focus on finding meaning in the chaos of life resonates with both those who believe in God and those who do not.</p>
