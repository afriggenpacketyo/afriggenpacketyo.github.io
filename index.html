          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-over-year in May, marking the steepest decline since September 2024, as the country navigates trade uncertainties. This drop was less severe than the 3.8% decline economists had predicted, but it reverses April's 2% gain. Exports to the U.S. decreased by 11.1%, while exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, fell by 8.8%. Automobile exports globally decreased by 6.9%, with a significant 24.7% drop in motor vehicle exports to the U.S., prompting concerns about potential impacts on Japan's GDP and corporate profits, especially given ongoing trade negotiations and tariff uncertainties.

          <p>The Defense Department announced the deployment of 2,000 additional California National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area amidst the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown. These troops are being activated under Title 10 law to support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property. This deployment follows previous criticism from local and state officials who argue that local law enforcement can manage the protests and that federal troop presence only inflames the situation. California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit challenging the deployment as a "power grab," though an appeals court halted a temporary block on the deployment.</p>

          <p>A Biden-appointed U.S. judge, Julia Kobick, has issued a ruling to temporarily block the Trump administration's policy limiting U.S. passports to only male and female gender options. This policy, aligned with an executive order recognizing only two genders, eliminated the "X" designation and suspended the policy allowing individuals to identify as the opposite gender or as intersex or nonbinary. Judge Kobick stated that the policy discriminates based on sex, is arbitrary, and is rooted in prejudice toward transgender Americans, arguing that it would cause psychological distress and fear for their safety when traveling with passports that conflict with their gender identity.</p>

          <p>Paul Taylor argues that European leaders should leverage NATO for their own security purposes, given the increasing U.S. focus on countering China and the unpredictability of U.S. commitments. He suggests that while maintaining American involvement is crucial for deterring Russian aggression, Europe must develop its own defense capabilities and strategies. This includes maximizing the use of NATO's command structure and collective defense planning to prepare for potential actions without U.S. support. Taylor proposes that a European-led coalition could provide security guarantees for Ukraine, highlighting the need for Europe to be ready to take the steering wheel.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is evaluating whether to pursue a diplomatic solution with Iran or resort to military action, with U.S. officials indicating the next 24 to 48 hours are critical. Despite heightened rhetoric, U.S. negotiators believe Iran's weak position could force it back to the negotiating table to abandon uranium enrichment. Iran has signaled a willingness to resume discussions, but the administration seeks concrete commitments before de-escalating. The U.S. military is deploying additional assets to the region, maintaining a defensive posture while keeping options open for assisting Israel.</p>

          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations centre" for the digital yuan to increase the renminbi's global influence, according to People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng. This initiative is part of a broader effort to expand overseas adoption of the yuan and accelerate Shanghai's development as a global financial hub. China aims to address issues with traditional cross-border payment systems by building a multi-channel renminbi clearing network. Trials will include refinancing schemes for foreign trade enterprises and expanded green finance programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven men from California have been charged in connection with what is being described as the "largest jewellery heist in US history," involving the theft of $100 million worth of gold, gems, and luxury watches. The suspects allegedly tracked a Brinks truck leaving a jewellery show near San Francisco in 2022 and stole 24 bags of jewelry from it while it was parked at a rest stop. Authorities believe the robbers sawed off the padlock and did not use any weapons during the heist. Some of the stolen jewels were recovered during search warrants.</p>
