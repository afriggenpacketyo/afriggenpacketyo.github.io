          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to discuss the ongoing trade war initiated by President Trump's tariff hikes and China's retaliatory levies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are representing the U.S., while Vice Premier He Lifeng leads the Chinese delegation. Expectations for a significant tariff reduction are low, but hopes remain that the talks will de-escalate tensions and reassure global markets. The article notes that the impact of the tariffs is already affecting the global economy, with China reporting a 21% drop in exports to the U.S. in April.</p>

          <p>Indian officials reported that Pakistan has moved troops into forward areas, suggesting an offensive intent, after India allegedly attacked 26 locations across Pakistan. Indian Army Col. Sofiya Qureshi stated that Indian armed forces are in a high state of operational readiness and are committed to non-escalation if Pakistan reciprocates. Air Force Wing Commander Vyomika Singh refuted Pakistani claims of destroying Indian military infrastructure, dismissing them as misinformation. Tensions between the two countries have escalated since the April 22 attack on Hindu tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants.</p>

          <p>President Trump's stance on reducing U.S. support for European security has prompted concerns among European leaders about their ability to adequately supply Ukraine with necessary weapons. Ukraine's Parliament approved a deal giving the U.S. a share of future revenue over natural resources to maintain arms shipments, as military aid approved under the Biden administration is set to expire. While European nations have collectively contributed about half of the $130 billion in military support to Ukraine, they lack the industrial capacity to fully replace U.S. assistance in the short term. This article highlights the challenges Ukraine faces in securing adequate weapons supplies amid shifting geopolitical dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, particularly in cases related to immigration. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, argued that the Constitution allows for the suspension of this legal liberty during times of "rebellion or invasion." This consideration comes as judges have challenged recent detentions made by the administration in its efforts to combat illegal immigration. Legal experts and critics have questioned the veracity of Miller's interpretation of US law, emphasizing that the power to suspend habeas corpus rests with Congress, not the president.</p>
