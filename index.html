          <p>Alphabet shares experienced a significant drop after Apple's Eddy Cue suggested that AI search engines could eventually replace standard search engines like Google. Cue mentioned the possibility of integrating AI services from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic into Apple's Safari browser. His comments came during testimony in a Justice Department lawsuit against Alphabet, which focuses on Google's practice of paying platform providers to be the default search engine. Cue also noted a recent decline in Safari searches, attributing it to the rise of AI usage.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted new official city flags, including Pride flags, in response to state laws that restrict the display of unofficial flags on government properties. These state laws are viewed by civil rights groups as attempts to suppress flags supporting L.G.B.T.Q. people. Salt Lake City approved flags featuring rainbow colors, transgender Pride colors, and a Juneteenth symbol, while Boise designated the rainbow Pride flag and an organ donation flag as official.

          <p>Actor Jon Voight, inspired by Donald Trump's recent statement about imposing tariffs on foreign-made films, discussed his plan to revitalize the U.S. film industry. Voight emphasized the need to address the reduction in film production in Los Angeles and the incentives offered by other countries that lure productions away from Hollywood. He believes incentivizing a shift back to Hollywood would create more jobs for film business workers. The White House has since walked back on Trump's announcement, saying that ‚Äúno final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made‚Äù.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold interest rates steady, citing increased uncertainty due to President Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on inflation and economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the rising risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation, making it difficult to determine the appropriate policy response. The Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach, Powell added.</p>

          <p>A new study has found an association between the consumption of ultraprocessed foods and the development of early symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The study, published in the journal Neurology, reported that people who consumed a lot of ultraprocessed foods were more likely to develop early signs of the disease than people who consumed less of them. The researchers analyzed diet questionnaire data from nearly 43,000 health professionals in the United States from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s.</p>

          <p>Nine people have been arrested and weapons and Nazi memorabilia seized after a group "celebrated Adolf Hitler's birthday" in an Oldham pub. Members of the far-right group British Movement North West posted pictures online of themselves eating a cake with swastika icing and appeared to hold up Nazi flags at the Duke of Edinburgh in Market Street, Royton, last month. The pub's owners said its staff had been tricked by the group, who had allegedly concealed their Nazi paraphernalia.</p>

          <p>A group of more than 20 United Nations experts has described Israel's continuing military operations in the Gaza Strip as "one of the most ostentatious and merciless manifestations of the desecration of human life and dignity," and demanded international action to avert the "annihilation" of Palestinians in the enclave. The statement came after rescuers in the Palestinian territory said Israeli bombardments on Wednesday had killed 59 more people ‚Äî 48 of them in Gaza City. The Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, said at least 2,545 people have been killed since Israel resumed its campaign after a two-month ceasefire collapsed on March 18, bringing the war's overall death toll in Gaza to 52,653.</p>

          <p>In Texas, a county judge, two City Council members, and a former county election administrator were indicted for "vote harvesting" and tampering with evidence, elevating Attorney General Ken Paxton‚Äôs charges of voter fraud by mostly Latino Democrats to a criminal level. Five people, all with ties to Democratic candidates, are accused of illegal vote harvesting, which usually involves knocking on doors and asking if volunteers can deliver completed absentee or mail-in ballots to voting centers or ballot drop boxes. Many activists fear that the exchange of money, such as money for gas, to help deliver a ballot or cast a vote could also be considered illegal.</p>

The FAA is also taking steps to address the issue, including installing new high-bandwidth communications, replacing copper wires with fiberoptic wires, and boosting controller staffing.</p>
