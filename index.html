          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a significant recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT), which favors closer ties with China. The outcome could potentially shift the legislative majority back to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has accused the KMT of obstructing key legislation, including defense budgets. This unprecedented recall effort is set against a backdrop of heightened tensions with Beijing and internal debate over the island's democratic future and its ability to counter Chinese influence.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that dopamine agonist drugs, like Ropinirole, prescribed for Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome, are causing extreme side effects including compulsive gambling and hypersexuality. The article details harrowing personal stories, including a man who began spying on his wife and sexually assaulted care home staff, tearing his family apart. Despite drug companies being aware of links to "deviant" sexual behavior for years, warnings on patient leaflets remain vague, prompting calls for stronger safety advice from health officials.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that a grenade explosion at a training facility was the cause of death for three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies last week. Officials also revealed that a second grenade, recovered from the same Santa Monica location, is now missing, sparking a major search effort led by the ATF. Believing the devices were inert, the deputies had stored them overnight before the fatal detonation. The department has since changed its policies to treat all explosive devices as live.</p>

The alert comes amid mounting international pressure and joint calls from Germany, France, and the UK for Israel to immediately lift restrictions on the flow of humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society is exploring the profound impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 after the House Un-American Activities Committee investigated alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit details the story of the "Hollywood Ten" and hundreds of others who were imprisoned or had their careers destroyed for their political beliefs or for refusing to name suspected Communists. It raises enduring questions about freedom of speech, privacy, and the consequences of political persecution in a democracy.</p>

Federal prosecutors claim Christopher Earl Lloyd posed as a successful investment manager to convince his victims to give him money for fake investment opportunities between 2021 and 2024. He allegedly used the funds for personal expenses, including making a payment on a Lexus, and now faces a lengthy potential prison sentence.</p>

          <p>This article explores how the game of golf for Donald Trump is more than a simple pastime; it serves as a core part of his business, a powerful tool for networking, and a fiercely competitive arena. Unlike other presidents who may have used golf for diversion, Trump has consistently leveraged his courses to forge connections with political allies and world leaders, often away from public scrutiny. The sport has been a stage for both friendly diplomacy and for building his personal brand, amid conflicting accounts of his actual skill and sportsmanship.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell was reportedly granted a limited form of immunity for her nine hours of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, according to sources familiar with the meetings. This "proffer immunity" allowed her to answer questions about Jeffrey Epstein's network without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors are seeking cooperation. Maxwell's lawyer stated she was asked about roughly 100 different people and answered every question, though no promises of clemency were made.</p>

          <p>In a determined effort to save Texas's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease in recent years, wildlife biologists have undertaken a major rescue operation. They successfully captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the state's last remaining disease-free herd to an isolated mountain range over 200 miles away. A recent check confirmed the relocated herd is surviving and has even produced new lambs, a result hailed as a monumental success and a sign of hope for the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has been abruptly cut short, with President Trump's special envoy stating that the U.S. team is returning home after Hamas issued a response showing a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire." The talks have been deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent end to the war in exchange for hostages. This diplomatic breakdown occurs as the UN and other aid agencies report that children in Gaza are now starving to death amid the ongoing blockade.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas took a sudden, dramatic dive to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft, an action that injured two flight attendants. Passengers described being lifted from their seats during the terrifying maneuver, which the pilot reportedly stated was a necessary response to an onboard collision warning. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which involved a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet and marks the second such near-miss in US airspace in a week.</p>

          <p>A health feature explores the rigidity of popular wellness targets like drinking eight glasses of water, taking 10,000 steps, and sleeping eight hours a night. Experts suggest that while these benchmarks are useful as general guides, there is often significant room for flexibility based on individual needs, and that a strict fixation on numbers can sometimes be counterproductive. For instance, while thirst is a reliable indicator for hydration for most people, getting at least seven hours of quality sleep is considered far less negotiable for long-term health.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is taking place in women's sports, with new research focusing on how the female body is uniquely affected by the demands of elite athletic activity. Scientists are studying topics once considered taboo, such as how breast movement and support can impact running stride, how the menstrual cycle might affect performance, and why female athletes face a higher risk of certain injuries like ACL tears. This new focus marks a significant shift from an era when female athletes were often treated simply as "mini-men."</p>
