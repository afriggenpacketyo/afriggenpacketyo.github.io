          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions in federal funding after the university rejected demands to change policies and leadership. The lawsuit claims the administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights and threatens academic independence and research. The Trump administration stated that federal assistance to institutions like Harvard is ending, arguing taxpayer funds are a privilege. Harvard alleges the funding halt will impede critical scientific and medical research, and diminish economic innovation.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers, led by Professor Wang Chao, have successfully factored a 90-bit RSA integer using a D-Wave Advantage quantum computer, marking a significant advance in quantum cryptology. This achievement raises concerns about Q-Day, a hypothetical point when quantum computers can decipher secure encryption, posing a threat to data security. Scientists globally are racing to develop quantum technologies and countermeasures like post-quantum cryptography to stay ahead of this looming threat. RSA encryption, widely used for securing digital communications, relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers.</p>

          <p>Climate change is increasingly threatening the $100 billion American fishing industry as rivers warm and lose oxygen. Research shows that 87% of rivers studied across the U.S. and Europe are warming, with 70% losing oxygen, impacting trout populations and the fly fishing industry. Nonprofits are working to restore river flow by removing dams and reinforcing banks to keep them from filling with sediment. The changing climate is altering the industry, making it harder for guides to make a living, but they are working to protect the rivers.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated a willingness to engage in direct talks with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky for the first time since the early stages of the war.

Zelensky has proposed a 30-day ceasefire on civilian targets, following a brief Easter truce that both sides accused each other of breaching. Putin said the Kremlin would analyze the idea, acknowledging that the military had targeted a civilian building in Sumy.</p>

Economists warn that this is not sustainable and does not indicate a healthy economy. The tariffs are having the opposite of their intended effect, as US manufacturing has slowed, and economists expect this trend to continue.</p>

The decision comes amid growing calls in Japan for more affordable imported rice, as prices continue to surge due in part to a supply shortage.
