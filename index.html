          <p>China is accelerating its strategic effort to attract elite scientific minds from overseas as part of its upcoming 15th five-year plan. The recent high-profile appointment of former Harvard statistician Liu Jun at Tsinghua University highlights this trend, reflecting a broader national push to build up domestic talent and gain a competitive edge in science and technology. This initiative aims to create a "snowball effect" by bringing globally recognized academics back to China, though the country faces significant headwinds in this global competition for top-tier researchers. The article notes this is a key component of China's long-term development strategy.</p>

Although a direct landfall is not anticipated, the system is projected to bring heavy rainfall, potential flash flooding, and life-threatening surf and rip currents to southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula through the early part of the week.</p>

          <p>Ohio's Wayne National Forest, a critical wilderness area established on former coal-mined land, is now targeted for large-scale logging under a Trump administration executive order. Environmental groups and local residents express grave concern that clear-cutting could release pollutants trapped in the soil from past mining activities, contaminating waterways and poisoning drinking water. The move is part of a broader plan to open 100 million acres of forest nationwide to lumber production, but opponents argue it threatens the delicate ecosystem and increases risks of wildfires and flooding.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes several significant tax benefits aimed at Main Street businesses. Key provisions that will take effect next year include 100% deductions for certain equipment purchases and the immediate expensing of domestic research and development costs, reversing a previous law. The legislation also restores a more generous calculation for business interest deductions and makes the 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction permanent, providing substantial bottom-line savings for many small business owners.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the European Union's primary trade concern should be the expansion of U.S. tariffs on finished goods, not the dispute over Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). The author contends that Washington's recently widened "derivative" tariffs on items containing steel and aluminum pose a more significant and immediate threat to European manufacturers of parts and equipment. The article suggests that Brussels should seek a compromise with Beijing on the EV issue to free up political capital to push back against the more damaging American trade policies.</p>

These reductions are occurring even before deeper cuts to federal Medicaid funding under a new Trump administration law take effect. Healthcare providers warn that lower reimbursement rates will force many to stop accepting Medicaid patients, severely limiting access to essential services like dental care and skilled nursing for millions of low-income and disabled Americans.</p>

This act of imagination and joy-seeking is not merely a pastime but a powerful form of resilience that provides a lifeline in the most difficult circumstances.</p>
