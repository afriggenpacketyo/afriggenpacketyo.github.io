          <p>Hurricane Erick has strengthened into a Category 3 storm as it nears Mexico's Pacific coast, packing winds of 120 miles per hour. The US National Hurricane Center warns of damaging winds and life-threatening flash floods in southern Mexico. Authorities are urging residents in low-lying areas to move to shelters, with around 2,000 temporary shelters set up in Guerrero and Oaxaca. The storm is expected to bring intense rainfall, increasing the risk of flooding and mudslides in the mountainous coastal regions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo has successfully hatched ten California condor chicks, contributing to the restoration of the state‚Äôs condor population. These chicks will eventually be released into the wild, helping to increase the genetic diversity of the species. Four of the chicks are being raised using a double-brooding method, a technique pioneered by the zoo. The California Condor Recovery Program has been instrumental in increasing the condor population from just 22 birds four decades ago to 561 as of 2024, though the species remains critically endangered.</p>

The bear was first spotted on a trail camera as a cub in 2023 with the lid obstructing its neck. The department of natural resources set a trap and safely lured the bear inside, where it was anesthetized and the lid was cut off. Despite the neck being scarred, the bear was in better condition than expected and was able to survive and feed itself.</p>

          <p>Leading climate scientists are warning that the Earth could breach the 1.5C warming limit in as little as three years if current carbon dioxide emissions continue. A new study indicates that the remaining "carbon budget" to maintain a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C has shrunk to 130 billion tonnes. Last year saw global average air temperatures exceed pre-industrial levels by more than 1.5C, primarily due to human-caused warming. While the rate of emissions increases appears to be slowing, scientists emphasize the urgent need for rapid and stringent emissions cuts to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.</p>

The OfS published guidelines for universities in England on upholding free speech, following a fine imposed on the University of Sussex for policies that had a "chilling effect" on freedom of speech. The new law places greater responsibility on universities to protect free speech and academic freedom.

          <p>Two breakthrough Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, have been deemed too expensive for the NHS, despite being the first to slow the disease's progression. NICE concluded that the drugs offered limited benefit relative to their cost, potentially diverting funds from other essential services. While the drugs can delay the transition from mild to moderate dementia, the cost of treatment and associated resources would be substantial. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed disappointment and plan to appeal the decision, arguing that the NHS is not adequately prepared to address Alzheimer's.</p>
