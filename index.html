          <p>Tensions escalated between China and the Philippines in the disputed South China Sea after a confrontation near Sandy Cay. The Chinese coastguard used water cannon against two Philippine vessels that they claimed illegally entered waters near Subi Reef and Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands. China stated that the Philippine vessels landed personnel on Sandy Cay and dangerously approached a Chinese ship, leading to a collision, while the Philippines has yet to officially respond to the incident. China has urged the Philippines to cease its infringing actions, asserting its right to protect its jurisdiction in the area.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will fall by 7% in July, marking the first decrease in a year. This translates to an annual bill reduction of Â£129 for a typical household, reflecting a drop in international wholesale gas prices. However, charities emphasize that many individuals still struggle with energy costs, with customers owing approximately Â£4 billion to suppliers. The announcement follows recent discussions about potential changes to winter fuel payments for pensioners, adding further complexity to the energy landscape.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart has temporarily stopped selling Labubu dolls in its UK stores until June due to reports of customers fighting over the popular toys. The decision follows incidents of chaos and unsafe conditions witnessed by customers, fueled by the dolls' viral status on TikTok and resale market. Pop Mart is working on a fairer system for when the dolls return to shelves, but fans have expressed anger at resellers driving up prices. Retail experts suggest the scarcity and blind box sales strategy contributed to the frenzy, potentially harming the brand's image.</p>

          <p>Eastern Australia is experiencing severe flooding due to incessant rain, resulting in widespread inundation, cut-off towns, and damaged homes, with New South Wales being the hardest hit. The storms have brought over six months' worth of rain in just three days, leading to a natural disaster declaration. The death toll has risen to four, and approximately 50,000 people remain isolated as rescue and recovery missions are underway. Experts suggest that these extreme weather events are increasingly linked to climate change, with abnormally warm oceans contributing to more intense rainfall.</p>

This accusation is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to address antisemitism in higher education by withholding federal funding. Columbia stated it would continue to work with the government on combating antisemitism and discrimination.

          <p>Concerns are growing about why President Biden was not tested for prostate cancer for over a decade, leading to a late and aggressive diagnosis. While his team claims it was routine due to his age, specialists argue that personalized medical care for presidents should include regular testing. The controversy is compounded by Biden's history of health cover-ups, raising questions about transparency and potential cognitive decline linked to hormone treatments. This revelation coincides with the release of a book alleging Biden's physical and mental deterioration, further fueling the media storm.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration decision to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students could significantly impact the university's sports teams, potentially eliminating several rosters. International students make up a substantial portion of many teams, including men's heavyweight crew, hockey, and squash. The Department of Homeland Security's action, citing an unsafe campus environment for Jewish students, could force thousands of foreign students to transfer or leave the country. Harvard is challenging the decision, while Massachusetts officials criticize the policy as harmful to students and the economy.</p>
