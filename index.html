          <p>A U.S. federal court has overturned the Trump administration's decision to cut approximately $2.2 billion in research funding to Harvard University. The judge ruled that the move violated the university's First Amendment rights, suggesting the administration used claims of antisemitism as a pretext for an ideologically motivated action against the institution. While acknowledging Harvard could have better addressed antisemitism, the ruling blocks the government from withholding any further federal funding or payments on existing grants, marking a significant legal victory for the university.</p>

While the company's revenue of $249.6 million met expectations and represented a 41% year-over-year increase, its third-quarter forecast and a dip in its net retention rate appeared to concern investors. The company is navigating the integration of AI features and recent acquisitions while facing market pressure.

The agreement will provide tutoring and other academic support to an estimated 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students over the next three school years. The lawsuit claimed that the shift to online learning disproportionately harmed Black and Latino students. The settlement mandates small-group tutoring, regular assessments, and more transparent reporting on student progress.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is exploring the creation of its own development bank, a move that could establish a financial system less vulnerable to U.S. and Western pressure. During a recent summit, China's leader Xi Jinping pledged $1.4 billion in loans to SCO member states, signaling a push for greater economic independence within the bloc. For member state Iran, this development is particularly crucial as it faces the potential restoration of international sanctions, making integration into alternative financial frameworks essential for its economic survival and strategic positioning.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to reframe the narrative of the January 6th Capitol attack, notably by granting military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by police during the riot. This move, along with a reported $5 million settlement with her family and pardons for many convicted rioters, is viewed by critics as an effort to portray the insurrectionists as heroes. The article argues these actions represent a justification of the attack by force, turning perpetrators into victims and creating a delayed triumph for a cause that sought to overturn a constitutional process.</p>

          <p>Veteran all-rounder Ravi Bopara scored a spectacular 45-ball century to lead Northamptonshire to a seven-run victory over Surrey in a rain-shortened T20 Blast quarter-final. The 40-year-old's unbeaten 105 guided his team to a total of 154-4 in their 14 overs. Despite a strong chase led by Sam Curran's unbeaten 69, Surrey fell short, finishing at 147-6. The victory secures Northamptonshire's first appearance at Finals Day since 2016, the same year they last won the competition, while top-seeded Surrey's season comes to an end.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine mandates for school attendance, a move that would make Florida the first state to do so. The officials framed the decision as a promotion of parental rights and medical freedom, with Ladapo likening mandates to "slavery." The proposal has drawn immediate and strong criticism from medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics, who warn that it is a dangerous and reckless policy that could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases such as measles and polio.</p>

          <p>The Idaho Attorney General's office has announced that no criminal charges will be filed against the four police officers who fatally shot Victor Perez, a 17-year-old with autism. The decision letter stated that prosecutors could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers' use of deadly force was unjustified. Officials said the officers were responding to a 911 call about an intoxicated man with a knife and were unaware of Perez's age or disabilities. The family's attorney expressed disappointment and plans to proceed with a wrongful death lawsuit.</p>

Linda Stermer maintains her innocence, claiming the events were a tragic accident. Her initial conviction had been overturned in 2018 due to prosecutorial misconduct before this recent retrial.</p>

Recent polling shows Adams, who is running as an independent, with only 9% of the vote, trailing Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. Speculation arose that Adams's exit could consolidate support for another independent candidate, Andrew Cuomo, to better challenge Mamdani. A spokesperson for the mayor stated that Adams has had no such discussions with President Trump and remains fully committed to winning the election.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that Americans continue to hold a negative view of the U.S. economy, with most describing its current state as "uncertain" and "struggling." Economic ratings have dipped slightly over the past month, with persistent concerns about rising prices being the primary driver of this sentiment. Two-thirds of respondents reported that prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so. While personal financial ratings vary by income, a majority of Americans believe the overall economy is getting worse rather than better. (not investment advice)</p>
