          <p>The United States has lifted its export restrictions on crucial chip-design software to China, as confirmed by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. The companies are now working to restore access for their Chinese customers, reversing a policy implemented in May that required licenses for such exports. This move impacts the U.S.-dominated electronic design automation (EDA) market, where Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA hold a significant majority of the global share. The decision signals a potential de-escalation in the ongoing technology trade tensions between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to secure enough votes to pass President Trump's major domestic policy bill, facing resistance from both moderate and conservative members of their party. The legislation, which already passed the Senate, includes increased spending for border security and defense, extends tax cuts, and makes significant cuts to health care programs. GOP leadership and the White House have been intensely lobbying holdouts who are unhappy with changes made by the Senate. The outcome of a key procedural vote remains uncertain, jeopardizing the bill's passage before the July 4 deadline.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively seeking to deepen its relationship with China and elevate it to a strategic partnership, according to its top diplomat, Ararat Mirzoyan. This diplomatic pivot comes as Armenia diversifies its foreign relations beyond its traditional reliance on Russia, particularly following Moscow's perceived failure to intervene in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Upset with its former ally, Armenia announced its withdrawal from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation. The move to strengthen ties with Beijing represents a significant shift in the geopolitical alignment of the South Caucasus nation.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a dramatic rebound, with new listing volumes soaring to $14 billion in the first half of the year, an eightfold increase from the same period in 2024. This surge, which positions the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination, is driven by a wave of Chinese companies seeking to raise capital. Factors fueling the boom include supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and fears of delisting from U.S. markets. This renewed enthusiasm marks a significant turnaround after several years of lackluster activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's executive order that severely restricted the ability of migrants crossing the southern border to seek asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system" that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The judge acknowledged the challenges at the border but affirmed that the Constitution and existing laws grant aliens present in the U.S. the right to apply for asylum. The decision has been stayed for 14 days to allow for a government appeal.</p>

Homes have been destroyed, power is out in some areas, and at least four elderly people have been hospitalized for respiratory issues. Firefighting efforts are being significantly reinforced with crews and equipment from across Greece to combat the fire on the rugged, forested terrain.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell resign immediately, escalating his long-standing criticism of the central bank's head. Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has repeatedly attacked him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate the economy. The call for resignation was posted on social media and followed Powell's recent testimony about the Fed's headquarters renovations. This move challenges the traditional independence of the Federal Reserve, as board members can typically only be removed "for cause" before their term expires. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An official inspection has found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed because the city council provided heavily redacted evidence to the police. The report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary noted that some documents had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value. This issue particularly affected two major operations investigating child sexual exploitation from the early 2000s. The council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules, but a new, more efficient process for sharing unredacted information has since been established.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for menopause hormone therapy is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women under 55. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen alone, a treatment suitable for women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research refines the understanding of hormone therapy, which has evolved since a controversial early-2000s study raised safety concerns.

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant political shift, with Donald Trump securing 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 presidential election, a substantial increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political experts suggest this trend reflects a growing populist sentiment among Latino voters rather than a simple shift to conservatism. Analysts theorize that disillusionment with the Democratic Party's handling of the economy and immigration, combined with a desire to distance themselves from anti-immigrant rhetoric, contributed to the change. The findings challenge long-held assumptions and signal a more dynamic and evolving Latino electorate.</p>

The show, titled "Back to the Beginning," is being hailed as a monumental event for heavy metal, featuring influential bands like Metallica and Slayer.

The assessment is based on material indicating the destruction of centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site.

          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots who conducted the recent airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites have been advised to maintain a low profile during their invited visit to the White House for the July Fourth holiday. President Trump, who lauded the pilots as heroes and invited them to be celebrated, has been at odds with intelligence reports over the extent of the damage caused by the mission. For security reasons, the pilots' identities will not be disclosed, and no public ceremony is planned, reflecting the sensitive nature of their mission and the risks of exposing personnel involved in such operations.</p>
