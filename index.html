          <p>Former President Donald Trump cautioned that if Vladimir Putin tries to conquer all of Ukraine, it will lead to Russia's downfall, while criticizing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump stated that Putin has gone "absolutely CRAZY!" and is needlessly killing people, expressing surprise at the intensified bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Trump also criticized Zelenskyy's rhetoric, claiming it causes problems and should stop. This comes after Zelenskyy condemned the silence of America following a major Russian air raid, urging for new sanctions against Russia, as Trump declined to place further sanctions on Moscow for not agreeing to a ceasefire. Optimism regarding the situation remains low due to the ongoing conflict and escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, people commemorated George Floyd on the fifth anniversary of his death, with gatherings in Houston, where he grew up, and Minneapolis, where he died. Floyd's murder by police officer Derek Chauvin sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. His family gathered in Houston for a service led by Rev. Al Sharpton, while Minneapolis hosted commemorations, including a church service and gospel concert. Despite what many hailed as a national "reckoning" with racism after Floyd's death, progress seems to be fading as President Donald Trump starts to roll back police reforms in Minneapolis and other cities.</p>

          <p>Researchers worldwide are investigating human consciousness to understand if and when AI systems might become conscious, sparking debate on the nature of consciousness itself. Some believe AI systems will soon achieve consciousness as they become more intelligent, while others argue it's driven by human exceptionalism. The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has fueled concerns about machine consciousness, with some experts suggesting AI could already be conscious. Concerns include the potential for moral corrosion, where compassion for AI outweighs concern for humans, and the reshaping of human relationships through AI interactions.</p>
