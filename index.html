          <h2>FEMA Internal Review Suggests Agency Unprepared for Hurricane Season</h2>

          <p>An internal review reveals that FEMA may not be fully prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, citing staffing limitations, hiring challenges, and coordination issues with states. Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson acknowledged that the agency is only about 80-85% ready but aims to close the gap soon, emphasizing a shift towards empowering states in disaster response. He conveyed President Trump's vision for FEMA to focus on legally mandated duties and allocate more resources to states. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson dismissed the review's concerns as out of context, asserting FEMA's full activation in preparation for hurricane season, though morale within the agency has reportedly been low since proposed elimination plans. The acting administrator has warned employees against obstructing presidential objectives.</p>

          <p>New York University (NYU) has withheld the diploma of Logan Rozos, a graduate who used his commencement speech to condemn the United States' support for what he described as "genocide" in Gaza. The university administration accused Rozos of misrepresenting his intended speech content to express personal political views. NYU stated that it "strongly denounces" Rozos' remarks, which have ignited debate about free speech on college campuses amid heightened political tensions regarding pro-Palestinian advocacy. Rozos' actions have resulted in disciplinary action by the university, and his diploma will be withheld pending resolution. The Trump administration's focus on antisemitism at elite institutions has intensified scrutiny of campus activism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated nearly 600 employees at Voice of America (VOA), a federally funded news network providing independent reporting to countries with limited press freedoms. These layoffs, primarily targeting journalists, represent over a third of VOA's staff and signal a continued effort to dismantle the broadcaster, despite a court ruling to maintain robust news programming. The administration also put the building housing VOA up for sale, further highlighting its hostility toward the organization.

          <p>The Trump administration's deals to sell advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have created divisions within the government regarding the potential outsourcing of the AI industry. While some officials believe these partnerships will boost American AI companies, others fear inadequate protections against the technology benefiting China and the relocation of data centers overseas. The agreements involve Nvidia and AMD chips and aim to establish major AI hubs in the Middle East. Concerns are also raised about the deals' consistency with an "America First" agenda and the potential loss of jobs and influence in the United States.</p>

This migration occurred via the Bering land bridge, which connected the two continents during periods of lower sea levels. The study, published in Science, found genetic exchanges between horse populations in North America and Eurasia. Among the fossils studied were Dalianensis horses, which lived 17,000 years ago in northeastern China and had mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting a photo of seashells arranged to spell "8647" on Instagram, which some interpreted as a threat against President Trump.

Comey removed the post, stating he was unaware of the potential meaning and opposes violence.

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to limit birthright citizenship, which would deny citizenship to babies born in the U.S. if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents. The court is considering whether the Justice Department's argument to narrow the scope of nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges holds weight. These injunctions, often used to block presidential policies, have been deemed unfairly restrictive by the administration. The legal challenge stems from Trump's executive order, which contradicts the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States.</p>

Conservatives suing the Biden administration often filed cases in small Texas courts with Republican-appointed judges, while liberals challenging Trump's policies favored courts in the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction.

The retailer will attempt to absorb some of the import taxes but anticipates that higher tariffs will ultimately lead to increased prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An audit of deaths in Maryland found that medical examiners often misclassified deaths in police custody as accidental or natural, rather than homicide. The report, prompted by George Floyd's death, identified at least 36 such cases over 17 years, indicating potential racism and pro-police bias. Attorney General Anthony Brown stated that medical examiners were less likely to classify a death as homicide if the deceased was Black or died after being restrained by police. The audit recommends a thorough review of these cases to assess the need for additional investigations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The announcement lacked specifics, causing confusion within the department regarding the scope and pace of the rollback. The Syrian transitional government, led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, has been lobbying for sanctions relief to address economic challenges. The move comes as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, U.S. allies in the region, have been normalizing relations with Syria's new government.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, impacting the export-heavy economy amid uncertainties from President Trump's trade policies. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) had previously warned of a likely moderation in the country's economy due to global trade policy effects. Despite these growth concerns, the central bank is expected to continue raising its policy rate, aiming for its 2% inflation target.</p>

          <p>Small businesses are experiencing financial instability due to President Trump's changing tariffs on China. Business owner Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, faced a 145% tariff, which has since been reduced to 30%. Despite the reduction, the tariffs continue to impact his business, forcing him to increase prices and navigate rising shipping costs. Many U.S. businesses are facing the dilemma of paying more to ship at the current 30% tariff rate or waiting in hopes that the administration will lower the tariffs further.

A vote to pass or reject the bill is not likely to take place on Friday, but rather in June. The government quietly made changes to its impact assessment on assisted dying, admitting errors in calculating how many people could take up the service if it becomes law.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments about ending the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions to halt unconstitutional government actions. The cases before the court involve President Trumpâ€™s executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship in the United States. The argument is that federal courts have always had this authority, and in recent years it has been used to block policies of Democratic and Republican administrations. The president's primary argument is that nationwide injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its constitutional duties. But as Justice Elena Kagan pointed out, if the president is violating the Constitution, his action should be stopped.</p>
