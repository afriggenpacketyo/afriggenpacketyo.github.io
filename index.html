          <h2>McDonald's to Revive Snack Wraps in U.S. Restaurants Next Month</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McDonald's is reintroducing snack wraps to its U.S. menu next month to stimulate sales following a slow start to the year. The snack wraps, which were discontinued in 2016 due to kitchen efficiency issues, will feature McCrispy Strips and come in spicy and ranch flavors. This decision is driven by sustained customer demand and aligns with McDonald's strategy to expand its chicken offerings, amidst the growing popularity of chicken-centric fast-food chains. The return of snack wraps could intensify competition in the fast-food chicken market, with Popeyes recently launching its own chicken wraps.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates a surprisingly positive shift in the labor market, with job openings increasing to 7.4 million in April, exceeding economists' forecasts. Hiring also saw a rise, while layoffs experienced a decrease, suggesting a relatively stable employment landscape. However, quits, a measure of worker confidence, showed a slight decline, and new orders for manufactured goods also fell, indicating potentially weakening demand. These figures suggest a mixed economic picture, with some sectors showing strength while others face challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent advancements in AI models, such as Anthropic's Claude 4, have demonstrated the ability to work continuously for up to seven hours, a significant milestone in AI capabilities. This is because AI models are limited by the number of tokens they can process, which affects their memory and performance over extended periods. While a 24-hour AI workday is technically conceivable in the future, it presents challenges related to computing power, cost, environmental impact, and the potential need for self-imposed limits. The discussion raises questions about the sustainability and implications of pushing AI to work around the clock.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after Prime Minister Dick Schoof stepped down due to disagreements over immigration policies, leading to the withdrawal of Geert Wilders' far-right PVV party from the ruling coalition. Wilders stated that his party's departure was due to a lack of support for their proposed stricter asylum measures, which included freezing asylum applications and limiting family reunification. This collapse echoes a previous government downfall in 2023, which was also triggered by conflicting views on immigration and led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Mark Rutte. The political instability raises concerns about the country's direction and future policies.</p>

Brückner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a sexual assault case, and authorities fear he may disappear if not charged in connection with McCann's disappearance. The search is expected to last until Friday, with investigators examining disused buildings and well-like structures.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge has sparked anger in Wales because it has been classified as an England and Wales project, meaning Wales will not benefit from extra funding. Politicians in Wales argue that this classification denies Wales hundreds of millions in funding that could transform its own rail network. Unlike Northern Ireland and Scotland, most of Wales' rail infrastructure is funded by the UK government, and Wales does not receive additional money when rail is spent in England and Wales under the Barnett Formula. The Welsh government has stated that Wales is not getting its "fair share" of rail cash.</p>

          <p>The killing of civilians near a Gaza aid center has heightened criticism of Israel's new aid distribution system, with witnesses reporting that Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians seeking assistance. The new system, supported by the United States, aims to replace the operations run by the United Nations and other international aid groups. However, concerns have been raised about the system's flaws, including chaotic distribution and insufficient aid, leading to desperate measures by Palestinians. The head of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) resigned recently, citing the system's inability to fulfill humanitarian principles.</p>

The loss of funding jeopardizes the progress made in reducing violence and could lead to increased crime rates. These community groups were credited for the decrease in homicide rates since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported a 16.3% year-over-year U.S. sales increase for May, driven by an employee pricing program implemented in response to rising tariff costs. Sales were primarily led by vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines and hybrid models, which offset a decline in sales of all-electric vehicles. The employee pricing program has contributed to consecutive months of double-digit sales increases for the automaker, highlighting the effectiveness of the promotional strategy in a challenging economic environment. The 25% auto tariffs on imported vehicles took effect in early April.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that HELOC rates will likely remain stable in the near term, with potential for one or two rate cuts in the second half of 2025, contingent on the Federal Reserve's decisions. HELOC rates move in tandem with the federal funds rate, so the Fed's monetary policy decisions will directly impact HELOC rates. The Federal Reserve is taking a cautious approach, closely monitoring economic data and inflation before making any changes to the federal funds rate.
