          <p>The article discusses the potential difficulties the U.S. faces in striking Iran's nuclear facilities, particularly the Fordo plant, which is deeply buried and requires specialized bunker-buster bombs. Experts suggest that even with these weapons, multiple strikes might be necessary, and ground personnel may be needed to ensure complete destruction. The article also considers the potential for Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region, possibly escalating the conflict. The article mentions the potential psychological impact on Iran as well as the risk of radioactive contamination. Optimism around the event is relatively low due to the escalation of regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick has intensified into a Category 4 storm, posing a significant threat to Mexico's Pacific coast, particularly the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. With sustained winds near 220km/h, forecasters anticipate devastating wind damage and life-threatening floods. Mexican authorities have issued warnings and mobilized resources, including setting up around 2,000 shelters, to prepare for the hurricane's landfall. Residents in low-lying and mountainous areas are urged to seek shelter and be aware of potential mudslides.

          <p>Japan is preparing to send two Self-Defense Forces airplanes to eastern Africa to potentially evacuate its nationals from the Middle East, following escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. The planes will be stationed in Djibouti, ready to transport Japanese citizens if needed, as the government assesses how many of the approximately 280 Japanese nationals in Iran and 1,000 in Israel wish to leave. Simultaneously, Japan has begun evacuating nationals and their families by bus from Tehran to Azerbaijan and from Tel Aviv to Jordan, due to airport closures. The government stresses that these actions are preparatory, and the situation remains strained.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during a routine test at the Starbase facility in Texas, resulting in a large fireball but no reported injuries. The company confirmed the incident, stating that safety protocols were followed and all personnel are accounted for, and an investigation is underway. The explosion occurred during preparations for a launch flight expected later this month. Despite previous successful launches, the Starship's scale and reliance on orbital refueling have raised concerns about its reliability, but it remains central to NASA's Artemis missions and Musk's plans for Mars colonization.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the lower house of parliament for the time being, according to a lawmaker. This decision makes same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely. The Prime Minister's ruling bloc does not hold a majority in the House of Representatives, and a passed no-confidence motion would require the Prime Minister to dissolve the chamber or the Cabinet to resign. The decision comes amid concerns over U.S. tariffs and rising tensions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs to eliminate the VA Servicing Purchase program (VASP) is leaving many veterans at risk of foreclosure. The VASP program helped veterans behind on their mortgages by offering new, low-interest-rate mortgages, but the VA ended it due to potential costs. This move has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, as it leaves veterans with fewer options compared to other homeowners with government-backed mortgages. The article highlights the stories of veterans struggling to keep their homes and the concerns raised by lawmakers about the abrupt ending of the program without a replacement in place.</p>

Computer simulations indicate a small chance of Earth being involved in a planetary collision or ejection. While the likelihood of such events is low, the study highlights the vulnerability of the solar system to gravitational disturbances from passing stars. The article also notes that Pluto and Mercury face higher risks of orbital changes, and the possibility of Mars being lost through collision or ejection is also considered.</p>

The artifacts, acquired by Kokugakuin University from an art dealer, were previously held by a collector who participated in a survey of the tomb in 1872.

          <p>Israel and Iran have continued exchanging strikes, escalating their conflict which began on Friday, with the US considering direct involvement. The conflict started with Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear and military sites, followed by Iranian retaliatory attacks targeting Israel. An Iranian missile struck a hospital in Beersheba, injuring at least 32 people, while Israel claimed to have attacked a nuclear reactor in Arak. The situation remains tense, with the US weighing its options and urging Iran to surrender unconditionally.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has led to a significant increase in shipping insurance costs in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of a ship's value for journeys into the Gulf, up from 0.125% before the recent Israeli attack on Iran. War risk insurance rates for the Red Sea have also increased, and coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%.
