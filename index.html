          <h2>UK and US Aim for Further Trade Opportunities After Initial Deal</h2>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, views the recent UK-US trade agreement as a foundation for future trade expansion and tariff reductions. The deal addresses tariffs previously imposed by former US President Donald Trump on UK imports like cars, steel, and aluminum. While discussions on the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) occurred during negotiations, abolishing the DST was not part of the agreement. Mandelson noted that other ambassadors in Washington expressed envy at the UK's successful negotiation of the deal, and he also recounted a compliment he received from President Trump about his appearance.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese officials in Geneva to address escalating trade disputes involving tariffs. The goal is to reduce the massive tariffs both countries have imposed on each other's goods, potentially easing tensions in global financial markets. Even before the talks, former President Trump hinted at lowering tariffs to 80%, but substantive results from the meeting remain uncertain. The article notes that China did not fulfill its previous purchase commitments, partly due to COVID-19 disruptions. The US also remains concerned about China's role in the flow of fentanyl into the US.</p>

Liran Berman, whose twin brothers Gali and Ziv have been held for 19 months, hopes Israel's military action will pressure Hamas to negotiate rather than seek revenge. Or Levy, a former hostage released in February, worries about the impact of further military action on those still in captivity, citing insufficient food and lack of sunlight during his imprisonment. Former hostages have reported receiving only one pita bread per day and being humiliated about their weight by Hamas gunmen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The end of the 'de minimis' rule, which allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US without tariffs, has led to a surge in online shopping and concerns about rising prices. Shoppers like Deborah Grushkin rushed to purchase items from Shein before the new regulations took effect, fearing it was their "last hurrah." Economists estimate that ending de minimis will result in billions of dollars in new costs, disproportionately affecting lower-income households. While some worry about the impact on affordable goods, others argue that the change will benefit American retailers and address safety concerns.</p>

          <p>For years, China's leader Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning the country to become indispensable to the global economy through its exports and technological dominance. This plan, conceived well before the Trump administration's trade war, aims to give China leverage against potential economic sanctions or disruptions. By controlling key supply chains, particularly in critical minerals and manufacturing, China seeks to deter foreign powers from interfering with its policies. While this strategy has strengthened China's global influence, it has also strained relationships with trading partners and created economic challenges for many Chinese households.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, causing further delays and cancellations. The outage, lasting approximately 90 seconds, affected communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C. The incident occurred shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the US air traffic control system. The FAA and transportation officials insist that Newark airspace remains safe, despite the delays.</p>

          <p>The military conflict between India and Pakistan escalated as Pakistan accused India of attacking its air bases, leading to retaliatory strikes on Indian bases and a missile storage site. The reported exchange marks a significant escalation in the ongoing confrontation, which began after militants killed 26 people in India-controlled Kashmir. Both sides have used drones for attacks and reconnaissance, raising concerns about the potential for further escalation. The international community, including the G7 nations, has urged restraint.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift was reportedly subpoenaed in the ongoing legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. A representative for Swift denied that the singer had any level of involvement in the film beyond agreeing to license her song “My Tears Ricochet” to be used in the trailer and a scene.

          <p>China reported a decline in consumer prices for April, fueling fears of deflation amid the ongoing trade war with the United States. The national consumer price index (CPI) edged down by 0.1% year-on-year, reflecting weak domestic demand and the impact of high tariffs. While negotiations with the US are possible, tariffs remain elevated, leading to stockpiles of unsold goods for Chinese manufacturers. The decrease in food prices and increase in prices for other goods and services paints a mixed picture for the Chinese economy.</p>

          <p>House Republicans introduced the initial components of a roughly $4 trillion tax cut package, aiming to extend key provisions from former President Trump's 2017 tax cuts and offer temporary expansions. The legislation proposes locking in the larger standard deduction and lower individual income tax rates while adding temporary boosts to the standard deduction and child tax credit. The plan faces opposition from Democrats, who criticize the proposed spending cuts to programs for the poor. With a slim majority in the House, Republicans face a challenging path to passing the legislation.</p>
