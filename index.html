          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck the Texas Hill Country, causing what officials describe as a 'mass casualty event' with at least 24 confirmed fatalities and over 20 people remaining unaccounted for. The primary cause was an unforecasted deluge of rain that caused the Guadalupe River to rise an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, inundating the region. A significant number of the missing are from Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp that was directly in the flood's path. In response, the Texas governor has issued a disaster declaration, mobilizing a massive search and rescue operation to locate and assist survivors.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy has avoided a major season-ending knee injury, being diagnosed with only a bone bruise after a frightening on-field collision. While he is expected to be sidelined for approximately six weeks, the team's management expressed relief that no ligaments were torn, which allows him to potentially return before the playoffs. General manager Brandon Gomes stated that this positive prognosis means the Dodgers' trade deadline plans will likely remain unaltered. The team will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim, confident that Muncy can regain his form upon his return.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities in New York City temporarily closed a section of beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. Drones operated by the city's emergency management team confirmed the sharks' proximity, leading lifeguards to clear the water as a safety precaution. The article notes that the beach was reopened after about an hour following continued monitoring. This incident comes as New York state officials, including Governor Kathy Hochul, have been increasing shark surveillance measures along Long Island's popular beaches to ensure public safety during the busy summer holiday season.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. actions targeting China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, both South Korea and Japan are implementing policies to strengthen their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a 'major crisis' and has pledged significant support to reclaim its status as a global leader. The government's new growth policy guide focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through increased digitalization and automation. These measures aim to enhance production capabilities and improve working conditions, positioning the nations to compete more effectively on the global stage.</p>

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law that permits towing companies to sell seized vehicles just 15 days after towing them is being criticized as predatory by residents and advocates. The article highlights the experiences of a couple from Waterbury whose car was towed for an expired registration and subsequently sold before they could raise the funds to retrieve it. Critics argue that companies like MyHoopty.com LLC are specifically targeting working-class and low-income neighborhoods where residents may struggle to pay hefty impound fees on short notice. Despite community pushback, the owner of the towing company defends his actions as simply enforcing the rules of private properties.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a comprehensive tax and spending package into law, marking a significant legislative achievement for his administration. The bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increases defense and border security funding, and implements substantial cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid. While the administration claims the law will stimulate economic growth, it has faced strong opposition from Democrats, who argue it disproportionately benefits the wealthy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation will add over $3 trillion to the national debt, raising concerns about its long-term fiscal impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to some claims, the recently passed 'big, beautiful bill' does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, but instead introduces a new temporary deduction for seniors. The legislation creates a 'bonus' deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below $75,000, which is set to expire in 2028. Policy experts cited in the article clarify that this provides some relief but is not a full repeal of the tax on benefits, and it will not benefit low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax. Critics also suggest this measure could increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records to South Sudan, after they were held for weeks at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti. The court clarified that its previous ruling, which paused a lower court's injunction, rendered that injunction unenforceable, thereby permitting the removal. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressed grave concern for the migrants' safety, stating they could face torture or death in South Sudan, a country plagued by civil war. The administration has been pursuing third-country removals as part of a broader, aggressive campaign to deter immigration and deport non-citizens.</p>

The local artisans, who handcraft the leather sandals for a modest price, were angered that the high-fashion version did not acknowledge its design origins. The controversy has drawn attention to the struggles of the nearly 5,000 artisans who work in difficult conditions for low wages to preserve the centuries-old craft. In response to the backlash, local industry associations are now seeking better recognition and potential compensation to support the artisans' cultural legacy.</p>

It references a recent public display of emotion by a UK politician and gathers anecdotal evidence from various professionals, both men and women, who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal news. Career coaches and experts suggest that modern workplaces are increasingly valuing emotional intelligence, viewing authentic emotional expression as a potential strength.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New scientific research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are 'unsung heroes' in the fight against climate change due to their significant role in carbon storage. These creatures, including copepods, gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica before migrating hundreds of meters deep to hibernate. During this deep-sea hibernation, they burn their fat reserves, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. The study quantifies this process, estimating it sequesters as much carbon annually as the emissions from 55 million cars, highlighting a crucial natural mechanism for mitigating global warming.</p>

          <p>An investigation by BBC News has exposed a criminal network in the UK that forges wills to steal millions of pounds from the estates of deceased individuals. The fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the digital probate system by monitoring a public list of unclaimed estates, then producing fake wills to name themselves as sole heirs. The article details several cases where this has occurred, with evidence suggesting a single group is responsible, using similar tactics and even connected company directorships. The criminals also appear to commit tax fraud by undervaluing the estates to avoid inheritance tax, a practice that critics say the current online system fails to adequately scrutinize.</p>

This is attributed to the bill's structure, which extends business tax breaks and raises the estate tax exemption while capping the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. This combination provides maximum upside to the wealthy in low-tax states while offering less benefit to those in high-tax states like California and New Jersey. (not investment advice)</p>

After becoming known for his pro-Trump advocacy within the Arab-American community, Bahbah was contacted by a senior Hamas official in April to help facilitate talks for a ceasefire and hostage release. Acting as a conduit, he relays messages between Hamas officials in Qatar and Cairo and President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Bahbah's involvement is credited with helping to build trust and secure the 'good faith' release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander in May.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. This marks a bumper breeding season for the vulnerable species at the zoo, with a total of ten chicks hatched. Zoo experts decided to share the parenting duties by placing one of two eggs laid by another penguin pair into Scampi and Flounder's nest to improve the chick's chances of survival. The article notes that same-sex penguin pairings are not uncommon, and the new parents are sharing feeding and care duties as expected. The zoo's colony plays a crucial role in the international breeding program for the at-risk species.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's recent immigration raids and the passage of a budget bill that significantly increases funding for deportation efforts. Protesters marched from City Hall to the Federal Building, expressing fear and anger over the aggressive enforcement actions that have created a climate of fear in immigrant communities. Speakers, including Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, criticized the spending bill as a 'Big Beautiful Scam' that prioritizes immigration enforcement over community needs.

          <p>Germany's women's national team started their Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. However, the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears during the first half. Gwinn, who has a history of two prior ACL injuries, will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the damage, leaving her participation in the rest of the tournament in doubt. While the team's performance was strong, the loss of their captain casts a shadow over their victory as they prepare to face Denmark next.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order that will increase entry fees for international visitors to U.S. national parks and give preferential treatment to American citizens for permits and lotteries. The order states that the additional revenue generated from foreign tourists will be used for infrastructure improvements at federal recreation sites. The directive also revokes a 2017 Obama-era memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the management and storytelling within the national park system. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending government DEI programs, shifting away from the previous focus on ensuring all Americans see themselves reflected in the parks.</p>

          <p>India is increasingly asserting its influence within Global South-based alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), often challenging China's leadership aspirations. A key rule in these organizations is the requirement for consensus in all decision-making, which India has used to block initiatives it opposes. For instance, at a recent SCO defense ministers' meeting, India's refusal to agree on language related to terrorism prevented the adoption of a joint statement. This dynamic highlights the ongoing strategic competition between the two Asian giants as they both vie for a leadership role among developing nations on the world stage.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks outlines five types of foods he avoids giving his own children to promote long-term cardiovascular health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts high in added sugar, and processed meats like bacon and deli meats, which are loaded with sodium and nitrates. He also warns against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, and deep-fried foods cooked in reused industrial oils. Instead, the article recommends healthier alternatives such as air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods.</p>
