            <p>The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to use an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants, stipulating they must receive a court hearing beforehand.  The ruling clarifies that challenges must occur in Texas, where the migrants are held.  Meanwhile, China vowed to retaliate against Trump's tariff threats, escalating trade war tensions.  Additionally, an Israeli airstrike on a Gaza hospital camp killed 10, including a journalist, highlighting the ongoing conflict's impact on media workers.</p>

            <p>The article discusses conflicting trends in dementia research, highlighting both rising case numbers and declining age-specific rates. While the absolute number of people developing dementia is increasing due to an aging population, the rate of developing dementia at a given age is decreasing. This decline is attributed to factors like lower smoking rates, higher education, and better treatment of high blood pressure. The article emphasizes the importance of modifiable risk factors and ongoing medical advancements in delaying the onset of dementia.</p>
