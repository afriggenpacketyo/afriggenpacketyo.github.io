          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark, who is sitting out the WNBA All-Star Game due to a groin injury, will still participate as a team captain and assistant coach. Speaking ahead of the game, she humorously stated her goal is to heckle the referees from the bench, possibly earning a technical foul while otherwise enjoying the event. Clark, who received the most fan votes, is known for her passionate interactions with officials during games, a trait common among many WNBA players. Her injury occurred during a recent game against the Connecticut Sun.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team secured a decisive 40-5 victory over the United States in a Test match in Washington D.C. that was significantly delayed by weather. The game experienced a one-hour delay at kickoff and another 40-minute pause in the first half due to lightning strikes in the area, forcing players and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, completing their summer tour with a perfect record. The USA managed a late try to avoid a shutout, and the event also saw several players make their England debut.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense aimed at individuals preparing for mass casualty attacks, even if they lack a specific terrorist ideology. This move comes in response to the Southport attack, where the perpetrator had planned the violence but could not be charged with a serious preparatory offense beforehand due to the absence of an ideological motive. The proposed law would mirror existing counter-terrorism legislation, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory actions like researching targets, thereby closing a perceived gap in the legal system.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar shortstop Mookie Betts an unplanned day off, citing the need for a mental reset amidst a severe season-long slump. Betts' batting average has fallen to a career-low .241, and his performance following the All-Star break showed no signs of improvement. Roberts stated he wanted to take the decision out of Betts' hands to allow him to watch a game from a different perspective and work on his mechanics. The move highlights the urgency of the situation for the team and the player, who is unaccustomed to such prolonged struggles at the plate.</p>

While the government stated the contracts complied with modern slavery rules, critics argue that taxpayer money should support ethical and domestic production.

Proponents argue it could help mitigate learning loss, ease childcare and cost-of-living burdens on parents, and potentially lower holiday prices. However, many teachers oppose the idea, viewing the long break as essential for recharging and planning. While some schools have already moved to a five-week summer, broader proposals in places like Wales have been paused after facing divisive public and professional responses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and threatened to end a key airline partnership between Delta and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions forcing airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport to a newer, more distant one, which the U.S. claims violates a trade agreement. All Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The decision escalates a trade dispute and could significantly impact the more than 40 million passengers who travel between the two countries annually.</p>

          <p>Germany is strengthening its security and political ties with France and the United Kingdom, forming a cooperative group known as the "E3." This pivot towards European partners is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future U.S. commitment to NATO under President Trump. A new bilateral treaty between Germany and the UK provides for close security and arms cooperation. This strategic realignment emphasizes Europe's need for greater defense independence, with the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK seen as a potential supplement to the U.S. security guarantee.</p>
