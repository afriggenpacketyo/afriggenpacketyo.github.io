          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is implementing significant cuts to minority health offices within HHS, potentially widening existing health disparities. These cuts affect offices at the FDA, CDC, CMS, HRSA, and SAMHSA, with layoffs impacting staff and directors. Experts warn that these reductions could worsen health outcomes for underserved groups, strain the healthcare system, and increase costs. While the Affordable Care Act prevents complete closure of these offices, the administration aims to narrow their scope and curtail resources, raising concerns about the future of health equity in the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities, often compared to self-made pensions, involve a lump sum payment to an insurance company in exchange for a future income stream. The cost varies based on the type of annuity, with fixed annuities having lower entry points than variable annuities. Beyond the premium, fees like administrative, investment management, and surrender charges can impact returns. Whether an annuity is worthwhile depends on individual financial situations, providing guaranteed income and tax deferral, but potentially limiting flexibility and incurring complexity.

Trump claimed that the GDP decline and market downturn were due to Biden's policies, not his own.

          <p>The Trump administration has removed several Biden appointees from the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, including Doug Emhoff, former second gentleman. The White House stated that Trump plans to appoint new members who will support the State of Israel and honor the memory of those who perished in the Holocaust. Critics argue that this move politicizes an institution dedicated to Holocaust remembrance and education, while some Jewish community leaders have requested a reconsideration.</p>
