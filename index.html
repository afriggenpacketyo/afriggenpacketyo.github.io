          <p>A hot air balloon caught fire and crashed in Santa Catarina, Brazil, resulting in at least eight fatalities and several injuries. The balloon, carrying 21 people, experienced a fire within the basket, prompting the pilot to attempt an emergency landing and instruct passengers to jump. Some passengers were unable to jump before the balloon crashed near a health center. Local authorities and the Brazilian President have expressed their condolences and are investigating the incident, which marks the second fatal balloon accident in Brazil within a week. This tragedy underscores the risks associated with hot air ballooning, especially during popular local festivities.</p>

          <p>France defeated England 26-24 in a dramatic rugby match at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium, marked by a late comeback and a red card for England's Immanuel Feyi-Waboso.

Antoine Hastoy's conversion in the final moments secured the victory for France in the energy-sapping match. This match served as preparation for England's tour of Argentina and the United States, with several key players absent due to British and Irish Lions selection.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was described as a doomsday "prepper" who instructed his family to prepare for war. Boelter is accused of killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Authorities discovered weapons, cash, and passports in Boelter's wife's vehicle, and she revealed her husband had a "bailout plan" for emergencies and business partner in Africa. The affidavit does not imply that Boelterâ€™s wife knew about her husbandâ€™s alleged plans to attack the lawmakers.</p>

The Fed kept interest rates unchanged, acknowledging both support for rate cuts due to consumer and housing market weakness, and the need for higher rates due to rising inflation expectations. The market is focused on individual company fundamentals and industry trends rather than higher-level dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

Israel targeted centrifuge production sites and killed senior Iranian commanders, while Iran launched retaliatory drones and missiles. President Trump is considering U.S. military involvement, and Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi cautioned against it. The conflict has resulted in hundreds of casualties on both sides, with ongoing fighting in Gaza adding to the regional instability.</p>

          <p>A new federal health initiative promoting awareness of ultra-processed foods could benefit key advisers to HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., due to their business interests in wearable health devices.

His sister, Casey Means, who is Kennedy's nominee for Surgeon General, sells continuous glucose monitors. Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts of interest due to these connections, and consumer advocates have criticized the hiring practices.</p>

          <p>As Israel's attacks on Iran continue, speculation about regime change in Tehran increases, but regime change has historically had disastrous consequences in the region. Foreign-imposed regime change is a violation of international law, often leading to power vacuums, violence, and instability.

          <p>Steve Bannon played a significant role in President Trump's decision to delay a potential strike on Iran's nuclear facility. Bannon, who holds no official government position, advised Trump against military action, citing concerns about Israeli intelligence, the effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs, and the risk to U.S. troops. Other advisors, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have also become more aligned with a noninterventionist stance. Trump ultimately decided to wait two weeks before making a final decision, despite his insistence that Iran was close to developing a nuclear bomb.</p>

          <p>Experts say US sunscreens are not as effective as those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences, with the FDA classifying sunscreen as a drug, have limited the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients. Some experts point out that the FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in more than 20 years. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives for regulatory approval, but dermatologists still emphasize the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend mineral sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>
