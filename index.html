The judge found that the government's justification, citing Khalil's beliefs as a threat to U.S. foreign policy, could lead to arbitrary enforcement. However, the judge did not order Khalil's release due to unresolved issues regarding his residency application. Khalil's attorneys argue his detention suppresses free speech, while the government also alleges he withheld information on his application.</p>

          <p>A federal court ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs, a major setback for his economic agenda. The Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose sweeping duties. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling, arguing that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has fueled trade deficits, creating a national emergency. The ruling likely sets up a legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is cancelling a contract to develop a vaccine to protect people against flu viruses, including bird flu, citing concerns about the safety of mRNA technology. The Department of Health and Human Services is terminating a $766 million contract with Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine. HHS stated it will prioritize vaccine platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. Experts criticized the decision, saying it puts lives and health at risk and makes the country less prepared for the next influenza pandemic.</p>
