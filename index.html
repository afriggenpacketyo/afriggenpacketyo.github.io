          <h2>Carney's Liberals Secure Unexpected Election Victory Amid Anti-Trump Sentiment in Canada</h2>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party achieved a surprising victory in Canada's federal election, fueled by a strong anti-Trump sentiment. Carney, a political newcomer, successfully portrayed Trump's threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty as the defining issue, positioning himself as the leader to protect the country's economic survival and sovereignty. While the Conservative opposition made significant gains, their focus on domestic issues was overshadowed by the pervasive concern over the US president's policies. Carney plans to initiate negotiations on a new economic and security relationship with the US following the election. Optimism remains moderate as the new government faces immediate challenges in navigating the US relationship.</p>

          <p>Tomoyuki Sugano delivered an impressive performance, pitching five scoreless innings for the Baltimore Orioles in their 4-3 victory against the New York Yankees. Sugano (3-1) showcased his fastball and splitter, striking out eight batters and allowing only five hits. He navigated a bases-loaded situation in the first inning and effectively neutralized slugger Aaron Judge. This marked Sugano's first scoreless outing in his Major League Baseball career, lowering his ERA to 3.00, the best among Orioles starters. The win snapped the Orioles' three-game losing streak and opened the series against the Yankees on a positive note.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank announced a 39% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong performance in its investment banking division.

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a notable victory in the Canadian election, largely due to the influence of Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Trump's continued criticisms and suggestions about making Canada the 51st US state galvanized Canadian voters, leading to a surge in support for the Liberals. Carney's campaign focused on countering Trump's perceived threats to Canadian sovereignty and economy, which resonated with voters concerned about the country's future. While Trump doesn't seem to have a personal dislike for Carney, the diverging political and policy interests between the US and Canada are expected to persist.</p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers, Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki, were released from prison after serving over four years on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion under national security legislation. They were arrested for participating in an unofficial primary poll in 2020, which authorities deemed a plot to subvert the government. Critics view their prosecution as part of Beijing's broader crackdown on rights and democracy in Hong Kong following the imposition of the national security law in 2020. The law was enacted after widespread protests in 2019 and is seen by officials as necessary to restore order.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars announced a $1.9 billion cost-cutting initiative following a sharp decline in first-quarter operating profit. The company, owned by China's Geely Holding, reported a drop in profit from 4.7 billion krona to 1.9 billion krona due to decreased wholesales, adverse currency effects, and automotive industry turbulence. The cost-cutting plan includes reductions in investments and potential layoffs across its global operations. Volvo Cars also withdrew its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, citing market headwinds such as price competition and tariffs. The company is focusing on controlling costs amidst the challenging market conditions.</p>

The city's GDP grew by 5.2%, while exports decreased by 8.7% in yuan terms, attributed to high baseline growth in 2024 and pressures from the ongoing tariff war and industrial transition. Some enterprises in Shenzhen face high costs and insufficient orders, with foreign trade and exports under pressure.

          <p>Oil giant BP reported a 49% drop in first-quarter net profit, attributed to weaker crude prices and a recent strategic reset. The underlying replacement cost profit, a proxy for net profit, was $1.38 billion, falling short of analyst expectations. Despite the profit decline, BP announced a dividend per ordinary share of 8 cents and a share buyback of $750 million. CEO Murray Auchincloss stated the firm had a "great start" in delivering on its strategic reset, citing high upstream operating efficiency and successful exploration discoveries.

          <p>The government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax, formally known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to milk-based drinks and non-dairy substitutes. This initiative aims to further tackle obesity by reducing the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml. The exemption for milk-based drinks was initially included due to concerns about calcium consumption, but the Treasury now argues that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar. The SDIL has raised £1.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, and the government estimates that most soft drinks are not subject to the tax due to reformulation by manufacturers.</p>

Surface buoys, equipped with satellite receivers, will provide real-time data via encrypted links, while mid-depth submerged buoys will track water currents and salinity shifts using acoustic profilers.

          <p>Formula 1 regulations are set to change in 2026, primarily driven by the desire to attract new manufacturers and refine chassis rules. The engine rules will retain 1.6-liter V6 turbo hybrids but simplify them by removing the MGU-H, which recovers energy from the turbo. Electrical capacity will be increased so that about 50% of the total power output will come from the electrical part of the engine, running on 100% sustainable fuel. These changes have led to Audi's entry into F1 and Ford's partnership with Red Bull. Moveable aerodynamics will also be introduced to aid in energy recovery, potentially shaking up the competitive order.</p>

          <p>HSBC's first-quarter results surpassed estimates, driven by strong performance in its wealth business and corporate and institutional banking segment. The bank announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion, expected to be completed before the announcement of its 2025 interim results. While profit before tax declined 25% year-on-year and revenue fell 15%, pre-tax profit soared nearly 317% from the previous quarter. CEO Georges Elhedery attributed the strong results to momentum in earnings and disciplined execution of strategy. The bank cautioned about heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, noting that protectionist trade policies are adversely affecting consumer and business sentiment.</p>

          <p>A massive power outage struck large parts of Spain and Portugal, disrupting daily life for millions. Subway and railway trains halted, phone service was cut, and traffic lights and ATMs shut down. Spain's power distributor, Red Eléctrica, reported that about 99% of the power capacity had been restored across the country. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez attributed the outage to a problem in the European grid and said the cause was still being determined. The blackout, described as unprecedented, is the second serious European power outage in less than six weeks.</p>

          <p>The football model defined by Pep Guardiola, expanding on the ideas of Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal, has become the dominant force in modern football. Three of Guardiola's disciples, Luis Enrique, Mikel Arteta, and Hansi Flick, are in the Champions League semi-finals. This positional football emphasizes structured play and turns defenders into midfielders. Critics argue it lacks spontaneity, but it has become a cultural force, influencing club hiring, academy training, and football education globally. The game is shifting from structured defense and free-form attack to a more cohesive, strategically designed approach.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has seen unprecedented use of executive orders, with about a quarter facing legal challenges. These orders have restructured U.S. governance and altered foreign and domestic policy, echoing recommendations from Project 2025. Some orders appear based on personal preference rather than policy priorities, raising concerns about the use of personalized power. All three branches of the U.S. government have the legal power to overturn executive orders. More than a quarter (29%) of Trump's executive orders have been legally challenged, with the vast majority of those cases still pending.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terror attack in Kashmir, India has renewed its claims of Pakistani involvement, citing "cross-border linkages." India alleges that a group called the Resistance Front, a proxy for Lashkar-e-Taiba, was behind the attack. Pakistan denies involvement and calls for an international investigation. The roots of the Kashmir conflict trace back to the 1947 partition of British India, and the region remains a point of contention between the two countries. India has presented evidence in the past linking Pakistan to militant groups, but has not yet provided similar evidence for the recent attack.</p>

It was not yet clear if the Liberals would secure the 172 out of 343 electoral seats needed for a majority. Following his victory, Carney told his supporters that Canada will "win this trade war" with the US. The election was largely influenced by US President Donald Trump's threats of tariffs and his suggestion to make Canada the 51st state. The Liberal Party was able to regain its lost popularity following Justin Trudeau's resignation in January.</p>

Deliveroo's listing was considered one of the worst in London's history, with almost £2bn wiped off its market capitalization on the first day of trading.
