          <p>Germany's national football team recovered from a recent loss to defeat Northern Ireland 3-1 in a crucial 2026 World Cup qualifying match. Coach Julian Nagelsmann's strategic substitutions, particularly the introduction of Nadiem Amiri, were pivotal in changing the game's momentum after a sluggish first half. Florian Wirtz also delivered a standout performance, scoring a decisive free-kick that highlighted his individual brilliance and secured the much-needed three points for the team. The victory provides a vital boost as Germany navigates a challenging qualifying group.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has publicly refuted the characterization of the Trump administration's tariffs as a tax on American consumers. In an interview, Bessent dismissed concerns from major corporations, arguing that warnings on earnings calls represent worst-case scenarios and are not reflective of the broader economic health, pointing to GDP growth and stock market highs. This stance comes despite a federal appeals court ruling that the administration overstepped its authority, a decision now being appealed to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to threats of a federal law enforcement and immigration crackdown, churches in Chicago are becoming centers for community guidance and support. Faith leaders, like Rev. Marshall Hatch, are urging congregants to remain calm, know their rights, and stay connected, while strongly opposing the potential deployment of federal agents or the National Guard. The sermons address deep-seated fears within Black and Latino communities, framing the issue as a need for resources and investment rather than increased policing. The community's response emphasizes peaceful resistance and preparedness.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century in a one-day international match against South Africa, reigniting discussions about his role in the upcoming Ashes Test series. The 21-year-old's performance is seen as a significant milestone, potentially solidifying his position and silencing critics who pointed to his lack of a century despite his immense talent. While England's white-ball captain Harry Brook praised the achievement as a potential turning point, some commentators remain unconvinced of his readiness for red-ball cricket. The innings adds a compelling new factor for selectors to consider.</p>

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow stated the current test is "too easy" and should include more thought-provoking, open-ended questions to better assess an applicant's attachment to the Constitution. This proposal is part of a broader shift within USCIS towards a more enforcement-oriented role, raising concerns among legal experts about the subjectivity and fairness of such changes.</p>

          <p>The Universal Postal Union reported that postal traffic to the United States dropped by over 80% after the Trump administration ended the "de minimis" trade exemption rule. This rule had allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country tariff-free. The administration defended the move as a necessary measure to combat counterfeit goods and illicit drugs. The sudden change has caused significant disruption, with at least 88 national postal operators suspending some or all services to the U.S. while awaiting a solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Editorial Argues Trump's Military Actions Against Traffickers Turn Failed Metaphor into Dangerous Reality</h2>

          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes the Trump administration's recent military strike against alleged drug traffickers as a dangerous escalation of the "war on drugs." The article argues that turning this campaign into a literal military conflict, involving extrajudicial killings without due process, sets a perilous precedent and undermines international law. It compares the strategy to the flawed "war on terror," warning that such actions are counterproductive, risk civilian casualties, and damage diplomatic cooperation. The piece advocates for focusing on demand reduction and financial disruption rather than military force.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot recently soared to nearly $1.8 billion, a new analysis shows significant state-by-state variation in lottery spending. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 annually per person, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 per year, which may be linked to reduced access in more rural areas. The report notes that lotteries are a notable source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of a state's general fund.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials are investigating a malware-laden email, disguised as correspondence from a Republican congressman, that targeted groups involved in U.S.-China trade talks. Cybersecurity analysts have linked the malware to a hacking group known as APT41, which is believed to operate on behalf of Chinese intelligence. The operation appears to be an attempt at espionage, aimed at gaining insight into the U.S. administration's strategies and recommendations for the contentious trade negotiations. The Chinese embassy denied knowledge of the attack and opposed such accusations without evidence.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 demonstrators gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and end the war in Gaza. The protests, which included families of the hostages, reflect growing public dissent against the government's current strategy, which prioritizes military victory over a negotiated deal. Speakers at the rally warned that intensifying the war further endangers the lives of the remaining captives. This comes as the Israeli military appears to be preparing for an expanded ground operation in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>The UK's Defence Secretary, John Healey, has stated that the government is considering an expansion of its program to house asylum seekers on military bases and other non-hotel sites. This initiative is part of Labour's plan to move asylum seekers out of costly hotels, which have become a source of public and political controversy. The announcement comes as the number of small boat crossings over the English Channel continues to pose a significant challenge for the new government. The plan aims to find more sustainable and cost-effective accommodation solutions.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has strongly condemned comments made by Vice President JD Vance regarding a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers. Vance had described killing cartel members as the "highest and best use of our military." Paul labeled Vance's sentiment "despicable and thoughtless," arguing that it glorifies killing people without a trial and ignores the principle of due process. The public disagreement highlights a significant ideological rift within the Republican party over the use of military force in law enforcement contexts.</p>

Although both teams had already qualified for the quarter-finals, the win gives New Zealand a more favorable path in the knockout stage. The result was a comprehensive display of the Black Ferns' strength and a tough loss for an Irish side that had been undefeated in the tournament.</p>
