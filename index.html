          <p>The Senate has approved a budget framework aligned with President Trump's agenda, following a lengthy series of amendment votes. The amended framework aims to raise the debt ceiling significantly and make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, using a controversial scoring tool. While some conservatives have expressed reservations about this method, Senate GOP leaders have voiced strong support for the framework. The budget also includes provisions for border funding, setting the stage for further policy and spending changes by congressional committees. </p>

          <p>President Trump's recent overhaul of US trade policy, involving tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on various trading partners, signifies a departure from the era of globalization. Trump asserts that these tariffs will revitalize the US economy and generate substantial revenue for the government. However, many economists and businesses express concerns that this approach could harm American consumers and disrupt the global economy. While Trump has advocated for tariffs for decades, the scale and scope of these new measures represent a significant shift in US trade policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries has officially commenced, with even higher levies on goods from major trading partners scheduled to follow. This action signifies a fundamental rejection of the post-World War II system of mutually agreed tariff rates. Experts predict that these tariffs will likely evolve over time as countries negotiate for lower rates, but the immediate impact is expected to be substantial.

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a novel vaccine booster, dubbed a 'molecular elevator', that can significantly enhance the immune system's response to cancer and viral infections. This technology, known as SABER, facilitates the delivery of vaccine antigens directly to the endoplasmic reticulum, bypassing cellular barriers and boosting immune responses by up to 150-fold. This advancement holds promise for improved treatments for malignancies and more effective vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses like coronaviruses. The research was published in the journal Nature and represents a significant step forward in vaccine technology.</p>

          <h2>Nike's Air Jordan 1s Face Potential Price Hikes Due to Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike produces most of its shoes, could significantly impact the price of the iconic Air Jordan 1s. Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia, and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes, ranging from 32% to 54%. While Nike hopes to negotiate lower rates, analysts predict that the company will likely have to raise prices to offset the increased costs. Nike is already facing a tight bottom line, and any large price increase could reduce demand in the competitive footwear market.</p>

          <p>UCLA's women's basketball team's run to the Final Four ended in a resounding 85-51 defeat against UConn. The Bruins struggled with turnovers and missed shots, failing to replicate their performance from earlier tournament games. While Lauren Betts scored 26 points, UConn's balanced attack and strong defense proved too much for UCLA to overcome. Coach Cori Close acknowledged the team's shortcomings and expressed hope that the experience would motivate them to improve for future opportunities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has granted TikTok a second extension to comply with a law requiring the video app to either sell its US operations or face a ban. Trump stated he does not want TikTok to 'go dark'. ByteDance said it had been in discussion with the Trump administration, but 'an agreement has not been executed'. The new extension comes as the Trump administration tries to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership, and keep the popular app running in the US.</p>

          <p>The Peace Corps is the latest federal agency to be targeted by Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”. It appears “Doge” could be eyeing cuts to the agency, which sends US volunteers around the world to work in local communities on health, education and environmental initiatives. Since Donald Trump was inaugurated, Musk and his allies in Doge have been steadily working to slash budgets and layoff workers in federal agencies. They’ve targeted more than 20 agencies with the mission to identify “waste, fraud and abuse”.</p>

While the Trump administration has not formally terminated the Uniting for Ukraine program, it suspended admissions under the policy, as well as status renewals for those already in the U.S.</p>
