          <p>An exhibition in Shanghai is showcasing early editions of Edgar Snow's influential book, "Red Star Over China," to commemorate the anniversary of World War II. The display includes the original 1937 English version, the first U.S. edition, and the earliest Chinese translation from 1938. Snow's book was based on his time embedded with the Red Army in 1936, where he conducted extensive interviews with key figures like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. The exhibition provides a historical look at the documentation of China's civil war and the rise of the Communist Party.</p>

          <p>This opinion article provides a roundup of what the author considers seven of the wildest news stories from the past month. The topics covered are diverse, ranging from rabbits in Colorado with horn-like growths to a Democratic National Committee memo advising against using certain "woke" vocabulary. The piece also touches on media coverage of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's engagement, a call for D.C. statehood, and an 82-year-overdue library book. The author presents these stories with a humorous and critical tone, reflecting on their perceived absurdity.</p>

          <p>Five Democratic U.S. senators have sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanding an immediate and "massive surge" of baby formula and other humanitarian aid to Gaza. The letter highlights the severe crisis where infants are reportedly dying of starvation, and international monitors have officially classified parts of the region as experiencing famine. The senators call on the U.S. to use its full authority to address the moral obligation, noting that malnourished mothers are unable to breastfeed, making formula essential for infant survival. This appeal follows a similar one from over 100 House Democrats.</p>

          <p>A Department of Homeland Security policy under the Trump administration is reportedly keeping immigrants in detention by arguing they are ineligible for bond, even when an immigration judge grants it. The article highlights the case of Luis Fernandez, a Queens resident detained in Texas, whose court-approved bond was blocked by DHS using a rarely used automatic stay provision. Immigration lawyers and advocates state this practice has become widespread, inflicting maximum punishment and undermining due process for individuals, regardless of how long they have lived in the U.S. or whether they pose a flight risk.</p>

          <p>An Oregon resident and firefighter, who has lived in the U.S. for 19 years, was arrested by Border Patrol agents while working at a wildfire in Washington. His lawyers argue the arrest was illegal, as he was in the process of obtaining a U-visa, a protection for crime victims who assist law enforcement. They state the detention violates Department of Homeland Security policies that prohibit immigration enforcement during emergency response operations.

          <p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 20 years ago, New Orleans's public school system underwent a dramatic overhaul that included the termination of over 4,000 teachers, most of whom were experienced Black women. This shift to a charter school system led to a significant and lasting decline in the percentage of Black educators, from 71% pre-Katrina to a low of 49% by 2014. Now, Black-led organizations like Black Education for New Orleans (Be Nola) are working to reverse this trend through professional development and fellowship programs. These initiatives aim to restore a vital sense of community and provide positive role models for the city's majority-Black student population.</p>

The article recounts the experiences of a mother who lost everything but found a new start, a surgeon who worked tirelessly to save patients in a flooded hospital, and the former police chief who dealt with the city's collapse. Despite the immense trauma and challenges, their reflections highlight a sense of hope and strength gained from surviving the catastrophic event.

          <p>In an interview, author Virginia Sole-Smith addresses the increasing cultural anxiety surrounding children's diets, particularly in light of movements like "Make American Healthy Again." Sole-Smith advocates for an anti-diet approach, arguing that restricting food can be harmful and that pathologizing body size creates toxic relationships with food. She suggests that instead of focusing on eliminating processed foods or obsessing over weight, the focus should be on ensuring all children have access to enough food and are empowered with bodily autonomy. The real issues, she contends, are systemic problems like poverty and food insecurity, not individual food choices.</p>

The court overturned an injunction that had blocked the use of The Bell Hotel in Epping for this purpose, a case seen as a potential precedent. However, councils like West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne argue that the use of these hotels constitutes a planning law breach and places an unsustainable strain on local services. The government has committed to ending the use of asylum hotels by 2029, but the ongoing legal battles reflect persistent local tensions.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the Trump administration is increasingly intervening in corporate America, a departure from the traditional Republican stance on free-market capitalism. The article cites several examples, such as securing a "golden share" in U.S. Steel, converting grants to Intel into a government stake, and brokering a deal for a cut of Nvidia's sales in China. These actions, along with challenges to the Federal Reserve's independence, are described as "Trumpalism," an ideology based on the president's personal power and leverage rather than consistent economic principles. This approach has drawn criticism from some conservatives for resembling socialist policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>U.S. Drug Overdose Deaths Decline Significantly, Reaching a Five-Year Low</h2>

          <p>Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a steady and dramatic decline in fatal drug overdoses in the U.S., falling to their lowest level since March 2020. The figures indicate that deaths dropped to 77,648 in the 12-month period ending in March 2025, a decrease of roughly one-third from the peak in 2023. Despite this positive trend, President Trump has continued to frame the fentanyl crisis as a growing threat to justify policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Public health experts credit the decline to improved healthcare access and disruptions in fentanyl supply chains.</p>

          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering or reinforcing military conscription in response to a changing security landscape. Germany, which ended compulsory service in 2011, is introducing a "new military service" model that starts voluntarily but includes the potential for mandatory conscription. Meanwhile, nations like Sweden have already reinstated the draft, and others such as Poland are significantly expanding their armed forces through professional and territorial defense units. This trend reflects a broader shift across the continent, with countries from France to Latvia bolstering their military readiness through various forms of mandatory and voluntary service and an increased focus on reservists.</p>

          <p>At least three people were killed after a mob set fire to a regional parliament building in Makassar, the capital of Indonesia's South Sulawesi province. The incident is part of a wave of violent protests that have erupted across Indonesia, fueled by public anger over a new housing allowance for lawmakers and the recent death of a ride-hailing driver during a demonstration in Jakarta. Protests have occurred in multiple cities, with demonstrators clashing with security forces, destroying property, and storming government buildings. Human rights groups have criticized the government's forceful crackdown on the protests.</p>

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated in a televised interview that while Iran does not seek conflict, it is prepared to respond "forcefully" to any attack from the United States or Israel. He accused the two nations of seeking to divide and destroy Iran but asserted that the country remains firm against its enemies. Pezeshkian also addressed the recent move by the UK, France, and Germany to potentially reimpose UN sanctions over Iran's nuclear program. He described the European claims of non-compliance as "legally baseless" and said Iran is working to prevent the activation of the "snapback" sanctions mechanism.</p>

          <p>Despite another quarter of blockbuster financial results from AI chipmaker Nvidia, its stock recently dipped, signaling growing investor uncertainty about the artificial intelligence bubble. While the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies have propped up the stock market, a new MIT survey found that 95% of companies experimenting with AI are not yet seeing revenue from it. This suggests the massive investments in AI have yet to yield widespread practical returns. The situation is compounded by political pressures, including a Trump administration deal for a cut of Nvidia's sales in China, raising concerns about government intervention in the market.

Cody and Liam Townend had entrusted Amie Upton with the funeral arrangements for their daughter, Macie-Mae, but found her body at Ms. Upton's residence instead of the funeral parlor. This follows a BBC report that Ms. Upton was banned from Leeds hospitals for keeping the bodies of babies at her home.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent ruling from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has dealt a legal blow to President Trump's trade policies. The court upheld a lower panel's judgment that the president does not have the authority to unilaterally alter America's tariff schedules without congressional approval. This decision challenges the legal foundation of some of the administration's key tariff actions, which have been a central component of its economic strategy. The ruling creates a significant legal challenge for the administration and is likely to set up a future confrontation on the matter at the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A global push for stronger online safety regulations, such as the U.K.'s Online Safety Act and the proposed Kids Online Safety Act in the U.S., is spurring the growth of AI-powered safety technology. These laws impose a duty of care on tech companies to protect children from harmful and age-inappropriate content. In response, companies like Yoti are developing AI facial analysis for age verification, which is being adopted by platforms from Pornhub to Spotify.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has blocked Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly by revoking their visas. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to their actions undermining peace efforts and seeking unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. The move is unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters, and it has been criticized by the Palestinian Authority as a violation of international law. The ban comes as some European nations are leading efforts to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN.</p>

          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers following a contentious contract stalemate that he described as the "hardest four months" of his life. The Packers acquired Parsons in exchange for two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark, subsequently making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history with a four-year, $188 million contract. Parsons expressed his excitement for a fresh start with the historic franchise, where he aims to build a legacy comparable to Packers legends like Reggie White.
