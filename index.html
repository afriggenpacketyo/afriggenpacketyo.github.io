          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two people and injuries to at least 19 others. The ship, carrying 277 people, lost power before the crash, causing its masts to smash against the bridge's underside, according to Mayor Eric Adams. The New York City Department of Transportation reported no structural damage to the bridge, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the mechanical issues that led to the incident, which occurred as the ship was departing for Iceland.</p>

          <p>Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, describing the move as "theft" and a betrayal of artists. He argued that allowing AI firms to use artists' content without payment would rob young people of their legacy and income, warning that artists lack the resources to fight big tech firms. The government maintains that no changes to copyright laws will be considered unless they work for creators, while Sir Paul McCartney has voiced concerns about AI creating a "Wild West" where artists' copyright is unprotected.</p>

          <p>Casey Michel discusses the Trump family's various business deals and financial arrangements with foreign entities, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and corruption. The article highlights the Trump Organization's activities in Saudi Arabia, a new cryptocurrency business deal with a fund backed by Abu Dhabi, and Jared Kushner's firm receiving investments from foreign autocrats. Michel argues that the Trump family's actions are part of a broader pattern of American politicians profiting from foreign influence, citing the Clinton Foundation as another example of an organization that accepted funds from foreign regimes. The article calls for stricter regulations to prevent former politicians and their families from engaging in foreign lobbying and deals.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the revitalized sleeper train network in Europe with the declining state of long-distance public transport in the United States. He notes that Europe is investing in nocturnal routes to compete with short-haul flights and reduce carbon emissions, while the U.S. is slashing funding for public infrastructure and transit workers. The article argues that America's car-centric culture has led to congested roads and a decline in happiness, while Europe's commitment to rail infrastructure fosters community and connection. Richards advocates for revitalized railways in the U.S. to offer an alternative to gas-guzzling cars and planes.</p>

Dean Henderson's penalty save further secured the win for Palace.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was caused by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil from parched farmland. Visibility dropped dramatically in Chicago, creating hazardous conditions. Similar dust storms have occurred in the past, including a deadly 2023 incident involving a 72-vehicle pileup. Experts attribute the severity of the storm to exceptionally dry soil conditions in the region.</p>

An analysis suggests millions could lose coverage by 2034, prompting worries about access to essential services. While some Republicans argue the cuts target fraud and abuse, those dependent on Medicaid fear reduced care or having to choose between healthcare and basic needs.

          <p>CBS's "48 Hours" featured the case of Jeanie Childs, a Minneapolis woman murdered in 1993, where a bloody, bare footprint became a pivotal clue. Despite the violent scene, investigators focused on the footprint and other evidence, eventually using genetic genealogy to identify Jerry Westrom as a suspect. The episode explored the challenges of the case, including the lack of a murder weapon and the presence of other DNA at the scene, ultimately leading to Westrom's conviction based on the footprint evidence and his DNA.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for warning that his tariffs would force the retailer to raise prices, insisting the company should absorb the costs instead. Trump, campaigning on preventing inflation, urged Walmart to "EAT THE TARIFFS" and keep prices down. Walmart, however, maintained that it would do its best to keep prices low but would not be able to absorb all the pressure imposed by the tariffs. Economists note that businesses must choose between raising prices and laying off workers, signaling potential economic challenges.</p>

          <p>The murder of Jeanie Childs in 1993 remained unsolved for decades until a bloody footprint at the crime scene led to a breakthrough. The case was reopened in 2015, and forensic testing revealed an unknown DNA profile. Investigative genetic genealogy identified Jerry Westrom as a potential match. Westrom was convicted based on the DNA evidence and the footprint, despite his denial of involvement. The article emphasizes the significance of the footprint and the challenges faced by investigators.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes swept across the U.S. Midwest and South, causing at least 26 deaths, with Kentucky being particularly hard-hit.

The Homeland Security Secretary offered federal resources to the affected states.

          <p>The government is considering plans to have convicted criminals fill potholes and clean bins as part of an expanded unpaid work program. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood believes current punishments are too lenient and wants to partner with councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. The offenders would not be paid, but the money earned would go into a fund for victim's groups. The proposal aims to address prison overcrowding and ensure punishment is more than just a slap on the wrist.</p>

          <p>A local government in China has detailed the punishment given to a 20-year-old man who refused to serve in the military, aiming to deter potential service dodgers.

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, placed 19th out of 26, despite strong vocals and positive attention from former winner Conchita Wurst. The song, "What the Hell Just Happened," was criticized for being a manic mish-mash of musical styles. While the staging was energetic, it lacked the scale and drama of other performances. Despite the disappointing result, there is optimism for the future, with a focus on maintaining strong vocals and energetic performances, and finding a way to get the public vote back on side.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched a new military operation in the Gaza Strip, dubbed "Operation Gideon Chariots," to pressure Hamas to release remaining hostages. The operation follows days of intensive strikes and comes as U.S. President Trump concluded his Middle East trip without visiting Israel. Meanwhile, Qatari and Egyptian-led negotiations to broker a ceasefire are underway in Doha, with renewed efforts to reach a deal that would release the remaining hostages and end the three-month Israeli blockade in Gaza. The humanitarian crisis continues with warnings of starvation and dwindling supplies.</p>

They aim to push for policies such as reducing immigration and mass deportations. A Reform spokesman stated that the far-right would never be welcome in the party and that a stringent vetting process was in place.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and those with high-risk medical conditions. The approval requires Novavax to complete studies on heart conditions, potentially costing the company millions. Experts express disappointment, citing concerns about limiting access to the vaccine for healthy individuals under 65 and questioning the influence of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s skepticism towards vaccines. The decision marks a shift from previous COVID-19 vaccine approvals, sparking controversy.</p>
