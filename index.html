          <p>With the government shutdown halting the official jobs report, investment firm Carlyle released its own analysis showing minimal employment growth in September. The firm's proprietary data indicated a gain of only 17,000 jobs, which aligns with other private-sector reports suggesting a significant hiring slowdown. Despite the weak employment figures, Carlyle's data also pointed to some economic bright spots, including a 2.7% annualized GDP growth pace and accelerated business investment. This alternative data provides a crucial, albeit grim, snapshot of the labor market during the government's data blackout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A number of self-employed and franchised drivers for the delivery company DPD have started a three-day work refusal in protest of payment cuts. The dispute centers on DPD's decision to reduce the rate for small parcel deliveries by 65p, a change some drivers claim could cost them thousands of pounds annually. DPD stated it does not anticipate significant service disruptions and has increased rates for larger parcels to offset the change. The drivers, however, argue that the volume of larger parcels is insufficient to compensate for the income loss from the more common smaller deliveries.</p>

Somber memorial events are taking place across the country, including at the site of the Nova music festival, overshadowed by the sounds of the continuing war in Gaza. The anniversary highlights deep national divisions over the government's handling of the conflict and the fate of the 48 hostages still believed to be held captive. The war, sparked by the attack, has led to over 66,000 deaths in Gaza, according to its health ministry.</p>

          <p>Alternative asset manager Ares Management has raised its three-year fundraising targets by 25%, attributing the increase to strong momentum from individual wealthy investors. CEO Michael Arougheti noted a significant shift, with retail investors expected to drive more than half of private market flows in the coming years. The firm, which already manages over $50 billion from retail-focused vehicles, is expanding its dedicated teams to service this growing client base. Arougheti pushed back against concerns that retail investors receive weaker deals, stating that investments are allocated based on available capital across both institutional and wealth platforms.

          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham has been convicted of stalking television and radio presenter Myleene Klass and her colleague Katie Breathwick over a four-year period. The man, Peter Windsor, sent numerous unwanted and disturbing items to the Classic FM studios, including a gun, handcuffs, and a police uniform. During the trial, Ms. Klass described her "sheer terror" upon learning the extent of the stalking campaign, which caused serious alarm and distress.

          <p>Modelo beer owner Constellation Brands reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Despite the positive quarterly results, the company reiterated its previously lowered full-year guidance, citing a challenging macroeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand. The company noted that its operating margin fell partly due to aluminum tariffs and continues to see concern among consumers about the socioeconomic climate. The reiterated forecast projects a 4% to 6% decline in organic net sales for the fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A controversial, state-run immigration jail in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," has resumed operations after an appeals court paused a lower court's closure order. The facility, known for allegations of inhumane conditions, was initially ordered to shut down after a judge ruled its construction violated federal environmental laws. However, two Trump-appointed judges allowed the camp to remain open, and it has reportedly "roared back into action," with buses of detainees arriving. Activists and attorneys express alarm, claiming the facility operates like a "black site" where detainees are held incommunicado or transferred without notice.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle maker Rivian is preparing to launch its next-generation vehicles, the smaller R2 SUV and R3 hatchback, as it aims to reach a broader market. The R2 is expected to start around $45,000 and will initially be produced at the company's Illinois facility before scaling up at a new $5 billion plant in Georgia. Chief Design Officer Jeff Hammoud explains that designing these more affordable models required a "subtraction" approach, removing features while retaining the brand's adventurous ethos. The article explores Rivian's design philosophy, including the origin of its controversial but now iconic "stadium" headlights.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, received an early-stage diagnosis after persistently requesting early screening options from her doctors. Although an initial mammogram was clear, a subsequent breast MRI, recommended by a high-risk clinic, detected two suspicious masses that were confirmed to be cancerous. Her case highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as breast cancer is rising in women under 50. Because the cancer was caught early, her prognosis is excellent, and her oncologist credits her proactive approach with preventing a much worse outcome.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Energy Minister announced that the country plans to boost its natural gas imports by 30% and is in discussions with G7 nations for support. The move is necessary due to "significant" damage to Ukraine's domestic gas production capacity caused by Russian airstrikes targeting energy infrastructure. Kyiv is also considering increasing its liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports to meet its needs. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is awaiting clarity from the U.S. regarding the potential supply of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, a move it warns would represent a "serious round of escalation."</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed skepticism about a new voluntary military service model, suggesting that a return to some form of conscription may be necessary. Germany suspended mandatory military service in 2011 but is now seeking to expand its armed forces to 260,000 soldiers by the early 2030s in response to new NATO commitments and the threat from Russia. The current government plan involves incentives for volunteers and a mandatory questionnaire for 18-year-old men. Merz's comments have postponed a parliamentary debate and highlighted a divide within the ruling coalition on the issue.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, analysts suggest that the upcoming October 15th pay date for 1.3 million active-duty military members could be a critical event forcing a political compromise. The prospect of missing this payment could generate significant public and political pressure on both parties to pass at least a temporary funding bill. While prediction markets indicate high odds of the shutdown continuing past this date, some experts believe it is the most significant forcing event on the calendar. Without a resolution, other services, from airport security to benefit programs, also face increasing disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

He described the situation as an "ongoing massacre" and lamented that the international community has been powerless to stop it.

          <p>Recent political upheaval in France, including the brief tenure and resignation of Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu, has unsettled financial markets and raised alarms about the country's economic stability. France holds the largest sovereign debt in the EU in absolute terms, at around 113% of its GDP, and runs the largest budget deficit. The political deadlock over how to implement necessary spending cuts has caused French borrowing costs to rise, with investors demanding higher risk premiums.

          <p>A new study in Uganda has found that treating baby wraps with insecticide can significantly reduce malaria infections in young children. Inspired by the U.S. military's practice of treating uniforms, researchers provided mothers with permethrin-soaked wraps for carrying their babies. The trial showed a remarkable 65% reduction in malaria cases among children using the treated wraps compared to a control group. This simple, low-cost intervention could provide crucial protection for children when they are not under a bed net, offering a promising new tool in the fight against a disease that kills a child under five nearly every minute.</p>

The rapid growth of solar and wind power was sufficient to meet all new global electricity demand, leading to a slight decrease in fossil fuel use. However, the report reveals a divided picture, with developing nations like China and India driving the clean energy expansion, while the US and EU saw an increased reliance on fossil fuels.

          <p>The phrase "heritage American" is being increasingly used in right-wing circles to define a specific vision of American identity, often tied to having ancestors in the country before a certain time, such as the Civil War. Proponents argue that America is defined by a specific people with an "Anglo-Protestant spirit," not by abstract ideals, and that changing the people changes the culture. Critics view the term as a nativist dog whistle, a more palatable way of saying "white" that creates a hierarchy of belonging and could be used to justify restrictive immigration policies or even the deportation of non-white citizens.</p>
