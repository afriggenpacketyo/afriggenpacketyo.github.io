          <p>The UK government will not make immediate changes to the £20,000 tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), according to a BBC report. Chancellor Rachel Reeves had been expected to announce a reduction to encourage more investment in stocks and shares. A Treasury spokesperson stated the government's ambition remains to ensure savings deliver better returns and drive UK investment. Discussions with financial institutions about potential reforms are expected to continue, but for now, the existing rules for tax-free savings will remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Pakistan's Balochistan province, gunmen ambushed two passenger buses, singling out and killing nine individuals of Punjabi ethnicity. The assailants reportedly stopped the buses, checked passengers' identification cards, and abducted ten people before the bodies of nine were discovered in the nearby mountains. While no group has officially claimed responsibility, President Asif Ali Zardari has blamed the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), an insurgent group seeking independence. This attack is part of a pattern of ethnic violence targeting Punjabis in the mineral-rich region.</p>

          <p>After eight months of peaceful demonstrations, Serbia's anti-government protest movement has escalated, with activists threatening widespread civil disobedience if snap parliamentary elections are not called. Recent protests in Belgrade led to violent clashes with police, who used tear gas and batons, resulting in hundreds of arrests and numerous injuries. Student protesters have adopted new tactics, such as relocating blockades to outsmart authorities. Despite the growing unrest and pressure, President Aleksandar Vucic has categorically rejected the demand for early elections, creating a tense political standoff.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of contraction and defying analyst expectations of slight growth. The Office for National Statistics attributed the decline primarily to a drop in manufacturing, particularly in car-making and pharmaceuticals, alongside weak retail sales. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the figures as "disappointing" but affirmed her determination to stimulate growth. The continuing economic weakness presents significant challenges for the government's fiscal plans amid high inflation and interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ordered a resentencing for Kaulana Alo-Kaonohi, a Native Hawaiian man convicted of a hate crime, which could result in a longer prison term. Alo-Kaonohi and another man were found guilty of a racially motivated attack on a white man, Christopher Kunzelman, in Maui in 2014. Prosecutors successfully appealed the initial sentence, arguing the judge improperly failed to apply a hate crime enhancement. The case centered on the use of the word "haole," which the victim testified was used derogatorily, while the defense argued it was not a racial slur.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis suggests UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are both struggling against rising populist movements that challenge their calls for patience and pragmatic politics. Both leaders are behind in opinion polls and face anti-establishment rivals, Reform UK and National Rally, who resonate with a disillusioned public. At a recent joint news conference, Starmer and Macron implicitly argued against the "politics of easy answers" offered by their opponents. The analysis highlights the challenge for mainstream leaders to deliver results and regain public trust in an era of impatience.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a renowned professor and IVF pioneer, has resigned from the British Medical Association (BMA) in protest of planned strikes by resident doctors. The 84-year-old Labour peer, a BMA member since 1964, argued that the five-day walkout over pay is ill-timed and could erode public trust in the medical profession. The BMA is in a dispute with the government, stating that real-terms pay is still 20% lower than in 2008 despite recent increases. Lord Winston urged doctors to consider their responsibility to vulnerable patients.</p>

          <p>Research from Princeton University indicates that threats and harassment against local school officials in the U.S. have increased by 170% since the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that initial anger over mask mandates evolved into conflicts over cultural issues, such as LGBTQ+ policies and diversity initiatives, affecting officials across the political spectrum. Many school board members report being targeted by vitriolic messages and false narratives spread on social media. This hostile environment is raising concerns that it could drive dedicated public servants out of their roles.</p>

          <p>In a major environmental restoration effort, China has blown up approximately 300 dams and closed numerous small hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the Yangtze. This action aims to save the habitats of rare and endemic fish species that have been severely impacted by the dense network of dams. For decades, these structures have blocked water flow, restricted migration routes for fish, and reduced suitable spawning grounds. The project is seen as a critical step to preserve the last refuge for many unique aquatic species in the upper Yangtze basin.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin laying off staff, aiming to reduce its domestic workforce by approximately 15% as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The cuts will affect roughly 1,800 U.S.-based positions through layoffs and voluntary departures, with dozens of offices being closed or merged. Officials state the goal is to streamline a "bloated bureaucracy" and focus on diplomatic priorities.

          <p>A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has found that Britain's F-35 stealth jet program is being undermined by delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages, impacting the UK's warfighting capability. Despite the F-35's technological superiority, the NAO described the return on the £11 billion spent so far as "disappointing." The report also estimated the final cost to expand the fleet could be over three times the Ministry of Defence's initial forecast. The MoD responded that the program is within budget and that two full squadrons will be deployable by year's end.</p>
