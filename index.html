          <p>India and the European Union are actively progressing towards finalizing a free trade agreement by the end of the year, driven by mutual economic opportunities and global trade pressures, including US tariffs on India. This strategic partnership aims to diversify supply chains, reduce India's dependency on volatile markets, and enhance the EU's geopolitical standing in the Indo-Pacific. Negotiations still face challenges regarding tariff reductions on specific goods and the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, but political engagement signals a strong commitment to a breakthrough. The agreement is seen as crucial for both economies amidst shifting global dynamics.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that President Trump's willingness to ban TikTok in the U.S. was the crucial factor in China agreeing to a deal framework for the app's U.S. operations. Bessent explained that commercial terms had been established months prior, but China only advanced after Trump's strong tariff announcement, signaling a shift in leverage. The administration emphasizes national security as paramount, even as the White House maintains its own TikTok account, reflecting a complex approach to the platform's future. The September 17th divestment deadline looms, though an extension is possible, as negotiations continue to unfold.</p>

          <p>Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS), the student wing of Bangladesh's largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, secured major victories in recent student council elections at two prominent public universities. These polls mark the first elections since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose government had previously banned the party under anti-terrorism laws. The interim administration has since revoked the ban, allowing Islamists to re-enter the political scene and contest elections. This article notes that these results are seen as a potential indicator of shifting public sentiment, particularly among youth, ahead of the February 2026 national elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge has dismissed two terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, ruling that prosecutors did not provide enough evidence to justify them. The judge stated that Mangione's actions and writings did not meet the state's legal definition of terrorism, which requires intent to put political pressure on the government or terrorize the general population. While the first-degree murder charge was dismissed, a second-degree murder charge will stand, potentially leading to a minimum sentence of 15 to 25 years. Mangione also faces federal murder charges, which could carry the death penalty.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent expert team, commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council, has concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, urging the international community to intervene and hold those responsible accountable. The report, based on a painstaking legal analysis of actions and intent, asserts that Israel has met four of the five "genocidal acts" defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention. Israel's Foreign Ministry vehemently rejected the findings, calling the report "distorted and false" and accusing the commission of anti-Israel bias. The deeply documented findings could potentially be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court, highlighting severe international condemnation.</p>

          <p>Accelerating inflation, partly fueled by President Trump's sweeping import tariffs, is deepening the economic divide between wealthy and lower-income Americans, according to recent data.

Lower-income households are disproportionately affected as they spend a larger share of their budget on tariff-exposed imports, exacerbating financial strain.

          <p>Spain experienced its hottest summer on record in 2025, with an average temperature of 24.2C, surpassing the previous high set in 2022 and marking the highest figure since records began in 1961. This article from AEMET, the national meteorological agency, confirms a clear and concerning trend towards much hotter summers, with no heatwave-free summer since 2014. The extreme temperatures, reaching 46C in some areas, fueled devastating wildfires that killed four people and contributed to over 1,100 deaths, primarily among the elderly. The country endured three intense heatwaves spanning 36 days, highlighting the severe impact of manmade climate change.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. comedians, including Dave Chappelle and Kevin Hart, are slated to perform at the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia, prompting Human Rights Watch to urge them not to "cover up the abuses of a repressive regime." Critics view these high-profile entertainment events as part of Saudi Arabia's "sportswashing" or "whitewashing" strategy, aiming to distract from its severe human rights record, including recent executions. This article highlights concerns that performers might be restricted from criticizing the Saudi royal family or its policies. Comedians are called upon to use their platform to speak out against abuses, despite reports of substantial appearance fees.</p>

While some affluent consumers benefit from market highs, many Americans face financial stress, leading to higher credit card balances and delinquencies.
