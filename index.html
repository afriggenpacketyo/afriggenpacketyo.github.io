          <p>After a militant attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, India launched strikes against Pakistan, targeting what it called terrorist infrastructure. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of war, reporting civilian casualties and vowing retaliation. The strikes and counter-strikes have heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations, prompting international calls for de-escalation. This New York Times article reports that India suggested Pakistan was behind the April 22 attack in Kashmir, and that Pakistan has repeatedly denied that claim.</p>
