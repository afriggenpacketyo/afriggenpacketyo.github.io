Andrew Feltwell caught the ball and gave it to his son, Lincoln, as a birthday gift, only to be accosted by a woman who claimed he took it from her. Although Feltwell ultimately gave the ball to the woman to de-escalate the situation, both the Phillies and the opposing Miami Marlins provided the young fan with gifts, including a signed bat. The incident sparked a discussion about fan etiquette at sporting events.</p>

          <p>Following the collapse of the French government, economists are expressing concern over France's significant public debt, which stands at approximately €3.35 trillion or 113% of its GDP. The political deadlock makes implementing necessary budget cuts politically untenable, leading to higher risk premiums on French bonds and fears of fiscal instability. While a short-term crisis is not imminent, experts warn that prolonged political destabilization in the eurozone's second-largest economy could threaten the stability of the single currency. The situation is complicated by stalled reforms and the rise of populist parties on both the left and right. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted an interim request from the Trump administration, allowing for the removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Kelly Slaughter for the time being. The decision puts a hold on a lower court's order that had required her reinstatement. Slaughter sued after being fired in March, arguing her removal violated the for-cause protections stipulated in the Federal Trade Commission Act. The administration contends that the modern FTC wields significant executive power, challenging a 1935 Supreme Court precedent that upheld such removal restrictions for independent, multi-member commissions.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has expressed regret after shoving a fan during a game against the Buffalo Bills. The incident occurred after Jackson and teammate DeAndre Hopkins were celebrating a touchdown near the stands, and a fan slapped both of their helmets. Jackson admitted he let his emotions get the better of him and should have let security handle the situation, which resulted in the fan's ejection. Despite the altercation, the Ravens ultimately lost the game 41-40 after squandering a significant lead in the final minutes of play.</p>

Zarutska was fatally stabbed on a Charlotte train in a seemingly random attack, and graphic surveillance footage of the incident was recently released. In his statement, Stein called the murder a "senseless act of violence" and advocated for more funding to hire police officers to enhance public safety. Critics, however, argued that the issue was not a lack of arrests, pointing out that the suspect had been arrested numerous times previously and released.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister François Bayrou was ousted after losing a confidence vote, plunging the country into further political instability just nine months into his tenure. The crisis stems from President Emmanuel Macron's 2024 snap election gamble, which resulted in a hung parliament and made governing exceptionally difficult. Bayrou's government fell over its proposal for €44 billion in budget cuts to address France's soaring public debt, which is the third-highest in the eurozone. Macron must now either appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years or risk calling another election that could yield an even more fragmented result.</p>

Despite the record price, some financial analysts believe there is still room for growth, with institutions like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan forecasting further increases into 2026. The potential for lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve could also make non-yielding assets like gold more attractive to investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration argues that the injunction poses a threat to the separation of powers and prevents the executive branch from aligning spending with its foreign policy objectives.

Former deputy leader Baroness Harriet Harman has argued that the role should be filled by a woman from outside of London to broaden the leadership's reach and complement the party leader. The contest was triggered by Rayner's departure after an investigation found she breached the ministerial code. Nominations open this week, with candidates needing the support of at least 80 MPs to proceed, a high threshold that some on the party's left believe will narrow the field of potential contenders.</p>

          <p>European stock markets closed higher on Monday, with investors closely watching the political developments in France, where Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was expected to lose a confidence vote. France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX both saw gains of over 0.75%, with retail stocks leading the upward trend across the continent. The focus in France is on the government's struggle to pass significant budget cuts, a situation that could lead to President Macron appointing a fifth prime minister in less than two years. U.S. markets were also higher ahead of key inflation reports expected later in the week.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously upheld the $83.3 million judgment against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court rejected Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he should be protected by presidential immunity. The ruling affirmed that the jury's award was "fair and reasonable" given the evidence of the reputational and personal harm Carroll suffered due to Trump's repeated denials of her sexual assault allegation. Carroll's legal team expressed satisfaction with the decision, stating they look forward to justice finally being served.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume broad immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area by freezing a lower court's restraining order. The 6-3 decision lifts restrictions that had prevented federal agents from stopping individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation without reasonable suspicion. The Justice Department argued the injunction hampered their ability to enforce immigration laws. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the ruling was a "grave misuse" of the court's emergency docket and subjected people to indignities based on their appearance.</p>

          <p>A survey by the New York Federal Reserve has revealed that American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to a record low. The August Survey of Consumer Expectations showed a perceived probability of just 44.9% of finding new employment after a job loss, the lowest since the survey began in 2013. This data reflects a significant shift from the "Great Resignation" period, as a cooling labor market with slower hiring has led more workers to stay in their current positions. The report follows recent data showing weak job creation and a rising unemployment rate.</p>

Routh has pleaded not guilty to five criminal charges, including attempting to kill a presidential candidate, which could result in a life sentence.

Federal borrowers may be eligible for income-driven repayment plans, which can lower monthly payments significantly, sometimes to zero, based on current income including unemployment benefits. Other options include an Unemployment Deferment or an Economic Hardship Deferment, which can temporarily pause payments, though interest may still accrue on some loans. Those with private student loans have fewer standard options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to discuss potential assistance programs available to them.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals a significant ideological divide within the U.S., particularly among Democrats, who now view socialism more positively than capitalism. The survey found that 66% of Democrats have a favorable opinion of socialism, compared to only 42% for capitalism. This marks a persistent shift over the last 15 years, driven largely by Democrats under 50 who have become much less positive about capitalism. While U.S. adults overall still favor capitalism, its image has declined since 2021, reflecting growing concerns about economic fairness and the perception of big business.</p>
