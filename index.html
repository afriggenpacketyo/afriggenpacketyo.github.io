          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and other federal agencies to cease funding for NPR and PBS, alleging bias in their reporting. The order aims to eliminate both direct and indirect funding sources for the news organizations, which receive a significant portion of their funding from the CPB, a federal agency, as well as private donations. The White House claims that NPR and PBS use taxpayer dollars to spread left-wing propaganda. The CPB is a private corporation formed in 1967 that supports hundreds of public media organizations, including radio and TV stations.</p>

          <p>China has announced it is considering U.S. overtures to begin trade negotiations, which could potentially lead to resolving the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies. Senior U.S. officials have reportedly reached out multiple times to initiate talks, but China has reiterated its demand for the U.S. to remove all unilateral tariffs as a prerequisite for negotiations. Analysts caution that reaching a comprehensive deal will be complex and time-consuming, citing President Trump's unpredictability as a major challenge. The substance of any talks would depend on both sides' strategic priorities and economic red lines, with little appetite for compromise currently visible.</p>

Vance emphasized that it is up to Russia and Ukraine to reach an agreement to end the brutal conflict.

The study aims to determine the impact of the debris on the sport fish population by comparing current data with surveys from the last 30 years. Researchers are examining fish for defects, measuring, and weighing them before releasing them back into the water. The cleanup on Douglas Lake is about 90% complete, with over 112,000 cubic yards of debris removed.</p>

The vote, largely along party lines, marks the first time Congress has moved to weaken the Clean Air Act. Republican lawmakers argue the rule disincentivizes companies from deploying new technology to reduce pollution, while environmental groups contend the move will allow industrial polluters to release toxic air pollutants linked to cancer and other health issues. The resolution now goes to the House for consideration.</p>

          <p>Japan's average unemployment rate in fiscal year 2024 fell to 2.5 percent, marking the first improvement in two years amid a labor shortage. The number of unemployed people decreased, while the number of those with jobs grew to the highest level since 1953. Despite a slight dip in job openings data, the labor market remains tight, with more jobs available than job seekers. Economists predict this labor shortage will persist.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio now holds four government positions: Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of USAID, Acting Archivist for the National Archives, and Interim National Security Advisor.

The appointment followed the ousting of Mike Waltz as National Security Advisor. Critics point out potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the archivist's role in ensuring record preservation within agencies Rubio also leads.</p>

          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and will nominate him as ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz while continuing as America's top diplomat. Waltz faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed. Sources indicate that Trump decided to nominate Waltz as UN ambassador just hours before the announcement.</p>

CEO Andy Jassy stated that Amazon is focused on maintaining low prices by purchasing extra inventory in advance of tariffs. Investors are closely monitoring how President Trump's tariffs will affect Amazon customers, with some speculating about accelerated purchases ahead of potential tariff increases.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the removal of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan immigrants. This action challenges a lower court ruling that blocked the administration's plan to end the protections, affecting hundreds of thousands of people.
