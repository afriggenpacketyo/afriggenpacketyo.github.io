        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated he feels "politically homeless," asserting the Democratic party no longer champions a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. In a July 4th social media post, he advocated for "techno-capitalism," a belief system that encourages wealth creation while also ensuring its wide distribution. Altman criticized a recent shift in the party's focus, suggesting they have moved away from policies that raise both the economic floor and ceiling. His comments were partly a response to a New York City mayoral candidate's statement that billionaires should not exist.</p>

          <p>Famed competitive eater Joey “Jaws” Chestnut is set to return to the Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, aiming for his 17th title. Chestnut was absent from last year's event due to a contractual dispute involving a partnership with a plant-based food company, but he has since resolved the issue. In the women's competition, defending champion Miki Sudo secured her 11th title by consuming 33 hot dogs and buns. The annual event, a celebrated tradition held at Coney Island, draws large crowds and international competitors.</p>

          <p>Former Arsenal player Thomas Partey has been formally charged with five counts of sexual assault against two women and an additional count of sexual assault involving a third woman. The alleged offenses occurred between 2021 and 2022, and the charges follow a lengthy investigation by London's Metropolitan Police that began in February 2022. Through his lawyer, the 32-year-old Ghanaian international has denied all charges and stated he welcomes the opportunity to clear his name.

          <p>The seven-year custody sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for the manslaughter of 80-year-old Bhim Kohli is being referred to the Court of Appeal for being potentially too lenient. Mr. Kohli was racially abused and fatally attacked in a Leicestershire park while walking his dog, suffering broken ribs and a fatal spinal cord injury. The Attorney General's Office confirmed the review under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme after the victim's family expressed disappointment with the initial punishment. A 13-year-old girl who filmed the attack received a youth rehabilitation order, which is not being reviewed.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old man has been sentenced to a nine-year hybrid order for using the internet to encourage a vulnerable woman to end her life for his own sexual gratification. Tyler Webb became the first person convicted under a new provision of the UK's Online Safety Act after the victim bravely reported his actions to the police. The court heard how Webb met the woman on a mental health forum and then instructed her on how to harm herself via a messaging app. The judge's order means Webb will be detained in a mental health facility before serving any remaining time in prison.</p>

          <p>The recently announced US-Vietnam trade deal, which includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on products transshipped through Vietnam, has sparked questions about its implementation.

The pact is seen as a direct effort to counter Chinese manufacturers who have been rerouting goods through Vietnam to evade hefty US tariffs.

          <p>Chinese state media has called for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys, a market dominated by the popular company Pop Mart, raising concerns about addiction among young consumers. However, analysts believe Pop Mart will be largely unaffected, as its primary demographic consists of young adults with purchasing power, not the children targeted by the proposed rules. The company's significant and growing overseas revenue, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, further insulates it from potential domestic regulatory pressures. Pop Mart also faces challenges from scalpers, counterfeits, and production delays.</p>

While the Taliban hailed the decision as a "historic step," critics and former Afghan officials condemned it, pointing to the regime's severe restrictions on women's rights and education.

The piece serves as a historical cautionary tale, suggesting that deploying troops on home soil can provoke fear, anger, and unpredictable escalation.

          <p>British tennis player Sonay Kartal has reached the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time after a commanding 6-4, 6-2 victory over France's Diane Parry. After a nervous start on Court One, the 23-year-old rallied to win nine consecutive games, showcasing powerful serving and shot-making. Kartal's impressive run marks a significant milestone in her career, having been ranked outside the world's top 800 just three years ago. She is now the fourth unseeded British woman to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon this century.</p>

          <p>Researchers have unearthed what they describe as a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals in Germany. The analysis of thousands of bone fragments and tools suggests that these early humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them to extract nutrient-rich marrow and fat. This discovery provides further evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than once believed, demonstrating advanced planning, organizational skills, and a deep understanding of nutrition. The practice likely helped them avoid protein poisoning by supplementing their lean meat diet with essential fats.</p>

          <p>After 42 years, a man has been indicted for the murder of his former girlfriend, whose disappearance had been a cold case since 1983. Mark Sanfratello, 72, was charged after advances in DNA technology allowed investigators to identify a human skull found in 1997 as belonging to 27-year-old Teresa Peroni. Peroni was last seen with Sanfratello at a party in Selma, Oregon, before she vanished. Although her disappearance was deemed suspicious at the time, a lack of evidence prevented charges until this recent breakthrough.</p>

          <p>In response to recent US and Israeli airstrikes on its nuclear facilities, Iran has announced it is suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The move raises significant concerns about international oversight of Iran's nuclear activities, which the IAEA had already warned were approaching weapons-grade levels. This decision heightens geopolitical tensions and stirs debate within Iran about the value of remaining in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). It remains unclear how the suspension will affect IAEA inspectors currently in the country.</p>

          <p>Following his feud with President Trump over a major spending bill, Elon Musk has renewed his threat to create a new political party, but experts say the endeavor is exceptionally difficult. Launching a national third party would require navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased towards the Democratic and Republican parties. The process would also likely involve costly and time-consuming legal battles against challenges from the established parties. While Musk's immense wealth could fund the effort, building a viable national party is considered a multi-year project.</p>

          <p>The United Nations human rights agency has criticized Germany's proposal to resume deportations to Afghanistan, stating that conditions in the country are not appropriate for returns. A UN spokesperson cited ongoing and documented human rights violations under Taliban rule as the primary reason for their concern. The statement came after Germany's interior minister expressed openness to making direct agreements with the Taliban to facilitate deportations. Germany had officially stopped deportations to Afghanistan in 2021 when the Taliban retook control of the country.</p>

          <p>A new peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, brokered by the United States, has been met with skepticism despite being hailed as a milestone. The deal aims to end hostilities in eastern Congo and neutralize armed groups, but observers and local actors express concern over its implementation and inclusivity. The M23 rebel group, a key player in the conflict, has already rejected the deal's binding nature, criticizing it as limited. While the agreement also outlines a path for economic cooperation, its success hinges on the commitment of all parties in a historically volatile region.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to NASA are an "extinction-level event" for American space science, threatening the nation's ability to search for alien life. The author highlights that the nearly 50% slash to the Science Mission Directorate jeopardizes future projects like the Habitable Worlds Observatory and could force the cancellation of 19 active missions. The article warns that these cuts will cause a devastating loss of scientific talent and cede America's leadership in space exploration to other countries like China. (not investment advice)</p>
