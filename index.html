          <p>A group of Japanese doctors and social workers is criticizing the continued COVID-19 restrictions in hospitals, arguing that they violate human rights by limiting patient visitations, even for terminally ill patients. Despite the government downgrading the threat level of COVID-19, many hospitals still maintain strict policies such as mask requirements, temperature checks, and limited visitation times. The doctors argue there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of these restrictions in preventing the spread of infections, and that the public needs to voice their concerns to prompt change. They believe that denying patients the ability to see their loved ones in their final days is a human rights violation.</p>

          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist. The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6, was lured to Woeltz's home with the promise of retrieving Bitcoin he had been forced to send the suspect. Prosecutors revealed graphic details of the alleged torture, including electric shocks, cutting the victim's leg with a saw, and forcing him to smoke crack cocaine.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 22:10:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study finds that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may pass their anxiety on to their dogs. The research surveyed 85 working dog owners and found that those with higher job stress had dogs who exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one person to another, and "emotional contagion," where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The article suggests that employed dog owners might benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations when at home to protect the well-being of their pets.</p>

The coilgun is capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute. This greatly surpasses traditional firearms and US commercial models. The breakthrough centers on eliminating capacitors, the traditional Achilles' heel of electromagnetic weapons, and powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries.

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive in the New York Mets' 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers' overworked bullpen forced them to rely heavily on starter Tony Gonsolin, who struggled with command after a strong start. Gonsolin's walks loaded the bases, setting up Soto's key hit, while Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively for nearly eight innings.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is implementing new restrictions on press access at the Pentagon, limiting journalists' access to many areas unless accompanied by a government escort. The restricted areas include the offices of Hegseth, his top aides, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, claims the new policies are to protect national security. The Pentagon Press Association has expressed deep concern, calling the memo a direct attack on the freedom of the press.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap, challenging the Labour government's stance on these issues. Reform UK intends to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. This move is expected to amplify policy divisions within the Labour party, which has faced pressure to modify its approach to both policies. The commitments are to be formally announced at a press conference next week.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing problems at the World Exposition in Osaka, with visitors expressing discomfort and concerns about potential health issues. The small flies have been found on walls and pillars, and although they don't bite, dead midges can cause allergic reactions if inhaled. The expo organizer is taking measures such as spraying insecticide, treating areas where rainwater accumulates, and installing insect repellent lights. Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura has also sought assistance from an insecticide maker to combat the infestation.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist whose book “Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual assault” reshaped the modern view of sexual assault, died at 90. Her book argued that sexual assault was a crime of power and violence, not passion, and led to laws that made it easier to prosecute rapists. Brownmiller's work sparked both praise and outrage, challenging male-generated myths and influencing the women's movement. Later in life, her views on young women and sexual assault drew criticism.</p>
