          <p>President Trump has enacted a travel ban affecting nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security risks; furthermore, citizens from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela will face partial travel restrictions. The ban, effective Monday, includes exemptions for lawful permanent residents, immediate family members, and athletes participating in major sporting events. Critics have condemned the move as discriminatory, while supporters argue it is necessary to protect Americans from foreign threats, with Chad retaliating by suspending visas to US citizens. The order is expected to face legal challenges, and its implementation aims to avoid the chaos of the 2017 ban, which was later revised and upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move that experts predict could increase costs on a wide range of consumer goods, including cars, sports equipment, canned goods, and household appliances. While the U.S. relies on imports from countries like Canada to fill gaps in domestic metal manufacturing, the White House aims to reduce reliance on foreign nations, however, economists warn that businesses are likely to pass on these increased costs to consumers through higher prices. The tariffs have been praised by some of the nation's largest steel makers, but concerns remain about the impact on industries that heavily rely on these metals. (not investment advice)</p>

President Zelenskyy confirmed Russia's preparation for an offensive, concentrating forces on the Kursk front, however, military experts suggest fears of a deep incursion are exaggerated. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces are attempting to secure advantageous positions for shelling and operational control, while Russia's main target is the strategically important village of Yunakivka, whose occupation would enable drone attacks on Sumy's city center. Despite Russia's numerical superiority, Ukrainian defense forces have learned to fight against a superior enemy.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk are engaged in a public feud over Trump's domestic megabill, with Trump expressing disappointment in Musk's criticisms and Musk accusing Trump of ingratitude. Musk claimed his support was crucial for Trump's election victory and criticized the legislation for undermining efforts to reduce government spending and the national debt. Trump contends that Musk is upset about the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles in the bill, while Musk denies ever seeing the bill before its passage. The legislation, facing headwinds in the Senate, would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increase spending for the military and border security.</p>

Key provisions include exempting tipped workers from federal income taxes (up to $160,000 a year), creating "Trump savings accounts" for newborns, and raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction limit. The bill would also eliminate federal excise taxes on gun silencers and indoor tanning services, while reducing green energy tax credits and slashing education programs.

Additionally, claims that taxes will rise by 68% if the bill does not pass and that Medicaid cuts only target waste, fraud, and abuse have been disputed by non-partisan analyses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously rejected a lawsuit brought by Mexico that sought to hold American gunmakers accountable for their role in the country's struggle with drug cartels. The court voted 9-0 to reject the suit, upholding a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if weapons they produce are misused. Mexico argued that the "flood" of illegal guns across the border resulted from "deliberate" practices by US firms, but the court found that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the defendant manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers.</p>

The Counter Act of 2025 calls for the US government to develop a strategy to respond to the People's Republic of China's efforts to establish military bases overseas. The legislation would require the director of national intelligence to submit a classified assessment of risks posed by Chinese bases overseas, and instruct the State and Defense departments to identify at least five locations that pose the “greatest potential risks”. The bill also establishes an inter-agency task force and require quadrennial reviews.</p>
