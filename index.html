        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple has removed apps from its App Store that allowed users to anonymously report sightings of ICE agents following pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi. The decision came after an FBI report revealed that a gunman who attacked a Dallas ICE facility used such apps. The Trump administration has condemned these apps as endangering law enforcement, while the app's creator defended it as a tool to protect immigrants from deportation. Apple stated the removal was due to safety risks identified by law enforcement, emphasizing its commitment to a safe App Store environment. The situation has raised concerns about the balance between public safety and freedom of information.</p>

          <p>The White House is urging nine universities to sign an agreement to prioritize Trump administration goals in higher education, potentially affecting federal funding access. The "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education" includes tuition freezes, limits on international student enrollment, and changes to diversity practices. The agreement asks schools to transform or abolish units that punish or belittle conservative ideas, and universities that sign the agreement will be given priority in receiving federal funding and engaging with White House officials. Some universities have expressed concerns, viewing the request as a threat to their autonomy, while others are reviewing the proposal. Optimism surrounding the possibility of an agreement remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Venezuela has condemned what it describes as an "illegal incursion" by US fighter jets into Venezuelan-controlled airspace, calling it a provocation that threatens national sovereignty. The Venezuelan government reported detecting the planes near its coastline, with the defense minister characterizing it as a military harassment and threat. Tensions between the US and Venezuela remain high, especially after the US military dispatched aircraft and warships to the Caribbean. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused Washington of seeking regime change, while also expressing openness to talks with a US envoy. The incident underscores the ongoing strain in US-Venezuelan relations.</p>

          <p>A woman was arrested at Washington, D.C.'s Union Station after allegedly attacking conservative activist Cam Higby, who was conducting his "Fearless Tour" to promote open debate. Higby stated the woman approached his group and became combative, leading to a physical altercation where she hit him with his MAGA hat. Higby responded by pepper-spraying the woman, who then resisted arrest and assaulted officers, resulting in her arrest by U.S. Park Police. Higby, who has been targeted before, claims his mission is to expose violence on the left and encourage peaceful political dialogue. The incident highlights the increasing tensions and confrontations surrounding political activism.</p>

          <p>Tae Miyaji Jones, an Orange County woman, has pleaded guilty to embezzling $2.8 million from an instant noodle company where she worked as an account manager. From 2017 to 2023, Jones wired money to her personal accounts, using the funds to purchase luxury items and properties. She concealed her actions by falsifying company records and was charged with mail and wire fraud. Jones is required to repay the stolen money and faces sentencing in April 2026; the case underscores the potential for long-term financial crimes within corporate settings.</p>

The Institute for Fiscal Studies predicts an additional 220,000 children and young people with education, health, and care plans (EHCPs) by 2029.

Authorities have classified the incident as terrorism, and the suspect was killed by police outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation. Violent attacks against Jews are rising worldwide, and those who track antisemitism have long been worried about the United Kingdom. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that the assailant “attacked Jews because they are Jews” and that additional police are being deployed to other synagogues throughout the country. The attack highlights the dangers of ancient prejudices.</p>

          <p>As the US government shutdown continued, President Donald Trump described the funding lapse as an “unprecedented opportunity” to further his campaign of firing federal workers and downsizing departments. Trump announced that he would meet with Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget chief, to determine which "Democrat Agencies" to cut. The president's remarks indicate a willingness to use the shutdown to advance his political agenda.

          <p>Robert Morris, the founding pastor of Gateway Church, pleaded guilty to charges of indecent conduct with a child, stemming from allegations of sexual abuse in Oklahoma. Morris was sentenced to 10 years in prison, with most of the sentence suspended, and will serve six months in Osage County.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to justify strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats by claiming the US is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels. This legal theory was presented to Congress as part of an explanation for recent military actions in the Caribbean. The administration argues that cartels engaged in drug smuggling constitute an armed attack against the United States. The move represents an escalation in the US government's efforts to combat drug trafficking. Venezuelan officials have reported encountering US fighter jets near their coast.</p>

          <p>Yunnan, China’s coffee capital, has seen a surge in coffee exports, reaching 7.7 billion yuan in the first eight months of 2025, the highest of any region. The province's coffee beans are being shipped to over 30 countries, including Germany and Vietnam. This increase in overseas orders is driving industrial reforms, with factories upgrading their equipment to meet consumer needs. The Yunnan province exported 32,500 tons of coffee in 2024, up 358 per cent year-on-year. The rise in coffee prices has boosted both volumes and margins for local growers.</p>

Rea's initial comments minimizing the abuse drew criticism, prompting him to issue a more contrite apology and acknowledge the need to own the situation.
