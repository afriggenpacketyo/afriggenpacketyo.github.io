          <p>Torrential rains led to flash flooding in northern West Virginia, resulting in at least five deaths, including a child, and several people missing, prompting Governor Patrick Morrisey to declare a state of emergency.

Rescue crews conducted multiple water rescues, while officials assessed the extent of the damage and worked to restore power amidst natural gas leaks.

These small, shiny, black ants often colonize undisturbed forest areas and can also be found near homes and businesses, nesting under mulch and debris.

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City, which charges drivers entering lower Manhattan a $9 toll, is showing early signs of success by reducing traffic and raising funds for public transit. Since its implementation, the policy has led to a decrease in vehicles entering the congestion zone, faster bus routes, and improved public transit ridership. However, the program has faced opposition, including potential revocation by the Trump administration and lawsuits from outside the city, raising concerns about its long-term viability and the precedent it sets for states' rights.

Miller's remarks have ignited discussions about the ethical responsibilities of government officials and the extent to which they are obligated to support administration policies, even when those policies conflict with their personal beliefs. The article suggests that other former Biden administration officials should come forward and share their perspectives on the administration's policies, particularly those related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in the interest of truth and accountability.

          <p>Richard Ellmann's biography of James Joyce, published in 1959, is examined for its impact on literary studies and its role in establishing Joyce as a canonical author. The article delves into Ellmann's meticulous research, his ability to bring Joyce's character to life, and his skillful weaving of biographical details with critical interpretations of Joyce's works. While Ellmann's approach has been critiqued for downplaying Joyce's political interests, his biography remains a landmark achievement, offering insights into Joyce's creative process and making his complex works accessible to a wider audience. The biography's enduring influence highlights a shift in literary studies towards specialization and single-author focus.</p>

          <p>Consumer spending in China shows little sign of recovery due to stagnant income, uncertainty about future wealth, and a lack of a social safety net, leading to declining consumer prices and low confidence. Disposable income growth has slowed, and unemployment among young people remains high, contributing to a preference for saving over spending. While authorities have introduced measures to support employment and social welfare, they have avoided mass cash handouts, and consumers are increasingly turning to lower-priced products or moving to smaller cities.

          <p>President Trump reportedly opposed an Israeli plan to kill Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to U.S. officials, conveying to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that it was not a good idea. The conversation allegedly occurred after Israel launched a significant attack on Iran, although a spokesperson for Netanyahu denies the reports. Trump has warned Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets in the Middle East, while also suggesting that Iran and Israel should make a deal, drawing parallels to his past efforts to de-escalate conflicts.</p>

The competition between Airbus and Boeing extends to government subsidies and defense manufacturing, with China's Comac emerging as a potential competitor in the aviation market.

The non-native mosquito-borne disease is decimating the state's iconic forest birds, particularly honeycreepers, as climate change allows mosquitoes to move into higher elevations. The approach, known as the incompatible insect technique (IIT), aims to reduce the mosquito population and slow the spread of malaria without harming the local ecosystem. This method has been used for human health, and there is optimism it will help save the endangered bird species.</p>

The need to appease the U.S. president has placed Putin in an uncomfortable position, forcing him to compete with Ukraine for Trump's favor and negotiate with unconventional figures.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell has agreed to rejoin Saracens on a two-year deal, just a year after leaving the club for French side Racing 92. The 33-year-old has signed a two-year deal after the Premiership club came to an agreement with Paris-based Racing to end his stint in Top 14 a year early. Farrell, England's record points scorer, previously spent 16 years at Saracens, helping the club win six Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups.</p>
