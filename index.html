          <p>A major manhunt is active in Paris for four suspects who stole "priceless" jewelry from the Louvre Museum in a daring daylight robbery. The thieves used a truck with a moving ladder to access a second-floor gallery, smashing display cases and escaping on motorbikes in approximately seven minutes. Among the stolen items are historic pieces from the French crown jewels, including items belonging to Empress Marie-Louise and Empress Eugenie. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron, have condemned the theft as an attack on national heritage and vowed to apprehend the perpetrators.</p>

          <p>Following a contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly suggested that Ukraine should accept Russia's territorial demands to end the war. Trump reportedly urged Zelenskyy to cede the entire eastern Donbas region, a proposal that led to a "shouting match" during their White House discussion, according to the Financial Times. In subsequent remarks, Trump stated that the fighting should stop at the current battle lines and that both sides should "claim Victory." The exchange has signaled a significant shift in U.S. policy and raised concerns about the future of American support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called "V-levels" for 16-year-old students in England. These courses are intended to replace existing Level 3 BTECs and other technical qualifications, aiming to simplify what ministers describe as a "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE options. The proposal is part of a broader white paper on education and skills, which also includes a new "stepping stone" qualification to reduce the number of students repeatedly resitting maths and English GCSEs. The move aligns with a greater emphasis on vocational training to provide clearer pathways into skilled careers.</p>

          <p>The brazen theft of historic jewels from the Louvre has prompted French officials to admit to significant security shortcomings at the nation's museums. Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin stated that the country had "failed" to protect its treasures, highlighting the ease with which the thieves accessed the museum. The incident is the latest in a series of recent museum thefts in France, raising concerns about the vulnerability of cultural institutions. The political fallout has intensified, with opposition leaders criticizing the government and President Macron for the "unbearable humiliation."</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the death of a BNSF Railway conductor who was fatally struck by a passing train in Columbus, Montana. The incident occurred Sunday morning while the conductor was reportedly between a parked train on one track and a moving train on an adjacent track. Emergency responders indicated the moving train struck the individual, though the exact circumstances remain under investigation by multiple agencies. The tragedy has drawn attention to rail worker safety, following a recent federal report that noted front-line BNSF workers often felt uncomfortable reporting safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated he is prepared to participate in a proposed summit with U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin if invited. This comes after a reportedly acrimonious meeting in Washington where Trump urged Ukraine to concede territory to Russia to end the war. While Zelenskyy described his discussion with Trump as "frank," he emphasized his goal is a "just peace, not a quick peace." He also expressed skepticism about Hungary as a potential venue for the talks, questioning Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ability to be a balanced contributor to the peace process.</p>

          <p>A growing number of major companies are publicly citing artificial intelligence as a reason for significant job cuts, but some experts are skeptical. Critics argue that AI has become a "good excuse" for firms to downsize workforces for other underlying reasons, such as overhiring during the pandemic or general economic slowdowns. Fabian Stephany of the Oxford Internet Institute suggests that blaming AI allows companies to appear innovative while deflecting responsibility for strategic miscalculations. This trend is feeding employee anxiety, even as recent economic data shows little evidence of mass unemployment caused by AI automation so far.</p>

          <p>China has played a significant role in funding major urban development projects in Angola, such as the $3.5 billion city of Kilamba, which was built by Chinese companies through an oil-for-infrastructure agreement. This city was part of Angola's national reconstruction efforts following its civil war. However, upon its completion, high property prices and a lack of available credit initially made it inaccessible for many Angolans. The Angolan government eventually had to intervene by lowering prices and introducing state-backed mortgages to increase occupancy, highlighting the complex financial realities of such large-scale projects.</p>

However, meta-analyses have found that many of these studies are of lower quality and often funded by the supplement industry, introducing potential bias.

          <h2>Universities Widely Reject Trump Administration's 'Compact for Academic Excellence'</h2>

          <p>A majority of the universities approached by the Trump administration have signaled they will not sign its "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education" ahead of a Monday deadline. The proposal ties preferential access to federal funding to commitments such as barring transgender athletes, freezing tuition, and limiting international student enrollment. Institutions including MIT, Brown, and the University of Virginia have publicly declined, citing conflicts with their core principles of academic freedom and merit-based scientific funding. The rejections represent a significant setback for the administration's effort to impose its political priorities on higher education.</p>

          <h2>Trump Claims Gaza Ceasefire Holds Despite Fighting, as Israel and Hamas Trade Blame</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite deadly clashes and retaliatory strikes, U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was still in effect, suggesting that rogue elements, not Hamas leadership, may be responsible for the violations. The fighting erupted after Israel reported two of its soldiers were killed, prompting it to launch strikes and halt aid to Gaza. Both sides have blamed each other for breaking the truce. Separately, tensions in Israel were highlighted when a police ban on a Tel Aviv football derby, citing fears of public disorder, drew criticism from team officials and opposition politicians.</p>

          <h2>Early Introduction of Peanuts Has Prevented an Estimated 60,000 Childhood Allergies, Study Finds</h2>

          <p>A significant shift in medical guidance recommending the early introduction of peanut products to infants has successfully prevented an estimated 60,000 cases of peanut allergies in young children, a new study reports. The research, published in Pediatrics, analyzed health records and found a substantial decline in allergy diagnoses after guidelines were updated starting in 2015. For decades, parents were advised to delay introducing allergens, but the landmark LEAP trial proved that early exposure dramatically reduces allergy risk. This real-world data confirms the profound public health benefit of the new approach.</p>

          <h2>Israel Conducts Retaliatory Strikes in Gaza After Two Soldiers Killed, Halts Aid</h2>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was severely tested after Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, stating its forces were attacked by Hamas militants, resulting in the deaths of two Israeli soldiers. In response, Israel struck dozens of targets and temporarily halted all humanitarian aid deliveries into the territory, though officials later indicated aid would resume. Hamas denied involvement in the attacks, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire and noting the incidents occurred in Israeli-controlled areas. The exchange of fire, which also killed dozens of Palestinians, represents the most significant violation of the truce.</p>

          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) caused widespread disruption across the internet, affecting dozens of popular websites, banking apps, and government services. The issue, which began Monday morning, was traced to a problem with the DNS resolution process in AWS's US-EAST-1 region, one of its largest data centers. Among the services impacted were Amazon's own platforms, Lloyds Bank, Reddit, Snapchat, and UK government portals. AWS confirmed it was working to resolve the issue and later reported observing signs of recovery across most affected sites.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, is reportedly planning to order an additional 15 F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. manufacturer Lockheed Martin. This purchase would supplement the 35 jets already on order, which are intended to replace Germany's aging Tornado fleet. The F-35s are capable of carrying U.S. nuclear weapons stationed in Germany, a key feature for NATO's nuclear sharing mission. The move is part of Germany's significant expansion of its defense budget in response to increased security threats in Europe, particularly from Russia.</p>
