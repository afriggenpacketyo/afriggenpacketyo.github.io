            <p>President Trump announced that the US and Ukraine are set to sign a long-awaited agreement concerning critical minerals, potentially granting American companies access to Ukraine's substantial mineral reserves. The deal aims to authorize these companies to participate in rebuilding Ukraine's infrastructure. Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko confirmed the virtual signing of a memorandum of intent, marking a step toward an economic partnership and the establishment of an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction. Trump administration officials believe the agreement will be signed next week.</p>

Sharpton called the meeting “very constructive and candid,” but provided no further details. He plans to inform Rev.

            <p>The Trump administration, through the Department of Transportation, is taking over the reconstruction of Penn Station in New York from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The DOT claims this move will save taxpayers approximately $120 million, championing a public-private partnership model to minimize financial risk. Amtrak, which is federally funded, will now helm the project, which aims to increase train service in and out of New York. This decision follows criticism from Elon Musk regarding the state of US passenger rail and Amtrak's performance.</p>

Hamas has formally rejected Israel's latest ceasefire proposal, demanding a deal that includes the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war.

            <p>American Express' wealthy cardholders are showing little concern about potential economic impacts from President Trump's tariff policies, maintaining their spending habits. Younger customers, particularly millennials and Gen Z, drove growth in first-quarter transaction volumes, with spending up 14%. While overall market concerns exist, AmEx's affluent customer base appears to be insulating the company from potential spending slowdowns. The company's CFO noted stability and strength in spending despite negative news and economic uncertainties.</p>

Tariffs will affect various expenses, including childcare, healthcare, food, clothing, education, and transportation. The companies that sell products geared at those raising kids are also going to feel the pinch as well. One CEO argues it could even mean certain products will become unavailable. Being a parent in the U.S. is already expensive. Slapping tariffs on the products kids use could make it more so.</p>
