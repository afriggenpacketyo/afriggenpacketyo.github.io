          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that President Donald Trump's supporters perceived as a veiled threat. The post featured seashells arranged to form "86 47," which some interpreted as a call to harm the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, but Trump and administration officials rejected his explanation, with Trump labeling Comey a "dirty cop" and suggesting he was calling for the president's assassination. The Secret Service confirmed Comey's interview and affirmed their commitment to protecting the president.</p>

In other news, a New Jersey Transit strike disrupted commutes after locomotive engineers walked off their jobs, demanding wage parity with other local railroads. Additionally, House Republicans blocked their own party's major domestic policy bill due to demands for deeper budget cuts. This legislation aimed to enact President Trump's agenda, cutting taxes while increasing military and immigration enforcement funding, but faced opposition from conservative hard-liners.</p>

          <p>A dust storm blanketed Chicago, causing the skyline to disappear and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its second-ever dust storm warning for the area. High winds, reaching 60 to 70 mph, swept over dry farmlands and collected dust into the air, significantly reducing visibility. The dust storm forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and temporarily halted incoming flights at Midway International Airport. While dust storms are more common in rural parts of Illinois, this event marked the first time such a warning included the city itself.</p>

The trip resulted in economic investments between the United States and the three nations he visited.

          <p>Ammunition manufacturers in Gorazde, Bosnia, are concerned about the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on their exports to the United States, their biggest market. The tariffs could halt exports and jeopardize expansion plans, as the U.S. appetite for guns has long provided a steady market for the region's weapons factories. The mayor of Gorazde expressed concern that the U.S. has abandoned free trade and economic development as a path to peace in the region, especially given the dismantling of U.S.A.I.D. projects.</p>

          <h2>Americans Fear Medicaid Cuts Could Jeopardize Health Coverage</h2>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans, are causing concern among those who rely on it for coverage. An analysis estimates the cuts could increase the number of uninsured by at least 8.6 million by 2034. While Republicans insist the cuts will only eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, some Americans worry they will lose access to essential health care. The bill would impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients -- at least 80 hours per month -- or require enrolling in an educational program for at least 80 hours or some combination per month.</p>

          <p>Sneaker Impact, a Miami-based recycling company, collects used sneakers and gives them a second life by either reusing or recycling them. Reusable shoes are shipped to developing countries and resold by local shops, while shoes that cannot be reused are crushed and repurposed into flooring, mats, or sandals. The company processes over one million shoes per year, aiming to reduce waste and create microbusiness opportunities. The founder hopes other companies will replicate this environmentally friendly approach to business.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans. This decision follows the company's announcement earlier this week that it will shut seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after logging a net loss for fiscal 2024. The two plants in question are Nissan's main Oppama plant and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co. The closures, if implemented, would reduce Nissan's domestic production capacity by about 30 percent.</p>

Launched at an angle from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase to engage targets.

I think, though, that Tapper and Thompson have done the party a favor. Some sort of reckoning is due for the disastrous missteps that paved the way for Trump‚Äôs return. It‚Äôs better for Democrats to rip off the Band-Aid now than to let the issue fester until the next election, and to try to glean some bitter lessons from their collective failure.
