          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is projected to intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend, posing a significant threat to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides in the region early next week, with some areas expected to receive up to three feet of rain. While the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the U.S. mainland, a hurricane warning is currently in effect for Jamaica. The system could become the strongest of the Atlantic season, with winds potentially reaching 140 miles per hour.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated she has not ruled out another run for the presidency, stating, "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 campaign and asserted that her warnings about Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct. The White House dismissed her comments as "absurd lies." Despite her openness to a future campaign, recent polling in her home state of California shows limited support for a 2028 run, with fewer than a third of voters endorsing another attempt.</p>

          <p>An NBA game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Brooklyn Nets was briefly delayed when a fan ran onto the court in an attempt to take a selfie with Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell. The incident occurred in the fourth quarter, and broadcast footage showed Mitchell backing away as security personnel quickly apprehended the individual. After the game, Mitchell confirmed the fan's motive and noted the swift response from Barclays Center security. Teammate Jarrett Allen also praised the security team's rapid action in removing the fan, whose future access to the arena is now in question.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a significant 26-6 loss to Australia in the first Ashes match at Wembley, a performance their head coach described as "torture." The English side was plagued by simple mistakes and wasted opportunities, allowing Australia to establish a clear lead in the second half. Australian full-back Reece Walsh was named player of the match for his pivotal role in both defense and offense. The defeat puts Australia in a strong position to retain the Ashes, while England faces pressure to make urgent improvements before the next match in Liverpool.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery to remove between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets he had swallowed, resulting in the loss of part of his bowel. According to a case report, the magnets clamped together inside his digestive tract, forming four chains that caused pressure necrosis, or tissue death. The sale of such magnets is banned in New Zealand, but they remain accessible online, which is where the teen reportedly purchased them. The incident highlights the severe internal injuries that can occur from ingesting multiple strong magnets, a danger that U.S. regulators have also sought to address.</p>

As a result, some traders are reportedly showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which would allow Democrats to redraw congressional districts to create five new safe seats, is being marketed to voters as a direct countermeasure to Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas. Proponents, including Governor Gavin Newsom, are framing the initiative as a way to "fight fire with fire" and a chance for Californians to oppose former President Donald Trump. While some critics decry the measure as a partisan power grab that undermines the state's independent redistricting commission, polling suggests the anti-Trump messaging is resonating with a majority of voters.

          <p>Following the demolition of the White House East Wing, a reporter for The Atlantic embarked on a quest to locate the historic structure's remains. The search led from a golf course in East Potomac Park, where truckloads of soil were being deposited to create a new hole, to an industrial park in Maryland rumored to be a dump site. While the White House dirt was confirmed at the golf course, the ultimate destination of the more substantial debris remained elusive. The article highlights the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the remnants of one of America's most cherished buildings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's abrupt termination of trade negotiations with Canada could lead to higher prices for consumer goods such as cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The decision, reportedly a response to a Canadian TV ad critical of tariffs, could keep existing 50% levies on Canadian steel and aluminum in place indefinitely. Since these metals are essential components in many manufactured goods, prolonged tariffs would likely increase costs for U.S. producers, who may then pass those costs on to consumers. Canada is the top exporter of both steel and aluminum to the United States.</p>

          <p>Independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded the election. Although vote counting is still in progress, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and independent lawmaker. Connolly, who has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza, secured the backing of several left-leaning parties. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two seven-year terms in the largely ceremonial role, becoming Ireland's tenth president and the third woman to hold the office.</p>

          <p>A new report from Brown Harris Stevens reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condo resales between mid-2024 and mid-2025 were sold for a loss. The data indicates that the median price per square foot for condos in the borough has remained largely flat over the past decade, a stark contrast to significant price increases seen in much of the rest of the country. When factoring in inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual share of unprofitable sales is likely even higher. The luxury market, particularly for properties over $10 million, was the main exception, consistently yielding profits for sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan was reportedly based on extensive investigations conducted during Xi's national tours throughout the year.

While the result was not a landslide, it places Powell in a senior, directly elected role within the party.
