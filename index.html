          <h2>House Republicans Advance Trump's Budget Bill Amid Internal Divisions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House is progressing with President Trump's budget bill, addressing defense, energy, and tax priorities. Three committees voted to advance the legislation, though Republicans are divided on issues like Medicaid and tax cuts. A key point of contention is the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap, with blue state Republicans seeking an increase. The House aims for a vote next week, but the Senate's input is expected to bring changes to the package, with some Senate Republicans expressing concerns about the House's version.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are facing challenges as they attempt to pass the "big, beautiful bill" due to President Trump's mixed signals on key issues. Trump's suggestions of a tax increase for the wealthy and limiting resources for children have caused confusion among GOP members. While some Republicans oppose raising taxes, Trump's economic message resonates with his blue-collar coalition. The White House expects Republicans to ultimately vote in favor of the bill, despite frustrations over the shrinking size of tax cuts and spending reductions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's approach to South Africa is shaped by a convergence of factors, including meetings with Afrikaner activists and a break over Israel's war in Gaza. The administration is welcoming white South Africans as refugees after suspending the program for others, claiming they face persecution and discrimination. This decision has fueled diplomatic tensions between the two nations, with the administration halting foreign aid to South Africa and expelling its ambassador. The move reflects Trump's focus on addressing perceived racism against white people and his views on South Africa.</p>

          <p>President Putin will not attend peace talks with Ukraine in Turkey, sending a hard-line aide, Vladimir Medinsky, to lead the Russian delegation. President Trump will also skip the talks, sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio instead. Zelensky expressed anticipation to see who will represent Russia before determining Ukraine's next steps. The stakes are high for both sides in the conflict, with Russia facing significant troop losses and Ukraine losing ground in the east.</p>

          <p>The question of whether Afrikaners want to leave South Africa for the US has sparked debate, following President Trump's offer of refugee status. While some Afrikaners have taken up the offer, others, like Ulrich Janse van Vuuren, remain committed to South Africa, seeing it as their home and heritage. The debate highlights concerns over crime rates and government policies aimed at reducing economic inequality. The US embassy clarified that applicants need to be South African, Afrikaner or from a racial minority, and able to cite past persecution or fear of persecution.</p>
