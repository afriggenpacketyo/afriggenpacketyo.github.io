          <h2>Online Real Estate Firm Opendoor Becomes Latest Meme Stock Sensation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 09:33:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor Technologies have surged dramatically, marking a revival of the meme stock phenomenon. The stock, which was trading below $1 for most of the year, experienced a more than 500% increase in July, driven by retail traders on forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets. This rally is fueled by high short interest, leading to a potential short squeeze, and a significant increase in options trading activity. The sudden interest echoes the GameStop mania of 2021, turning the once struggling startup into a highly volatile and heavily traded stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent economist Mohamed El-Erian has publicly called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign from his position. El-Erian, an advisor at Allianz, argued that this step is necessary to safeguard the central bank's operational autonomy from what he describes as growing and broadening political threats. He acknowledged this view is contrary to the Wall Street consensus, which prefers Powell to complete his term. El-Erian's statement highlights increasing concerns about political pressure on the Fed's monetary policy and its expanding mission.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Secretary Bessent Signals Likely Extension of China Tariff Deadline Amid Planned Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 09:28:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that an extension of the August 12 tariff deadline with China is probable. The upcoming talks in Stockholm are expected to formalize this extension, continuing the 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs that began in May. Bessent expressed a constructive outlook on U.S.-China trade relations, hoping to broaden discussions to include China's manufacturing output and its role concerning sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil. This development suggests a move towards de-escalation and more comprehensive negotiations between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced its decision to withdraw from UNESCO for the third time, with the departure set to take effect in December 2026. The Trump administration cited the UN agency's alleged "anti-Israel bias" and promotion of a "divisive social and cultural" agenda at odds with its "America First" policy. This move reverses the Biden administration's 2023 decision to rejoin, which was aimed at countering Chinese influence within the organization. UNESCO's Director-General expressed deep regret over the decision, which represents a significant blow to the principles of multilateralism.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's endorsement and Coca-Cola's confirmation of a new cane sugar version, health experts are weighing in on the nutritional debate. While cane sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup have slightly different chemical compositions, experts state their overall health impacts are similar when consumed in excess. Both are considered empty calories and contribute to health issues like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Some experts express concern over the higher fructose content in corn syrup and its potential link to inflammation, but the consensus remains that moderation of all added sugars is key.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that while he advocates for a comprehensive internal review of the Federal Reserve's operations, he does not believe Chair Jerome Powell should resign. This position contrasts with President Trump's repeated calls for Powell to step down. Bessent suggested the review should focus on the Fed's non-monetary policy functions, which he claims have grown without sufficient oversight. He framed this as an opportunity for Powell to "right-size" the institution's role, separating its core monetary duties from other expanding responsibilities and preserving their integrity from political influence.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has officially announced it will introduce a version of its classic soda made with cane sugar for the U.S. market this fall. This move comes after President Trump publicly endorsed the switch from the high-fructose corn syrup currently used in American Coke. The company has used corn syrup in the U.S. since the 1980s due to its lower cost, though the cane sugar version, popular as "Mexican Coke," has a dedicated following. The new product is part of a strategy to offer more choices to consumers, complementing its portfolio which has recently focused on sugar-reduction.</p>

          <p>The ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files is creating a rift within the MAGA movement, forcing influential conservative media figures to navigate a difficult political landscape. While President Trump has dismissed the issue, personalities like Tucker Carlson are criticizing the administration's handling of the matter, arguing it mirrors the dismissiveness of the establishment Trump campaigned against. Carlson has used the issue to voice broader critiques of the conservative establishment, questioning its focus on culture wars over the economic realities facing average Americans. This dynamic highlights a rare and significant challenge to Trump's control over his political base.</p>

Despite the tariff-related pressures, the company's underlying business remained solid, with a 7% rise in U.S. sales.

Sanseito has effectively used social media to spread its message, which includes conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for remilitarization.

          <p>Howard Phillips, a 65-year-old from Essex, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for Russia after offering to provide sensitive information to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents.
