            <p>Lori Daybell, convicted of murdering two of her children, delivered her closing argument in her Arizona trial, where she is charged with conspiring to kill her fourth husband. Daybell maintains her brother acted in self-defense when he shot her husband, while prosecutors argue it was a ploy to collect life insurance money and be with Chad Daybell. The prosecution claims Daybell and her brother used twisted religious beliefs to justify the murder. The jury is currently deliberating after hearing arguments about premeditation, motives, and religious interpretations.</p>

            <p>US trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia, concluding a trade case initiated by American manufacturers. The manufacturers allege that overseas rivals are flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods.

Dumping duties range from 6.1% to 271.28%, while anti-subsidy duties are between 14.64% and 3,403.96%, depending on the company and country.</p>

            <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants, particularly Venezuelans. Immigrants' rights groups argue that providing only 24 hours' notice before deportation is insufficient and violates due process. The administration defends its actions by citing the need to combat gang violence and national security concerns. The case highlights the legal rights of migrants and the scope of executive power in immigration enforcement.</p>
