          <p>A shooting incident at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday night resulted in one death and several injuries. Authorities have detained a person of interest, and police confirmed that surveillance footage indicates only one shooter, who is now in custody. The exact number of wounded individuals and whether they sustained gunshot wounds remains unclear. The incident prompted a shelter-in-place order for nearby areas, which has since been lifted, with police assuring the public there is no ongoing threat. A witness described the shooter running through a wedding reception after being hit with a chair, highlighting the chaotic nature of the event.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several bills aimed at curbing federal officers' reach, particularly concerning immigration enforcement. The "No Secret Police Act" (SB 627) bans federal and local law enforcement from wearing face coverings on duty and requires officers to be identifiable by name and badge number, effective January 1. Other legislation protects children from immigration enforcement at schools and prohibits officers from entering nonpublic hospital areas without judicial warrants. These measures are a response to what Newsom termed "secret police" operations and a Supreme Court ruling allowing immigration stops based on appearance, drawing strong condemnation from Department of Homeland Security officials who argue the laws endanger officers and obstruct enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate Lindsey Halligan, his former attorney, as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, following the abrupt resignation of Erik Siebert. Siebert's departure came amid pressure from the administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation. Trump stated he fired Siebert, citing his alleged support from Democratic senators and his refusal to pursue the case. Halligan, who has no prosecutorial experience, previously represented Trump in the classified documents investigation and is tasked with removing "improper ideology" from Smithsonian properties, marking a highly politicized appointment.</p>

          <p>Angels star Mike Trout hit his 400th career home run, a significant milestone that prompts reflection on his illustrious but injury-hampered career. Despite recent seasons marked by frequent stints on the injured list, Trout remains a dominant force, known for his power and ability to get on base. Comparisons to legends like Mickey Mantle highlight what could have been without injuries, yet his three MVP awards and consistent top-five finishes solidify his Hall of Fame status. Trout, a private individual who prioritizes personal values over commercial promotion, has twice bypassed free agency to remain loyal to the Angels, earning him the moniker "Mr. Angel" among fans.</p>

          <p>An email from 2011, reportedly sent by Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has resurfaced, referring to him as a "supreme friend."

A spokesperson for the Duchess stated the email was sent under advice to assuage Epstein after he threatened to sue her for defamation for linking him to sexual assault. The spokesperson emphasized that the Duchess stands by her public condemnation and that she, like many, was deceived by his lies, with her thoughts always with his victims.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.00%-4.25% led to a paradoxical outcome: long-term interest rates, including those for mortgages, actually increased. This phenomenon is attributed to bond traders "selling the news" after recent bond gains, viewing the Fed's easing as a potential sign of taking its eye off inflation, which remains above target. Higher long-term yields can impact borrowing costs for homes, autos, and credit cards, as evidenced by homebuilder Lennar missing revenue expectations due to "elevated" interest rates. Experts suggest bond markets are looking for more significant economic downturns to justify aggressive rate cuts, warning that declining yields often signal a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

Her friends recall her struggles for financial survival and an encounter at a Nanyuki bar, a town with a permanent British Army training base. This potential extradition would mark a historic first for a British soldier to face trial abroad for a civilian murder, as calls for justice and accountability continue amidst allegations of a cover-up and systemic issues regarding British troops' conduct in Kenya.</p>

Rioters clashed with police, throwing objects, torching a police car, and vandalizing the office of the centrist D66 political party. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds, with some protesters carrying flags associated with the pre-war Dutch Nazi party. Caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders condemned the violence, calling it "completely unacceptable."

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters warning of consequences if states continue to obstruct immigration enforcement by not holding individuals for federal agents. Illinois and New York formally declined, while California initially did not respond, citing existing state laws that limit cooperation with ICE detainers without judicial warrants. The Trump administration argues these policies release "criminal aliens" into communities, while states maintain that detainers are voluntary requests and that compliance could lead to constitutional challenges and liability for erroneous detentions.</p>

He envisions a society where everyone enjoys the "best medical care, food, home, transport and everything else," with intelligent humanoid robots far outnumbering humans. Musk argues that a mere universal basic income wouldn't suffice when machines handle most labor, necessitating a more generous system. While this vision offers sci-fi optimism, critics question the feasibility of funding such a system given current economic challenges and political roadblocks, with many wondering how the entire economic structure would be rethought to support such widespread prosperity.

          <p>Jane Austen's classic novel 'Emma' has been adapted for the 21st-century stage by Ava Pickett, setting the story in a modern Essex nightclub scene. The adaptation, playing at London's Rose Theatre, features Emma Woodhouse as a meddling, quick-witted protagonist who interferes with her friends' online dating profiles after failing at Oxford. Pickett, drawing from her own experiences, explores themes of self-worth derived from social media validation and the complexities of modern relationships. The play updates the Regency-era narrative with contemporary elements like dating apps and clubbing, while retaining Austen's core insights into human nature, love, and friendship, aiming to resonate with modern audiences.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of university students are juggling demanding part-time jobs and long commutes because their maintenance loans fail to cover basic living costs. Research indicates that maximum annual maintenance loans cover only about half the expenses for freshers, with a typical shortfall of over £500 per month. Students like Tianna Hunkins work up to 30 hours a week, sometimes wearing uniforms to lectures, missing academic opportunities to fund their studies and social lives. Others, like Faith Webb, opt for two-hour daily commutes from home to avoid renting. Universities are seeing an increase in students needing deadline extensions due to work, prompting calls for the government to reintroduce maintenance grants and increase loan amounts to reflect inflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is gaining attention for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly in combating brain fog. Originally known for enhancing athletic performance, new research suggests it may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. Dr. Henry Chung notes its shift from elite sport to mainstream use, especially among women in their 40s experiencing perimenopausal brain fog. While studies are still limited, some individuals, like Katie Mansell, report improved clarity and motivation after taking creatine, alongside other treatments. Experts like Professor Trevor McMorris suggest it might work by increasing brain creatine stores, thereby boosting energy for cognitive processes, especially under stress, though more research is needed to confirm widespread efficacy and potential side effects.</p>

          <p>The UK government, under Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, has announced its recognition of a Palestinian state, a significant shift in British foreign policy. This decision, coinciding with the UN General Assembly, follows mounting pressure from Labour MPs and international allies like France, Australia, and Canada. Starmer conditioned recognition on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to a two-state solution, conditions widely expected not to be met by the current Israeli government. While supporters view it as a galvanizing moment for peace, critics label it "gesture politics" that rewards terrorism and puts the UK at odds with the US, highlighting deep divisions over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions for journalists, requiring them to agree not to disclose unauthorized information or risk losing access to the building. These changes, which also limit movement within the facility, follow a series of recent leaks and are championed by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who stated the press does not run the Pentagon. The Department of War asserts its commitment to transparency but emphasizes that information must be approved for public release, even if unclassified. Critics argue these guidelines infringe on press freedom and accountability, while officials maintain they are common-sense measures to protect national security and sensitive information.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma have introduced legislation requiring all public universities in the state to erect a "Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza," featuring a statue of the assassinated activist and signage proclaiming him a "modern civil rights leader." The bill, sponsored by Senators Shane Jett and Dana Prieto, mandates prominent placement and specific statue designs, with non-compliant institutions facing monthly fines. This initiative aligns with broader conservative efforts to elevate Kirk's legacy, drawing comparisons to figures like Martin Luther King Jr., which King's son, Martin Luther King III, has explicitly rejected. Critics, including Catholic leaders and the National Catholic Reporter, condemn the move, highlighting Kirk's controversial rhetoric and questioning the accuracy of the "civil rights leader" designation.</p>

          <p>Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including top CIA deputies and Democratic congressional staffers, without prior notification to the White House. This move caused significant consternation within the administration, as officials only learned post-fact that career intelligence officers and key congressional aides were affected. The action, which Gabbard claimed was at Trump's direction to address "politicization or weaponization of intelligence," deepened animosity between her office and the CIA. Despite the blunder, Gabbard is not expected to face major repercussions, having previously navigated similar fraught moments with the president, who remains skeptical of the intelligence community.</p>

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated a signing is imminent, though Beijing has yet to confirm. This agreement aims to address national security concerns regarding the video-sharing app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, after President Trump previously threatened a ban. Oracle, chaired by Trump ally Larry Ellison, will manage data and privacy for the U.S. operations. The deal signifies a significant shift in control over the popular platform, which Trump had increasingly used for his presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a stark warning to Afghanistan, threatening "bad things" if the nation does not return control of the Bagram air base to the United States. Trump, who has expressed a long-standing desire to regain the base, declined to rule out sending troops to retake it. The sprawling airfield served as the main American base during two decades of war, and its withdrawal in 2021 preceded the Taliban takeover. Afghan officials oppose a renewed U.S. presence, and current and former U.S. officials caution that re-occupying Bagram would resemble a re-invasion, requiring substantial troops and advanced air defenses, making it vulnerable to various threats.</p>
