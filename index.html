          <p>A federal judge is reviewing the Trump administration's invocation of state secrets privilege to withhold details regarding the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue the administration is obstructing court-ordered fact-finding related to his return after he was mistakenly deported. The Justice Department claims attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege, and executive privileges protect the information, and further stated that releasing documents about arrangements with El Salvador regarding the use of their prisons for deportees would reveal classified information. Abrego Garcia's lawyers are seeking additional depositions, potentially including someone from the White House with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him.</p>

          <p>Airlines faced a surge in customer complaints in 2024, reaching a record 66,675, according to a U.S. PIRG Education Fund report. The increase is attributed to issues such as flight cancellations, delays, and mishandled luggage, which have worsened since the pandemic. The report also highlights that airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs compared to the previous year, though millions were still lost or damaged. Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints per passenger, while Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaiian Airlines performed best in overall customer satisfaction.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit engineers went on strike, halting all rail service and affecting over 300,000 daily commuters, with Metro-North's west of Hudson service also impacted.

NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan involving additional bus service, but it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. New Jersey Gov.

          <p>The German government plans to suspend family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status for at least two years, primarily affecting Syrian families. This decision has sparked debate, with critics arguing it can cause psychological strain and lead to irregular immigration attempts. While asylum seekers and recognized refugees have the right to family reunification, those with subsidiary protection status do not. Critics such as Pro Asyl say that the separation from family can place a huge psychological strain on those affected, which can have consequences for integration and also irregular immigration.</p>

Investors, however, seem unconcerned, with shares in Nvidia and AMD soaring after the announcements, giving a lift to the Magnificent 7 group of A.I.-focused stocks.

Decades later, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that matched Westrom, who denied knowing Childs.

          <p>Fortnite is now unavailable on iOS devices globally after Apple blocked Epic Games' attempt to reinstate the game on the App Store. Apple's action follows a dispute over in-app purchase commissions, leading to Fortnite's initial removal in 2020. Epic Games had sought to bypass Apple's 30% fee by linking to its own website for purchases. While Fortnite was accessible in Europe through Epic Games' own digital store due to the Digital Markets Act, Epic Games said that it was also blocked from distributing Fortnite on its Epic Games Store for iOS in the EU.</p>

          <p>Charter Communications and Cox Communications, two of the largest cable companies in the U.S., have agreed to merge in a deal valuing Cox at $34.5 billion. The merger aims to strengthen their position amid heated competition from wireless and streaming services and declining traditional cable TV subscriptions. The broadband industry has been contending with heated competition from wireless competitors in recent years as there's been a rise in alternate home internet options like 5G, or so-called fixed wireless. Charter was up roughly 8% in premarket trading from its previous close of $419.57.</p>
