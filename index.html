These proposals are a direct response to efforts by business groups to overturn the wage hike, which the union champions as an "Olympic wage" to ensure workers can afford the rising cost of living.

          <p>Despite evidence that mass deportations negatively impact the economy and don't benefit American-born workers, Trump continues to pursue them, raising concerns about his true motives. Studies show that illegal immigrants don't take jobs from citizens and that removing them worsens the economy. Trump's adviser Stephen Miller advocates for a scorched-earth campaign against illegal immigration, driven by xenophobia and cultural concerns. Trump's campaign is dangerous because he wants undocumented people and the people who care for them to live in fear, to see him as a potentate who can deport people or leave them alone at his mercy and whim.</p>

          <p>Immigration raids in Southern California are causing fear and anxiety among Latino gardeners and landscapers, many of whom are undocumented. Despite the risks, these workers continue to maintain yards, driven by the need to pay bills and support their families. The raids have also affected U.S. citizen family members, who express concern about the potential detention and deportation of their parents. The horticulture industry relies heavily on immigrant labor, highlighting the economic impact of immigration policies on both workers and the broader community.</p>

          <p>While school phone bans aim to improve student focus, they haven't significantly addressed the youth mental health crisis, suggesting deeper factors are at play. Family disintegration, declining religious affiliation, and a bleak worldview contribute to anxiety and depression among young people. Experts emphasize the importance of purpose, meaning, and independence, encouraging risk-taking and resilience. Shielding children from normal stresses may inadvertently hinder their ability to cope with life's challenges, thus parents and teachers need to curb their instinct to shield children from the normal stresses and disappointments in life.</p>

Multinational corporations understood that closed borders were a powerful weapon to squeeze more profit out of global supply chains.

          <p>Timbaland has co-launched a new AI-focused entertainment company called Stage Zero, which recently announced its first AI-generated "artist," TaTa. Music for TaTa and fellow AI "artists" will be created using the music platform Suno, an AI music creation program positioned as a ChatGPT for song-makers. Longtime Jay-Z engineer Young Guru pleaded directly with the super-producer: "Your voice is powerful and way too important to do anything like this," he wrote in a reply on Instagram. Ideation is the result of cognition, and often requires collaboration — people putting their heads together to puzzle out an answer — which is part of what makes generative music feel so sinister.</p>

          <h2>Al-Hilal CEO Explains Why Ronaldo Loan Move Was 'Counter-Intuitive'</h2>

          <p>The chief executive of Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal stated that a loan move for Cristiano Ronaldo would have been "completely counter-intuitive" because he played for their "biggest opponent" Al-Nassr. Despite being linked with a possible deal for Ronaldo, Al-Hilal decided against it due to the player's affiliation with their rival club. The CEO said that the move would be counter-intuitive even more when it's only for three to four weeks, so they decided against it.</p>
