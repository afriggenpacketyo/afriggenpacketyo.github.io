          <p>Saturday's newspapers are dominated by two main stories: Reform UK's strong performance in the local elections and Prince Harry's BBC interview following his legal challenge regarding his UK security. The Daily Mail emphasizes the "Reform revolution," noting the party's significant gains. The Times also splits its front page between the election results and Prince Harry's reflections on his security appeal loss and his relationship with the royal family. The Daily Telegraph focuses on the Conservative party's "bloodbath" in the elections, while also mentioning Prince Harry's desire to reconcile with his father. The Sun dedicates most of its front page to Prince Harry, describing his comments as an "incendiary attack on his family."</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit argues that these policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement efforts, citing instances where local laws prevent law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. The suit specifically mentions the controversial apartment complex in Aurora which President Trump claimed last year had been taken over by a Venezuelan gang. Local officials have refuted Trump's claims, but acknowledged the apartment complex was terrorized, including by people linked to Tren de Aragua.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions, and other car parts has come into force in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry. The new tariff is intended to incentivize carmakers to increase manufacturing in the US, but analysts predict higher costs for businesses and consumers. While companies have been somewhat shielded by increased sales due to concerns about price hikes, General Motors has warned of billions in new costs due to the tariffs. The policy has been softened regarding Mexico and Canada, with parts made in compliance with their free trade agreement being spared the duties.</p>

President Trump eliminated the exemption, subjecting goods from mainland China and Hong Kong valued at less than $800 to import taxes. Temu has already stopped shipping products directly from China to U.S. customers, and both Temu and Shein have reduced their advertising spending.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious National Cathedral project, envisioned as a national monument designed by architect David Adjaye, has stalled due to economic mismanagement and corruption allegations.

The unbuilt cathedral has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and a political battleground, with the new government halting funding and launching an anticorruption initiative.</p>

          <p>Federal transportation safety officials are investigating after two commercial flights aborted landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport due to an Army helicopter entering restricted airspace. The FAA had restricted nonessential helicopter traffic around the airport after a fatal midair collision in January. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed outrage, while Senator Ted Cruz called for legislation to improve civilian air safety. The Army stated the helicopter was directed by Pentagon air traffic control to conduct a go-around.</p>

          <p>During the Pacific Palisades fire, water supplies ran dry, partly because the Santa Ynez Reservoir was shut down for repairs. Records reveal that Los Angeles officials had attempted to revive an old reservoir to supplement water capacity, but the plan was never completed due to safety concerns. The smaller tanks relied upon were quickly depleted, leaving firefighters with dry hydrants. The inability to utilize the extra reservoir capacity potentially exacerbated the situation, with legal claims now centering on the water supply issues.</p>
