          <p>Alaska Airlines requested a nationwide ground stop for all its flights and those of its partner, Horizon Air, due to a significant IT system outage. The issue, which began Sunday evening, disrupted operations and caused widespread delays. The airline apologized for the inconvenience to travelers, advising them to check their flight status before heading to the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the ground stop as the airline worked to resolve the technical problems and manage the subsequent operational impacts.</p>

          <p>A new provision enacted by the Trump administration will require visitors needing nonimmigrant visas to pay a mandatory $250 "visa integrity fee." This charge is in addition to existing visa application fees and applies to tourists, business travelers, and international students. While the fee is potentially reimbursable if visa conditions are met, the process for reimbursement is unclear, leading immigration experts to advise treating it as nonrefundable. The policy aims to enhance immigration system integrity but has raised concerns among travel associations about its implementation and potential impact on tourism.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the 44-year-old brother of the late U.S. Army Ranger and NFL player Pat Tillman, has been arrested in connection with a fire at a San Jose post office. Authorities allege he intentionally reversed a vehicle into the building's lobby and set it on fire, causing a total loss. Investigators also found the phrase "Viva La Me" spray-painted on the building's exterior, though its meaning is unclear. The motive for the incident remains under investigation as Tillman awaits his court appearance.</p>

          <p>The struggling Chinese city of Hegang, located in a rust-belt region, is embarking on a major infrastructure project to build a new airport. With an estimated investment of 1.2 billion yuan, the Luobei Airport is scheduled to open in 2027 and is expected to handle 450,000 passengers annually. This initiative is a key part of the city's strategy to reverse its economic decline, which has been marked by a shrinking population and decreasing GDP. The airport aims to improve connectivity and foster trade, particularly with neighboring Russia, as a catalyst for regional revival.</p>

          <p>Companies in China are engaged in fierce price wars across various sectors, from electric vehicles to food delivery, driven by increased consumer price sensitivity following the pandemic.

Despite the significant political setback, Ishiba has stated he has no intention of resigning, emphasizing his focus on pressing issues like trade negotiations. The election results reflect voter frustration with the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner over rising living costs and other economic challenges. This loss of majority will likely weaken the government's ability to pass legislation and could lead to political instability within the ruling party.</p>

To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to find solutions. Analysis reveals that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed, low earners, and certain ethnic groups, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on strategies to close this growing retirement savings gap and ensure future financial security.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 2013 case of Nickey Van Exel, son of former NBA star Nick Van Exel, who was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the 2010 murder of his childhood friend, Bradley Eyo. Nickey claimed the shooting was accidental, but prosecutors argued he was motivated by fear that Eyo would expose their alleged involvement in robberies. During the trial, Nick Van Exel gave an emotional testimony, apologizing to the victim's family while maintaining his belief that the death was an accident. The tragedy underscores the profound and lasting impact of the event on both families involved.</p>

          <p>Xiang Jingen, the founder and CEO of Chinese quantum computing firm SpinQ, believes the technology is on the verge of a major breakthrough, predicting it will cross the threshold of practical "usefulness" within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the Shenzhen-based company develops both small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful industrial-grade systems. Xiang compares the current state of quantum computing to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, suggesting a period of rapid advancement and transition is imminent as the technology matures and becomes more broadly applicable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's mass deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the policy. This shift is driven by a growing perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than anticipated. While the president's political base remains strongly supportive, approval among the broader public, including Hispanic Americans, has declined. The survey also indicates that Americans want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on deportation or tariffs, reflecting ongoing economic anxieties.</p>

          <p>In one of the deadliest days for civilians seeking aid during the war, at least 85 Palestinians were killed at various locations across Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The largest number of casualties occurred in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, where a U.N. aid convoy encountered massive crowds that came under fire. Witnesses claimed Israeli forces shot into the crowd, while the Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to disperse a threatening gathering.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now billions over budget and years behind schedule, is cited as a prime example of how not to manage major infrastructure. Insiders and analysts suggest the project was troubled from its inception due to a combination of overly ambitious technical specifications, such as aiming for the world's fastest trains, and a complex, costly planning process. The UK's unique geography and democratic system, which allows for extensive local opposition and requires numerous compromises, added immense costs and delays. This has led to questions about whether such large-scale projects are fundamentally unworkable in Britain without major reforms.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will launch a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved violent clashes between thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what was later described as discredited evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for decades, expressed cautious elation at the long-awaited announcement.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since the peak of Tiger Woods, drawing frequent comparisons to the legend. His consistent, machine-like performance and ability to close out tournaments from a leading position set him apart from his peers. While Scheffler himself dismisses the comparisons as premature, his record of four major wins and numerous PGA tour victories in the last four seasons tells a story of remarkable command. Analysts point to his unflappable mental game and recent improvements in his putting as key factors in his ascent to undisputed world number one.</p>
