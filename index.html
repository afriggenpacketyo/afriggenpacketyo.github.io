          <p>A maritime convoy, featuring activist Greta Thunberg and actor Liam Cunningham, has departed from Spain carrying humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip. The flotilla aims to challenge the Israeli blockade and deliver essential supplies like food and medicine to the territory, where food experts have warned of famine conditions. Organizers state the convoy includes about 20 boats with delegations from 44 countries, with more expected to join en route. This is not Thunberg's first attempt to reach Gaza, as she was previously deported during a similar effort in June.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the U.S. government from deporting 10 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The order, which lasts for 14 days, responds to a legal challenge from immigration advocacy groups who argue the removals would violate U.S. laws protecting vulnerable minors. The lawsuit contends that the children, aged 10 to 17, could face abuse, persecution, or torture if returned to Guatemala. The planned deportations are part of a broader immigration crackdown initiated after Donald Trump returned to office.</p>

          <p>An infant has died in the United Kingdom after contracting whooping cough, marking the country's first fatal case of the infection this year. According to the UK Health Security Agency, the baby's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during her pregnancy. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for protecting newborns in their first weeks of life, as infants do not receive their first jab until eight weeks old. The tragic event has amplified government warnings about declining vaccine uptake and the rise of vaccine hesitancy.</p>

The raids occurred as the rebels increased security following an Israeli airstrike that killed the Houthi prime minister and several cabinet members. The UN condemned the arbitrary detention of humanitarian staff, noting it is the latest in a series of actions by the Houthis against international organizations. The incident escalates tensions in the region, where the Houthis have been attacking Israel and Red Sea shipping.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore addressed his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump over crime rates in Baltimore, stating he is interested in "fighting for my communities," not with the president. The dispute escalated after Trump called Baltimore a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore described as "performative." While acknowledging there is more work to do, Moore highlighted the city's recent drop in crime and criticized the president's "arrogant criticism and cynicism."

          <p>European Union foreign ministers convened for informal talks to brainstorm new avenues of support for Ukraine amidst the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas discussed were the potential implementation of secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and a plan to establish Ukrainian arms production facilities on EU soil as a "safe haven." Ministers also revisited the contentious topic of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv's reconstruction efforts. Another proposal involves shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops from Poland and Germany onto Ukrainian soil following a potential ceasefire.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Céline Gounder discussed the significant leadership vacuum at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), warning that it affects all Americans. She noted the recent ouster of the director and other key officials has created a situation where vaccine policy is now being driven by "political fiat" rather than a transparent scientific process. Dr. Gounder expressed concern that upcoming meetings could see unprecedented changes to long-standing recommendations for childhood vaccines and COVID-19 shots. This turmoil is already causing confusion for the public, pharmacies, and doctors' offices.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a lackluster 0-0 draw, a result described as one of the worst in recent memory. While Rangers showed fight and resilience, earning a much-needed clean sheet, the draw marks their worst start to a league season since 1983. Celtic, despite returning to the top of the league table, delivered a feeble offensive performance, failing to create significant chances and registering an expected goals (xG) of just 0.17. The match highlighted significant issues for both clubs, with managers from both sides acknowledging the poor quality of play.</p>

This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 advanced anti-submarine frigates.

          <p>A massive kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by removing nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins from the ocean floor. Over the past 13 years, divers led by The Bay Foundation have cleared over 80 acres, allowing the once-decimated "sequoias of the sea" to thrive again. The kelp forests, vital for storing carbon and providing habitat for hundreds of marine species, had declined by 80% due to an explosion in the urchin population. The effort is now being viewed as a potential model for restoring underwater ecosystems in other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>Forty years after his historic discovery of the RMS Titanic, ocean explorer Bob Ballard reflects on the mission and his ongoing career in deep-sea exploration. The 1985 expedition was famously a cover for a top-secret U.S. Navy mission to survey sunken nuclear submarines, a context that shaped his search strategy. Ballard realized he should look for the ship's debris field, a much larger target, which led to the breakthrough. The technology developed for that search has since revolutionized ocean science, and at 83, Ballard is still actively exploring, recently mapping WWII wrecks in the Pacific.</p>

Calling the 7-4 decision "weaponized partisan injustice," Navarro warned that if the ruling is upheld by the Supreme Court, "it will be the end of the United States." The court found that Trump had overstepped his presidential authority in levying the duties, placing a key part of his economic agenda in jeopardy. The tariffs will remain in effect until October 14 to allow time for a Supreme Court appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS News is mourning the loss of veteran correspondent Mark Knoller, who passed away this weekend after a 32-year career with the network. Knoller was revered in Washington as the unofficial record-keeper of presidential statistics, meticulously logging every trip, speech, and public comment made by the sitting president. His colleagues remember him not only for his encyclopedic knowledge and distinctive radio voice but also for his generosity and selfless nature. He was considered an essential resource by fellow journalists and even the White House itself, which would often call him to verify presidential facts and figures.</p>

          <p>Swimming advisories have been issued for beaches across the United States for the Labor Day holiday weekend due to unsafe levels of bacteria associated with fecal contamination. Popular destinations from Florida to Maine and California are affected, with health officials warning that the bacteria can cause gastrointestinal illnesses, rashes, and nausea. A recent report from Environment America found that 61% of U.S. beaches tested experienced at least one day of potentially unsafe fecal contamination. The primary sources of the pollution are cited as polluted runoff, failing sewer systems, and industrial livestock operations.</p>

          <h2>Retailers Warn Consumers of Continued Price Hikes Due to Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 10:41:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major U.S. retailers and food companies are warning that the financial impact of tariffs is increasingly being passed on to consumers through higher prices. Companies like Walmart and J.M. Smucker have indicated that as they replenish inventory at post-tariff costs, price increases on groceries, electronics, and home goods will continue into the coming months. The situation is compounded by a recent federal appeals court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's global tariffs, creating further uncertainty for businesses. This pricing pressure is forcing consumers, particularly lower-income households, to alter their shopping habits and seek more value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been contacted about any such deployment, which follows the use of federal agents and National Guard troops in other cities like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. The governor accused the president of having ulterior motives beyond fighting crime, suggesting it could be part of a plan to disrupt future elections. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker for deflecting from Chicago's crime crisis.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, who recently turned 80, has released a new album of re-recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival hits after a long and painful legal battle to regain control of his own songs. For decades, Fogerty felt he had lost his musical legacy, even stopping performing his classic songs like "Proud Mary" and "Fortunate Son" for a period. Encouraged by his wife Julie, he not only bought back the rights to his catalog but also recorded the new versions with his sons, Shane and Tyler, who are part of his touring band. He describes the process as revisiting the feelings he had when he first wrote the iconic tracks.</p>

          <p>Two climate activists were arrested after smearing red and black paint on Barcelona's iconic Sagrada Familia basilica. The protest, organized by the group Futuro Vegetal, was intended to express outrage over devastating summer wildfires in Spain and what they call the government's insufficient action on climate change. The group highlighted the connection between livestock farming and the prevalence of wildfires, which have ravaged nearly a million acres across Spain this year. This act is the latest in a series of similar demonstrations by the group, which has previously targeted artworks and private property to draw attention to the climate emergency.</p>

          <p>A new report from FlexJobs has identified the leading job sectors offering remote, part-time work, with education, healthcare, and project management topping the list. The analysis of over 60,000 companies found that roles such as licensed therapist, career consultant, and nurse practitioner are among the most common opportunities. Career experts note that such positions are in high demand as they allow workers to supplement their income, upskill, or explore new career paths without committing to a full-time role. The number of remote, part-time jobs in mental health, project management, and administrative fields saw a 27% increase over the past year.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the ten-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy, prompted by wars in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, has had a profound and lasting impact on German society and politics. A decade later, the nation is taking stock of both the successes and challenges of integration. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave had found employment by 2022, debates over immigration, social cohesion, and resource allocation continue to dominate the national conversation.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Arch Manning had a difficult debut as the full-time starter for the No. 1 ranked Texas Longhorns, losing 14-7 to Ohio State. Manning accepted blame for the loss, stating "I've got to play better for us to win," after completing 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Head coach Steve Sarkisian defended his young quarterback, criticizing the "out of control" external expectations placed upon him. Sarkisian urged patience, stating that this game was just the first chapter in a long season and that people should wait to "finish the book before we judge it."</p>

          <p>An investigation into heat-related deaths in Arizona reveals a disturbing trend of fatalities occurring indoors, often due to broken or unaffordable air conditioning. The report highlights the case of Richard Chamblee, a 52-year-old bed-bound man who died just two days after his mobile home's AC failed during a 115°F heatwave. Many victims are low-income, elderly, or sick residents living in poorly insulated homes, who cannot afford repairs or rising electricity bills. Experts warn that as climate change intensifies heatwaves, such preventable deaths could surge, exacerbated by financial hardship and cuts to social safety nets.</p>

          <p>A woman in Llanharan, Wales, had a surprising experience while pet-sitting her brother's pregnant Labrador, Tilly, who went into labor a week earlier than expected. The dog, initially thought to be carrying about six puppies, gave birth to a massive litter of 14 over a 15-hour period while her owner was on holiday abroad. The pet sitter, Rhian Boxall, described the event as a "rollercoaster of emotions," successfully saving one pup born outside in the garden with advice from an emergency vet. Twelve of the fourteen puppies survived, and the owner returned from his trip to a much larger canine family than he had anticipated.</p>
