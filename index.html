        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump authorized the deployment of 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles, escalating the federal response to protests over immigration enforcement. California Governor Newsom, who is suing Trump over the initial deployment, criticized the move as an ego-driven stunt disrespectful to the troops. The Defense Department has also mobilized Marines to support the National Guard, while Trump has voiced support for arresting Newsom over obstruction of federal immigration enforcement. The ACLU condemned Trump's actions, questioning the training of the Marines for policing protests while respecting constitutional rights, as the legal battle between California and the federal government intensifies. Optimism for the resolution of the conflict is somewhat tempered by the escalating rhetoric and actions from both sides.</p>

          <p>National Guard and Marine personnel deployed to Los Angeles amidst protests are operating under specific rules of force, prioritizing the protection of federal buildings and personnel without engaging crowds unless necessary. Troops are carrying weapons, but their guns are not loaded with ammunition, and they are instructed to de-escalate situations. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the need for clear coordination among all agencies to ensure a lawful and orderly response. Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Edmonds raised concerns about the ambiguity of the military's role in relation to law enforcement. The troops are led by Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman and have been trained in de-escalation and crowd control.</p>

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard to Los Angeles, characterizing it as an "unprecedented power grab". The lawsuit asserts that President Trump bypassed Governor Newsom by placing the National Guard under federal control without his consent, arguing that the situation does not constitute a "rebellion" as defined by the relevant law. Attorney General Bonta contends that the federalization of the National Guard deprives the state of essential resources and increases tension, while Newsom accuses Trump of escalating the situation for political purposes. The lawsuit aims to ensure that civil authorities, rather than military forces, govern the state.</p>

          <p>A former chair of the Environment Agency is warning about the risks of spreading sewage sludge containing toxic chemicals on farmers' fields, highlighting the failure of successive governments to address the issue. The sludge, used as a cheap fertilizer, may contain cancer-linked "forever chemicals", microplastics, and other industrial pollutants. Documents indicate increasing concern within the water industry that farmers may reject the sludge, prompting lobbying efforts and contingency plans. The former chair says efforts to update regulations have been continually frustrated, leading to calls for immediate action to protect soil and the food chain from long-term contamination.</p>

Scientists who signed the letter say they have tried to raise concerns internally without success, particularly as Bhattacharya is set to testify on the NIH budget.

Mark Davids, co-head of Asia-Pacific equities, says investors need to carefully screen stocks and sectors to pick winners, as the return on equity is faltering. While Chinese stocks have rallied this year, global investors remain underweight, and an improvement in the profitability of Chinese companies is needed for a re-rating. The aggregate annual expected return of Chinese stocks is around 10 per cent, which is not as compelling as the historic average. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Families and lawyers are facing difficulties in contacting workers arrested in recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, with reports of detainees being held in deplorable conditions without food, water, or beds. Some of those arrested were almost immediately deported to Mexico without paperwork, while others were taken to detention centers in California and Texas. The ACLU held a rally demanding humane treatment and access to lawyers for all detainees, and lawyers argue that the workplace raids violate a federal judge's injunction forbidding warrantless immigration stops. The raids come amid a broader push to speed up arrests and deportations.</p>

          <p>WWE's Worlds Collide event, a crossover with AAA, broke records for live viewership on YouTube, celebrating Mexican lucha libre. The event was well-received, with the transmission viewed by over 4.1 million people in the first 24 hours. However, the Money in the Bank ladder matches were controversial, particularly the men's match, which saw Seth Rollins win despite fan support for LA Knight. The unexpected return of R-Truth at Money in the Bank added excitement and appeased fans, as WWE may have reconsidered letting him go after seeing the negative reaction.</p>

          <p>Dr. Phil's presence during ICE raids in Los Angeles, where he interviewed Trump's border czar, has raised questions about his role in shaping the narrative around immigration policy. As a television personality and Trump supporter, his involvement is seen as part of a broader effort to normalize the administration's divisive policies. Critics argue that his presence highlights the spectacle surrounding the raids, with his media company promoting a conservative perspective. The situation has sparked concerns about the politicization of immigration enforcement and the use of reality TV tactics to shape public opinion.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is in recovery mode after a weekend of protests against President Trump's immigration policies and the deployment of the National Guard, with city workers cleaning up graffiti and damage. Demonstrations, which were mostly peaceful, were marred by vandalism and violence, including rocks thrown onto police vehicles and Waymo cars set on fire. The National Guard was largely absent from policing the protests, while city officials and union leaders gathered to demand the release of a labor leader arrested during an immigration raid. The situation remains tense as the city addresses the aftermath of the protests.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed Â£14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Reeves hailed the project as a landmark decision to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Miliband said nuclear energy would deliver a golden age of clean energy abundance. However, the project faces opposition from groups like Stop Sizewell C, who believe it is a costly mistake that will add to consumer bills. The investment is part of a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric car manufacturers are expanding into global markets, offering cheaper alternatives but raising concerns about security risks and competition for established automakers. BYD, the biggest player in China, is launching the Dolphin Surf in Europe, priced around Â£18,000. Concerns have been raised about potential hacking and spyware risks associated with Chinese-made vehicles, with some experts suggesting that Chinese vehicles could represent a security risk from hackers and third parties. The US and EU have taken measures to address these concerns, while European manufacturers are racing to develop their own affordable electric cars.</p>

Cramer likens stablecoins to casino chips in the crypto space, explaining that they can be used to buy other crypto currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but retain their value.
