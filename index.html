          <p>Families of victims from the Cantor Fitzgerald company, which lost many employees in the 9/11 attacks, are appealing to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to advocate for the extradition of Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi national suspected of ties to the attackers, during upcoming economic talks with Saudi Arabia. The families cite newly unsealed evidence linking al-Bayoumi to the hijackers and express hope that Lutnick's position will help uncover the full truth about the attacks. They emphasize the importance of accountability and justice in any economic partnership with the kingdom, urging Lutnick to ensure al-Bayoumi faces justice in an American court. Lutnick, who lost his brother in the attacks, has been a staunch supporter of the victims' families.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a dispute that strained relations between the two countries. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple in Tsushima, Nagasaki Prefecture, was handed over to temple representatives in South Korea after South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership. The artifact, designated as a cultural asset, is expected to be stored at a museum following a ceremony at the temple. The statue's return marks the end of a legal battle that began when a South Korean temple claimed it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to stop covering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy, despite research indicating Zepbound's superior weight loss results, is forcing many Americans to switch medications. This decision highlights the influence of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and their secret deals with drugmakers, leading to insurance denials that limit patients' treatment options. While Caremark claims the move will lower drug prices, doctors and patients express concern over the reduced ability to tailor prescriptions and the potential for less effective treatment. The article highlights the growing trend of PBMs excluding medications from their formularies, disrupting treatments and upsetting patients.</p>

          <p>The first group of white South Africans, granted refugee status under a program initiated by former US President Donald Trump, have arrived in the United States. The program offers resettlement to Afrikaners, a white ethnic minority, who claim to face government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including property confiscation. This initiative, fueled by claims of persecution against white South Africans, contrasts with the Trump administration's general stance on refugee admissions. While critics argue that Afrikaners remain privileged in South Africa, the Trump administration asserts that they face discrimination and property confiscation due to land expropriation laws.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to Gulf states, a key objective is to secure substantial new investments in the US economy, particularly from sovereign wealth funds. The push comes amid economic challenges, including disruptions to global trade caused by new import tariffs. Trump aims to showcase his "America First" agenda by highlighting these investments and their potential for job creation and domestic manufacturing. Discussions are expected to focus on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors. While Trump courts Gulf capital, Saudi Arabia also seeks American investment in its Vision 2030 program.</p>

          <p>Researchers are developing technologies, including spinal cord stimulators and "digital bridges," to help people with spinal cord injuries regain movement and bodily functions. The digital bridge, which wirelessly connects an implant on the brain to a spinal cord stimulator, has enabled some paralyzed patients to move their limbs using their thoughts. The article highlights the potential for these technologies to improve blood pressure regulation, bladder function, and mobility in individuals with spinal cord injuries and even Parkinson's disease. While these technologies are still in early clinical trials, they offer hope for restoring a range of critical functions for those with paralysis.</p>

          <p>While it's generally safe to mix motor oil from different brands, it's not ideal and shouldn't be a regular practice. The primary concern is ensuring the viscosity grades are the same to maintain proper engine lubrication. Different brands may contain different additives, and mixing them could potentially affect engine performance over time. The article emphasizes that topping off oil is a temporary solution and regular oil changes are crucial for engine health.</p>
