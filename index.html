          <p>The threat of flash flooding is expected to return to parts of the Southwest U.S., particularly southern California and Arizona, due to incoming monsoonal moisture. This follows recent deadly floods in the region where a two-year-old was swept away in Barstow, California. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to strengthen and is projected to become the second hurricane of the season. While not expected to make landfall in the U.S., Gabrielle will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>A public memorial for assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk is set to draw over 100,000 people to State Farm Stadium in Arizona, with President Trump and Vice President JD Vance scheduled to speak. Security is at its highest level, comparable to a Super Bowl, following the arrest of an armed man near the venue who was charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer. The event has prompted calls for unity from some political figures, while also highlighting deep divisions in political rhetoric following Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>Efforts by the Trump administration to initiate trilateral nuclear disarmament talks involving China have been firmly rejected by Beijing, creating an impasse for future arms control. China maintains that its nuclear arsenal is at a minimum level for national security and that it will not engage in an arms race. This refusal complicates the potential extension of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) between the U.S. and Russia. The situation raises concerns among analysts about the possibility of a renewed nuclear arms race among the world's major powers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, a program heavily utilized by technology companies to hire high-skilled foreign workers. The executive order has been criticized by some as a blow to the tech industry, which has recently attempted to cultivate a better relationship with the president. Proponents of the change argue it will prevent employers from using the program to replace American workers with lower-paid labor, addressing long-standing critiques of the visa system. The move reflects a significant overhaul of U.S. immigration policy for skilled workers. (not investment advice)</p>

The move has drawn criticism from the Israeli government and some UK Conservatives, who argue it rewards terrorism.

The move comes amid tense trade negotiations between the U.S. and India, following recent U.S. tariffs. The White House has clarified the fee applies only to new applicants, not renewals, but the abruptness of the policy has been widely criticized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern Inyo Healthcare District, a small hospital in Lone Pine, California, is on the brink of financial collapse, with only days of cash on hand. As the only hospital in a nearly 60-mile radius serving residents and tourists visiting Mt. Whitney and Death Valley, its potential closure would create a "medical desert." Local officials have requested an emergency $3 million from the state to stabilize its finances, citing rising operational costs and the depletion of pandemic-era funds. The situation reflects a broader crisis facing rural hospitals across the country, which are struggling to remain solvent.</p>

          <p>A chaotic qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was marked by a record six red flags after more than a quarter of the drivers crashed on the difficult Baku street circuit. Challenging conditions, including strong winds and light rain, contributed to the numerous incidents.

They will start the race in seventh and ninth place respectively, creating an unpredictable and mixed-up grid for the main event.</p>

          <p>With a federal government shutdown deadline of September 30 approaching, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have formally requested a meeting with President Trump. In their letter, they accuse Republican leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan negotiations to keep the government funded. Both parties appear determined to blame the other for a potential shutdown after competing short-term spending bills failed in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated he is open to a meeting but believes there is little to discuss.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with sanctuary states, warning California, New York, and Illinois that they could face lawsuits and loss of federal funding for not honoring ICE detainers. In letters, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons accused the states of obstructing federal immigration enforcement by refusing to hold undocumented migrants for federal agents. The states have laws limiting cooperation with ICE, citing constitutional concerns and the goal of building trust with immigrant communities. The Trump administration argues these policies release dangerous individuals and force ICE to conduct more raids in public spaces.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used its new "golden share" authority to stop U.S. Steel from closing its Granite City, Illinois, plant. The company had planned to idle operations, affecting nearly 800 workers, but reversed its decision after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened. This authority, giving the White House veto power over major company decisions, was a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon. It marks the first time the administration has exercised these national-security-related powers, demonstrating a more direct government hand in the private sector.</p>
