          <p>Construction has officially begun on an $8 billion luxury resort in Singapore, a new venture by Las Vegas Sands that will exist as a separate identity from the iconic Marina Bay Sands. The project features a 55-story all-suite hotel, high-end retail, gaming facilities, and a 15,000-seat arena. This development, which includes a rooftop public space with an observation deck and gardens, aligns with Singapore's long-term tourism strategy to attract more high-value leisure and business travelers. The new resort is a significant investment aimed at bolstering the city-state's appeal as a world-class destination.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever were defeated by the New York Liberty 98-77 in their final game before the All-Star break, playing without star rookie Caitlin Clark due to a groin injury. This marks Clark's second groin-related issue this season, raising questions about her availability for the upcoming All-Star weekend, where she is slated to be a team captain and 3-point contest participant. Fever coach Stephanie White emphasized the team's need to build consistency and mental toughness in the face of adversity. The loss drops the Fever's record to 4-6 in games played without Clark.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched significant airstrikes against Syrian government targets in Damascus and southern Syria for a third consecutive day, stating the action is to protect the Druze minority. The intervention comes amid intense sectarian violence in Suweida province between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes, which has reportedly killed over 350 people. While Israel claims its goal is to force Syrian military withdrawal from the region, Syria's interim government has accused Israel of a large-scale escalation. The United States announced that "specific steps" have been agreed upon to end the violence.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated his ambition to supply China with more advanced chips than the current-generation H20, which was designed to comply with U.S. export controls. His comments in Beijing came after Nvidia resumed sales of the H20 chip to China, seeking to revitalize its business in the major market. Huang argued that as technology evolves, the chips available to China should also improve over time. The statement highlights the delicate balance Nvidia navigates between adhering to U.S. government restrictions and capitalizing on the significant Chinese AI market.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that a key national fentanyl overdose prevention program, facing a $140 million funding shortfall, will have its congressionally allocated money disbursed "in increments" rather than as a single annual payment. This change to the Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) program has sparked concern among CDC staffers and state health officials, who fear delays and operational chaos. They argue that the uncertainty makes it difficult to manage contracts and services, potentially triggering layoffs and program shutdowns at a critical time in the overdose crisis.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially canceled $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, a move state leaders have called illegal and politically motivated. The Federal Railroad Administration cited the project's mismanagement, delays, and budget overruns as the reason for pulling the funds. Governor Gavin Newsom vowed to fight the decision, stating that California is building America's only high-speed rail and will not let the administration abandon the project. This action represents a major financial blow to the already beleaguered infrastructure plan.</p>

Investigators believe the suspect gained entry through an unlocked door and that the killings were a random act of violence.

The research identified allergenic substances in the pollen of the artemisia plant family, which is widely used in the project due to its low cost and ease of cultivation. While the program is successful in combating desertification across northern China, this unintended consequence has led to worsening allergy symptoms, including asthma, for many residents in the region.</p>

          <p>A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging an unlawful, coordinated practice of arresting people at their own immigration court hearings. The lawsuit asserts that this tactic violates due process rights by turning courthouses into traps for immigrants who are attempting to comply with their legal obligations. The plaintiffs, many of whom were seeking asylum, argue that the policy is designed to instill fear and fast-track deportations without fair hearings, undermining the justice system.</p>
