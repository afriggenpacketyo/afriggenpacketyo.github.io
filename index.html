          <p>Portugal has announced it will officially recognize a Palestinian state, joining a growing number of Western nations shifting their policy. This move comes as the war in Gaza continues and ahead of the UN General Assembly. The decision has been denounced by Israel and its ally, the United States, who argue that it rewards terrorism following the Hamas-led attack in 2023. Approximately three-quarters of UN members already recognize Palestinian statehood, a status granted non-member observer state rights in 2012.</p>

          <p>AI tools are increasingly being adopted by companies to automate tasks and reduce employee burnout, with some studies showing a drop in emotional exhaustion. Tools like ChatGPT can act as assistants, handling repetitive work and allowing for early intervention when employees show signs of stress. However, other research suggests that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout, as the technology can lead to increased workloads and the pressure to be constantly productive. The effectiveness of AI in mitigating burnout appears to depend heavily on its implementation and the company's culture.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a plan to open police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this would increase police visibility, build public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. To fund this "police desk promise," the Lib Dems suggest abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles, which they claim would free up sufficient funds. The announcement was made at the party's annual conference as part of a broader strategy to appeal to voters concerned about community policing.</p>

UESTC is on the US "entity list" due to concerns about its connections to the Chinese military, making the move significant amid US-China tech competition.

The incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, prompting a major police response. West Midlands Police have since arrested three individuals in their 20s and 30s on suspicion of violent disorder after their vehicle was stopped on the M6 motorway. Authorities have cordoned off a major city route for investigation and are appealing to the public for any information or footage from inside the venue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The administration claims the measure is designed to curb "abuse" of the program and encourage companies to hire American workers first. Critics, particularly from small businesses and the tech industry, argue the exorbitant fee will price them out of attracting essential global talent and harm American competitiveness. The move represents a significant shift from previous H-1B policies and is expected to have a major impact on immigration for skilled professionals.</p>

          <p>Russia is launching its own version of the Eurovision Song Contest, a revived Soviet-era competition called Intervision. Positioned as a conservative alternative, the event aims to promote "traditional values" in contrast to what Moscow views as the West's liberal and LGBTQ+-friendly Eurovision. Artists from Russia have been banned from Eurovision since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Twenty-three countries, including BRICS members like China and Brazil, are participating in the contest, which the Kremlin hopes will reinforce its cultural and geopolitical alliances outside of Europe.</p>

This incident is the latest in a series of provocations, following recent Russian drone incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace.

          <p>A 45-year-old hiker from Argentina has died after falling approximately 2,000 feet down the Wintun Glacier on Mount Shasta in Northern California. The hiker, Matias Augusto Travizano, had successfully reached the summit but lost the trail during his descent and attempted a controlled slide down an ice sheet. He lost control, collided with a boulder, and ultimately slid to his death. This marks another fatality on the mountain's Clear Creek Trail, which, despite being considered the easiest route, presents significant dangers, especially in poor visibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Speaker of the UK's House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has expressed serious concern that Parliament is vulnerable to espionage after charges against two men accused of spying for China were dropped. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) stated that the "evidential threshold" had not been met to proceed with the case under the Official Secrets Act. Sir Lindsay voiced his deep unhappiness with the decision, suggesting it leaves the door open for foreign actors and indicating he is considering a private action against the individuals. The two men had consistently denied the allegations.</p>

          <p>The High Seas Treaty, a landmark global agreement to protect marine biodiversity in international waters, is set to come into force after receiving its 60th ratification. The treaty, two decades in the making, will allow for the creation of marine protected areas in the high seas, which cover over two-thirds of the world's oceans. Environmental groups have hailed this as a monumental achievement, providing a legal framework to protect 30% of these waters by 2030. This is a critical step toward reversing damage from overfishing, pollution, and climate change in ecosystems beyond national jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his position. His departure follows reports that federal prosecutors were concerned he could be fired for not bringing a mortgage fraud case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. President Trump fueled these concerns by publicly stating, "Yeah, I want him out," citing Siebert's support from Democratic senators. The case against James was referred by a Trump ally, and her office has called the allegations baseless and politically motivated revenge for her successful lawsuit against the Trump Organization.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has sharply criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Brendan Carr for his role in the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared Carr's threat to review ABC's broadcast license over Kimmel's monologue about the slain activist Charlie Kirk to tactics used by the mafia. While stating he was "thrilled" Kimmel was disciplined, Cruz warned that the government using its power to regulate speech is "dangerous as hell" and could set a precedent that would be used against conservatives in the future. President Trump defended the FCC chairman, stating he disagrees with Cruz's assessment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leading Japanese defense researcher has warned that declining U.S. engagement with India and other regional partners is creating a strategic opening for China in Asia. Speaking at a forum, the researcher highlighted the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad)—comprising the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia—as a key diplomatic tool for balancing against China. However, the perceived waning interest from the Trump administration and a deteriorating U.S.-India partnership are seen from a Japanese perspective as a potentially dangerous development for regional stability. This erosion of American-led alliances is a significant concern for Tokyo's foreign policy.</p>
