          <p>Two police officers who defended the Capitol during the January 6, 2021, attack have filed a federal civil lawsuit, seeking a court order to hang a plaque honoring police heroes. The lawsuit cites a 2022 law requiring the plaque's installation by March 2023, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to doing so. The officers argue that the failure to hang the plaque violates the Equal Protection clause, particularly given President Trump's downplaying of the attack and Republican leaders' actions. The plaque remains in storage, fueling disputes over Trump's pardons and the lack of Republican commemorations.</p>
