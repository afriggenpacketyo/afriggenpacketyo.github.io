          <p>Over 365 people were arrested in London for participating in a demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed by the UK government under the Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of individuals display signs of support, leading to mass arrests by the Metropolitan Police for supporting a banned organization. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing security advice and the group's history of serious attacks, while protesters argued the move is an authoritarian crackdown on free speech and democracy.</p>

          <p>Following a stellar two-touchdown preseason debut for the Cleveland Browns, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders confronted ESPN reporter Tony Grossi about what he perceived as consistently negative coverage. In a video, Sanders sarcastically asked the reporter when he would write something positive, though the interaction ended with a laugh. Grossi later praised Sanders' performance on-air, stating the rookie was "outstanding" and had put pressure on the other quarterbacks, intensifying the team's quarterback competition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bollywood's depiction of Kashmir has evolved significantly, moving from a scenic, romantic backdrop in post-independence films to a contentious political landscape. The armed insurgency of the 1990s marked a turning point, with films like "Roja" portraying the region as a conflict zone. In recent years, following India's abrogation of Article 370, films such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370" have increasingly aligned with the Indian government's nationalist narrative, reflecting a more statist perspective.</p>

          <p>In a potential sign of easing tensions, the South Korean military has detected North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers after its new president, Lee Jae Myung, halted anti-Pyongyang broadcasts. For months, the two nations had engaged in Cold War-style psychological warfare, with the North blasting irritating sounds in response to the South's K-pop and propaganda messages.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is structured in a way that overwhelmingly favors Moscow. The article argues that a proposed deal involving Ukraine ceding territory in exchange for a ceasefire would be a victory for Putin, allowing him to gain land without a fight and use the pause to regroup militarily. European allies and Ukraine are wary, fearing a repeat of past failed agreements and a slow, diplomatic defeat for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denies any conspiracy to destroy her predecessor, Alex Salmond, and accuses him of failing to show contrition for his behavior towards women. Sturgeon writes that Salmond was prepared to destroy the SNP rather than see it succeed without him and that her refusal to intervene in the investigation into allegations against him made their political breakup inevitable. She describes the fallout as a form of "mortal political combat" and reflects on the personal grief of losing him as a friend.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans Roman Catholic archdiocese has outlined a proposed settlement in its bankruptcy case that would use a point system to compensate survivors of clergy abuse. Points would be assigned based on the severity of the abuse, such as sexual assault receiving 75 points, but the monetary value of each point remains unclear. The plan requires approval from two-thirds of voting survivors, but it faces strong opposition from some attorneys who believe their clients could receive more through individual lawsuits.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James, ordering her to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump. This move is being widely condemned by James's office and her lawyer as a blatant act of political retribution carried out by the Trump administration. They argue that weaponizing the justice system to retaliate against a state official for investigating the president's business practices should disturb every American.</p>

          <p>An investigation based on documents obtained after a six-year legal battle has revealed that a Royal Navy nuclear weapons base at Coulport, Scotland, repeatedly leaked radioactive water into a loch. The leaks of water containing low levels of tritium were caused by the navy's failure to properly maintain old pipes. While the Ministry of Defence and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency insist there were no unsafe releases and the environmental risk was of "no regulatory concern," the secrecy surrounding the incidents has raised concerns.</p>

          <p>In a significant shift, prominent Democrats are now signaling a readiness to engage in their own partisan gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts, with one DNC leader stating, "We’re bringing a knife to a knife fight." This new, aggressive stance comes as a response to a push by Donald Trump and the GOP to redraw maps in states like Texas to gain more seats. Lifelong reform advocates like Eric Holder now argue that Democrats must "take up arms" against what they see as an authoritarian, anti-democracy effort.</p>

          <p>A development team has completed a $104 million project to transform the abandoned 19th-century campus of St. John's College in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, into a luxury apartment building.

The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, which will receive income from the property.</p>

          <p>According to nutrition experts, certain foods can significantly support skin health and promote a youthful appearance as you age. Foods rich in specific nutrients are highlighted, including edamame for its isoflavones, which may reduce wrinkles, and sweet potatoes and tomatoes for their carotenoids that protect against sun damage. Additionally, the omega-3 fatty acids in salmon can reduce inflammation, while the zinc in pumpkin seeds aids in wound healing and may help improve acne.</p>
