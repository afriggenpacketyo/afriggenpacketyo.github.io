          <p>A recent study published in *Pediatrics* reveals that medical guidance from 2015 recommending the early introduction of peanut products to infants has successfully prevented an estimated 60,000 cases of peanut allergies. This change in practice, which reversed decades of advice to delay exposure, has led to a significant decline in diagnoses among young children. Despite the success, adoption of the new guidelines by pediatricians has been slow, and overall food allergies in the U.S. continue to rise, affecting about 8% of children.</p>

          <p>France's justice minister has stated that security measures "failed" during a brazen daylight robbery at the Louvre, creating a "terrible image" for the country. Thieves stole priceless jewels from Napoleon's collection, and experts fear the items will be quickly dismantled and sold if not recovered within 48 hours. The incident has highlighted significant security vulnerabilities, with reports suggesting a lack of surveillance cameras in the affected wing and a recently broken alarm system. Officials are concerned the crime was orchestrated by organized criminals for money laundering purposes.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was tested as Israel launched deadly airstrikes after accusing Hamas of killing two of its soldiers with a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire. In response, Israel struck dozens of Hamas targets, resulting in at least 38 Palestinian deaths, and temporarily halted humanitarian aid. Hamas denied involvement in the attack, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire, while U.S. President Trump suggested internal "rebels" might be responsible. The violence complicates ongoing negotiations for the next phase of the peace plan.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, is reportedly planning to order an additional 15 F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. manufacturer Lockheed Martin, on top of 35 already requested. This move is part of Germany's significant expansion of its defense budget in response to the perceived threat of Russian aggression. The jets are intended to replace Germany's aging Tornado fleet and are capable of carrying U.S. nuclear bombs stored in the country. The additional aircraft are expected to cost approximately €2.5 billion.</p>

          <p>Using a newly developed high-speed, high-resolution imaging technology, scientists in China have successfully captured the dynamic process of communication between neurons. This breakthrough allowed them to observe the "kiss-shrink-run" process of synaptic vesicles, the tiny structures that transmit signals in the brain. The achievement, published in the journal *Science*, helps to resolve a half-century-long scientific debate about the mechanics of neurotransmission. The technology provides an unprecedented view of processes that occur on both millisecond and nanometer scales.</p>

          <p>UK Housing Secretary Steve Reed has stated his job is "on the line" regarding the government's pledge to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next parliament. However, housing industry experts have expressed strong doubts, telling the BBC the target is "looking increasingly distant" and there is "absolutely no way" it will be met. The government plans to enforce faster adoption of local development plans by councils and reform rules around "grey belt" land to spur construction. The current building rate is about 200,000 homes per year, short of the 300,000 needed to meet the goal.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments concerning the legality of Alina Habba's position as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. A lower court judge previously ruled that President Trump's former lawyer was not lawfully serving in the role due to a "novel series of legal and personnel moves" used for her appointment. That ruling, which could void her actions since July, was put on hold pending the appeal. The Justice Department maintains her appointment is valid under federal statute, a stance being challenged by several individuals facing federal charges in the state.</p>

          <p>In a meticulously planned robbery, thieves disguised as construction workers used a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor gallery of the Louvre Museum and steal priceless jewels. The perpetrators broke a window with a power tool, smashed display cases, and made off with at least eight items from the collections of Napoleon and his wives before escaping on motorcycles. The entire heist took less than seven minutes, occurring just before the museum was scheduled to open. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed that the perpetrators will be caught and the heritage items recovered.</p>

          <p>In remarks to an International Monetary Fund committee, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the country's productivity challenges have been "compounded by the way in which the UK left the European Union." She cited the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast of a 4% long-term negative impact on the economy compared to remaining in the EU. This represents a significant shift in the government's rhetoric, openly acknowledging the economic downsides of the 2020 Brexit deal on a major international stage. The argument is expected to be a key element in the justification for potential tax rises in the upcoming budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 4.8% in the third quarter, aligning with analyst expectations but marking the slowest pace in a year. A significant point of concern was the unexpected 0.5% contraction in fixed-asset investment for the first nine months, described by one economist as "rare and alarming." The decline was driven by a persistent slump in the property sector and slowing spending on infrastructure. While industrial production exceeded expectations, the weakness in investment, particularly from the private sector, signals a lack of confidence and poses a risk to future growth.

          <p>A California Highway Patrol vehicle was hit by falling shrapnel from a 155mm artillery round that reportedly detonated prematurely over the I-5 freeway. The incident occurred during a live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton celebrating the U.S. Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, which necessitated a temporary freeway closure. No injuries were reported, but the CHP described the situation as "unusual and concerning" and called for a review of safety protocols. The Marine Corps has suspended further live fire over the freeway and launched an investigation into the cause of the premature detonation.</p>

This protein, which is also found in humans, appears to be exceptionally efficient in the rodents, contributing to their long lifespan of up to 37 years. The findings, published in the journal *Science*, suggest that understanding this molecular mechanism could inspire new anti-aging therapies for humans.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicated they may move to disqualify Patrick Fitzgerald, the lead defense attorney for former FBI Director James Comey, due to a potential conflict of interest. The issue stems from Fitzgerald's alleged role in helping Comey disclose memos to the media in 2017, shortly after Comey was fired by President Trump. Prosecutors argue that because Fitzgerald was involved in the disclosure of information later deemed classified, he may be unable to ethically represent Comey in his current criminal case.

The change follows several mystery drone sightings over British airbases used by U.S. forces last year.
