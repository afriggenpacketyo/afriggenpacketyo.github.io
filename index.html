          <p>Silicon Valley is experiencing a significant downturn as tech stocks plummet following President Trump's sweeping tariff plan, which imposed 10% tariffs on all US trading partners. The Nasdaq suffered its worst week since the Covid-19 pandemic began, with major tech companies losing a combined $1.8 trillion in market capitalization. Several companies, including Klarna and StubHub, have delayed their IPOs due to market instability. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E This situation has sparked concerns about a potential recession, prompting some tech leaders who previously supported Trump to defend their positions, while others remain silent. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella avoided expressing his views on the tariffs during the company's 50th-anniversary celebration. </p>

          <p>A new hacking technique called "doubleclickjacking" is putting user data at risk by exploiting the common action of double-clicking on websites. This method allows attackers to take control of accounts or change device settings by hiding malicious commands beneath legitimate buttons. Users may unknowingly grant permissions to access webcams, microphones, or approve transactions. The vulnerability is widespread and difficult to defend against, but users can protect themselves by being cautious about double-clicking, keeping browsers updated, using strong antivirus software, and limiting unnecessary permissions. </p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of 10% tariffs on all U.S. trading partners, followed by individualized rates for specific countries, triggered a significant sell-off in the stock market. China retaliated with 34% tariffs on all goods, and the European Union is considering countermeasures, leading to economic, market, and geopolitical uncertainty. Economists criticized the rudimentary math used to calculate the tariffs, which appear to punish high-deficit trading partners rather than those with the most restrictive trade regimes. The market responded by selling assets except bonds, as the tariffs make it difficult to predict future earnings, and the Federal Reserve indicated it would hold steady on interest rates. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is navigating the UK's response to Trump's tariffs by balancing caution with accelerated action. While the government is engaging with businesses to assess the impact of the tariffs, it is also hesitant to introduce retaliatory measures. Simultaneously, Starmer is pushing for faster implementation of existing plans, such as the Industrial Strategy, to mitigate potential economic harm. This approach reflects a broader effort to adapt to global uncertainties while maintaining a measured and strategic response. </p>

          <p>A new study suggests that older adults who receive a shingles vaccine may be 20% less likely to develop dementia. The study followed over 280,000 people in Wales and found a significant reduction in dementia risk among those who received the vaccine. Scientists theorize that the vaccine's impact on inflammation may play a role in preventing cognitive deterioration. This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that viral infections may be a cause of neurodegenerative diseases. </p>

          <p>A US neo-Nazi terrorist group with a Russia-based leader is calling for targeted assassinations and attacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine. The Base, founded in 2018, is seeking to destabilize the country as it carries out ceasefire negotiations with the Kremlin. The group is offering cash for volunteer operatives and recruits to carry out attacks on electric power stations, military vehicles, and government buildings.

          <p>The Trump administration is quietly working to reverse hundreds of bans on PFAS "forever chemicals" and other dangerous compounds in consumer goods. This effort involves changing how the EPA carries out chemical risk evaluations, which could preempt state laws that regulate toxic chemicals. Critics argue that this move would increase public exposure to chemicals linked to serious health issues. The plan could undo California’s Proposition 65 law and federal prohibitions, including a ban on asbestos. </p>
