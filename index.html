        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is revamping apprenticeship funding to focus on individuals under 21, potentially impacting postgraduate-level apprenticeships. Funding for Level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will now be restricted to those under 21, aiming to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults. This shift has sparked controversy, with critics arguing it could undermine advanced training in sectors like healthcare and limit access to professions for those without university degrees. The government defends the change as a necessary step to prioritize younger workers and address the decline in entry-level apprenticeships.</p>

          <p>The Sean Combs sexual assault and racketeering trial has featured testimony from 16 witnesses over two weeks, including star witness Cassie Ventura. Prosecutors have presented evidence and testimony alleging Combs used violence and threats to coerce women into sex and protect his music empire. Witnesses have corroborated Ventura's claims, detailing instances of violence and coercion. Combs denies the allegations, with his defense arguing his actions were driven by jealousy and drug addiction, not sex trafficking.

          <p>President Trump has expressed strong criticism of Vladimir Putin's intensified attacks on Ukraine, labeling the Russian leader as "absolutely crazy." Russia's recent drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities have prompted Trump to voice his frustration, though he has not taken concrete action to increase sanctions or aid to Ukraine. Despite the criticism, Trump also reiterated his frustrations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Kremlin downplayed Trump's remarks as an emotional outburst. Meanwhile, a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine provided a rare sign of progress amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>California Representative Nanette Diaz BarragÃ¡n is urging the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement multilingual emergency alerts for natural disasters, expressing concern over the Trump administration's delay.

The push for multilingual alerts is particularly relevant in Los Angeles, where diverse immigrant communities face language barriers during emergencies.

          <p>The Trump administration's plans to significantly reduce intelligence and national security jobs across the government are raising concerns about potential risks to national security. Experts are weighing the possible consequences of these cuts, considering the reliance of the U.S. government on intelligence officials for safeguarding the country. The restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC) and the radical downsizing trend under President Trump's second term are part of this broader shift.
