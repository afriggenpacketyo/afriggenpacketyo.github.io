          <p>Numerous immigration enforcement operations conducted by Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA, and the FBI across Los Angeles led to the arrests of dozens of individuals, sparking citywide protests. The raids took place in areas including the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., with ICE reporting approximately 44 arrests. Community organizations like CHIRLA estimated even higher numbers, while Mayor Karen Bass and Senator Alex Padilla condemned the operations, citing concerns over community terror and disruption of safety. The LAPD and LA County Sheriff's Department clarified their non-involvement in civil immigration enforcement, emphasizing their focus on local laws and community safety. Optimism in the situation is low due to the high tensions and potential harm to communities.</p>

          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges following a disastrous first quarter, exacerbated by a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The spat, triggered by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, led to a sharp decline in Tesla's stock value and a breakdown in their relationship. This rift could impact Tesla's regulatory environment, government support, and tariff exemptions. Prior to the feud, Tesla was already struggling with declining revenue and increased competition, compounded by Musk's controversial political actions and endorsements.</p>

          <p>The government is facing difficulties in cutting the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with plans to spend ¬£2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This figure is only marginally less than the ¬£2.3bn spent in 2024/25, with the money largely used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers. Critics argue that this diverts funds from vital humanitarian and development programs, while the Home Office insists it is working to reduce costs by speeding up asylum decisions and introducing tighter financial eligibility checks.</p>
