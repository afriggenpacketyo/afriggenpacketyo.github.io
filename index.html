          <p>Japanese energy firm Jera Co. has committed to ensuring a stable power supply this summer by using one of the world's largest power plants fueled by liquefied natural gas. The Kawagoe thermal power station in Mie Prefecture, boasting a maximum output of 4.80 million kilowatts, was showcased to the media, highlighting its role in meeting increased electricity consumption during the summer months. By utilizing the LNG-fired plant, Jera aims to compensate for fluctuations in solar power generation, which has been rapidly expanding in the region. The region is projected to have an electricity reserve rate topping 8 percent this summer, a proportion necessary for stable supply.</p>

The agreement, which involves projects in minerals, oil, and gas, will be an equal partnership, with resources remaining the property of Ukraine and subject to ratification by Ukrainian lawmakers.</p>

          <p>A natural resources deal between the United States and Ukraine has been finalized, aimed at accelerating Ukraine's recovery through collaboration on mutual assets, talents, and capabilities. Ukraine holds approximately 5% of the world's critical raw materials, including significant reserves of graphite, titanium, and lithium, which are essential for renewable energy, military applications, and industrial infrastructure. However, a substantial portion of these mineral deposits has been seized by Russia, adding a strategic and economic dimension to the ongoing conflict. The US is interested in Ukraine's mineral resources to reduce its dependency on China, which controls a large percentage of the world's rare earth deposits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has determined that Apple deliberately violated a court injunction in an antitrust case brought by Epic Games, the creator of "Fortnite." The ruling states that Apple has been impeding developers' ability to communicate with users and levying commissions on off-app purchases, which goes against the original 2021 injunction. The judge accused Apple's vice-president of finance of lying under oath and suggested that CEO Tim Cook disregarded advice from other executives to comply with the injunction. The matter has been referred to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for potential criminal contempt proceedings.</p>

This internal division makes Beijing reluctant to reveal its negotiation strategies until there is more clarity on the U.S.'s final position.

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters are expected to participate in May Day rallies across the United States, opposing what they view as a 'war on working people' by the Trump administration. Activists aim to build on the momentum of recent grassroots protests, expressing concerns about the elimination of federal jobs, immigration raids, and the influence of billionaires. The protests, organized under the banner of May Day Strong, will decry attacks on labor rights, public services, and the safety of immigrants, with organizers emphasizing their opposition to violent forms of protest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has requested more time to address the US economy, which contracted for the first time in three years, raising concerns about a potential recession. Trump attributed the economic downturn to his Democratic predecessor, President Joe Biden, and cited stockpiled imports ahead of his imposed tariffs as a misleading factor. He also touted $8 trillion in promised inward investment, arguing that it would revitalize American manufacturing. The US economy experienced a 0.3% annual contraction, a significant decline from the previous quarter's 2.4% growth, as Trump marks 100 days in office amid public discontent over his economic stewardship.</p>

          <p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has stated that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction stemming from the Epic Games case, further asserting that Apple Vice President of Finance Alex Roman "outright lied" to the court. The judge referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for investigation into potential criminal contempt proceedings against both Roman and Apple. Rogers accused Apple of deliberately trying to violate her ruling, highlighting that nearly every Apple decision on its app-linking policies was anticompetitive. The decision is a striking repudiation of Apple's conduct during the Epic Games trial, with the judge ordering Apple to stop imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside an app.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba visited Vietnam and the Philippines, positioning Japan as a reliable partner for ASEAN amid concerns over U.S. tariffs and China's expanding influence. Experts suggest that Japan's support for ASEAN, including through its "official security assistance" program, benefits both Tokyo and the region by promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific and peace in the South China Sea. As the U.S. implements protectionist measures, Japan's long-standing and stable cooperation with ASEAN becomes increasingly important, particularly in security and economic matters. Japan can also function as an intermediary between ASEAN members and the United States, given its close security alliance with the U.S. and shared values with Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that Americans may have to accept having less as a result of the ongoing trade war with China. While previously stating there would be disruptions, Trump indicated that many Americans might need to adjust to fewer imported goods.

However, Trump insisted that the trade war's impact would be more severe for China, which relies on the U.S. as a key market.

          <p>Tesla's board members have reportedly contacted executive search firms to identify a successor for CEO Elon Musk, according to the Wall Street Journal. The board's move was allegedly prompted by Musk's extensive involvement with the Trump administration, specifically his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This involvement has drawn criticism due to declining sales of Tesla's EV lineup and Musk's embrace of far-right politics, which has led to protests and vandalism. While the board has asked Musk to dedicate more time to Tesla, it remains unclear if he is aware of the succession planning efforts.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared divided over the effort to create an online Catholic charter school in Oklahoma, a case that could potentially direct public funds to religious schools. Justices debated whether excluding the school from Oklahoma's charter system constituted unconstitutional discrimination or if allowing it would weaken the separation between church and state. A ruling in favor of the school could impact laws in numerous states and the federal charter school program, while a deadlock would uphold the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision against the school. The outcome is expected to hinge on Chief Justice John Roberts's perspective on the level of state involvement in charter schools.</p>

The final decision, expected in the next two months, will likely be similar to last year's increases.
