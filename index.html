          <p>This week's inflation report will provide an initial assessment of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs on pricing across the United States. Economists initially feared a burst of inflation, but government data is expected to show a slight cooldown in price increases. Despite some rollbacks of levies, analysts anticipate a potential rekindling of inflation as retailers restock inventory. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that sustained tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, but noted the uncertainty surrounding these policies.

          <p>As President Trump announces an executive order to lower prescription drug prices, a spotlight is cast on the most expensive medications in the U.S., both by price and sales volume. The order aims for "most favored nations drug pricing," potentially reducing costs significantly. The list includes gene therapies like Lenmeldy and Hemgenix, costing millions per dose, and widely used drugs like Keytruda and Eliquis, generating billions in revenue. Experts caution that lowering prices could impact pharmaceutical innovation, while others argue that current costs are unsustainable and that the insurance system and the hospital business also contribute.

          <p>Manus AI, a Chinese artificial intelligence agent, is now offering free public registration, eliminating its previous wait-list system following new funding and increasing competition. Since its invite-only launch in March, the AI agent has gained attention for its ability to handle complex tasks. The decision to open registrations follows a recent funding round of US$75 million, led by US venture capital firm Benchmark Capital, amid rising competition from Big Tech and other AI start-ups. The US Treasury Department is reportedly reviewing the investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is facing a health care crisis as the state's costs have spiraled out of control, partly due to the expansion of Medicaid to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The state has borrowed billions to cover these costs, and Newsom must now consider rolling back coverage or finding other budget cuts. The political decision involves balancing his promise of universal health care with the reality of rising costs and limited support for providing coverage to immigrants without legal status. Republicans have threatened to cut Medicaid funding for states that provide coverage for immigrants without legal status, making Newsom's decision even more difficult.</p>

          <p>Following high-level trade talks between China and the United States, comments from the US delegation highlighted the skilled negotiating approach of their Chinese counterparts. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted a sense of "equanimity" and mutual respect during the discussions, contrasting with previous negotiations. The talks resulted in a provisional reduction of tariffs, with Vice-Minister of Commerce Li Chenggang making his debut as a trade representative. The agreement signals a potential shift towards more collaborative trade relations between the two countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Farmers in Texas are struggling due to a prolonged drought and Mexico's inability to meet its water delivery obligations under a nearly 80-year-old treaty. The treaty requires Mexico to send billions of gallons of water to the U.S. every five years, but Mexico has been historically behind on deliveries, leading to significant losses for Texas farms. President Trump has pressured Mexico with the threat of tariffs to force water deliveries. However, experts argue that the water simply isn't available, and that political pressure won't solve the underlying scarcity problem.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing a critical week as they aim to finalize President Trump's "big beautiful bill," which includes significant changes to tax, immigration, and energy policy. Speaker Mike Johnson is navigating competing demands within the GOP, balancing concerns from swing district Republicans and pressure from conservatives to cut spending and restructure programs. Key issues include Medicaid reforms, extending Trump's tax cuts, and addressing the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap. The goal is to pass the bill through the House by Memorial Day and send it to Trump for his signature by July 4, while also addressing the debt ceiling by mid-July.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S.'s decision to temporarily cut tariffs on China, businesses are scrambling to expedite shipments while the lower rates are in effect. The tax on Chinese imports to the U.S. will decrease from 145% to 30%, and China will reduce tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. While business owners welcome the cut, they also acknowledge the uncertainty of the 90-day window and the potential for increased freight rates. Some companies may accelerate production to avoid higher tariffs in the future, while others are exploring alternative manufacturing locations.</p>

On Monday, counterterrorism police officers took over investigations into the fire. It broke out earlier that day outside the four-bedroom home where Mr. Starmer lived until he won last year’s general election and moved into the prime minister’s official residence, 10 Downing Street.</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms that profited from high interest rates are now facing a test as rates decline, potentially impacting their net interest income. While higher rates boosted profits for fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo in 2024, a broad decline raises questions about the sustainability of this income. Diversification of revenue streams and strong monetization of customer bases through non-interest services are seen as key to weathering the changing economic environment. Some fintechs are expanding into areas like crypto trading, share trading, and mobile plans to reduce their reliance on interest income.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering plans to allow homeowners to purchase heat pumps through salary sacrifice schemes, potentially reducing the cost of installation. The proposal would enable salaried employees to repay the loan in monthly installments from their pre-tax income, resulting in savings on national insurance and income tax. Similar schemes are already in place for electric vehicles, and expanding the program to include heat pumps could boost uptake of renewable heating systems. The government is currently consulting on expanding the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to support new approaches to cleaner heating.</p>
