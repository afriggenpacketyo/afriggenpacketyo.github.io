          <h2>UK Government Postpones Release of Child Poverty Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 01:36:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially expected in the spring, until later in the year, possibly coinciding with the Budget in the autumn. The Child Poverty Taskforce, led by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, continues to work on the strategy, considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Critics, including the SNP, have condemned the delay, while charities like Save the Children UK express concern over the impact on impoverished families. A government spokesperson stated that they are committed to tackling child poverty and will introduce fully-funded measures to address its root causes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 01:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are adopting a "quiet quitting" approach, prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that approximately 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with younger employees being the most likely to admit to this behavior. This shift in attitude is driven by a desire for more "me time," a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations, and a recognition that company loyalty no longer guarantees long-term job security. Experts suggest this change is a positive development, potentially leading to happier individuals and a healthier economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, overcoming a blown save and a rain delay, but the game highlighted concerns about the team's pitching depth. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw was limited to two innings due to a rain delay, and the bullpen was heavily taxed, pitching 11 innings. Teoscar Hernández drove in the go-ahead run in the 13th inning, and Luis García closed out the game, but the Dodgers face a challenging stretch of games against playoff-contending teams with a depleted pitching staff, raising concerns about fatigue and future performance.</p>

          <p>This article explores the intricate dynamics between football players who represent their hometown clubs and the fans who support them. While playing for a local team can be a dream come true, it also brings added pressure and scrutiny, as fans often have higher expectations for players who share their connection to the area. Former players like Chris Sutton emphasize the unique attachment and responsibility that comes with representing one's community, while others, like Jamie Carragher, acknowledge that players' priorities may differ from those of the fans, potentially leading to disappointment when they move on to other clubs.</p>

          <p>A former people smuggler, identified as Nick, detailed to the BBC how he used yachts to transport migrants into the UK, exploiting vulnerabilities in private marinas. Nick, a former British soldier, explained that these marinas often lack adequate security, making them easy targets for smuggling operations. He also described smuggling Albanians in cars onto ferries, where they would then jump into lorries mid-journey. Nick, who was imprisoned for his crimes, claims that the same routes and methods are still being used, highlighting the need for improved security measures to prevent further illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan’s representative office, relocating it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling a deepening alignment with Beijing. The move comes as Somalia bans Taiwanese passport holders, seen as retaliation for Taiwan’s growing ties with Somaliland. Experts suggest Taiwan’s diminishing presence in Africa reflects the robust economic relationship between African nations and China, making them hesitant to offend Beijing by granting Taiwan prominence. Taiwan's only official diplomatic ally in Africa remains eSwatini, highlighting the island's dwindling diplomatic recognition on the continent.</p>

The attack occurred between platforms 13 and 14, accessible via a busy main road, and some victims were treated inside trains.

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans for the government to sell its stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. The government intends to bypass auctions, allowing for more control over prices, and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution. This move comes amid criticism that the government has not effectively curbed the recent spike in rice prices, which has hurt households as inflation outpaces wage growth. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms in early May, nearly double last year's level.</p>

          <p>This article critiques Germany's approach to acknowledging its Nazi past, arguing that the country's vigilance against revisionism is selective. While Germany actively condemns the past when it flatters its self-image, it often ignores historical truths that threaten personal gain or strategic interests. The author points to the Herbert Quandt Media prize, which celebrates a Nazi supporter, as an example of amnesia cloaked in liberal respectability. The article also highlights the ongoing refusal to confront societal entanglement with state violence and genocide, such as streets named after colonial administrators involved in atrocities.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail is under scrutiny, with authorities crediting the technology for aiding in the recapture of one fugitive. Despite a recent pause in automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. by the New Orleans Police Department, the organization's facial recognition cameras were used in the manhunt. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, raise concerns about privacy and potential biases in the technology. The ACLU argues that live facial recognition is a radical escalation of surveillance power, while others cite studies showing the technology can be racially biased.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred as the Black Hawk helicopter neared the Pentagon, prompting air traffic controllers to take precautionary measures. An Army official attributed the incident to a temporary antenna's location, which has since been moved. The incident has raised concerns about close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, especially after a deadly midair collision in January.</p>

          <p>As Japan faces record-high rice prices, supermarket operators are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a lower price compared to domestically-grown rice, and other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen strong demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest in more affordable options, with Aeon hoping that increased choice will boost overall rice consumption. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May, nearly double the previous year's level.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the UK's ban on disposable vapes starting June 1, many vapers are stockpiling the products, fearing the available alternatives won't suit their needs. The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, but some ex-smokers worry about the convenience and taste differences of rechargeable vapes. Retailers are seeing sales surge as customers stock up, while concerns rise that some may turn back to smoking if they can't access disposable vapes. The government hopes the ban will protect public health and the environment, but some argue it's counterproductive for smoking cessation.</p>

The canal aims to lower logistical costs and integrate less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs.
