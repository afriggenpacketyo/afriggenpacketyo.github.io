          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit his MLB-leading 20th home run in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 9-5 win against the Cleveland Guardians. Ohtani's two-run homer in the fourth inning extended the Dodgers' lead, marking his fastest time to reach 20 home runs in his major league career. The Dodgers secured the first two games of the series, with Dustin May earning the win. Elsewhere, Seiya Suzuki achieved his 50th RBI for the Chicago Cubs, and Tomoyuki Sugano received a no-decision for the Baltimore Orioles.</p>

          <p>Japan has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in April 2026. The law targets firms producing over 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually, covering approximately 60% of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive emission allowances, and those exceeding their limits must purchase carbon credits, incentivizing emissions reduction. While designed to lower emissions, the system could lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

          <p>A military simulation in Oklahoma, organized by MilSim West, draws participants who re-enact battles between NATO and Russian forces using airsoft guns. The simulations, while set in a fictional dystopian world, are heavily influenced by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with participants often using uniforms and equipment similar to those used by Russian troops. Despite the company's intentions to remain in the realm of fantasy, the real-world conflict serves as a reference point for many participants, raising questions about the ethics of recreating a war that has caused significant loss of life. Some players even purchase surplus uniforms directly from Ukraine’s battlefields.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. This consideration is due to Netanyahu's concerns that the U.S. might allow Iran to maintain uranium enrichment capabilities. Tensions between the U.S. and Israel stem from differing views on how to address Iran's nuclear program, with Israel favoring military action and the U.S. prioritizing negotiation backed by the threat of force. Recent meetings between Israeli and U.S. officials have aimed to bridge these differences, but disagreements persist over the terms of any potential agreement.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a crash expert testified that data from Read's vehicle placed her at the scene of Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe's death. The expert, Dr. Judson Welcher, stated that the vehicle's black box did not register a collision but matched the vehicle's data to O'Keefe's final movements. According to Welcher, the vehicle accelerated rapidly before backing up, aligning with the timestamp of O'Keefe's last cellphone interaction. This evidence aims to support the prosecution's narrative that Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV. </p>

          <p>A British think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), suggests that a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is "unlikely in the near future" but remains "not impossible," especially with Donald Trump in the White House. The IISS report highlights strained US-China relations, characterized by "deep mutual distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms." While some tactical improvements occurred during the Biden administration, these are unlikely to significantly alter the strategic direction during Trump’s second term, given the risks of misperception and miscommunication.</p>

In Circle's offering, 60% of the shares are being sold by existing shareholders, reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. One potential reason for this is the extended period of poor returns for venture capital firms, leading to a strong desire for liquidity. Circle, however, is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, making the decision less about financial necessity and more about investor appetite for exits.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. The Chrisleys, known for their series "Chrisley Knows Best," were found guilty in 2022 of conspiring to defraud banks and the IRS. Trump stated that he believes the couple was unfairly targeted by an unjust justice system. The pardon is part of Trump's broader pattern of granting clemency to individuals convicted of white-collar crimes.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, the leader of President Trump's "Department of Government Efficiency," has publicly criticized the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, stating that it increases the budget deficit rather than decreases it. Musk expressed disappointment in the legislation, which would add trillions to federal budget deficits over the next decade through tax cuts. This criticism is notable given Musk's close ties to the president, especially since the White House insists the tax cuts will boost government revenue, contrary to budget experts' predictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increasing difficulty finding employment, contributing to a rise in the national unemployment rate. Unemployed recent grads account for 12% of the overall increase in unemployment since mid-2023, despite comprising only 5% of the labor force. This trend is largely attributed to a slowdown in hiring within formerly robust sectors, particularly in technology, where the supply of graduates exceeds the demand. The economic uncertainty created by tariffs is also a factor, potentially leading to continued increases in unemployment among recent graduates. </p>
