          <p>The Menendez brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, were resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole, according to BBC News. The resentencing came after emotional statements from the brothers and family members, who argued for their release after over 30 years in prison. The judge acknowledged the brothers' 'remarkable' work in prison, including creating programs to better the lives of inmates, but noted the original sentences were justified at the time. The district attorney's office opposed a lower sentence, arguing the brothers weren't rehabilitated.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that despite public dismissals, an internal Israeli analysis warns of extreme food shortages in Gaza if aid deliveries are not restored promptly. Some Israeli military officials believe widespread starvation is imminent unless the blockade is lifted within weeks. This stark assessment contrasts with Israel's public stance, which has downplayed the impact of the blockade on civilian life. The analysis highlights the urgency of the situation, as bakeries and charity kitchens close and the UN's World Food Program runs out of supplies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times reports that Bob Myers, a UC regent and former Golden State Warriors GM, questioned the financial stability of UCLA's athletic department, which faces a $219.5 million deficit. Myers asked how the department could avoid 'sinking' amid financial challenges. The deficit is attributed to factors including the House settlement with the NCAA, Olympic sports running in the red, and revenue issues at the Rose Bowl. UCLA is exploring ways to mitigate these issues, including premium seating at the Rose Bowl and Pauley Pavilion renovations.</p>

The Chutian-001 satellite demonstrated core capabilities, including satellite system performance, high-resolution smart imaging, and space environment monitoring. VLEO satellites offer advantages such as lower signal latency and stronger transmission but must regularly fire on-board thrusters to counter atmospheric drag.</p>

The insurance giant already received a 20 percent rate increase last year, a move that a consumer watchdog group, as well as homeowners struggling to be paid after their homes were destroyed in January in the Los Angeles fires, criticized as unfair and unfounded.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, “Original Sin,” details how Mr. Biden’s aides quashed concerns about his age, according to The New York Times. The anonymous accounts show that many Democrats are still afraid to discuss the issue publicly. The book chronicles how Mr. Biden’s advisers stomped out discussion of his age-related limitations, including internal concerns of aides, external worries of Democratic allies and scrutiny by journalists. The authors write about a “cover-up,” though their book shows a Biden inner circle that spends more time sticking its collective head in the sand about the president’s diminishing abilities than it does scheming to hide evidence of his shortcomings.</p>
