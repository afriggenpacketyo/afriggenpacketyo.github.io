          <p>The founders of Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, are being sued by the SEC for allegedly running a $112 million Ponzi scheme. The complaint claims they defrauded investors by misrepresenting the financial health of bankrupt brands they acquired, including RadioShack, Pier 1 Imports, and Modell's Sporting Goods. Instead of using investor funds for the specific companies as promised, they allegedly used new investments to pay returns to earlier investors and diverted $16 million for personal use. The lawsuit also accuses them of misrepresenting the experience of their COO to bolster credibility.</p>

          <p>With children back in school, concerns about head lice are rising, as infestations are most common among preschool and elementary-aged students. The CDC clarifies that lice are spread through direct head-to-head contact and are not an indicator of poor hygiene. Prevention methods include avoiding sharing items like hats and brushes and not sharing beds or couches recently used by an infested person. While itching is a primary symptom, health agencies emphasize that lice do not transmit diseases and children do not need to be sent home from school immediately upon discovery, recommending they return after beginning treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia's government is planning to raise its value-added tax and cut non-defense spending to manage a growing budget deficit, which has nearly quadrupled its original target for 2025. The economic strain is largely due to plunging oil and gas revenues, the impact of international sanctions, and successful Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure. This has led to a significant cooling of the Russian economy, with analysts suggesting that these mounting domestic pressures could force the Kremlin to seek an earlier end to the war in Ukraine. The planned cuts are expected to severely impact social sectors like education and healthcare. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark is reportedly considering invoking Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which calls for member consultations when territorial integrity or security is threatened, after drone activity forced the closure of Aalborg airport. This marks the second such incident this week, with Copenhagen's airport also affected, in what Danish authorities are calling a "hybrid attack" from a "professional actor."

          <p>Robert Kraft has agreed to sell an 8% minority stake in the New England Patriots to two investment groups, Sixth Street Capital and Dean Metropoulos, in a transaction that values the NFL franchise at $9 billion. This valuation marks a massive increase from the $172 million Kraft paid for the team in 1994. The funds from the sale will reportedly remain on the team's balance sheet, and the deal, which does not include the Kraft-owned New England Revolution MLS team, is now pending approval from the NFL's finance committee. The sale reflects the soaring valuations of major sports franchises.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is implementing a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes laying off 900 non-retail employees and closing approximately 1% of its stores across North America. The move comes as the coffee giant struggles with six consecutive quarters of declining sales, attributed to consumers cutting back on spending amid inflation. In a letter to employees, CEO Brian Niccol stated the changes are necessary to build a stronger company. The Starbucks Workers United union criticized the decision, arguing it disregards the input of baristas and that the company is moving backward instead of addressing core issues.</p>

According to analysts, this change is driven by escalating geopolitical tensions and concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities for strategic industries like defense and advanced electronics. Washington's recent moves are seen as a recognition that market forces alone may not be sufficient to ensure adequate domestic production capacity for critical minerals and semiconductors.

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed he was the victim of "triple sabotage" during his appearance at the United Nations, citing a series of technical malfunctions. In a social media post, he detailed how an escalator he was on came to a "screeching halt," his teleprompter failed during his speech to the General Assembly, and the sound system in the auditorium was apparently off. Trump dismissed the events as a coincidence and demanded the UN Secretary-General launch an immediate investigation. A UN official, however, suggested that a person in Trump's entourage may have inadvertently hit the escalator's emergency stop lever.</p>

          <p>The French navy has successfully intercepted a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa, seizing 9.6 tons of cocaine with an estimated market value of over $600 million. The operation was conducted by two naval ships as part of France's long-standing Corymbe mission, which aims to enhance maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea. The seizure followed intelligence provided by anti-drug authorities and British police. This major bust is part of a series of successful counter-narcotics operations by French authorities at sea, which have intercepted over 54 tons of drugs so far in 2025.</p>

Transocean plans to use the proceeds from the sale to pay down its existing debt. The discounted offering and subsequent stock drop reflect market reactions to the company's capital-raising strategy and financial position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The way Gen Z navigates sex and relationships has evolved beyond traditional models like the "bases" metaphor, giving rise to a complex new vocabulary and set of norms. Terms like "situationships," "sneaky links," and "catching feelings" describe a landscape where emotional vulnerability is often avoided, and casual, undefined entanglements are common. This generation faces a "buffet" of relationship options without clear scripts, leading to both greater freedom to define intimacy on their own terms and significant stress. For many, physical intimacy may now precede emotional investment like hand-holding, reversing the sequence common to previous generations.</p>

          <p>Rangers manager Russell Martin is facing intense pressure after his team failed to win any of its first five league games and suffered a humiliating Champions League qualifying defeat. An analysis of the team's performance shows Martin initially implemented his signature possession-based, attacking style, but it led to defensive vulnerabilities and costly turnovers. In response to the poor results and a 6-0 loss to Club Brugge, Martin has uncharacteristically abandoned his long-held philosophy, adopting a more pragmatic and defensive 4-2-3-1 formation. This drastic tactical change is seen as a last-ditch effort to stabilize the team and secure his position.</p>

Donors reportedly include major corporations like Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir, with nearly $200 million pledged so far for the construction.

          <p>A new report alleges that the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was largely unreachable for hours during the deadly floods that struck Texas in July, which killed over 130 people. This reportedly delayed the deployment of critical search-and-rescue resources. The agency was already facing criticism for its slow response, which was also hampered by a new policy requiring the Homeland Security Secretary to personally approve any expenditure over $100,000. Citing the report, some Democratic lawmakers are now calling for the acting administrator to resign over his handling of the disaster.</p>

This would be another significant increase, following the expansion to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament. Proponents argue a 64-team format would be a fitting way to celebrate the tournament's centenary and would make the event more inclusive. However, critics, including the presidents of UEFA and Concacaf, have called it a "bad idea," warning it would diminish the quality of the tournament, devalue the qualification process, and create logistical chaos for the multi-continent hosts.</p>

          <p>The trial of South Sudan's First Vice President, Riek Machar, on charges of murder and treason is fueling concerns about the stability of the nation's fragile peace agreement. Machar's recent suspension by President Salva Kiir has effectively dissolved the unity government, reigniting ethnic tensions between their respective supporters. Observers fear the trial, which has had limited media access, is politically motivated and could derail the peace process ahead of the 2026 elections. The rivalry between Kiir and Machar was a central cause of the country's devastating five-year civil war, which the 2018 peace deal ended.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget has instructed federal agencies to prepare plans for mass layoffs if a government shutdown occurs next week. A memo told agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices for employees in programs that lack alternative funding or are "not consistent with the President's priorities." This move is a significant escalation from typical shutdown procedures, which usually involve temporary furloughs rather than permanent firings. Democratic leaders condemned the memo as an "attempt at intimidation" and an extortion tactic to pressure them into a funding deal ahead of the September 30 deadline.</p>
