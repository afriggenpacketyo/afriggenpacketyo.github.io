          <p>At WWE's SummerSlam event, Naomi retained her Women's World Championship in a dramatic triple-threat match against Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky. The match featured a series of high-impact moves and near-falls, keeping the audience engaged throughout the contest. The conclusion saw Naomi strategically re-enter the ring to pin Ripley, who had just executed her finishing move on Sky. The victory was secured with a roll-up pin where Naomi held Ripley's tights, a controversial tactic that the referee did not see, solidifying her reign as champion.</p>

          <p>China has formally rejected demands from the United States to cease purchasing oil from Russia and Iran, asserting its right to secure its energy supply based on national interests. The U.S. had linked the issue to ongoing trade negotiations, threatening a 100% tariff, but Chinese officials stated that coercion would not be effective. This stance highlights a significant point of contention amid otherwise cautiously optimistic trade talks between the world's two largest economies. Analysts note that China's reliance on these discounted energy sources is both economically and strategically crucial for Beijing.</p>

          <p>In response to record-high infection rates, the UK has initiated a nationwide rollout of a gonorrhoea vaccine, a world-first public health campaign. The vaccine will initially be offered in sexual health clinics to individuals at the highest risk, including gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners. While the vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, is only 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea, health officials hope it will significantly curb the spread and combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains. The NHS predicts the program could prevent up to 100,000 cases over the next decade.</p>

Sources indicate she is leaving to start her own government affairs firm but will remain a special government employee temporarily to conclude some policy projects. Her departure is significant as she is known to be a close associate of Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 30 Democratic lawmakers from Texas has fled the state for Illinois to prevent a vote on a new congressional map proposed by Republicans. By leaving, they deny the state legislature the necessary quorum to conduct business, effectively halting the proceedings of a special session called by Governor Greg Abbott. The Democrats accuse Republicans of pushing a gerrymandered map at the behest of Donald Trump that would unfairly create five new GOP-leaning districts. This dramatic move could result in daily fines and potential arrest warrants for the absent legislators.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have confirmed the death of Khamis Ayyad, a Palestinian American man, from smoke inhalation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. His death occurred after Israeli settlers allegedly set fire to homes and vehicles in the village of Silwad. The U.S. State Department condemned the violence and is providing consular assistance to Ayyad's family, highlighting the incident amid a recent surge in settler attacks and broader regional conflict. This event marks the second death of a Palestinian American in the West Bank in three weeks, increasing pressure on Israel to investigate and ensure accountability.</p>

          <p>Prior to the August recess, Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, engaged in intense negotiations to release billions in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees.

The deal ultimately fell apart when President Trump rejected the terms, leaving numerous nominations, including ambassadors, unconfirmed until at least September.

          <p>Marvel's 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning an estimated $40 million. However, this figure represents a significant 66% drop from its impressive debut, a steeper decline than other recent superhero films. The weekend's new releases, comedies 'The Bad Guys 2' and 'The Naked Gun,' secured the second and third spots, respectively. While the overall summer box office is tracking ahead of last year, analysts note that the slow start to August means sustained performance from all films will be crucial to meet industry targets.</p>

          <p>The recent sale of the iconic American company U.S. Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel includes a unique provision that gives President Trump significant influence over the company's future. This arrangement, referred to as a 'golden share,' grants certain rights or powers to a specific stakeholder, in this case, the former president. The terms of this deal are noteworthy as they embed political influence directly into the corporate governance of a major industrial entity. This structure could have long-term implications for the company's operations, strategy, and its relationship with the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>A collaborative podcast series from NPR's 'Embedded' and the CBC, titled 'Tested,' delves into the complex and controversial history of sex and gender testing in athletics. The series examines how sports governing bodies have attempted to define and enforce biological categories for competition. It explores the scientific, ethical, and human rights dimensions of these policies, questioning what constitutes 'fairness' in sports. The investigation sheds light on the impact these tests have had on the lives and careers of athletes who have been subjected to them over the decades.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending the abrupt firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, pointing to downward revisions in recent jobs data as justification. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett suggested the revisions raised doubts about the data's reliability, while critics, including a former Trump-appointed BLS head, called the move groundless and a dangerous precedent that undermines the agency's credibility. The administration claims it wants its own appointees to ensure transparency, but the ouster has fueled fears of an attempt to politicize and manipulate crucial economic statistics.

The activist group Palestine Action, which has since been proscribed by the government as a terrorist organization, claimed responsibility for the incident in June, which involved spray-painting two RAF Voyager planes. The 22-year-old suspect faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place for purposes prejudicial to the state's safety.

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is in its third day for an army veteran suspected of killing four people in a bar shooting in Anaconda, Montana.

The suspect, who was reportedly a regular at the bar, fled into the nearby foothills after the attack.

          <p>In a court filing, the Trump administration has denied that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been directed to meet a daily quota for arrests or deportations. This contradicts earlier media reports and a public statement from White House adviser Stephen Miller, who said the administration was looking to set a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day. The government's legal filing claims that while the figure may have been discussed as a 'goal,' no such policy was ever officially issued to the Department of Homeland Security or ICE, creating a discrepancy between public rhetoric and official policy.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly overtaken California in the installation of new utility-scale solar energy, a surge driven by economics rather than state climate policy. The growth is led by major utilities like Florida Power & Light, which benefit from a rule that fast-tracks permitting for solar projects under 75 megawatts. While this demonstrates solar's increasing cost-competitiveness with natural gas, the industry faces new headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing strain on the power grid. The state's ability to maintain this momentum without consistent policy support remains a key question. (not investment advice)</p>
