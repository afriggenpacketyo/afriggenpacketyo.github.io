          <p>A psychiatrist, Dr. Awais Aftab, addresses the complexities surrounding antidepressant use, acknowledging their potential to be lifesaving for some patients while also highlighting the less discussed side effects and withdrawal challenges. The article emphasizes the lack of research guiding clinicians on safely tapering patients off antidepressants, leading many to seek advice from online communities. Aftab criticizes the medical community's reaction to Robert F. Kennedy's claims about antidepressant withdrawal, urging a more serious engagement with patient concerns and advocating for more research into medication safety and long-term effects. He argues that the public deserves balanced advice about psychiatric medications, acknowledging both their benefits and trade-offs, to avoid losing credibility with patients whose lives have been negatively impacted. </p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, is experiencing a decrease in consumer sentiment, with customers sharing meals and avoiding leftovers, indicating financial strain. The owner, Stanley Kallivrousis, has paused expansion plans due to fewer customers and difficulty retaining staff, with some cooks leaving for the gig economy. A business consulting expert, John Samuels, notes that companies are scrambling to react to changing consumer behavior, potentially raising prices or canceling orders. Despite economic uncertainty, Kallivrousis emphasizes the diner's importance as a community gathering place, highlighting the relationships with his customers as the most rewarding aspect of the business.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious in a chaotic Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a timely safety car intervention after Oscar Piastri initially led the race. The safety car, triggered by a collision between Alonso and Lawson, allowed Norris to pit for slick tires and gain the lead. Verstappen faced a 10-second penalty for an unsafe pit release, dropping him to last place. Antonelli's race was significantly hampered by the collision with Verstappen, preventing him from making his pit stop and ultimately finishing out of the points.</p>

The ministry emphasized that the decision followed a thorough and independent investigation and that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped, drawing on lessons from Germany's history. The BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence service, designated the AfD as a "confirmed rightwing extremist" force, citing the party's xenophobic stances as incompatible with the country's constitution.</p>

A "national conference" organized by the regime proposed dissolving the 2005 Political Parties Charter and limiting the number of permitted parties to five.

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. Ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, these tariffs follow earlier levies on imported cars and will impact even vehicles made in the U.S. due to the prevalence of foreign-made components. While parts from Canada and Mexico meeting trade agreement requirements are exempt, the tariffs are expected to drive up costs and contribute to overall inflation. Automakers and suppliers express concerns about the time and uncertainty involved in relocating assembly lines, with General Motors estimating the tariffs could cost the company up to $5 billion this year.</p>

          <p>Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) is expected to secure another decisive win in the general elections, bolstering the mandate of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is in his first year in office. The PAP has governed the wealthy city-state since 1959, and the projected results represent an improvement compared to the 2020 election. Voters' concerns included living costs and housing availability, with the opposition arguing that the government has failed to address these issues. Wong's government has warned of recession if Singapore becomes collateral damage in the worsening US-China trade war.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia secured a second term, marking a significant victory for his center-left Labor Party, which had been trailing in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. The election saw a resounding defeat of the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who faced challenges due to his association with some of former President Trump‚Äôs messaging and policies. The election took place against a backdrop of global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration. In his victory speech, Albanese emphasized that Australians had chosen "to face global challenges the Australian way," rejecting the need to copy ideas from overseas.</p>

He asserts that the American government is accusing him of undermining U.S. foreign policy, a pretext for deporting him for political speech.
