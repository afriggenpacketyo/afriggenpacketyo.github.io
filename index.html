          <h2>Trump Reiterates Past Promises Not to Cut Medicaid Amid Republican Bill Proposals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has consistently stated his opposition to Medicaid cuts, even as House Republicans propose a bill that would significantly reduce funding for the program. The bill aims to cut hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade by imposing work requirements, increasing eligibility checks, and penalizing states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. Despite Trump's assurances, the proposed cuts have faced criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, who argue they contradict his promises and would leave millions uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 8.6 million more Americans will become uninsured under the proposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.3% in April, slightly less than economists anticipated, signaling that inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Housing costs were a major factor, with energy costs also increasing despite lower gasoline prices. Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, though the effect may not be immediately apparent in economic data. Due to a tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., some experts have lowered their year-end CPI forecasts, suggesting the Fed may cut rates twice in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, Pedro Inzunza Noriega and his son Pedro Inzunza Coronel, have been charged with narco-terrorism for allegedly trafficking large quantities of fentanyl into the United States. The charges follow the Trump administration's designation of the Sinaloa Cartel as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Prosecutors claim the pair lead one of the world's largest and most sophisticated fentanyl production networks. The indictment is the first of its kind from the Department of Justice's newly formed Narco-Terrorism Unit, coming after Mexican authorities seized over 1.65 tons of fentanyl from locations managed by the pair.</p>

As president, he legalized gay marriage and abortion, and oversaw a decrease in unemployment, poverty, and infant mortality. He also controversially deregulated cannabis for recreational purposes.

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame. The decision changes the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, stating that bans expire at death. Rose was banned in 1989 for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal. The earliest Rose or Jackson could be inducted into the Hall of Fame is 2028, but the decision has sparked debate due to their past controversies.</p>
