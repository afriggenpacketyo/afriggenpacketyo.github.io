          <p>911 emergency phone systems experienced a significant outage across Mississippi and Louisiana on Thursday, which authorities attributed to an accidental cut of AT&T fiber optic lines. The disruption prompted law enforcement agencies to provide alternative local numbers for emergencies via social media. Officials stated there was no indication of malicious activity, though the incident highlighted infrastructure vulnerabilities. By Thursday evening, service was progressively being restored in various parishes and counties, with New Orleans reporting that its system had returned to being fully functional.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have released a detailed timeline of the deadly attack on a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, indicating the shooter engaged in extensive pre-attack planning. Evidence, including a handwritten note expressing a desire to cause "real terror" for ICE agents, points to a targeted attack. The gunman, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, used a rifle to fire on the facility, killing one detainee and injuring two others inside a transport van. The investigation revealed the shooter had also used mobile applications to track the presence of ICE agents.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order approving a deal designed to prevent a U.S. ban of the social media app TikTok. The agreement establishes a new U.S.-based joint venture, with Chinese parent company ByteDance owning less than 20%, to comply with a divest-or-ban law. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will hold a majority stake and manage the app's algorithm and U.S. user data to address national security concerns. The new entity is reportedly valued at approximately $14 billion, with the White House expressing confidence that it satisfies all legal requirements.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Thursday that he would not permit Israel to annex the occupied West Bank, stating, "It's time to stop now." This public declaration aligns with reports that he had privately assured Arab leaders he would oppose such a move. The statement comes as some hardline members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government have advocated for annexation in response to several Western nations recognizing a Palestinian state. Annexation of the territory, which has been under Israeli occupation since 1967, is widely viewed as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Sara Jane Moore, who attempted to assassinate President Gerald Ford in San Francisco in 1975, has died at the age of 95. Moore fired a revolver at Ford but was thwarted by a bystander, causing her to miss. She pleaded guilty to the assassination attempt and served 32 years of a life sentence before being released on parole. In later interviews, she stated that she had hoped her actions would trigger a violent revolution in the country. Her attempt occurred just 17 days after a separate assassination plot against Ford by a follower of Charles Manson.</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Dodgers head into their 13th consecutive postseason after clinching another National League West title, this article reflects on the rarity of their sustained success.

The piece quotes former Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen on the difficulty of making the playoffs and how fans should not take this successful era for granted.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured their 12th National League West division title in the last 13 years with an 8-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Manager Dave Roberts expressed that the team is playing its best baseball of the season heading into the playoffs.

          <p>President Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday aimed at creating a strategy to counter organized political violence and domestic terrorism, which he characterized as a left-wing network. At the signing, Trump stated the goal was to target the funders of anarchist and agitator groups, though he was vague about specific organizations. The move has drawn criticism from opponents who fear it could be used as a pretext for a broad crackdown on political dissent. The initiative follows recent calls from the administration for retribution after the murder of a far-right pundit and a deadly attack on an ICE facility.</p>

This hawkish turn, supported by President Trump, marks a departure from the previous priority of containing the war within Ukraine's borders.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has formally requested that the U.S. Supreme Court reject the Trump administration's attempt to remove her from the central bank's board. Her lawyers argued that allowing the president to fire her would undermine the Federal Reserve's independence and could cause chaos in financial markets. The legal battle began after President Trump announced he would remove Cook based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. A lower court had previously blocked her removal, and a group of former top economic officials, including three past Fed chairs, has filed a brief supporting Cook's position.</p>

          <p>KION-TV, a news station serving California's central coast for over 50 years, has abruptly closed its newsroom and laid off more than a dozen employees. The station's owner, News-Press & Gazette, announced a new partnership with a San Francisco CBS affiliate to provide news coverage, effectively ending its local news production. Staff members were reportedly shocked by the sudden decision, which also affects the Spanish-language station Telemundo 23, housed in the same building. The closure is another significant blow to local journalism in the U.S., which has seen a dramatic decline in reporters and news outlets in recent decades.</p>

          <p>A group of Walt Disney Co. shareholders, including the American Federation of Teachers union, is demanding the company release records related to its decision to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" followed comments he made about the person who killed a conservative activist, and came after the FCC Chairman called for action against the host. Although the show has since been reinstated, the shareholders' letter expresses concern that the board may have breached its duties by caving to political pressure from the Trump administration, and they are seeking to understand the internal decision-making process.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning music producer Jack Antonoff has publicly criticized Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino for claiming that concert tickets are still "underpriced." In a social media post, Antonoff called the viewpoint "sick" and argued for making it illegal to sell tickets above face value to eliminate market chaos and give control back to artists. His comments come as Live Nation, along with its subsidiary Ticketmaster, faces an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice and a separate lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission over alleged illegal resale tactics. Antonoff stated that artists are actively seeking ways to make concerts more affordable for fans.</p>

          <p>Bryson DeChambeau has transformed from a divisive figure into a talisman for the U.S. Ryder Cup team, with teammates now viewing him as a central, "gladiator"-like presence. Previously met with ambivalence from peers and taunts from fans, DeChambeau has reportedly made a concerted effort to integrate with the team, earning praise from captain Keegan Bradley. After being snubbed for the 2023 team following his move to LIV Golf, he earned an automatic spot for this year's event through strong major championship performances. His national pride and on-course intensity are now seen as key assets for the American squad at Bethpage.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has initiated a "phased restart" of some operations after a major cyberattack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines. While its factories remain closed, the company has restored some financial and logistics systems, allowing it to process payments to suppliers and manage vehicle sales. The prolonged shutdown has raised serious concerns about the viability of smaller firms in JLR's supply chain. In response, the UK government has stated it is working around the clock on a potential support package for these affected businesses.</p>

          <p>U.S. new vehicle sales have received an unexpected boost, with industry analyst Cox Automotive raising its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million units. This increased demand is attributed to consumers buying vehicles now to avoid potential future price hikes from tariffs and the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits. While this has benefited automakers like General Motors and Toyota in the short term, analysts predict the sales pace will slow in the fourth quarter and into next year. The current trend shows larger, established brands gaining market share while smaller automakers are struggling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of used-vehicle retailer CarMax dropped 20% on Thursday after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The stock closed at its lowest price since March 2020. The company's revenue was approximately $6.6 billion, down 6% from the previous year, while overall vehicle sales declined by 4.1%. CarMax CEO Bill Nash described the quarter as "challenging," citing difficult market conditions and depreciation in its vehicle inventory. The poor performance is seen by many as a barometer for the broader auto retail sector, leading to a drop in other car retailers' stock prices as well. (not investment advice)</p>
