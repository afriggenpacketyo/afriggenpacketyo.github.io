          <p>During Bryan Kohberger's sentencing for the murder of four university students, the victims' families delivered powerful impact statements to the court. The fathers of Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen emotionally addressed the killer, expressing their profound grief, anger, and the permanent void left by the murders. The statements conveyed the devastating and lasting trauma inflicted upon their families, but also their resolve to move forward and not let the tragedy define them completely. The court heard how the senseless act of violence shattered numerous lives beyond just the four individuals killed.</p>

          <p>Retail traders, largely coordinating on platforms like Reddit's WallStreetBets, have targeted GoPro and Krispy Kreme, causing significant short-term spikes in their stock prices. This speculative activity mirrors the 2021 GameStop phenomenon, focusing on heavily shorted or low-priced stocks in an attempt to force a short squeeze. The article notes this trend is occurring alongside a broader market rally, which some analysts attribute to relief over economic data and recent tariff news. This renewed interest in meme stocks highlights the continued influence of retail investors on market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has detailed its national artificial intelligence strategy, which prioritizes reducing regulatory burdens to accelerate innovation and secure America's global leadership in the field. The plan's three pillars focus on supporting American workers, ensuring AI systems are free from ideological bias, and protecting U.S. technology from foreign adversaries. Officials emphasized that this approach aims to avoid Europe's "innovation-killing" regulations and foster massive private-sector investment in domestic AI infrastructure, including data centers and energy production.</p>

          <p>Syria's new interim government, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, is struggling to contain deadly violence between community groups, such as recent clashes in Sweida province between Druze and Bedouin-Sunni factions. This escalating conflict undermines the government's efforts to unify the nation after the fall of the Assad regime, putting its authority to the test. Experts warn that al-Sharaa's thin support base and the presence of extremist elements pose significant challenges to achieving long-term stability and reconciliation in the fractured country.</p>

          <p>This article explains how credit card companies calculate minimum monthly payments, which typically range from 1-3% of the balance or a percentage plus interest and fees. For a $2,000 balance with a 22% APR, the minimum payment could be between $40 and $60. Experts strongly advise paying more than the minimum, as only doing so results in significantly higher interest costs over a much longer repayment period.

          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will implement a "low double-digit" price increase across its candy portfolio to combat the unprecedented rise in global cocoa prices. The cost of cocoa has surged due to poor harvests in West Africa, driven by climate change and disease, creating a global shortage. Hershey stated the price hikes are a direct reflection of these rising ingredient costs and not related to tariffs, as the company also pivots to promote products that are less cocoa-intensive, signaling broad impacts of commodity inflation.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence system, named Aeneas, designed to help historians analyze fragmented ancient texts, such as Roman inscriptions. The tool can suggest missing words, estimate the date of an inscription, and determine its geographical origin by cross-referencing a vast database of 176,000 known texts. While not a replacement for human expertise, the system acts as a powerful assistant, rapidly identifying historical parallels that could take a scholar months or years to find, potentially transforming the study of ancient history.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Ben Schneider, the frontman of the band Lord Huron, delved into the themes of his new album, "The Cosmic Selector: Vol. 1." He discussed how the music explores unanswerable questions about life, consciousness, and love, embracing mystery rather than providing definitive answers. Schneider also touched on his creative process, his appreciation for "crucial weirdos," and the powerful, sometimes irrational, pull of nostalgia that shapes the band's haunted Americana sound and poignant lyrical style, offering insight into his artistic vision.</p>

The piece highlights Trump's denial of writing a note in Epstein's birthday scrapbook, his attempts to kill the story, and his efforts to deflect by attacking political opponents. The author argues that by framing the issue as another "witch hunt" comparable to his election fraud claims, Trump is acting in a manner that appears more guilty than innocent, fueling further speculation.</p>

Experts attribute this crisis to a combination of intense academic pressure, a "toxic competitiveness" in the education system, and a lack of adequate mental health support. The Indian government has acknowledged the problem and is implementing new programs, while mental health advocates call for systemic changes, including teaching coping skills and integrating mental health education into school curricula to address this tragic trend.</p>

          <p>For the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion, thousands of Ukrainians have protested against their own government after President Zelenskyy signed a controversial law. The new legislation curtails the independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), placing them under the authority of a political appointee.
