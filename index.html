          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Ukraine's recent attack on Russian airplanes and nuclear talks with Iran. Putin expressed his intent to retaliate against Ukraine for the strike, which Kyiv claimed hit over 40 Russian bombers. Trump indicated the conversation was productive but unlikely to immediately lead to peace. The call lasted approximately 75 minutes, but Trump did not indicate whether he discouraged Putin from retaliating. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing conflict and potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, a city already hosting autonomous vehicle testing by companies like Waymo and Amazon's Zoox. Austin's appeal lies in its tech-friendly environment, affordable housing, and favorable regulations. Tesla's approach relies on camera-based systems, differing from Waymo's sensor-heavy model. However, Tesla has faced delays in delivering self-driving technology, and faces regulatory hurdles despite Texas's generally favorable stance. The success of robotaxi services in Austin could influence the future of autonomous vehicle regulation nationwide.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns that a large federal government could be detrimental under a leader like Donald Trump, the author argues that a strong government with oversight is essential. The principal issue with the Trump presidency is not the power of the federal government but rather the lack of sufficient oversight. A robust state is necessary to cater to the needs of its citizens and respond to crises effectively. Strengthening oversight mechanisms and checks and balances, rather than shrinking government, is crucial for protecting against abuse of power.</p>

          <p>The Florida board of governors rejected the hiring of Santa Ono as president of the University of Florida due to concerns about his past support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The decision followed a contentious meeting where board members questioned Ono's record, including his response to pro-Palestinian protests at the University of Michigan. The rejection reflects a broader conservative effort to challenge DEI efforts in higher education.</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates after a weak ADP jobs report. Trump criticized Powell for not cutting rates, claiming it puts the U.S. at an economic disadvantage. Trump has repeatedly pressured Powell to lower borrowing rates, even hinting at firing him. The European Central Bank is expected to lower rates, adding to the pressure on the Fed to take similar action (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Vietnam has abolished its long-standing two-child policy to address a declining birth rate and shrinking working-age population. The Vietnamese lawmakers passed new amendments to the Population Law, leaving it up to families to decide how many children they want to have. The Ministry of Health warned that the national fertility rate has dropped to 1.91 per woman, which is the lowest in Vietnam's modern history. The country is also facing challenges with an aging population.</p>
