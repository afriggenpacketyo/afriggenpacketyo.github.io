          <p>Jarren Duran of the Boston Red Sox executed a straight steal of home against the Cleveland Guardians, marking the first time a Red Sox player has accomplished this feat in 16 years. Duran attributed his decision to the new rules, which restrict catchers from blocking the plate, and his awareness that the pitcher was working from the stretch. Manager Alex Cora praised Duran's ability to capitalize on the situation, and opposing manager Stephen Vogt acknowledged the heads-up play. Duran's successful steal contributed to the Red Sox's 7-3 victory. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's approval rating has reached its lowest point in 80 years at the 100-day mark of his presidency, according to a new poll. The poll indicates widespread disapproval of many of Trump's policies and significant economic discontent, with a majority of voters expressing concerns about a potential recession. Despite these negative assessments, Trump still maintains an edge over the Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems. This reflects a broader bipartisan disaffection with the political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has offered a glimmer of hope to Ukrainians amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia. Trump questioned why President Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the U.S. is trying to broker peace talks, suggesting a possible shift in his approach towards Russia. Ukrainians view this as a potential sign that Trump may not force Ukraine into a disadvantageous peace plan. This comes after a massive Russian missile attack on Ukraine's capital and U.S. efforts to push Ukraine to accept a peace plan.</p>

          <p>A recent Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Reagan National Airport is linked to the practice of "visual separation," where pilots navigate around other aircraft independently. The crew requested and received permission for visual separation shortly before the crash, highlighting the potential risks when this practice is mishandled. Aviation experts have warned about these risks for years, and the incident underscores the importance of stringent safety protocols. The crash resulted in the loss of all crew members on board the helicopter.</p>

          <p>The prevalence of environmental toxins poses a significant threat to fertility, with Black families facing an outsize risk due to living in more polluted areas. A recent Human Rights Watch report links air pollution to gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and fibroids, while contaminants like heavy metals and industrial solvents are associated with infertility and pregnancy complications. Personal stories highlight the shame and dismissal surrounding infertility, emphasizing the need to connect Black maternal health to environmental pollution. The conversation underscores the systemic issues and environmental injustices affecting reproductive health.</p>

The 1967 Outer Space Treaty bans state exploitation but is vague on private claims, fueling a scramble for asteroid mines, lunar ice, and helium 3. Critics argue that this privatization risks turning space into a realm of corporate extraction rather than a shared resource needing ethical stewardship.
