          <p>New York City police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Columbia University after they occupied Butler Library, leading to clashes with public safety officers and reported injuries. The university requested NYPD assistance due to disruptions and safety concerns, citing a large number of participants and attempts to force entry into the library. Protesters inside claimed they were choked and beaten by public safety officers. Columbia has implemented stricter campus access rules following the incident, requiring university IDs for building entry and suspending guest access, as the university administration aims to restore order amidst ongoing protests and pre-final exam reading week.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has accused India of launching a drone attack that resulted in civilian casualties and injuries to soldiers in the disputed Kashmir region, heightening tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations. This follows India's missile strikes on multiple locations within Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which Pakistan labeled an 'act of war'. India initiated national preparedness exercises, anticipating potential retaliation from Pakistan, as the ongoing crisis stems from a recent terrorist attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, an event for which India blames Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk has adjusted its global container market volume growth forecast for 2025 from 4% to a range of -1% to 4% due to increasing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, particularly stemming from the trade tariff landscape between the U.S. and China. Despite this revision, Maersk reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit, driven by robust demand earlier in the year. The shipping industry continues to navigate the complexities arising from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, which include significant import duties on products from China, prompting retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on U.S. goods.</p>

McBride, who struggles to differentiate between red and orange, and sees light blues as grey, embraces experimentation and challenges to show that color blindness is not a barrier to creativity in make-up. Although she was eliminated from the competition after two weeks, she takes pride in her work, inspiring others to pursue their goals regardless of their limitations.

          <p>In an interview on 'Interesting Times', Senator Chris Murphy discusses the Democratic Party's performance during the first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term, suggesting the party was unprepared for Trump's coordinated assault on the rule of law. Murphy argues that Democrats need to match Trump's intensity with their own sense of urgency and be willing to take more risks. He emphasizes the importance of addressing the perception that the current democracy is rigged in favor of billionaires and special interests by focusing on campaign finance reform and ethics. Murphy connects economic policy with government integrity, suggesting that unrigging the economy requires unrigging the government.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge in Boston has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing concerns that the deportations would violate a previous order ensuring their right to due process. The order came after reports that the U.S. military was preparing to fly migrants to Libya, a country mired in conflict. The judge emphasized that officials must provide migrants with written notice in their language and a meaningful opportunity to file a claim to prevent their removal. The Libyan Prime Minister stated that his country refused to be a destination for the deportation of migrants under any pretext.</p>

          <p>Nintendo projects to sell 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, with market analysts expecting similar numbers in 2025 alone. This forecast comes as the company reported a decrease in fourth-quarter revenue and profit, due to consumers awaiting the new console. Nintendo is also monitoring the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on goods manufactured in Vietnam, which could affect pricing and demand in the U.S. market. The company's president noted that tariffs could significantly reduce profits, and analysts believe Nintendo's forecasts are typically conservative.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on numerous trading partners, though details remain unclear. The agreement, anticipated since Trump's first term, could lower British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and remove taxes on U.S. technology companies. The announcement follows nearly three years of negotiations, with Britain also negotiating trade deals with the European Union and recently agreeing to a trade deal with India. This agreement could offer vindication for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of President Trump.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times argues that the United States has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, defining it as a system where opposition comes with a price, citing the Trump administration's weaponization of government agencies against critics. The authors, Steven Levitsky, Lucan Way, and Daniel Ziblatt, claim that the administration has selectively deployed law enforcement, targeted law firms and donors, and assaulted universities, leading to a chilling effect on free speech and political opposition. They suggest that the government has become an oligarchy. The authors contend that civil society leaders are not doing enough to resist and that America's slide into authoritarianism is reversible, but only if civil society acts collectively.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that home washing machines may not effectively eliminate harmful bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, even at high temperatures. Half of the tested machines failed to disinfect clothing during a rapid cycle, while a third did not clean sufficiently during a standard cycle. The study suggests that domestic laundering of healthcare uniforms could spread antimicrobial resistance within communities and hospitals. Researchers recommend that healthcare professionals and institutions re-evaluate policies allowing workers to wash work clothing at home and suggest using disinfectants and high-temperature washes to minimize risks.</p>

          <p>A woman discovered a collection of letters her mother received from servicemen during World War II, revealing a previously unknown aspect of her life. The letters, written by soldiers who met her mother at Red Cross dances in Rome, offered a glimpse into her interactions and relationships with the men. The collection also included comment cards the mother had written about each man, detailing their dancing skills and other observations. The discovery provided a new perspective on her mother, who had rarely spoken about her experiences during the war.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania reportedly exhibited erratic behavior during a meeting with teachers union representatives, including repeating himself, shouting, and slamming his hands on a desk, prompting a staff member to end the meeting. This incident follows a New York Magazine story detailing concerns about Fetterman's mental health, citing a letter from his former chief of staff about his behavior. Fetterman's office attributed the incident to frustration with the Trump administration's education cuts, while union representatives declined to comment on the private conversation. The event has led to questions about Fetterman's health.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade deal with the United Kingdom on Thursday, potentially easing investor concerns over global tariffs. The UK government has been eager to secure a deal post-Brexit to expand global trade ties. A British official suggested the UK is considering lowering tariffs on U.S. cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting U.S. tech companies. While details remain unclear, the deal could be a significant win for both countries.</p>

          <p>For Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the news of an imminent trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. That Britain is the first country in the world to conclude a deal with the United States after Mr. Trump imposed an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on dozens of American trading partners seemed to affirm the “special relationship” often invoked by British and American diplomats. Starmer turned up in the Oval Office\nwith a letter from King Charles III\n, inviting Mr. Trump to make a rare second state visit to Britain.</p>
