          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, carrying 277 people, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two fatalities and 19 injuries. The incident occurred at 8:30 p.m. when the ship reportedly lost power and mechanical function, causing it to drift into the bridge pillar. Cellphone videos captured the collision, showing crew members dangling from the damaged masts. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, with preliminary information suggesting a mechanical issue. Despite the accident, officials have confirmed that the Brooklyn Bridge did not sustain structural damage.</p>

Authorities stated that the pilot experienced mechanical issues while navigating the ship out of the channel, leading to the collision. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a full investigation into the incident, which briefly closed all lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, dramatically reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was driven by winds up to 70 miles per hour from thunderstorms, lifting dry soil into the air. Visibility dropped to a quarter-mile at Chicago Midway International Airport, marking the first time a dust storm warning was issued for the city. The event is considered unusual, with soil moisture levels in the area being exceptionally low, reminiscent of conditions during the Dust Bowl era.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid are causing concern among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare coverage. The bill, intended to fund President Trump's agenda, includes significant tax breaks achieved by reducing spending, particularly in Medicaid. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office suggests that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance by 2034. Many Republicans argue that the cuts aim to eliminate fraud and waste, but individuals and families dependent on Medicaid fear reduced access to care and difficult choices between healthcare and basic necessities. The proposed bill would impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients.</p>

The return occurred after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of the region. Most of the 360 refugees were women and children, transported across the border in buses provided by Rwandan authorities. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and Save the Children escorted the returnees, with plans to repatriate 2,000 people. The returnees will receive emergency assistance and reintegration support, marking the end of a long exile for some who were born in Congo and had never seen Rwanda.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic activities in the Middle East indicate a shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu playing a less central role. During a tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, Trump pursued peace deals in Iran and Yemen and negotiated business agreements, without stopping in Israel. This change has raised concerns about the U.S. sidelining its long-standing ally, despite Trump's insistence that it benefits Israel by fostering relationships with Middle Eastern countries. The article also cites instances such as a cease-fire with Houthi militants in Yemen and the release of an American hostage in Gaza, both achieved without Israel's involvement.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's efforts to improve relations with the European Union are facing significant opposition from the British news media, despite surveys indicating that most Britons regret Brexit. Media outlets are using terms like "surrender summit" to describe the upcoming meeting with EU leaders, reflecting a vocal minority of voters and lawmakers who oppose closer ties. The article suggests that the government is behind public opinion on rapprochement with the EU, with some experts noting a lack of communication on the positive aspects of cooperation.

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving toward renewed cooperation, driven by a changing global landscape under President Trump's administration. A summit in London is expected to produce a defense and security agreement to bolster military security in Europe. The US is pulling back from global leadership on defense and free trade, and this may be a powerful incentive for greater cooperation with the bloc, along with the chance to reduce some of the costly trade barriers erected by Brexit. Discussions also include relaxing food trade rules and deepening energy cooperation, despite persistent sticking points like fishing rights and youth travel.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have announced the development of a stable fiber-optic gyroscope suitable for navigation in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. The gyroscope, created by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, offers a more reliable method for measuring orientation and rotation. This is especially useful in inertial navigation systems, which do not rely on external signals and are therefore immune to interference, which is vital for military and security applications. Fiber-optic gyroscopes, including interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (IFOGs), are used in both military and civilian settings ranging from aerospace to weapons systems, oil platforms and autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <p>A 1993 Minneapolis murder case is revisited, focusing on a rare clue: bloody, bare footprints found at the crime scene. The victim, Jeanie Childs, was found stabbed to death in her apartment, with the footprints indicating the killer was barefoot. Investigators compared the footprints to multiple suspects, eventually using investigative genetic genealogy to identify Jerry Westrom as a potential match. Westrom's DNA was found at the scene, and his footprints were later compared to the crime scene prints, leading to his arrest and conviction. The case highlights the importance of forensic evidence and advancements in DNA technology in solving cold cases.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on potential price increases, asserting that the retailer should absorb the costs. This followed Walmart's warning that tariffs would force it to raise prices on its goods. Trump's intervention comes as he aims to prevent inflation amid his trade policies. The article notes that Walmart sources a significant portion of its products from abroad, particularly China and Mexico, making it susceptible to tariff impacts. This action is one of several companies that have said they will be forced to pass on the costs of tariffs to consumers.</p>

          <p>The government is exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is advocating for expanding unpaid work programs, which she views as insufficiently punitive. Under the proposed scheme, probation teams would collaborate with councils to assign tasks to offenders, and private companies could also employ them. Offenders would not receive wages, but the earnings would be allocated to a fund for victim's groups. The proposal comes amid prison overcrowding, with the aim of punishing offenders outside of prison while benefiting the community.</p>

However, the song was a manic mish-mash of musical styles, which sped up in the verses, and slowed down for the choruses, with all the consistency of a jelly in a heatwave. The performance lacked the scale of other entries, and the UK's music industry isn't particularly well integrated with Europe.</p>
