        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Venezuelans, reversing a lower court's block on the decision. Former President Biden had previously extended the TPS program for Venezuelans, but Noem revoked the protections in February, a move halted by a federal court before the Supreme Court intervened. Activists have condemned the decision as stripping a large group of non-citizens of immigration status, while Homeland Security officials stated it was a win for American safety and criticized the Biden administration's use of the program. The legal battle reflects ongoing tensions regarding immigration policy and the treatment of migrants seeking refuge in the United States.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in New Orleans for six inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish jail, drawing attention to the facility's long-standing issues. The inmates, facing charges including murder and armed robbery, broke out by creating a hole in a cell wall, leaving a taunting message behind. Louisiana's Governor Landry has demanded answers about the jailbreak, highlighting the jail's history of overcrowding, understaffing, and inadequate oversight. The Orleans Parish jail has been under a federal consent decree since 2013 due to poor conditions, with ongoing concerns about defective infrastructure and camera malfunctions, which is leading to greater scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's potential to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly becoming the largest global listing in 2025, with funds primarily allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients. CATL's expansion into Europe coincides with similar moves by other Chinese EV makers, amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU regarding trade practices.

          <p>US Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, has been charged with assaulting federal agents following a confrontation at an immigration detention center in New Jersey, while a trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was dismissed. McIver claims federal law enforcement escalated the situation and that the charges against her are politically motivated, aimed at deterring legislative oversight. The incident occurred during a visit by the congressional delegation to the detention center, leading to a chaotic scene and the mayor's arrest. Democrats and legal advocates have reacted with alarm, viewing the prosecution of McIver as an attempt to stifle opposition to the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

While President Trump offered initial well wishes, he later questioned the timing of the disclosure, with other Republicans alleging a cover-up during Biden's time in office.

          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, believing he died in the explosion. Bartkus, who had nihilistic views and opposed bringing people into the world against their will, used a large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device. The attack, which injured four others, is considered the largest bombing ever investigated in Southern California. While investigators confirmed that explosive material was found inside of Bartkus' home, they stressed that there is no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) provided its first update on the investigation into the crash involving a Mexican navy ship and the Brooklyn Bridge, revealing that the ship accelerated suddenly before the collision. The CuauhtÃ©moc, carrying 277 people, was moving at 2.3 knots before its speed increased to six knots, resulting in the masts striking the bridge. Investigators are seeking access to the ship to inspect the engine and interview crew members, while emphasizing that the bridge's structural integrity remains intact. The accident resulted in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to others, prompting questions about the ship's propulsion and the events leading up to the crash.</p>

Baraka criticized the ICE facility, while McIver denied the charges against her, calling them "purely political" and claiming ICE agents created an unnecessary confrontation.

The deals will generate nearly 9 billion pounds a year by 2040, adding just 0.2 percent to Britain's GDP, with Brexit costing the country 5.5 percent of its GDP.

McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and an attempt to deter legislative oversight, while the U.S. attorney maintains that the conduct cannot be overlooked.

          <p>Ruth LÃ³pez, a leading human rights activist and critic of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, has been arrested in El Salvador on charges of embezzlement of state funds. LÃ³pez leads the anti-corruption and justice program for the human rights organization Cristosal, which has documented human rights abuses in the country. Her arrest has been condemned by international human rights organizations, who are concerned about the growing crackdown on dissent and the increasingly close ties between the Trump administration and the Bukele government. Cristosal says Lopez was arrested at her home late on Sunday evening by armed police and that her whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
