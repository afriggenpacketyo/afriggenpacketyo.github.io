          <p>Two teenagers, Thalha Jubair and Owen Flowers, have been charged in connection with a cyberattack on Transport for London (TfL) that occurred on August 31 of the previous year, causing significant disruption for three months. Investigators believe the teens are members of the cyber-criminal group Scattered Spider. The attack resulted in unauthorized access to personal information of approximately 5,000 TfL customers, including names, emails, and bank details. The National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested the teenagers, who appeared in court charged under the Computer Misuse Act. This incident highlights the increasing threat from cyber criminal gangs based in the UK. Optimism surrounding the security sector has taken a hit. </p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor is adjusting its financial targets for the year, increasing revenue expectations while lowering its operating profit margin due to ongoing U.S. tariffs. The automaker now projects a 6% to 7% operating profit margin, down from 7% to 8%, and a 5% to 6% increase in revenue. This revision comes ahead of a CEO investor day in New York City, the first time the event has been held outside of South Korea. The company also reaffirmed its goal to increase annual sales to 5.55 million units by 2030, representing a 34% increase from last year. The event is happening shortly after immigration officials arrested hundreds of workers at a jointly owned battery plant in Georgia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft is set to invest $4 billion in a second data center in Wisconsin, adding to its initial $3.3 billion investment in a first data center slated to open in early 2026. The first data center will house Nvidia Blackwell GB200 chips for AI model handling, according to Microsoft President Brad Smith. Microsoft aims to match its fossil fuel energy consumption with carbon-free energy contributions, including a 250-megawatt solar farm. The initial data center, located on land originally intended for a Foxconn plant, will employ 400 people and use as much water annually as a restaurant. The article also mentions Microsoft's infrastructure spending in the U.K. and a deal with Amsterdam's Nebius Group. </p>

          <p>The UK government has secured £150 billion in US investment, projected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with the signing of the "Tech Prosperity Deal" between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Companies like Microsoft and Google have pledged billions in spending in the UK as part of this agreement. The UK aims to strengthen economic ties with the US through this deal, although some industries, such as steel, face setbacks. Microsoft plans to invest £22 billion in the UK over four years, while Google will invest £5 billion over two years to expand a data center. The investments are hoped to boost Britain's economy despite slowing investment from domestic businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines plans to cut its capacity by approximately 25% starting in November as part of a restructuring effort. The airline's CEO, Dave Davis, indicated in a memo to employees that these scheduling reductions will likely lead to layoffs to reduce costs. This announcement follows Spirit's recent decision to halt service in a dozen U.S. cities and abandon plans to launch service in Macon, Georgia. The cuts come as discount carriers face increasing competition from larger airlines that are attracting budget-conscious travelers. Spirit operates roughly 5,000 flights to 88 destinations across the U.S., Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama, and Colombia. </p>

The law, set to take effect on December 4, could impose penalties of at least $100,000 on providers who mail pills into the state, which bans virtually all abortions. The law represents the cutting edge of the anti-abortion movement’s campaign against abortion pills and telehealth, which have become increasingly popular since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. Providers are mailing pills under legal innovations known as “shield laws,” which have yet to be seriously tested in court. </p>

          <p>NBA star Kevin Durant is unable to access his Coinbase bitcoin account due to a lost password, which has inadvertently benefited him as the cryptocurrency's value has skyrocketed. Durant began buying bitcoin in 2016 when he played for the Golden State Warriors. His agent, Rich Kleiman, said they have not been able to track down his Coinbase account information, so they have never sold anything, and this bitcoin is just through the roof. Kleiman and Durant are also investors in Coinbase Global and have a multi-year deal to promote the trading platform. Bitcoin's price has increased significantly since Durant's initial investment.

          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper suggests the Federal Reserve could make a few more interest rate cuts, but cautions against excessive easing, which could lead to inflation and market dangers. Tepper said that if the Fed cuts rates while inflation hasn't been fully tamed, demand can pick up faster than supply, reigniting price pressures. Too-easy monetary policy could also create asset bubbles as investors flock to riskier markets. Tepper acknowledges high valuations but remains constructive due to the current easing, advising against fighting the Fed. He notes that the market anticipates further rate cuts before the year's end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel, host of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!", has been suspended from ABC following controversial remarks he made about the murder of Charlie Kirk. Nexstar, a major station owner, announced it would pre-empt the late-night talk show on its stations. Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, threatened action against ABC for Kimmel's comments. Donald Trump praised the decision, while the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA criticized the move as endangering freedom of speech. Kimmel made the remarks in his monologue Monday, suggesting allies of President Trump were trying to use Kirk's assassination for political gain. </p>

          <p>ABC took popular late-night (and former Oscar) host Jimmy Kimmel off the air "indefinitely" after comments he made suggesting Kirk's killer may have been a MAGA Republican. Paramount's CBS arm quietly paid Trump $16 million (€13.5 million) to settle a lawsuit over a 2024 "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. Disney recently renounced "woke" values, with the company's CEO, Bob Iger, declaring that its mandate is to "entertain" rather than to advance "any kind of agenda." The programming shift is equally visible, Amazon is paying a jaw-dropping $40 million for two documentaries by and about Melania Trump. This reorientation is not entirely about ideology, Economics play a decisive role, and that Hollywood is trading one kind of conformity for another. </p>

          <p>A review of the Jordan Peele-produced horror film "Him" critiques its deviation from traditional sports movie formulas, recasting football as a brutal meat grinder. The film follows Cameron Cade, a college quarterback, whose career is threatened by a head injury, leading him to a training compound where he faces vice and duplicity. The reviewer criticizes the film's lack of subtlety and its struggle to suspend disbelief, particularly regarding the privilege of quarterbacks and the age of a fading football legend. While the film has interesting points about football's conflation of white Christian values and American jingoism, it ultimately fails to deliver a cutting takedown of the sport. The reviewer praises the supporting cast but finds the story unconvincing. </p>

The incident refers to the evening of September 18 when the Japanese Kwantung Army in Shenyang, Liaoning province, used an explosion on the South Manchuria Railway as a pretext for an invasion and quickly occupied three northeastern provinces. The commentary did not directly mention the Mukden Incident but began with the statement: “An important day in history is bound to be a significant moment in history.” Many Chinese view the incident as a day of national humiliation. </p>

          <p>Robert McNamara confided to a Pentagon aide: “I want to give the order to get our troops out of there so bad that I can hardly stand it.” Throughout his remaining 22 months in the administration, McNamara advised Johnson to temper the intensity of the conflict and seek a diplomatic resolution, all while faithfully carrying out the president’s orders to expand the war. But letters, diaries, and other materials unavailable to previous biographers reveal that the defense secretary led a double life. McNamara was a war proponent in the Johnson administration and a war opponent in private, at once driven by a lust to succeed in the president’s eyes and horrified by the human toll of what he came to see as an unwinnable war.</p>
