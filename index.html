            <p>Sarah and Gordon Brown, following the loss of their daughter Jennifer, established the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory in 2004 to investigate premature birth. The Theirworld Edinburgh Birth Cohort, a key part of the lab's work, tracks 400 children from birth to adulthood to understand the long-term effects of early labor on brain development. Findings highlight the significant impact of poverty on brain development, with babies from deprived backgrounds facing similar risks to those born prematurely in affluent families. The study emphasizes the importance of nutrition, sleep, and maternal care in mitigating the effects of premature birth.</p>

            <p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN agency, is considering implementing a global emissions tax on the shipping industry to phase out fossil fuel use. This move could establish a landmark carbon levy and reduce the climate impact of international shipping, which accounts for approximately 3% of global carbon emissions. However, the implementation of a carbon tax faces challenges due to concerns about U.S. tariffs, a potential global trade war, and resistance from some member states. Fortescue, an Australian mining giant, views the talks as historic and a potential game-changer, but acknowledges that the outcome is uncertain.</p>

            <p>India's central bank has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6% in an effort to stimulate the country's slowing economic growth. This decision aligns with analyst expectations and comes as the U.S. imposes reciprocal tariffs, including a 26% levy on Indian goods. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cited increased global economic uncertainties due to tariffs as a factor influencing its decision, despite softening inflation. HSBC predicts the tariffs will directly reduce India's full-year growth by 0.5 percentage points for the financial year ending March 2026.</p>

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs on imports, including a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, have gone into effect, intensifying a potential global trade war. Financial markets in Asia have declined, and U.S. stock futures suggest further losses on Wall Street. While Trump has indicated he is open to "tailored deals" with trading partners, China has vowed to retaliate, with tariffs on U.S. goods scheduled to take effect soon. Experts warn of potential inflation as the tariffs increase prices, while Canada has also implemented tariffs on certain U.S. auto imports.</p>

            <p>Ecuador has become a major transit point for cocaine smuggled from Colombia and Peru to Europe, with the Albanian mafia playing a significant role in the trafficking. Despite not producing cocaine, 70% of the world's cocaine now flows through Ecuador's ports, leading to a surge in violence and record drug seizures. The rise in trafficking is attributed to increased European cocaine consumption, economic factors, and the presence of European gangs who exploit legal exports like bananas to conceal illicit cargo. Efforts to combat the trade are hampered by corruption, limited resources, and the vulnerability of ordinary workers caught in the supply chain.</p>

China faces the highest tariffs, with a cumulative rate of 104% on its goods, leading to retaliatory measures.

            <p>Chinese commentators suggest that China may consider expanding its trade dispute with the US to include the services sector in response to Washington's increased tariffs. This could involve restricting US firms from participating in Chinese government procurement or limiting cooperation with US law firms and consultancies. Other potential countermeasures include increasing tariffs on US soybeans, banning imports of US poultry and Hollywood films, suspending cooperation on fentanyl control, and investigating US companies in China over intellectual property issues.</p>

Kennedy Jr. has traveled to Texas to address the situation and support health officials, while experts emphasize the importance of vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

            <p>Cambodia is facing a crisis in its manufacturing sector due to the Trump administration's imposition of a 49% tariff on its goods. Despite the goal of bringing manufacturing back to the US, this is unlikely to happen, as manufacturers are looking to other countries to relocate their supply chains. The tariff is expected to have a devastating impact on Cambodian factories and workers, with new orders being paused and companies struggling to survive. The Cambodian government is exploring measures to mitigate the pressure, such as fiscal policies and tax credits.</p>

            <p>Sick sea lions are attacking beachgoers in Southern California, with multiple incidents reported recently. The animals are suffering from domoic acid toxicosis, a neurological condition caused by a harmful algal bloom.

Experts say that while attacks are rare, the number of sickened animals appears to be increasing, raising concerns among residents and prompting warnings to stay away from marine mammals on the beach.</p>

Citi has cut its GDP forecast to 4.2% for the year, citing limited scope for a deal between the two countries. Natixis has also reduced its forecast to 4.2%, while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have warned of increasing downside risks to their current 4.5% growth expectations.
