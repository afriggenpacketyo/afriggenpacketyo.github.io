            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration. Van Hollen reaffirmed his commitment to fighting for Garcia's return to the U.S. Garcia's deportation sparked a legal standoff, with courts ordering the U.S. government to facilitate his return, though the Trump administration has alleged Garcia's gang affiliations, which his lawyers deny. The meeting occurred after Van Hollen was initially denied access to the prison where Garcia is being held, highlighting the ongoing controversy and political divisions surrounding the case.</p>

            <p>The White House is restructuring the National Security Council (NSC) by appointing aides who are seen as strongly supporting President Trump's policies. This follows the dismissal of six individuals earlier in the month, with Derek Harvey expected to take a senior role in intelligence. Harvey, who previously served on the NSC, was ousted during Trump's first term due to differing viewpoints.

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports, following an investigation that found China's shipbuilding industry had an unfair advantage. The fees, phased in over several years, aim to reverse Chinese dominance and incentivize U.S.-built ships. Vessel owners can receive fee remissions by providing proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order. The policy includes exemptions for bulk exports and shipping to U.S. territories, reflecting concerns about supply chain security and economic competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

The SeaCURE project aims to test the efficiency of extracting carbon from the sea, where it is present in higher concentrations than in the air. The process involves treating seawater to release dissolved carbon as CO2, which is then captured and stored. The low-carbon seawater is returned to the ocean, where it absorbs more CO2 from the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gas reduction.</p>
