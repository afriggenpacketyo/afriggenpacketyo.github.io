            <h2>Wisconsin Audit Reveals Lack of DEI Spending Tracking by State Agencies and University System</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-12 07:00:57 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A recent audit by Wisconsin's Legislative Audit Bureau (WLAB) revealed that the University of Wisconsin system and several state agencies failed to track spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives during FY 2023-2024, leading WLAB to estimate the spending. The audit estimated that the university system spent $12.5 million on salaries for employees with DEI-related job titles and $40.2 million on offices with DEI duties, though not all funds were specifically dedicated to DEI. The university had already planned to scale back DEI efforts following a deal with Republican legislators in 2023, reducing DEI positions from 123 to 60, and removed its chief diversity officer due to fiscal responsibility issues. Twelve state agencies were found to have spent approximately $2.2 million on DEI salaries and $705,300 on DEI training, highlighting inconsistent reporting and overlapping costs.</p>

            <p>Following actions that destabilized global financial markets and a subsequent easing of trade tariffs, Donald Trump has faced criticism for appearing detached from economic realities, spending time golfing, dining with donors, and making comments deemed insensitive to those suffering economic hardship. Critics have drawn comparisons to historical figures like Nero, accusing Trump of being out of touch and prioritizing personal interests over the needs of the country. The article highlights the juxtaposition between Trump's opulent lifestyle and the economic anxieties of ordinary citizens, suggesting a potential political price to pay for his perceived indifference. Trump's initial imposition of tariffs was made with little consultation and constant deference from his inner circle, further isolating him from dissenting voices.</p>

            <p>Matthew Okula, a Los Angeles firefighter, is working to raise awareness about amniotic fluid embolism, a rare and life-threatening birthing complication, after his wife, Hailey Marie Okula, died from it shortly after giving birth. The couple conceived after nearly two years of in vitro fertilization treatment and shared their pregnancy journey on Hailey's popular Instagram account, "Rn New Grads." Okula hopes to educate expecting mothers about the complication and encourage them to discuss it with their healthcare providers, also advocating for more medical research into amniotic fluid embolism, which has no known risk factors and a high mortality rate. Hailey was known as "Nurse Hailey" on social media, where she supported graduating nurses, and her community is now supporting Okula.</p>

            <p>Economists are debating the impact of Donald Trump's tariff policies, specifically whether they preserve American jobs or simply raise prices for U.S. consumers. While tariffs may protect specific industries by discouraging imports, they also increase the cost of goods for American consumers, according to Bradley Setzler, an economist at Pennsylvania State University. Setzler notes that regions heavily exposed to import competition from China experienced significant manufacturing job losses when China became a global exporter. However, other Americans benefited from more affordable goods, highlighting the trade-off between protecting domestic industries and providing consumers with lower prices.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for arresting and detaining pro-Palestinian protesters, labeling them as "Hamas supporters" without providing evidence, following a plan from the Heritage Foundation called Project Esther, which aims to crack down on antisemitism. Project Esther calls for rebranding pro-Palestinian supporters as Hamas supporters, deporting student visa and green-card holders critical of Israel, and using anti-racketeering laws to break up pro-Palestinian groups. Critics argue that Project Esther conflates any critique of Israel with antisemitism, and that its proposals will stoke antisemitism rather than mitigate it, by making Jews the face of authoritarian crackdowns. The administration's actions are seen as an effort to dismantle civil society institutions and suppress domestic opposition under the guise of protecting Jews.</p>

Wind gusts reached up to 93mph, the strongest in the Chinese capital in over half a century, prompting authorities to issue an orange alert and advise residents to stay indoors. As of Saturday morning, 838 flights had been cancelled at Beijing's two major airports, and train services, including the airport express subway line, were suspended. Parks and historic sites were also closed, with nearly 300 trees falling in the capital, though no injuries were reported.</p>

Canadians, a significant source of tourism revenue, are boycotting American products and canceling travel plans due to Trump's threats, and the detention of a Canadian on a work visa has further exacerbated the situation. Hotels are bracing for price increases on various goods and are worried about businesses canceling conferences and families forgoing vacations due to economic pressures.</p>

Granderson questions Smith's vague promise to fix "this mess," arguing that real problems require real solutions, not just hot takes. The columnist emphasizes that governing requires more than a big personality and that Smith's reluctance to be a politician is problematic.

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that migrants facing deportation have the right to a hearing before being removed from the country, placing a check on President Trump's power to arrest and quickly deport alleged members of foreign crime gangs. The court emphasized that those facing deportation are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal before a federal judge. The ruling comes after the administration deported hundreds of prisoners, including some alleged to be members of crime gangs, without giving them a legal right to challenge their removal. While the decision is likely to slow the pace of deportations, it does not stop them entirely, and it remains unclear how the Trump administration will comply.</p>

Author John Green is also mobilizing support to lower drug prices and diagnostic tests, arguing that the world has the ability to eliminate TB but is choosing not to.

Colossal used ancient DNA from dire wolf fossils to genetically engineer gray wolves with traits resembling dire wolves, resulting in the birth of three pups. However, the Tar Pits experts argue that these are genetically engineered gray wolves, not true dire wolves. While they appreciate Colossal's work on conserving endangered species, they believe focusing on conservation is a more productive use of resources than de-extinction efforts, with the director of the excavation site inviting anyone curious about the creatures to visit La Brea Tar Pits to see some of the “real dire wolves” that they have excavated at the site.</p>

Diplomatic experts say Beijing is increasingly focused on its neighbors amid growing concerns that the world's two largest economies are on a collision course.

            <p>Rawayana, a Venezuelan band known for its Caribbean-soaked pop, has become a symbol of resilience for the Venezuelan diaspora, overcoming political opposition and economic hardship. Despite facing criticism from Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and having their homecoming tour cancelled, the band continues to create music that resonates with Venezuelans around the world. The band members, who are part of the largest diaspora in the world, have used their music as an "escape hatch" from Venezuela's turbulent political landscape. Rawayana's journey reflects the struggles and triumphs of a generation of Venezuelans who have been forced to leave their home country.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has announced that dark, ashy wildfire sediment on L.A. beaches from the January firestorm poses no chemical health risk to beachgoers. Tests conducted by the L.A. Regional Water Quality Control Board found that the sediment does not contain wildfire-related chemicals at dangerous levels. However, beachgoers are warned to watch out for physical debris like burned branches and broken glass. There are no plans to remove the sediment, as it could cause coastal erosion and harm marine life, and the beach ecosystem is expected to recover naturally over time.</p>

            <p>A plan by the IRS to share taxpayer data with ICE is causing widespread fear and anxiety among undocumented immigrants in California, who worry about being targeted for deportation. The Trump administration defends the plan as a legal tool to investigate individuals who have committed crimes, but immigrant rights groups argue it will undermine trust and discourage undocumented individuals from filing taxes, potentially costing billions in lost revenue. State leaders are speaking out against the deal, arguing it betrays decades of commitment to protecting taxpayer information and endangers immigrant communities. The IRS-ICE agreement outlines the sharing of taxpayer data for "nontax criminal enforcement," raising concerns about the weaponization of taxpayer information.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's order to expand timber production in the U.S. will affect all 18 of California's national forests, encompassing over 20 million acres. The directive stems from President Trump's executive order to increase American timber production by 25%, with the goal of providing domestic timber supplies, creating jobs, reducing wildfire disasters, and improving habitats. Environmental groups have criticized the order, arguing that it will circumvent legal protections, endanger species, and prioritize logging over environmental concerns. The order cites the need for forest management and wildfire risk-reduction projects, but experts caution that large-scale logging can make the landscape more flammable.</p>

            <p>Farmers in the United States are expressing concern over China's imposition of steep tariffs on U.S. exports, fearing increased costs for farm supplies and potential retaliation against U.S. crops. President Trump has imposed tariffs on various countries, including a significant tariff on Chinese goods, leading to China retaliating with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. The White House is considering ways to help farmers, potentially using funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), similar to aid provided during Trump's first-term trade dispute with China. However, farmers emphasize that government aid is not a long-term solution and that they prefer access to markets to sell their grain at a profit; the soybean market never recovered after China went elsewhere for soybeans during Trump's first term.

            <p>A three-year legal battle over the death of Charles Givens, an inmate with health problems and mental disabilities, at Virginia's Marion Correctional Treatment Center ended with a jury finding five former corrections officers not liable.

The defense argued that Givens died from a seizure and fall, breaking his ribs and causing fatal internal bleeding. The case raised questions about conditions at the facility, including reports of hypothermia cases, but the jury ultimately found the guards not responsible for Givens' death.</p>

            <p>Ecuador is preparing for a crucial presidential election amidst escalating drug gang violence and a struggling economy, with record-high homicide rates making security the top concern for voters. The election is a rematch between incumbent Daniel Noboa and former lawmaker Luisa González, with the country now a major hub for cocaine trafficking to the U.S. and Europe. Noboa, who declared drug gangs as "terrorists" and relies heavily on the military, faces criticism for his lack of detailed plans and reliance on foreign intervention, while González is tied to former populist president Rafael Correa, raising concerns about a communist shift. Ecuador's economic challenges limit its ability to combat crime, with GDP falling and growth expected to be among the lowest in Latin America.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A new study reveals that crows possess geometric intuition, distinguishing between regular and irregular four-sided shapes, marking the first time this ability has been observed in a non-human species. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany tested two carrion crows, finding they could identify geometric regularity in shapes, challenging the notion that this skill is exclusive to humans. The crows were trained to peck at the outlier shape in a group of six, and they consistently identified the irregular quadrilateral among perfect squares, parallelograms, and other shapes. This suggests that humans' geometric abilities may build upon precursor capabilities present in the animal kingdom.</p>

Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who has previously endorsed immunization conspiracy theories, has visited the region but has struggled to provide consistent messaging in support of vaccination. The outbreak highlights the challenges of combating vaccine skepticism and the importance of trusted messengers in promoting public health.</p>
