        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump defended the White House's plan to accept a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, stating the U.S. has aided Qatar significantly in the past. Trump dismissed concerns about the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments, saying it would be foolish not to accept the gesture. Critics, including Democrats and some of Trump's supporters, have raised legal and ethical questions, while the White House insists any gift will comply with applicable laws. The plane, a Boeing 747-8, would need retrofitting and security clearance before use, as Boeing is behind schedule in directly providing the White House with two new 747-8s. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has released a model ordinance for local municipalities to address homeless encampments and announced new funding for treatment and housing, asserting that there are no more excuses for inaction. Newsom emphasized the need for cities and counties to do their part, providing resources to address encampments and offer alternatives. The model ordinance requires policies to prioritize shelter and services, not criminalize sleeping outside when no alternatives exist, and allow local authorities to clear encampments. Newsom highlighted the Supreme Court ruling in favor of anti-camping ordinances and a 2024 executive order as justification for cities to act, supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding.</p>

          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Dalton Police Department reviewed dashboard camera footage and determined that the officer had stopped the wrong vehicle. Arias Cristobal, who lacks authorization to be in the U.S., remains in ICE custody and faces deportation, along with her father, who was also arrested following a traffic stop. Officials expressed regret for the agency's mistake but could not opine on how ICE should proceed, with Arias Cristobal's lawyers stating she will likely remain in custody pending a bond hearing.</p>

          <p>A recent art auction at Christie's in New York revealed signs of economic uncertainty affecting the art market, with presold items and quiet bidding. The auction of the Riggio family collection, built on the Barnes & Noble fortune, saw lackluster bidding, attributed to concerns over President Trump's tariffs. While the collection totaled $272 million with fees, it fell short of presale expectations. A Mondrian painting, once displayed in Leonard Riggio's apartment, sold for $47.6 million, below the previous record for a Mondrian. The 20th Century Evening Sale fared slightly better, but the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted weakness in that market.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, a program that offered deportation protections and work permits to over 8,000 Afghans. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Afghanistan has an improved security situation and a stabilizing economy, making TPS no longer necessary. The Biden administration had previously extended TPS due to the humanitarian crisis following the Taliban's takeover in 2021. Advocates criticized the decision, while the Trump administration seeks to roll back TPS for other countries like Venezuela. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that the administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent.</p>

          <p>Sussan Ley has been named the first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, succeeding Peter Dutton after the party's historic election loss. Ley, from the moderate faction, defeated Angus Taylor, who promised to restore conservative values. The Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat in the recent election, attributed to polarizing leaders and policies that alienated women and young people. Ley aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, emphasizing the need to respect and represent modern Australia. The junior coalition partner, the Nationals, re-elected David Littleproud as leader, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's new cabinet has been sworn in.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed sharp restrictions on the federal anti-hunger program, SNAP, seeking to limit its funding and benefits as part of a broader package to advance President Trump’s tax cuts. The proposal would require states to contribute funding for food stamps and mandate more beneficiaries to obtain employment in exchange for federal aid. Republicans argue that their approach would improve the provision of food stamp benefits while helping to defray the cost of Mr. Trump’s expensive legislative ambitions. The Republican overhaul targets the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and could result in potentially millions of low-income families losing access to the safety net program.</p>

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia facility managing Newark Liberty International Airport's air traffic caused significant flight delays, with some flights delayed by up to seven hours. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said at least three controllers were scheduled per hour, but sources indicated the number of fully certified controllers was sometimes one or two, far below the target of 14. These delays are the latest in a series of setbacks for Newark, including a recent radar outage, and have prompted some controllers to take leave due to stress.

The resolution came in response to a challenge by Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg and alleges that the DNC improperly combined questions and tallied votes, giving male candidates an advantage.

          <p>Proposed cuts by the Trump administration threaten to eliminate funding for NOAA's global CO2 program, which has been monitoring carbon dioxide levels since the 1960s. Scientist Ralph Keeling, whose father initiated the program, warns that these cuts would end decades of unbroken data collection, degrading the nation's ability to project the impacts of climate change. The program collects air samples from around the world, and the data is used to create the Keeling Curve, a graph plotting the rise of carbon dioxide.

The World Bank expects growth to increase slightly in 2025 to 3.7%. President Bola Tinubu's government implemented economic reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira currency. However, the reforms have led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians, with nearly half living in poverty. Inflation is expected to remain high at an average of 22.1%, and the agricultural sector faces challenges due to insecurity and high input costs.</p>

          <p>Douglas "Pete" Peterson, a former U.S. Air Force pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam, reflects on his journey from hating the Vietnamese to becoming the first postwar U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. Captured in 1966, Peterson spent six and a half years as a POW before deciding to "leave his hate at the gate." After being elected to Congress, he made several trips back to Vietnam and was appointed ambassador in 1997. As ambassador, Peterson oversaw a key trade agreement and started the "Safe Vietnam" program to improve safety awareness, including mandatory helmet use for motorbike riders. Since his ambassadorship, Peterson has devoted himself to improving safety for children throughout Asia.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching an all-time high, driven by unpredictable US trade policies, geopolitical uncertainty, and inflationary pressures. Central banks have been net buyers of gold, seeking a safe haven asset outside the banking system. However, while gold is considered a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations, and major surges have been followed by significant falls. Experts are divided on whether the upward trend will continue, with some forecasting further increases and others warning of a potential market bubble. Investors are advised to diversify their portfolios and avoid putting all their eggs in a golden basket. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The focus on weight alone when considering weight-loss drugs is misplaced; changes in health should be the primary goal, not just changes in weight. GLP-1 drugs can reduce visceral fat, improving metabolic health. The strongest case for GLP-1s is in people with excess visceral fat who have begun to suffer its consequences. BMI is a poor measure, but waist size is a good predictor of visceral fat, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. GLP-1 drugs were approved under the premise that patients will stay on them for life, but so far, most people take them for less than a year, and scientists do not have good data on how to get off the drugs without regaining weight.</p>

          <p>The Episcopal church’s migration service is refusing a directive from the federal government to help resettle white South Africans granted refugee status, citing the church’s longstanding “commitment to racial justice and reconciliation”. Presiding bishop Sean Rowe announced the step on Monday, shortly before 59 South Africans arrived at Dulles international airport outside Washington DC on a private charter plane and were greeted by a government delegation. Donald Trump opened a fast-tracked refugee status to white South Africans, accusing their government of discrimination, even as his administration abruptly shut down the overall US refugee program. The move marks the end of a ministry-government partnership that, for nearly four decades, has served nearly 110,000 refugees from countries, including Ukraine, Myanmar and Congo, Rowe said.</p>
