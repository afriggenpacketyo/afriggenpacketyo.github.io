        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media company, X, can proceed to trial. The suit alleges breach of contract and fraud after X abruptly canceled a partnership with Lemon just hours after he conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge determined that Lemon's legal team plausibly argued the existence of an implied contract and that X and Musk may have committed "fraud by false promise." This decision denies the defendants' attempt to have the case dismissed, moving it forward in San Francisco Superior Court.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, a significant event coinciding with Nvidia becoming the first company to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. The meeting's agenda is not public, but it occurs as Nvidia navigates U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly impacting sales to the Chinese market. The Trump administration recently implemented rules requiring export licenses for certain processors, a move Nvidia has stated effectively closes off the $50 billion China market to its products. This high-level discussion underscores the intersection of technology, national security, and international trade policy.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance after reporting second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The denim company now projects annual revenue growth of 1% to 2%, a significant improvement from its previous forecast, citing strong consumer demand and successful new product pricing. However, the company is navigating the economic uncertainty of new U.S. tariffs, which it anticipates will cost $25 million to $30 million for the remainder of the year. While Levi's is currently absorbing some of these costs, executives acknowledge that future trade policy developments could force a change in strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Job search and review companies Indeed and Glassdoor are laying off approximately 1,300 employees, about 6% of their combined workforce, as their parent company, Recruit Holdings, pivots towards artificial intelligence. The CEO stated that AI is fundamentally changing the industry and the company must adapt to simplify the hiring process and reduce manual labor costs. The restructuring will involve integrating Glassdoor's features into the Indeed platform and will primarily affect U.S.-based R&D and sustainability teams. This move reflects a broader trend of corporations embracing AI for efficiency, even as it raises concerns about potential job displacement for white-collar workers.</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government is formulating a response to the Trump administration's surprise announcement of a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports, set to begin in August. President Trump cited "unfair trade barriers" and the alleged political "persecution" of former president Jair Bolsonaro as justification, a rationale that surprised Brazilian officials given the consistent U.S. trade surplus with Brazil. Wary of direct retaliation that could harm its own industries, Brazil is considering measures under its Reciprocity Law, such as suspending U.S. patents or taxing profits from American companies. Analysts predict the tariffs could push Brazil toward closer economic ties with China.</p>

The judge imposed the sentence to deter similar actions, highlighting the danger stowaways pose to aviation security. Dali was caught after hiding in the plane's bathroom for hours and was returned to the U.S., where she now faces separate charges in Connecticut for a previous security breach at an airport.</p>

Key players like Mookie Betts and Max Muncy have been sidelined with injuries, exposing a lack of depth and putting pressure on the team's superstars.

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official testified in federal court that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he were released from detention. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man facing human trafficking charges, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March before being returned to the U.S. A judge had ordered his release before trial, but the Justice Department stated ICE would then seek to remove him to a "third country." The testimony revealed a lack of clarity and planning regarding his potential removal, frustrating the judge who is seeking to ensure he receives due process.</p>

Yaccarino's departure followed a period of turmoil at the company, including a recent incident where its AI chatbot, Grok, generated antisemitic content.

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium travel classes, such as business and first class, following a model similar to what it has done with its main economy cabin. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, indicated that the goal is to offer more choices to premium customers, who have different needs and willingness to pay. While no specific changes have been announced, this could potentially lead to new fare types, such as a less-expensive business class ticket without all perks, or a higher-end suite with more amenities. This strategic focus comes as revenue from premium seats continues to be a major driver of the airline's profitability.</p>

The forecast is driven by accelerating large-scale artificial intelligence deals and strong demand for enterprise use cases in its cloud division. Ives raised his 12-month price target for Microsoft stock to $600 per share, suggesting that the market has not yet fully priced in the company's future growth in AI and cloud computing. This bullish outlook positions Microsoft to follow Nvidia, which recently became the first company to briefly touch the $4 trillion valuation milestone. (not investment advice)</p>

Vought also suggested Powell may have misled Congress about the project's details, such as VIP dining rooms and rooftop gardens.
