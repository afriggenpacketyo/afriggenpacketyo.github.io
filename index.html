          <p>The UK government announced plans to plant 20 million trees and create 2,500 hectares of new woodland in the West of England by 2050, as part of a larger initiative to increase woodland cover.  This Western Forest project aims to increase tree cover in some areas to 30%, addressing current low woodland coverage in England and contributing to national tree-planting targets.  The initiative will also focus on urban areas like Bristol, Swindon, and Gloucester.</p>
