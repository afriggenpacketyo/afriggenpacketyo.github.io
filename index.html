          <p>An independent inquiry into the BBC's "MasterChef" has substantiated 45 allegations against presenter Gregg Wallace, including inappropriate physical contact and sexual language. The report, commissioned by production company Banijay, also noted culturally insensitive comments. Following the inquiry and a BBC News investigation that revealed numerous claims, Wallace was dismissed from the show and the BBC has stated it has no plans for future work with him. Wallace, who was recently diagnosed with autism, has accepted the findings but stated he does not wish to hide behind his diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flooding across central Texas has resulted in at least 130 confirmed fatalities, with search and recovery operations ongoing for numerous missing individuals. The hardest-hit area is Kerr County, where 106 deaths have been recorded, including 36 children from a summer camp. Rescue teams from local, state, and federal agencies are continuing to deploy as the mission becomes more technically challenging. The disaster is being described as one of the worst in the state's recent history, with the death toll expected to climb further as recovery efforts proceed.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated he does not support a merger between his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and his artificial intelligence firm, xAI, responding with a simple "No" to an investor query. However, he has suggested that Tesla might hold a shareholder vote on whether to invest in xAI, which develops the Grok AI chatbot. This comes amid moves to integrate his various companies, including merging xAI with social media platform X and a reported $2 billion investment in xAI from SpaceX.

The attack comes as U.S. President Donald Trump announced that more sophisticated military equipment, including additional Patriot air defense systems, would be sent to Kyiv. Trump specified that the European Union would cover the costs of the systems, which have been crucial for Ukraine in defending against Russian aerial bombardments. Meanwhile, Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, has arrived in Kyiv for discussions on security and sanctions against Moscow.</p>

          <p>A growing healthcare movement known as "social prescribing" involves doctors prescribing community activities like cycling, art classes, or volunteering instead of, or in addition to, traditional medication. The approach focuses on what matters to the patient to improve both mental and physical health, tackling issues like loneliness, diabetes, and depression. Proponents, citing examples from the U.K. and U.S., say it complements conventional treatments by leveraging the proven benefits of social connection, exercise, and nature.

While supporters see it as a vital tool to protect over a million vulnerable people, many disability advocates are critical of the idea. Opponents argue that such registries provide a false sense of security, as they do not guarantee evacuation assistance and can discourage individuals from creating their own emergency plans.

          <p>The retirement announcement of North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a historically conservative Republican, after he opposed a party-line bill has sparked analysis on the shifting definition of "conservatism." Political scientists suggest that in the current Republican Party, ideological alignment has been replaced by loyalty to Donald Trump as the primary litmus test. Lawmakers like Tillis, who have a strong conservative voting record but occasionally break with Trump, are increasingly labeled as "RINOs" or moderates. This trend highlights a growing political polarization where deviation from the party leader can be a significant liability, even for established conservatives.</p>

Tesla maintains that its systems are safe when used with an attentive driver and that the driver in this incident admitted to being distracted.

The fire, which was sparked by lightning, grew rapidly and prompted the evacuation of firefighters and hikers from the inner canyon due to the release of chlorine gas from a burned water treatment plant. No injuries have been reported, but the loss of the iconic 1930s-era lodge is a devastating blow to the national park.</p>

          <p>Following NATO's agreement to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, economic experts are questioning whether many member nations can realistically afford the commitment. Countries like Spain, Italy, and Belgium, which already struggle to meet the previous 2% target, face significant challenges due to high government debt. Prioritizing defense on this scale would likely require politically difficult choices, such as raising taxes or cutting social programs, which could trigger public backlash.

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, beating economists' forecasts and bolstered by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets. A temporary tariff truce with the United States also helped slow the rate of decline in exports to America. The data also showed a notable 60% surge in rare earth shipments to a record high. While imports rose for the first time this year, the increase was modest. Despite the positive first-half performance, analysts remain cautious, warning that export momentum could falter later in the year due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, breaking the $120,000 milestone on Monday.

This surge comes as the U.S. House of Representatives begins its "Crypto Week" to deliberate on a series of bills aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts believe the combination of strong institutional buying and increasing policy clarity is boosting investor confidence and could propel the cryptocurrency to even higher valuations in the near future.

South Korean intelligence also estimates that North Korea has already supplied Russia with approximately 12 million artillery shells.

          <p>China's leadership has signaled a new policy priority to tackle "excessive competition," or "neijuan," within its domestic market, raising concerns about disorderly, low-price competition that yields diminishing returns. This initiative recalls the "supply-side structural reform" of 2015, which aimed to cut excess capacity in industries like steel and coal. However, analysts note that today's economic landscape is different, with a larger role for private firms, weaker overall growth, and limited government fiscal space. The new focus aims to guide enterprises toward higher quality and manage the exit of outdated production capacity.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic floods in Texas, which have killed over 129 people, are being analyzed as the result of a "toxic cocktail" of climate change and political decisions. Meteorologists point to a warming atmosphere holding more moisture, leading to more frequent and intense downpours, a phenomenon increasingly common in the region. This article argues the disaster was compounded by the Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies like the National Weather Service, which may have left services understaffed and hindered coordination. Critics are questioning Texas Senator Ted Cruz's role in cutting funds for weather forecasting just days before the storm hit.</p>

Norwegian consumers have responded positively to the quality and affordability of the Chinese models, presenting a significant challenge to established Western automakers, including market leader Tesla.

An undercover reporter at Connells found evidence that agents favored buyers who used in-house mortgage services, potentially costing sellers a higher sale price, a practice known as conditional selling. At Purplebricks, a whistleblower alleged that staff were incentivized to get price reductions on properties that were deliberately overvalued to win instructions. Both companies are signatories to a code of practice forbidding such behavior, raising questions about regulation and consumer protection in the property market.</p>
