          <p>A nine-year-old Canadian girl, initially reported as kidnapped from a rest stop in upstate New York, was found deceased, leading to a significant shift in the investigation. The report from her father prompted a massive search and an Amber Alert. However, police later stated there was no evidence of an abduction and identified significant inconsistencies in the father's account of the events. The investigation is now focused on the father, and authorities have assured the public that there is no ongoing threat related to a kidnapping.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is set to shut down its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's main scientific research arm that provides analysis on environmental hazards. The administration states the move is part of an effort to streamline operations and save approximately $749 million, while adding scientific functions to other program offices. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, arguing it will cripple the EPA's ability to use science in protecting public health and have generational impacts. The move is part of a broader plan to reduce the EPA's staff by 23%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, teaching a child the skill of self-connection is non-negotiable for their future success. Self-connection is defined as the ability to understand one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which fosters resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article argues that common parenting habits, like dismissing a child's feelings, can inadvertently erode this connection over time. It suggests practical shifts, such as validating emotions and modeling self-awareness, to help children build a strong sense of self and protect their long-term mental health.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, describes the precarious situation for American businesses operating in China. He suggests that the current 90-day pause on new tariffs is likely to be extended, as a return to high tariffs is undesirable for both nations. Stein notes that while China has taken steps on restricting fentanyl precursors, the U.S. has yet to reciprocate by lowering related tariffs. The business community remains concerned that discussions between the two economic powers are almost exclusively focused on tariffs, overlooking other critical aspects of the trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded a nonprofit, Better Angels, with the ambitious goal of proving that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. Using a $300-million investment fund, the initiative aims to use private capital to finance projects faster and at a lower cost than traditional models that rely on government grants and tax credits. Better Angels is currently bidding on several projects in Los Angeles, including a 212-unit development, and is already backing two smaller apartment buildings. The model seeks to attract for-profit developers to the affordable housing market, aiming to address the housing crisis through capitalist principles.</p>

Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck explains the current legal standing and potential next steps. The collapse of the plea agreements, which would have taken the death penalty off the table in exchange for life sentences, reopens complex legal and procedural questions. The trials have been plagued by years of delays, and this latest development adds another layer of complexity to the long-running effort to bring the accused conspirators to justice.</p>

The incident began when a Tuscaloosa police officer attempted to stop a vehicle for traffic violations. The driver, identified as Jaylen Reed, immediately fled at high speed but crashed into a ditch and culvert less than 30 seconds later, sustaining fatal injuries. Reed, who was the sole occupant, was later found to have multiple active felony warrants.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, a new CBS poll reveals his approval rating has dropped to 42%, down from a majority in February. A key factor in the decline is public perception of his immigration policy, with a majority now believing the administration is deporting more people than expected and is not just prioritizing dangerous criminals. Approval for the deportation program has fallen, particularly among Hispanic Americans, who increasingly feel they are being targeted. The poll also shows majority disapproval for the administration's new tax and spending bill, with most believing it primarily helps the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

In a series of statements, Trump called for the team to change its name back to the "Washington Redskins," a name dropped in 2020 due to its perception as a slur. The president claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the change and that he would impose a restriction on the stadium deal, which requires federal land approval.
