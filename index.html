        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of small packages sent from China to the UK, exempt from import tax, more than doubled to £3 billion last year. This increase is largely attributed to the popularity of e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu, whose low prices are impacting UK businesses. The UK government is currently reviewing the tax exemption rule for imports under £135, as industry groups call for faster action to protect domestic retailers and consumers from potentially unregulated goods.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has stated that its relationship with South Korea is based on mutual interests and should not be subject to external interference. This warning follows comments from South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, who indicated that Seoul must rebalance its ties with Beijing amid intensifying US-China competition. Lee emphasized that South Korea can no longer rely on the US for security while depending on China for its economy, suggesting a shift to align more closely with Washington's policies.</p>

          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China's second-largest liquor distiller, has reported its slowest profit and revenue growth in ten years, a trend also seen with its competitor, Kweichow Moutai. This slowdown is attributed to China's intensified anti-corruption campaign, which has curbed extravagant spending, and a broader economic deceleration. The decline in the baijiu market reflects how government policy and economic conditions are significantly impacting sales of the popular spirit, which is a staple at official banquets and cultural events.</p>

          <p>Argentinian police are searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait believed to have been looted by a Nazi officer during World War II. The search was initiated after Dutch reporters spotted the painting, "Portrait of a Lady," in an advertisement for a property linked to the descendants of the fugitive officer. The artwork was originally part of the extensive collection of Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker. While a raid on the property did not recover the painting, the event highlights ongoing efforts to reclaim art plundered by the Nazis.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has stated that any action by President Donald Trump to send the National Guard to Chicago will be met with a response. The governor's comments escalate a feud over how to address crime in the city, which Trump has threatened to manage with federal troops. Pritzker, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, argues that such a deployment is unconstitutional, unnecessary, and would inflame tensions, while citing data that shows a recent decline in violent crime.</p>

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has been fined nearly £31,500 for his behavior during a surprising first-round defeat to Benjamin Bonzi.

The total fine amounts to approximately 40% of the prize money he would have received for participating in the first round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is set to replace Nin Pandit, his principal private secretary, who has been in the key Downing Street role for only ten months. This marks the third departure of a top aide in less than a year, following his chief of staff and director of communications. The principal private secretary acts as a crucial gatekeeper between the prime minister and the government's official machinery. This staff change comes amid speculation of a wider reshuffle of junior ministers following recent Labour party rebellions.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Conservative party is facing a significant challenge from Reform UK, which has seen a surge in opinion polls and has attracted several defections from Tory MSPs and councillors. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage predicts the Conservatives will soon be an irrelevant force in Scottish politics. This political shift forces Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay into a difficult position, as moving further right to counter Reform risks alienating the moderate voter base that previously helped the party become the main opposition in Holyrood.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball prospect whose life spirals into a violent crime caper in 1998 New York City. The review describes the movie as a "bruising bacchanal" that immerses viewers in a grimy, pre-millennial Manhattan, featuring a colorful cast of characters including those played by Zoë Kravitz and Regina King. The article praises the film's energetic, humorous, and menacing tone, viewing it as an affectionate, if dirty, tribute to the city and a continuation of Aronofsky's career-long focus on characters at risk of squandering their potential.</p>

The well-preserved fossil indicates the creature was a "hypercarnivore" and a top predator, reaching up to 3.5 meters in length and weighing around 250 kg. With a powerful jaw and large, sharp teeth, it likely preyed on medium-sized dinosaurs in the freshwater floodplains of ancient Patagonia.

          <p>In a civil trial where a security guard is suing Cardi B for assault, testimony from the rapper's obstetrician and his receptionist has bolstered her defense. The receptionist testified that she saw the plaintiff, Emani Ellis, corner the pregnant rapper and that the guard was the aggressor. The doctor also testified that he did not see any injuries on the guard's face after the 2018 incident. Cardi B has maintained that while a heated verbal exchange occurred, she never physically touched, scratched, or spat on Ellis, who is seeking $24 million in damages.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old boy with nonverbal autism who went missing in New Orleans was found dead, with the coroner determining the cause of death to be drowning with trauma consistent with an alligator attack. Bryan Vasquez was reported missing on August 14 after leaving his home and was discovered in a nearby canal following a two-week search. The New Orleans Police Department is now investigating the case as an unclassified death. In response, the police chief has requested that state wildlife officials remove "nuisance" alligators from the area where the boy was found.</p>

          <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been thrown into chaos after its director, Susan Monarez, was ousted just four weeks after being confirmed. The move, reportedly driven by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over disagreements on vaccine policy, prompted Monarez's lawyers to state she would not resign. The turmoil escalated as at least three other senior CDC officials resigned in protest, with one citing the "ongoing weaponizing of public health" as their reason for leaving, signaling a deep crisis within the nation's top public health agency.</p>

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of China's central bank, has called for a measured approach and a "multidimensional assessment" of stablecoins amid growing global interest. While jurisdictions like the US and Hong Kong are developing regulatory frameworks, Zhou warned against the risks of stablecoins being used for excessive speculation, which could lead to fraud and financial instability. He cautioned that hype around the asset could be leveraged by some firms to inflate valuations rather than build sustainable businesses, ultimately creating systemic risks.

          <p>A Chinese envoy has warned the United States against creating barriers and sowing "fear and hostility" with its proposed changes to visa rules. The new proposal from the Department of Homeland Security would cap the stays of mainland Chinese journalists at 90 days and limit student visas to a maximum of four years. The US government cited challenges in monitoring an increasing number of non-immigrants as the reason for the proposed rule. The Chinese official urged the US to instead encourage travel and people-to-people exchanges to promote cooperation rather than decoupling.</p>

          <p>The United States has told Denmark to "calm down" after the senior US diplomat in Copenhagen was summoned over reports of an American covert influence campaign in Greenland. According to Denmark's public broadcaster, the operation aimed to infiltrate Greenlandic society and promote its secession from Denmark to the US. While a White House official dismissed the concerns, Denmark's foreign minister stated that any interference in the country's internal affairs is unacceptable. The incident reflects ongoing tensions related to US interest in the semi-autonomous Danish territory.</p>
