          <p>A terror attack occurred at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, resulting in the deaths of two Jewish individuals and serious injuries to three others. The assailant, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent, was shot dead by police at the scene after a car ramming and stabbing. Authorities are treating the incident as a terror attack, with security staff and worshippers lauded for preventing the attacker from entering the building.

          <p>Yunnan, China's primary coffee-producing region, significantly increased its coffee and derivative product exports, reaching US$1.1 billion in the first eight months of 2025. This surge, driven by rising global demand and record-high benchmark coffee futures, has led to a 358% year-on-year increase in export volume for 2024. The booming overseas orders are also prompting industrial reforms, with local factories upgrading technology to meet evolving consumer needs. This success has brought a substantial windfall to local growers, elevating raw bean prices.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Energy Department canceled over 300 clean energy projects in states won by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, amounting to nearly $8 billion in rescinded funding. Announced on the first day of a federal government shutdown, these cuts affect efforts to reduce emissions, pollution, and strengthen electrical grids, potentially costing tens of thousands of jobs. Critics, including state governors and advocacy groups, condemn the move as politically motivated, while the Trump administration claims the projects were not economically viable or adequately documented. The decision highlights escalating political tensions during the shutdown.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has ruled against the public release of graphic images from the crime scene where Bryan Kohberger murdered four college students. Second District Judge Megan Marshall deemed the pictures, which include blood and victims' bodies, "incredibly disturbing" and their release an "unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." While law enforcement can release other investigatory records, areas containing graphic content must be blacked out. This decision follows requests from victims' families and comes after Kohberger pleaded guilty to the murders, avoiding the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth saw an 8% increase after CEO Barbara Humpton confirmed the company is in "close communication" with the White House regarding rare earth supply chain development. This follows recent Trump administration investments in other rare earth miners, signaling a broader strategy to reduce U.S. dependence on China for these critical materials. Humpton expressed support for these government deals, emphasizing the need for multiple players to build out the domestic market. The company is developing a mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Evita Solutions to manufacture a generic version of mifepristone, a key medication used in abortions, despite intense pressure from anti-abortion groups. This decision has infuriated opponents who sought to restrict access, with some criticizing the Trump administration's health secretary for not conducting a promised safety review. Abortion rights supporters, however, celebrate the approval as a victory for evidence-based medicine, citing numerous studies affirming mifepristone's safety and effectiveness. The FDA stated its discretion in approving generic drugs is limited.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its third day, President Donald Trump announced plans to meet with his budget director to identify and cut "Democrat Agencies," framing the shutdown as an opportunity to "clear out dead wood." This comes after the administration froze billions in funding for infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic-leaning states, sparking a blame game on Capitol Hill. While Republicans accuse Democrats of "selfish" demands, Democrats insist on including healthcare insurance subsidies in funding legislation. The impasse leaves hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or working without pay.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed Congress that the U.S. is engaged in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist organizations. This declaration follows recent U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats from Venezuela in the southern Caribbean Sea, resulting in fatalities. The administration justifies these actions by terming the individuals killed as "unlawful combatants" and asserting that drug smuggling constitutes an "armed attack" against American citizens.

          <p>The Trump administration has controversially declared the U.S. is in an "armed conflict" with drug cartels, labeling them "nonstate armed groups" after military strikes killed at least 17 people on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. This declaration, first reported in a letter to Congress, seeks to justify wartime powers for killing and detaining cartel members. Critics argue that this does not meet the definition of "armed conflict" under international law, and the administration has previously faced legal challenges for similar actions. The article highlights Trump's attempts to expand military authority and use of force against cartels, despite questions about legal justification and intelligence assessments.</p>

Compounding their woes, goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel made a significant mistake, and the team displayed a lack of attacking quality, failing to score for the fifth time this season.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst the U.S. government shutdown, Republican leaders, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, falsely claimed Democrats are demanding free healthcare for "illegal immigrants." Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer vehemently denied this, clarifying that Democrats seek to extend Obamacare subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, which do not cover undocumented individuals. The article explains that while Democrats aim to restore healthcare access for "lawfully present" immigrants, federal law prohibits taxpayer-funded coverage for undocumented immigrants, except for emergency Medicaid. This highlights a significant point of contention and misinformation during the ongoing political standoff.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration secured a significant deal with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, compelling the company to lower U.S. drug prices to match those in other developed countries. This marks a breakthrough after years of Trump's failed attempts to curb high drug costs, which he often criticized as "getting away with murder." Pfizer also agreed to participate in TrumpRx, a new website offering discounted drugs directly to consumers. While the deal's full impact on patient savings remains uncertain, especially for existing drugs, it represents a major concession from the industry, driven by the administration's threat of 100% tariffs.</p>

          <p>This article explores the historical evolution of U.S. college rankings, tracing their origins from Edwin Embree's controversial 1934 list to the ubiquitous U.S. News & World Report system. Early attempts at ranking were met with strong opposition and even government suppression due to perceived biases and the public's intense reaction. As higher education became a mass-consumer good post-WWII, rankings transformed into a crucial guide for students and a source of anxiety for institutions. The article highlights how these lists, initially based on subjective "eminence," evolved to incorporate more statistical data, profoundly shaping perceptions of American meritocracy and influencing university strategies.</p>

Despite offering a replica, State Department officials continued to request the original. Ultimately, a replica was presented, but the incident led to Arrington being told to "resign - or be fired" due to perceived untrustworthiness regarding confidential information.</p>
