          <p>Microsoft's stock saw a 7% jump after the company announced fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst predictions. For the first time, Microsoft disclosed that its Azure and other cloud services revenue surpassed $75 billion for the fiscal year, a 34% increase. The Intelligent Cloud unit alone generated nearly $29.88 billion in the quarter, growing 26% and beating expectations. This strong performance comes despite recent layoffs and signals robust health in its key business segments, contributing to the stock's 22% year-to-date gain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas was arrested for his alleged involvement in an illegal high-stakes gambling ring operated from a California mansion he owned. Federal prosecutors claim Arenas and five co-conspirators, including a suspected member of an Israeli organized crime group, ran the operation between 2021 and 2022. Arenas faces charges of conspiracy, operating an illegal gambling business, and making false statements to investigators. This incident adds to a history of off-court issues for Arenas, who was previously suspended from the NBA for a firearm-related incident in 2010.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal, which could see the EU import over $750 billion in U.S. energy, primarily fossil fuels, has drawn criticism from environmental groups. They warn the agreement could lock Europe into long-term fossil fuel dependency, undermining its Green Deal climate targets, which aim for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. The deal was framed by leaders as a way to replace Russian energy with more affordable U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG). However, critics argue that relying on U.S. LNG could increase emissions and create new energy security vulnerabilities for the bloc.</p>

Prosecutors presented evidence of his incriminating internet searches, such as "how to make murder look like a heart attack," while the defense suggested suicide. The conviction for first-degree murder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole in Colorado. Craig was also found guilty on five other charges, including solicitation to commit murder against an investigator in his case.</p>

          <p>Amid what they describe as unprecedented obstruction from Democrats, Senate Republicans are contemplating changing chamber rules to speed up the confirmation process for President Trump's nominees. Senate Majority Leader John Thune noted that interest in such reforms is growing quickly to break the procedural logjam created by Democrats. The average time to confirm presidential nominees has significantly increased over recent administrations, and Republicans argue the current delays are unsustainable. This move signals escalating partisan tensions over judicial and executive appointments, with some senators even suggesting forgoing the August recess to process the backlog.</p>

          <p>High Noon has initiated a nationwide recall for its Beach Variety 12-packs of vodka seltzer after discovering some were incorrectly packaged in Celsius energy drink cans. The error, traced to a packaging supplier, could lead to unintentional alcohol consumption, posing health and safety risks, particularly for those who avoid alcohol. The affected cans are labeled as Celsius Astro Vibe Sparkling Blue Razz Edition but contain High Noon's alcoholic seltzer. The company is urging customers who find the mislabeled cans to dispose of them and contact High Noon for a refund.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that the Army helicopter involved in a fatal mid-air collision near Washington D.C. had a faulty altimeter. This malfunction caused the helicopter to fly significantly higher than intended, with discrepancies ranging from 80 to 130 feet. The January 29 crash killed all 64 people on an American Airlines flight and the three crew members aboard the helicopter. Investigators are also examining the insufficient vertical separation distances in the FAA-approved flight routes around Reagan National Airport, which may have contributed to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Sherry Xue Li has pleaded guilty to orchestrating a multi-million dollar investment scam that defrauded foreign nationals by promising U.S. residency and selling access to political events. As part of the scheme, Li charged foreign investors $93,000 each to attend a 2017 fundraiser and be photographed with then-President Donald Trump. The illegally sourced foreign funds were then funneled as contributions to the event's hosting committee. The scam was centered around a fictitious development project, and Li now faces charges of money laundering and campaign finance conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Leading humanitarian organizations have declared that a famine is now actively unfolding in Gaza, calling it a "worst-case scenario" of widespread starvation and disease. The crisis has intensified dramatically, with a majority of malnutrition-related deaths in 2025 occurring in July. Despite some aid entering the territory, distribution is hampered by logistical challenges, security risks, and what aid groups call insufficient access granted by Israel. While Israel denies using starvation as a weapon, the international community, including the U.S. and EU, is increasing pressure to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, the Department of Justice has disclosed that only two law enforcement officers—an FBI agent and an NYPD detective—provided testimony to the grand juries that indicted Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. No alleged victims testified directly. This information was revealed as part of the DOJ's effort, directed by President Trump, to unseal the grand jury transcripts to address public interest and speculation surrounding the investigations. The department argued that releasing the records would provide transparency while still protecting victims' rights, as the effort to unseal continues in a New York federal court.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, borrowers with high-rate debt, particularly on credit cards, are encouraged to explore proactive relief strategies. This article outlines several key moves, including conducting a detailed budget review to identify savings, understanding the risks and benefits of options like credit counseling or debt management programs, and addressing the root causes of debt accumulation. While rate cuts may be delayed, these steps can empower individuals to regain control of their finances. Taking these actions can help create a sustainable path toward financial independence in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia is ordering hundreds of thousands of additional H20 AI chips from its manufacturer TSMC to satisfy unexpectedly strong demand from China. The H20 was specifically developed as a less powerful alternative to comply with U.S. export restrictions, competing with Chinese chipmaker Huawei. Despite its reduced capabilities compared to the H100 and H200 models available elsewhere, Chinese tech companies have a significant appetite for the hardware. This surge in orders highlights China's continued reliance on American-designed AI technology and provides a major sales boost for Nvidia in the restricted market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula generated tsunami waves, prompting warnings and advisories for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and other Pacific nations. While initial warnings in Hawaii were later downgraded, officials urged caution as the waves caused minor flooding and dangerous currents were observed. The powerful quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, caused significant flooding in Russia and led to evacuations in several countries. Fortunately, no major damage or severe injuries have been reported in the U.S. so far, though some South American countries issued new alerts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing a case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. The Treasury Department accused de Moraes of human rights abuses and politically motivated prosecutions. Concurrently, President Trump signed an executive order raising tariffs on many Brazilian exports to 50%, directly linking the action to what he termed Brazil's "politically motivated persecution" of Bolsonaro. This escalation marks a significant downturn in U.S.-Brazil relations, with Brazil threatening to retaliate with matching tariffs, potentially sparking a trade dispute.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order placing a universal 50% tariff on all copper imports, causing the metal's price to plunge in after-hours trading. This move is the latest in a series of steep import taxes on key materials, following similar tariffs on steel and aluminum, aimed at boosting domestic industries. The new duties could raise costs for a wide range of products, from electronics to construction materials, as the U.S. imports nearly half of its copper. The announcement led to a sharp drop in the stock prices of major copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a better-than-expected quarterly report and a 10% stock rally, investors are questioning if life sciences company Danaher can maintain its momentum. The company has faced headwinds from a slow recovery in China, post-pandemic ordering shifts, and U.S. policy changes, causing its stock to struggle. While all of its operating segments beat estimates, challenges remain, particularly in China due to new procurement policies. Analysts suggest a sustained rally for the sector is still a quarter or two away, contingent on a return to mid-single-digit revenue growth across the industry. (not investment advice)</p>
