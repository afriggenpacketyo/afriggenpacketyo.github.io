          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 07:40:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK is contemplating legal challenges, including judicial reviews and injunctions, to prevent asylum seekers from being housed in hotels within areas it now controls, according to party chairman Zia Yusuf. Yusuf stated that the party would use every available instrument of power to resist housing asylum seekers, focusing on regulations related to planning and budget allocation. The Home Office is responsible for housing adult asylum seekers, but Reform aims to exploit regulatory loopholes to hinder the process. Yusuf also mentioned plans to deport everyone in the country illegally during their first term, and to cut waste by targeting diversity and inclusion initiatives. </p>

          <p>A missile fired from Yemen by Houthi rebels landed near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, causing temporary flight suspensions and prompting retaliatory vows from Israeli officials. The missile evaded interception by Israeli air defenses, resulting in damage to a road near Terminal 3 and injuries to several people. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed the airport was no longer safe for air travel, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened meetings to discuss a response. The attack, part of ongoing Houthi missile attacks in solidarity with Hamas, led to some international airlines canceling flights.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his Vice President signaled a shift from a coalition government to a royal court, where Trump is surrounded by loyalists and enforcers. The article contends that unlike Trump's first term, where advisors sometimes curbed his impulses, his second term is characterized by yes-men, accelerationists, and the absence of dissenting voices. Klein asserts that the selection of Vance, who reportedly assured Trump he would overturn the 2020 election results, demonstrated that Trump's second term would be marked by ferocity and recklessness.</p>

Abel, currently vice chairman of non-insurance operations, has a 25-year tenure at Berkshire and will continue Buffett's patient value investing style. Buffett will remain involved to assist Abel, but the final decisions on operations and capital allocation will be with the new CEO, and Buffett reiterated his commitment to retaining all his Berkshire shares.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese secured a landslide re-election as Australia's prime minister, partly due to anti-Trump sentiment resulting from the global turmoil caused by President Trump's policies. Despite Albanese's efforts to maintain a neutral stance towards Trump, the conservative opposition leader, Peter Dutton, faced criticism for emulating Trump's ideas and messaging. Australians were alarmed by the impact of Trump's policies on their retirement accounts and his approach to international relations. The election results reflect a rejection of Trump-like politics and a preference for sensible, centrist approaches.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to resist pressure from President Donald Trump to cut interest rates, prioritizing price stability amid rising inflation concerns. Despite Trump's calls for a rate cut, the Fed is inclined to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting. Recent government data showing a healthy jump in April payrolls supports the Fed's decision to stand pat. The White House's pursuit of tariff deals introduces uncertainty, complicating the Fed's ability to forecast future economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has stated that changing the party leader is not a sufficient solution to address the Conservatives' recent heavy losses in English local elections. She cautioned against knee-jerk reactions, emphasizing that the party's issues cannot be resolved quickly. Badenoch affirmed that the party would develop policies that resonate with the public and work on a slow and steady plan to return to government. While acknowledging the possibility of Nigel Farage becoming prime minister, she asserted that her job is to ensure he does not, as he lacks the necessary solutions.</p>

          <p>NYU Professor Scott Galloway has proposed that a significant portion of wealthy seniors should not receive Social Security benefits. He argues that American seniors are the wealthiest generation and that transferring wealth from younger generations to them is unjust. Galloway suggests that eliminating benefits for the top 10% to 30% of retirees could address wealth imbalances and reduce the burden on young workers. He believes that Social Security is a tax, not a pension fund, and that reforms are necessary to address the program's future insolvency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has made significant gains in English local elections, challenging the dominance of the Labour and Conservative parties. The surge in support for Reform, combined with gains for other smaller parties, has shaken Britain's traditional two-party system. Political analysts suggest that the Conservatives could cease to exist as a meaningful force if this trend continues. Both Labour and the Conservatives are struggling to compete with opponents on their left and right, leading to a fragmentation of the political landscape.</p>
