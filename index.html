          <p>An attack at Boulder's Pearl Street Mall in Colorado injured eight people during a march in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails, shouting "free Palestine" during the incident. The FBI is investigating the attack as a targeted act of violence and potential terrorism. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, included a Holocaust refugee and a university professor, with one person in critical condition. The incident prompted evacuations and drew condemnation from officials, including Colorado Governor Jared Polis and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The attack is being investigated as an act of terrorism.</p>

          <p>China has rejected accusations from President Trump that it violated the trade truce between the two countries. In response, China stated that the United States was the one implementing discriminatory restrictive measures. Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have recently increased, especially after a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng in Geneva, Switzerland. This meeting had led to a temporary suspension of most tariffs for 90 days, but the Trump administration has since ratcheted up export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, while also announcing visa revocations for Chinese students.

          <p>UCLA's baseball team defeated UC Irvine 8-5 in the Los Angeles Regional final, securing their spot in the NCAA super regionals. The Bruins will host Texas San Antonio, marking their first super regional appearance since 2019. UCLA's offense exploded early, scoring three runs in the first two innings, while Mulivai Levu's three-run home run in the fourth extended their lead. Freshman Wylan Moss delivered a strong pitching performance, and a combined bullpen effort held UC Irvine at bay, despite some late-game complications. If UCLA beats UTSA, it will advance to the College World Series in Omaha for the first time since 2013.</p>

          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland's presidential runoff election against liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland is expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was supported by President Trump. Nawrocki's victory will complicate Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to advance his agenda. Nawrocki, previously head of the Institute of National Remembrance, has been described as embodying traditional, patriotic values, and his win was lauded by Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban. The election revealed deep divisions within Poland, a country on the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.</p>

The Japanese Fisheries Agency added fin whales to the list of commercial whaling target species in 2024, setting a catch quota of 60 for this year.

          <p>Officials from Kyiv and Moscow are scheduled to meet in Istanbul to discuss ending the conflict. This will be the second round of talks since the invasion began, held at the request of US President Donald Trump. The first round of talks resulted in a prisoner swap agreement and discussions about a peace deal. The talks come after Ukraine's recent attacks on Russian airbases. The Russian delegation will present a memorandum of peace terms, while Ukraine seeks a full ceasefire, prisoner release, and a direct meeting between Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin.</p>

          <p>A man shouting "free Palestine" injured eight people in a fire attack at a gathering supporting Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly tossed Molotov cocktails at the group, leading authorities to investigate the incident as a suspected terror attack. The victims, aged 52 to 88, sustained burns and other injuries. Soliman, an Egyptian national, was arrested at the scene, and the FBI is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism. Footage showed the suspect screaming at the group while holding what appeared to be Molotov cocktails.</p>
