          <p>China's military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the victory over Japan will showcase its modernizing army, but several of its most advanced weapon systems will not be displayed. Key assets like the next-generation J-36 and J-50 stealth fighters will be absent, as they are either still in development or considered too sensitive for public reveal. This decision highlights the People's Liberation Army's strategy of demonstrating strength while maintaining secrecy around its most cutting-edge military technology and future capabilities.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has asserted that she never committed mortgage fraud and that the allegations are a pretext for her removal by President Trump. The filing argues that any inconsistencies in her mortgage applications were known to the White House and Senate during her confirmation process in 2022. Lowell contends that the true motive behind the firing attempt is to pressure the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates, thereby threatening the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its stock jump 8% after a federal judge ruled against the most severe penalties proposed by the Department of Justice in its landmark antitrust case. The court decided that Google will not be required to sell its Chrome browser, a crucial asset for its advertising business. While the company was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, investors reacted positively to the avoidance of a forced divestiture, viewing the outcome as a significant win for the tech giant.

          <p>President Trump has emphasized the urgent need for a Supreme Court decision on his administration's tariffs, stating he plans to appeal to the high court immediately. He argued that if the tariffs, which have generated over $140 billion in revenue, were overturned, it would be devastating for the U.S. economy and national security. The tariffs were implemented under the justification of addressing national emergencies, including trade deficits and the influx of fentanyl, a claim being challenged in the courts.
