          <p>A photo exhibit titled 'Sahy Rano' by photographer Miora Rajaonary showcases the courage of eight women in Madagascar who are raising awareness about female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions in Africa. The waterborne infection, spread by parasitic worms, leads to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and genital ulcers, often causing shame and suspicion due to STD-like symptoms. The women in the exhibit wear traditional Malagasy face masks to emphasize their bravery in speaking about the disease, while Rajaonary uses painted backdrops and laundry ropes to symbolize the water's presence in their lives. Razanaparana, one of the women featured, contracted FGS while working in rice fields and faced abandonment by her husband due to the symptoms, highlighting the severe social impact of the disease. The exhibit aims to break taboos and promote public awareness about FGS and its impact on women's lives.</p>

          <p>Amazon's easy return policy, while convenient for shoppers, poses significant problems for small businesses selling on the platform, with returns fraud leading to customers receiving used or damaged products. Some sellers are exiting the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program due to return-related issues, while others express a desire to leave Amazon altogether. Sellers are now facing increased costs due to a new Amazon fee for items exceeding return rate thresholds, which may lead to rising prices for consumers. Amazon claims to be taking action against fraudulent returns, but sellers are struggling with repeat offenders and discrepancies in return rates compared to other marketplaces (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed, D-R.I., has voiced strong criticism of President Donald Trump's dismissal of his own intelligence community's assessment that Iran is not currently developing nuclear weapons. Reed suggests that Trump's rejection of this intelligence is politically motivated, especially given the president's consideration of a potential attack against Iran. He emphasizes that if the Director of National Intelligence made a false statement, there is an obligation to correct the record immediately, not to reject it due to external factors. Reed's remarks underscore the growing tension between the executive branch and the intelligence community regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Recent assassinations of senior Iranian military officials, including Saeed Izadi and Behnam Shahryari, point to increasing vulnerabilities within Iran's intelligence apparatus. Izadi, a key coordinator with Palestinian armed groups, was reportedly killed in Qom, while Shahryari, responsible for smuggling weapons, was assassinated in western Iran. These attacks follow a series of incidents targeting Iranian military figures, raising concerns about infiltration within Iran's security community. In response, Iranian officials have implemented stricter security measures, including restrictions on smartphone usage for protection personnel and increased public vigilance.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional, marking a victory for civil liberties groups. The court's decision supports the separation of church and state, arguing that the mandate would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. Louisiana's Attorney General disagrees with the ruling, believing it only applies to specific districts and plans to appeal, potentially taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws in Arkansas and Texas are facing challenges, with legal experts anticipating the Supreme Court will ultimately address the issue of religion in government.</p>

          <p>Israel claims to have killed Saeed Izadi, a senior Iranian commander who allegedly helped plan Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, in a strike on the city of Qom.

Israel also claimed to have killed another Quds Force commander, Behnam Shahriyari, in a drone strike, alleging he was responsible for transporting missiles to Iran's proxy groups.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's hesitation to engage militarily with Iran may be part of a calculated strategy by Tehran to exploit his vulnerabilities. The strategy involves absorbing Israeli strikes, mobilizing Russian President Vladimir Putin to dissuade Trump from military action, agreeing to negotiations, and then delaying and obfuscating to reconstitute Iran's nuclear program. This approach plays on Trump's reluctance to act against Putin's wishes and his lack of preparation for a full-scale war. The analysis highlights Trump's failure to secure congressional authorization, mobilize allies, or rally domestic public opinion, making him susceptible to Iran's negotiate-to-delay tactics.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, marking a significant step towards reducing reliance on foreign software for satellite technology. The OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS), a lightweight version of Huaweiâ€™s open-source platform, was tested aboard the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat. The mission demonstrated faster data updates and improved stability compared to previous systems, using a domestically produced chip. Following the success, national technical standards are being proposed to guide the broader adoption of OpenHarmony in small satellite missions across China.</p>

          <p>Recent immigration raids in Los Angeles and Southern California have caused widespread fear and a noticeable decrease in activity in immigrant communities. Businesses, street vendors, and public spaces have seen reduced foot traffic as residents, particularly those without documentation, are afraid to leave their homes. The increased enforcement has also impacted families, with some struggling to send money to relatives in their home countries and relying on community support for basic needs. The situation has drawn comparisons to the pandemic lockdown, with residents feeling even more restricted due to the fear of arrest and deportation.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans in the U.S. who fled the Taliban's resurgence are facing potential deportation due to the Trump administration's decision to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan. This decision has sparked fear and anxiety within the Afghan community, particularly among those who assisted U.S. forces. Advocates and lawmakers argue that Afghanistan remains unsafe, especially for minorities, women, and those who worked with foreign entities. The loss of TPS, which also provides employment authorization, will have significant financial and emotional consequences for many Afghan families in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The rising cost of in-home elder care, exemplified by a $18,000 monthly bill for a 100-year-old woman in Gardena, California, highlights a national crisis as the U.S. lags behind other developed countries in providing affordable care for its aging population. Many families are forced to deplete their savings or quit their jobs to care for aging parents, while options like board and care facilities remain expensive. The lack of comprehensive coverage from health insurance and potential cuts to Medicaid further exacerbate the issue, leading to a growing need for public policy solutions to address the challenges of elder care. The situation underscores the urgent need for systemic changes to support both the elderly and their caregivers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested that Japan raise its defense spending to 3.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP), a demand that may lead to the cancellation of a planned high-level meeting with Washington. The request, made by Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby, is significantly higher than Japan's current defense budget. This development is likely to strain Japan-U.S. relations, particularly as Japan has already committed to doubling its annual defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027. The increased demand also follows Trump's continued complaints about the U.S.-Japan security treaty and calls for Japan to pay more for American troops stationed in the country (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An analysis discusses the depiction of sexual assault in Celine Song's film 'Materialists' and its potential exploitation for the protagonist's emotional growth. The film features a B-plot where one of the protagonist's clients is assaulted, which is used to shatter the protagonist's cynical approach to dating and love. While not as overtly exploitative as other films, the use of the assault to facilitate the protagonist's redemption is questioned, particularly in a film marketed as a rom-com. The analysis suggests that this narrative choice feels oddly cynical and ultimately detracts from the film's overall message.</p>
