          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced strong first-quarter earnings, surpassing revenue expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company anticipates revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion for 2025, supported by significant capital expenditures. A five-year deal with OpenAI, valued at up to $11.9 billion, is a key factor in CoreWeave's growth, in addition to Microsoft's reliance on CoreWeave for 62% of its 2024 revenue. Despite long-term uncertainties regarding AI supply and demand, CoreWeave is working to diversify its client base and does not expect significant impact from President Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Anti-abortion activists are intensifying their efforts to restrict access to mifepristone, a widely used abortion pill, through a campaign called ‚ÄúRolling Thunder.‚Äù This campaign involves pressuring the FDA to reinstate restrictions, initiating lawsuits against doctors prescribing the medication, and lobbying for its complete removal from the market. The activists are relying on a controversial report claiming high rates of health complications from mifepristone, a claim disputed by reproductive health experts. Despite mixed signals from the Trump administration, the DOJ has asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access, but the administration's ultimate stance on mifepristone remains uncertain as the FDA reviews the drug's safety.</p>

          <p>Former Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed disapproval of the UK government's invitation to US President Donald Trump for a second state visit, stating that Canadians were not "impressed" by the gesture. Carney emphasized that the invitation coincided with repeated comments from Trump about making Canada the 51st US state, undermining Canadian sovereignty. He highlighted Canada's reaffirmation of its sovereignty through an invitation for King Charles III to attend the opening of Canada's Parliament, a move seen as a direct response to Trump's remarks. Carney, who recently met with Trump to negotiate trade and security, reiterated that Canada is "not for sale, ever."</p>

          <p>A couple from Gloucester Township, New Jersey, has been arrested on charges of kidnapping, aggravated assault, and sexual assault of a child after allegedly abusing and confining their 18-year-old victim for years.

The investigation found issues at over half of the 26 Kroger and Kroger-owned stores examined.

          <p>Republican lawmakers are expressing concern over President Trump's openness to accepting a $400 million plane from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One. The proposal raises ethical and legal issues, testing even Trump's most loyal supporters. Concerns include potential security risks and violations of the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause. Democrats plan to introduce a resolution of disapproval, arguing the gift is unconstitutional, while some Republicans caution the plan is far from final and will face scrutiny.</p>

Instead, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act capped prices using calculations based on Medicare prices and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market. The Trump administration believes they have the authority to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare.</p>
