          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, endured a massive overnight drone attack by Russia, resulting in at least two deaths and thirteen injuries. The city's military administration reported that falling drone wreckage caused fires in multiple districts, affecting residential buildings, warehouses, and vehicles. This assault follows one of the largest aerial attacks of the war just days prior, with Ukrainian authorities urging residents to remain in shelters. The ongoing strikes highlight the persistent threat to civilian areas as Ukraine's air defense systems work to repel the constant barrage.</p>

          <p>Shares in WK Kellogg, the company behind cereals like Froot Loops, soared over 50% following reports that it is in advanced takeover talks with Ferrero. The Italian confectionery giant, owner of the Ferrero Rocher and Kinder brands, is reportedly close to a $3 billion deal that could be announced this week. This potential acquisition would give Ferrero a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market and comes as WK Kellogg has been facing financial struggles. The move reflects a broader trend of consolidation within the convenience food industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a 50% tariff on copper imports will take effect on August 1, justifying the move with a national security assessment. He emphasized copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, military hardware, and other essential technologies, stating the tariff will help rebuild America's domestic copper industry. The announcement caused an immediate surge in copper prices, with analysts warning that U.S. consumers could face significantly higher costs for the metal compared to the rest of the world.

          <p>In the United Kingdom, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is advocating for a new policy to prevent foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits. In an upcoming speech, she will describe the UK's rising welfare bill as a "ticking time bomb" that threatens the economy. This proposal aims to create a clear policy distinction with the Labour party, which recently scaled back its own planned welfare cuts. The move is part of a broader Conservative push for tighter welfare controls, including stricter eligibility criteria for certain benefits.</p>

Authorities are concerned about a significant acceleration in Seoul housing prices and a corresponding rise in household debt. The central bank is prioritizing financial stability over stimulating growth, despite a recent economic contraction. The country's unique "jeonse" rental system, which involves large upfront deposits often funded by loans, contributes significantly to the high levels of household debt. (not investment advice)</p>

While a surprise flood in Texas resulted in over 100 deaths, a subsequent deluge in Ruidoso, New Mexico, caused far fewer casualties despite extensive property damage. The article explains that Ruidoso was more prepared because recent wildfires had created "burn scars," increasing the known flood risk and prompting proactive planning.

          <p>Before beginning his seven-year federal prison sentence for fraud, former Congressman George Santos issued a statement on social media. In the post, he asserted that he was not suicidal and made the unsubstantiated claim that President Trump had intended to pardon him but was blocked by House Speaker Mike Johnson. This allegation was met with widespread skepticism, given that the Speaker has no constitutional role in the pardon process and Santos has a well-documented history of making false claims. The statement marks a bizarre final public act before his incarceration.</p>

          <p>According to documents obtained by Politico, the Trump administration is planning to cut at least 2,145 senior and specialized employees from NASA. This move is part of a larger government-wide push to slash the federal workforce through buyouts and early retirements. The reported layoffs would affect experienced staff in core areas like science and human space flight. The news has drawn sharp criticism from former NASA officials, who warn that such cuts could undermine U.S. leadership in space exploration and cede ground to competitors like China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation into the deadly Texas floods suggests that a failure in the emergency alert system may have contributed to the tragedy. Recordings of emergency radio traffic from Kerr County reveal that a firefighter's request to activate the CodeRED alert system was delayed pending supervisor approval. As a result, many residents in the path of the rapidly rising floodwaters never received a warning. This systemic breakdown raises serious questions about whether a more timely and efficient alert could have prompted earlier evacuations and potentially saved lives.</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded 1,288 cases of measles so far this year, the highest number since 1992 and a figure that surpasses the entire total for 2019.

Public health experts attribute the resurgence of this highly contagious disease, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, to declining childhood vaccination rates in certain areas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs of federal workers. The court lifted a lower court's injunction that had blocked the workforce reduction efforts at nearly two dozen agencies. This decision allows the administration to resume its government reorganization plans while the broader legal challenge from labor unions proceeds. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration's agenda to shrink the federal government, but opponents warn it jeopardizes essential public services.</p>

Mayor Cherelle Parker held firm on the city's fiscal constraints, and workers, including sanitation staff and 911 dispatchers, have returned to their jobs pending a ratification vote.</p>
