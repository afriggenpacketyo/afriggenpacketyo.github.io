          <p>The recent firing of a federal prosecutor from the Justice Department is impacting the case against a businessman accused of defrauding a fund for children with special needs out of approximately $100 million. This dismissal is part of a broader series of firings that critics allege are politically motivated acts of retribution by the Trump administration against those involved in U.S. Capitol riot cases. Victims and their families have expressed shock and concern that the removal of the prosecutor will jeopardize and delay their pursuit of justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, terminating a long-standing agreement that had previously averted such duties. The Commerce Department stated the move is intended to protect U.S. farmers from what it calls unfair trade practices and an influx of cheaply priced produce. While supporters in states like Florida praise the decision, critics, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and some Democratic lawmakers, warn it could lead to higher consumer prices for items like salsa and harm American industries reliant on imported tomatoes.

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with mass layoffs affecting nearly 1,400 employees at the Department of Education while legal challenges continue. This action is part of the administration's stated goal of dismantling the agency and returning its functions to the states. The court's three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sotomayor writing that the judiciary's role is to check such executive "lawlessness," not to facilitate it by allowing the department to be dismantled.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the Trump administration's tougher stance on Russia stems from the president feeling personally insulted and made to look weak by Vladimir Putin's repeated defiance. It frames the recent policy shift, including new weapons for Ukraine and tariff threats, not as a strategic change but as a reaction to being ignored. The piece details Trump's growing frustration after his calls for a peace deal were met with escalated attacks, humiliating him on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski's surprise selection to the National League All-Star team has sparked considerable debate across baseball. The move came just after a dominant 12-strikeout performance against the Dodgers, but some, including members of the Philadelphia Phillies, have called his inclusion a "joke" given his limited big-league experience. Dave Roberts, the NL team manager, defended the decision, stating that if the "electric" young player brings excitement to the game, he is all for it.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who has publicly broken with former President Trump on key issues like tax cuts and foreign policy, has reported strong fundraising for his re-election campaign.

This model would put ownership into the hands of the postmasters who run the branches, aiming to restore trust and transform the organization's culture. Any major structural change is unlikely before 2030, pending the replacement of the faulty IT system and the full recommendations from the public inquiry.</p>
