          <h2>New Law Overhauls Federal Student Loan Repayment System</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law signed by President Trump overhauls the federal student loan system, reducing the number of repayment plans from seven to two and capping borrowing amounts. The legislation phases out plans like SAVE and introduces a standard 10-25 year plan and a new 30-year income-driven option. The law also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants for students with full scholarships while expanding it for those in workforce training programs, aiming to simplify a confusing system but drawing criticism for potentially extending repayment periods.

          <p>President Donald Trump and the first lady are set to visit Kerrville, Texas, to survey the devastation from massive floods that have killed over 120 people, including campers and counselors at a summer camp. The visit occurs as the administration faces scrutiny over its disaster response, particularly concerning a new policy that allegedly delayed the deployment of FEMA search and rescue teams. The White House has defended its actions, asserting the response was swift and that ongoing reforms to FEMA aim to improve overall efficiency.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is grappling with a backlog of over a billion dollars in grants, reportedly stalled by new bureaucratic hurdles from the Trump administration's 'DOGE' initiative. These delays are jeopardizing funding for critical services, including support for unaccompanied migrant children, a domestic violence hotline, and HIV care resources. To manage the crisis, HHS has reportedly asked some laid-off employees to return temporarily, as officials fear it's nearly impossible to process the grants in time without compromising review standards.</p>

          <p>The Unite union has voted to suspend Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership, escalating a conflict over the long-running bin strikes in Birmingham. The move reflects a deepening rift between the union and the Labour government, as Rayner had encouraged striking workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council. Unite has warned that this dispute is part of a broader dissatisfaction with the government's policies and could threaten the union's significant financial and political relationship with the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's 'Doge' efficiency initiative, spearheaded by Elon Musk, exposes a hazardous Silicon Valley ideology aimed at dismantling public institutions in favor of private digital platforms. The author contends this anti-institutional mindset, which treats governance like a tech startup, is unsuited for caring for citizens and threatens democratic processes. The article warns that this 'platform-archy' is a dangerous fantasy and calls for a renewed commitment to strengthening public institutions in the age of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly weighing legal action against fellow Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur concerning their pursuit of midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White. Forest is said to be furious with Tottenham's conduct, alleging a potential breach of a confidentiality agreement within the player's £60 million release clause.

          <p>A court in Tunisia has handed down lengthy prison sentences, ranging from 12 to 35 years, to 21 political opponents of President Kais Saied in a mass trial. Prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi was among those convicted, receiving his sentence while already incarcerated on separate charges. Human rights groups and opposition figures have decried the trial as politically motivated, viewing it as a significant escalation in President Saied's crackdown on dissent and the continued dismantling of Tunisia's democratic structures.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, indicating robust consumer demand for its apparel. The iconic denim company acknowledged the financial headwinds from President Trump's new tariffs but stated it intends to absorb some of the initial costs. This strategy is bolstered by strong full-price sales and successful premium pricing on new products. However, the company's guidance is based only on currently known tariff rates, and its leadership acknowledges that the trade policy landscape remains highly uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The northern Ukrainian city of Sumy, near the Russian border, is enduring increasingly frequent and deadly attacks as Russia reportedly amasses tens of thousands of troops for a potential new offensive. The city, a hub of Ukrainian culture and resistance, has been devastated by missile and drone strikes that have killed civilians, including a celebrated local musician. This escalation in violence has coincided with uncertainty over U.S. support, as cuts to USAID funding have impacted independent media and other vital services in the embattled region.</p>

The program, which can reduce review times to as little as one month, is intended to incentivize companies to address U.S. health priorities, including developing innovative cures and boosting domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The National Trust, a major UK heritage and conservation charity, has announced plans to eliminate approximately 550 jobs, which constitutes 6% of its total workforce. The organization attributed the cuts to 'sustained cost pressures,' including a £10 million annual increase in its wage bill driven by recent rises in National Insurance and the National Living Wage. These job losses are part of a wider strategy to achieve £26 million in savings, though the Prospect union contends that management decisions also played a role in the charity's financial issues.</p>
