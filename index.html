          <p>Former Dodgers pitcher Eric Gagné's bat company, B45, is at the forefront of a new trend in baseball: torpedo bats.  Designed with a unique weight distribution, these bats are gaining popularity among major league hitters for their potential to increase bat speed and power. The innovation is a response to recent advancements in pitching, which have made it more difficult for batters to hit.  While the long-term impact remains uncertain, the torpedo bat represents a significant development in the equipment used in the sport.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of a 50% tariff on Lesotho's imports has caused significant economic distress for the small African nation.

The Lesotho government plans to seek solutions in Washington and diversify its trade relationships to mitigate the impact of these tariffs, which are significantly higher than those imposed on any other country.

          <p>An emerging markets fund is experiencing its largest drop since 2020 due to concerns about President Trump's tariffs and the potential for a global trade war.  Many emerging market economies are heavily reliant on exports, making them particularly vulnerable to tariff-related disruptions.  China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs further fueled market anxieties.  The situation underscores the interconnectedness of global markets and the potential for widespread economic consequences from protectionist trade policies.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are expected to increase the cost of airplanes, engines, and other aerospace products.  The aerospace industry, a major US exporter, is seeking exemptions from the tariffs under a long-standing trade agreement.  Increased costs will likely be absorbed by manufacturers, supply chains, or consumers, impacting the industry and potentially reducing competitiveness. The situation highlights the complexities of global trade and the potential for unintended consequences from protectionist policies.</p>

          <p>The Royal Air Force has lifted its ban on Tunnock's teacakes after conducting altitude chamber tests.  The ban was imposed 60 years ago following an incident where unwrapped teacakes exploded in a cockpit due to pressure changes. The recent tests demonstrated that the teacakes do not pose a flight safety risk when kept in their wrappers.  This amusing news highlights a quirky piece of aviation history and the thoroughness of modern safety protocols.</p>
