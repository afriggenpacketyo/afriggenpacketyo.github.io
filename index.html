          <p>As the midnight deadline approaches, congressional leaders are deeply entrenched in a blame game over a potential government shutdown, driven by partisan disagreements on funding measures. Republicans push for a "clean" continuing resolution, but Democrats insist on restoring Medicaid cuts and permanently extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. President Trump's position seemed inconsistent, as he falsely claimed Democrats sought healthcare for undocumented immigrants while also stating his disinterest in a shutdown. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sharply criticized Republican absences and Trump's use of a "bigoted" deepfake video, emphasizing Democratic unity in protecting American healthcare.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is making significant progress in its revitalization efforts, securing up to $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing and an additional $150 million from a major aircraft lessor, subject to court approval. The budget carrier filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in under a year due to high costs and weak demand, leading to plans to cut 40 routes and furlough a third of its flight attendants. Spirit aims to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft and 12 airport leases to reduce costs. CEO Dave Davis expressed gratitude to stakeholders, emphasizing these steps are crucial for building a stronger, future-proof airline.</p>

          <p>Sylvester Stallone admitted to feeling nervous about working with fellow Hollywood icon Samuel L. Jackson for the first time on season 3 of "Tulsa King." Stallone, who leads the series as Dwight "The General" Manfredi, anticipated a competitive dynamic with Jackson, who joins as ex-con Russell Lee Washington Jr. Despite living near each other for decades, their paths rarely crossed professionally. However, Stallone revealed their on-screen collaboration quickly developed into a strong, synergistic flow, leading to an enjoyable working relationship.

          <p>The U.S. government is on the brink of a shutdown as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked over a funding deal, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimating approximately 750,000 federal employees would be furloughed. This would incur a daily compensation cost of about $400 million, with the number of affected employees potentially fluctuating. House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats of making policy demands, specifically regarding Affordable Care Act tax credits, to protect Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's position.

          <p>President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace proposal, though largely sensible on paper, faces significant hurdles in implementation despite initial backing from various international and regional actors. The plan aims to end the war, return hostages, provide aid, and disarm Hamas, reversing Trump's earlier controversial "clean out" proposal. However, the article highlights the difficulty in securing Hamas's concessions on demilitarization and ensuring Prime Minister Netanyahu upholds the deal against his far-right coalition's objections. Trump's unique leverage over Netanyahu and good relations with key Arab states offer potential, but sustained attention is crucial for the plan's success.</p>

The data suggests MET-097i can achieve significant weight loss, up to 14.1% in 28 weeks, with potentially fewer gastrointestinal side effects than existing GLP-1 drugs, and a monthly dosing advantage.

This could cause delays for borrowers seeking assistance or those applying for loan forgiveness programs.

          <p>Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Experts warn this move would flood the program with claims, threatening its financial stability and providing ammunition for vaccine opponents, as the link between vaccines and autism has been debunked. The VICP, established in 1986, is a no-fault system designed to compensate for vaccine-related injuries while protecting vaccine supply. Scientists and public health officials emphasize that autism's origins are genetic or environmental during pregnancy, not vaccination, and that expanding VICP in this way would be purely political, potentially undermining public trust in vaccines.</p>

The enhanced premium tax credits currently make health insurance affordable for 22 million ACA enrollees, saving them an average of $705 annually.

The FTC claims Zillow paid Redfin $100 million for an agreement where Redfin would re-host Zillow's listings, terminate existing advertising contracts, and exit the multifamily advertising market for up to nine years. This arrangement, which saw Redfin fire hundreds of employees subsequently rehired by Zillow, effectively made Redfin's sites identical to Zillow's.

Borrowers must understand the true costs, including origination fees, insurance premiums, and ongoing property expenses, to avoid financial surprises. It's crucial to consider the impact on heirs, as the loan must be repaid when the homeowner dies or moves, potentially forcing a sale or refinance. Borrowers should avoid taking more than needed to prevent excessive interest accrual and understand how proceeds might affect eligibility for means-tested benefits like Medicaid. Seeking independent professional guidance is essential to weigh alternatives and ensure long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted unconstitutionally by revoking visas, arresting, detaining, and deporting foreign students and faculty engaged in pro-Palestinian advocacy. Judge William Young, in a scathing 161-page ruling, found that the State and Homeland Security Departments misused their powers to chill free speech on college campuses, violating the First Amendment rights of non-citizens. Young criticized the administration's actions as part of broader efforts to limit free speech, and condemned ICE for using masked agents during arrests, likening it to a "masked secret police." The ruling affirms First Amendment protections for noncitizens, though the administration continues to pursue deportations.</p>

          <p>Over a dozen House Democrats allege the Trump administration may be "improperly" seizing tax refunds from defaulted student loan borrowers by failing to provide the legally required 60-day notice. After a pandemic-era pause, the administration resumed garnishments of tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits. Lawmakers argue that previous notices, issued years ago, are insufficient given potential life changes for borrowers. They express concern about the accuracy of the Education Department's data and contact information, especially after significant staff cuts at the Federal Student Aid office. This article highlights a potential violation of due process affecting millions of borrowers.</p>

          <p>Following a tragic shooting and fire at a Michigan church during Sunday services, officials confirmed all individuals are accounted for, with the FBI investigating it as an "act of targeted violence." The suspect, Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and fired an assault rifle, killing four and injuring eight, including children. The White House indicated investigators are probing the motive, with initial understanding pointing to hatred of the Mormon faith. The incident, which occurred a day after the faith's president died, prompted increased patrols around places of worship. This article details a deeply tragic event with significant human cost.</p>

          <p>The undeniable rebound in Wall Street dealmaking, highlighted by Goldman Sachs advising on Electronic Arts' massive $55 billion leveraged buyout, signals a bullish outlook for the firm's investors. This development, coupled with Jefferies' record-breaking third-quarter revenue driven by strong dealmaking, bodes well for Goldman's investment banking division. After a period of reduced activity due to high interest rates and regulatory uncertainty, a more relaxed business environment under the current administration is fueling a resurgence in IPO and M&A activity. Goldman Sachs shares have already reflected this bounce, with the article noting the firm's continued dominance in M&A advisory. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The potential U.S. government shutdown hinges on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, which currently help 22 million Americans afford health insurance. These subsidies, set to expire at the end of 2025, are a key demand from Democrats in funding negotiations, while Republicans want separate talks. Experts warn that without an extension, premiums could more than double, leading to financial hardship for millions and potentially causing 4 million people to lose coverage. Insurers are already proposing significant rate hikes for 2026, driven by rising medical costs and the anticipated subsidy expiration. This article emphasizes the critical impact of these credits on American households.</p>
