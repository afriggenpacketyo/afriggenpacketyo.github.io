          <p>Several Republican-led states, including West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio, are deploying hundreds of their National Guard troops to Washington D.C. This action supports President Trump's initiative to address what his administration has termed a public safety crisis in the nation's capital. The deployment has been met with significant political pushback from local officials, such as D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who view it as an overreach of federal power and an infringement on the city's self-governance. Protests have also emerged in opposition to the increased military and federal law enforcement presence in the city.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin rapidly intensified from a tropical storm into a powerful Category 5 hurricane before slightly weakening, a process fueled by unusually warm ocean waters. This phenomenon, known as rapid intensification, is becoming more common due to climate change, which complicates forecasting and emergency preparedness. While Erin is not projected to make landfall in the continental U.S., its outer bands are bringing strong winds and heavy rain to Caribbean islands, prompting warnings for potential flooding and landslides. The storm's development highlights the increasing volatility of the Atlantic hurricane season, which is expected to be unusually busy this year.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Washington D.C. to protest President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency" and the subsequent deployment of National Guard troops. The peaceful march, which moved from DuPont Circle to the White House, was a response to the administration's increased federal oversight of the city's police department. Protesters expressed concerns over what they see as a legal and ethical overreach, challenging the narrative of rampant crime and defending the principle of local self-governance. This demonstration followed a successful legal challenge by D.C.'s Attorney General that prevented the White House from appointing its own emergency police commissioner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' star pitcher Zack Wheeler has been placed on the 15-day injured list following a diagnosis of a blood clot near his shoulder. The team's president of baseball operations, Dave Dombrowski, confirmed the diagnosis but did not provide a specific timetable for the three-time All-Star's return. Wheeler, a leading contender for the Cy Young Award, currently leads the major leagues with 195 strikeouts this season. His absence is a significant blow to the Phillies, who hold a five-game lead in the NL East, though the team anticipates the return of another key pitcher, Aaron Nola, from injury soon.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in trade tensions, Chinese merchants selling goods on major e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu continue to worry about the potential for future U.S. tariffs. The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy remains a significant concern for businesses that rely on American consumers for a large portion of their revenue. Some companies reported having to suspend their U.S. operations for months earlier in the year when bilateral relations deteriorated. This ongoing anxiety highlights the fragile nature of the current trade environment and the significant impact that geopolitical decisions can have on global online retailers and their supply chains.</p>

          <p>Following a summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has shifted his position on the war in Ukraine, now advocating for a permanent peace agreement instead of an immediate ceasefire. Trump is reportedly urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a deal that may involve ceding territory in the Donbas region in exchange for Russia freezing the current front lines. This represents a significant change from Trump's previous demands for a rapid ceasefire. Zelenskyy has stated that Russia's refusal to halt hostilities complicates the situation but is preparing to meet with Trump in Washington to discuss the path forward.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that National Guard members deployed to Washington D.C. as part of President Trump's public safety initiative may be armed. However, an official clarified that the troops will not be making arrests and their primary role is to protect federal assets and provide a secure environment for law enforcement. This statement marks a shift from earlier guidance, which indicated the Guard members would not be armed. The deployment, which includes troops from several Republican-led states, is intended to deter violent crime through a visible law enforcement presence, a move that has been protested by some D.C. residents.</p>

The article also details a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump, hand-delivered by the president, which raised concerns about children affected by the conflict. In a separate development, the White House dismissed an NPR report about summit-related documents being found on a hotel printer as a "hilarious" non-issue.

          <p>A new, highly contagious COVID-19 variant, nicknamed "Stratus," is driving a nationwide surge in cases, with the Southwest experiencing the highest positivity rates. This spike coincides with students returning to school and a recent change in CDC policy, influenced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which no longer recommends updated COVID shots for all children. Public health experts have criticized this decision, arguing that boosters remain effective at reducing hospitalization and death. The rise of the Stratus variant, which now accounts for two-thirds of detected cases, underscores the virus's ongoing evolution and the continuing public health challenges it presents.</p>

The renovated fortress now features 40 beds, modern amenities, and even a nightclub.

          <p>With food prices rising, parents are adopting meticulous planning and creative cooking techniques to manage the increased cost of feeding children during the school summer holidays. Strategies include buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items to freeze for later, batch cooking meals, and organizing the fridge to ensure food with the nearest use-by date is used first. Some families also rely on community pantries that provide surplus food from supermarkets at a low cost. These methods help stretch household budgets at a time when expenses for childcare and activities are also high, and the subsidy of school meals is unavailable for many.</p>

          <p>Across the United Kingdom, a prolonged period of hot and dry weather is causing signs of a "false autumn," with trees shedding leaves and fruit ripening weeks ahead of schedule. Experts explain that these are not signs of a seasonal shift but rather indicators of nature under stress from drought conditions. This summer is on track to be one of the warmest on record, impacting agriculture with early harvests and prompting concerns for wildlife. Conservationists warn that the disruption to natural cycles could lead to food shortages for animals like birds and badgers later in the year.</p>

The strike began after contract negotiations with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) broke down over key issues, including wages and unpaid work hours. In response to the massive travel disruption during the peak summer season, the Canadian federal government quickly intervened, forcing both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to resolve the dispute and get employees back to work.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing to travel to Washington D.C. for a crucial meeting with President Donald Trump. The visit follows the recent US-Russia summit in Alaska, where Trump and Vladimir Putin discussed the war in Ukraine. After the summit, Trump shifted his focus from a ceasefire to a permanent peace settlement, which reportedly involves a Russian offer to freeze frontlines if Ukraine withdraws from the Donbas region. Zelenskyy's upcoming talks at the White House are seen as the next critical step in these high-stakes diplomatic negotiations to find a resolution to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a plan to move Palestinians to the southern Gaza Strip in preparation for a renewed military offensive aimed at taking control of northern Gaza City. The agency for civilian affairs stated that the supply of tents and shelter equipment would resume to facilitate the relocation. This move comes as Israeli forces intensify operations on the outskirts of Gaza City, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as the final stronghold of Hamas. Meanwhile, families of hostages held in Gaza have called for public protests to demand a deal to end the war and secure the release of all remaining captives.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman from Gaza, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment while suffering from severe malnutrition, has died in a hospital in Pisa. The woman, identified as Marah Abu Zuhri, suffered a cardiac arrest less than 48 hours after her arrival. Her death highlights the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and famine-like conditions. Italy is one of several countries that has established a program to evacuate critically ill children and adults from the conflict zone for medical care. The war has decimated Gaza's healthcare system, leaving many without access to essential treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung is successfully challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors that appeal to consumers. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its experimentation with new designs are creating significant competition. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to counter Samsung's momentum in the premium device category. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that landmark environmental laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 are under threat and must be defended. While the act successfully helped some species recover, many marine mammals, including North Atlantic right whales and various dolphin populations, remain vulnerable. The author contends that new threats, particularly climate change, are causing widespread harm through marine heatwaves, loss of kelp forests, and toxic algal blooms. Weakening these protections, as proposed by some politicians, would be a "death sentence" for these animals and ignores the fact that their decline is an indicator of the declining health of our oceans.</p>
