          <p>Jury selection has begun in the sexual assault trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, a prominent figure in hip-hop. Combs faces allegations of racketeering conspiracy, sexual assault, and transportation for prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The prosecution intends to present evidence including a surveillance tape showing Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, who is expected to testify along with other alleged victims. The defense is arguing that Combs was a swinger and all encounters were consensual. The trial is expected to last two months and will include evidence seized from Combs' homes during raids, including electronic devices and AR-15-style rifles. </p>

Rhino horn is in high demand on the black market in Asia, particularly in Vietnam and China, where it is used in traditional medicine and as a status symbol, driving poaching activities. </p>

He argued that everyone, regardless of documentation status, is entitled to due process, referencing Dugan's arrest for allegedly aiding an illegal immigrant.

          <p>Emmitsburg, Maryland, a town that largely supported President Trump due to his promise to cut federal spending, is now facing the consequences of those cuts. The Trump administration cancelled in-person classes at the National Fire Academy, a significant part of the town's identity and economy. Residents express puzzlement over the administration's decision to cut training for firefighters. Some residents are beginning to question their support for Trump, feeling the administration is cutting without considering the impact. </p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are struggling to reconcile deep divisions as they attempt to extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which could add trillions to federal deficits. Economists warn that the GOP's fiscal plans could destabilize the economy. The party is struggling to agree on spending cuts and tax hikes to offset the cost of the tax cuts. Failure to pass a bill could result in taxes automatically increasing for nearly all Americans next year, potentially triggering a recession. </p>
