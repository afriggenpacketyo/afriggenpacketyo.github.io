        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorneys general from five states have filed a lawsuit against Zillow and Redfin, mirroring a recent complaint from the Federal Trade Commission. The suit alleges the companies engaged in an anti-competitive scheme where Zillow paid Redfin $100 million to exit the apartment rental advertising market and transfer its clients. This action, according to the complaint, was designed to insulate Zillow from competition, potentially harming renters and advertisers by reducing options and driving up costs. The states are seeking an injunction to block the agreement and may push for business restructuring to restore market competition.</p>

          <p>A viral food trend inspired by the Netflix movie "KPop Demon Hunters" is leading to serious burn injuries among children and teenagers, according to medical experts. The trend involves eating hot instant noodles to imitate a scene from the film, but spills from high-placed microwaves are causing frequent scaldings. A burn specialist noted that children's skin is thinner and more susceptible to severe burns, which can result in lifelong scarring and emotional distress. The American Burn Association and a recent University of Chicago study highlight the significant danger posed by instant noodles, which account for nearly a third of childhood scald admissions.</p>

The acquisition could be finalized within days and would represent Berkshire's largest deal since its 2022 purchase of Alleghany, deploying a portion of its record $344 billion cash reserve. This move comes as Buffett prepares to step down as CEO, with his successor, Greg Abel, having deep expertise in the energy sector. Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, a position Buffett began building in 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay preventing President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position until the court hears the case in January. This decision maintains, for now, the central bank's traditional independence from political interference from the White House. The case arose after Trump, who has been pressuring the Fed for lower interest rates, moved to oust Cook based on allegations of misstatements on a mortgage application, which she denies. Critics of the President's move argue that compromising the Fed's autonomy could lead to poor economic outcomes.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a plan to remove synthetic dyes and over 30 other ingredients, such as artificial sweeteners and certain preservatives, from its private-label food products by 2027. The change will impact approximately 1,000 items across brands like Great Value and is a response to consumer demand for simpler, more familiar ingredients. This move by the nation's largest grocer is expected to have a significant effect on the food market and follows similar initiatives by other major food manufacturers.

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $18 billion in federal funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects: the Hudson River Tunnel and the Second Avenue Subway. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought stated the hold was to ensure funding does not flow based on what he termed "unconstitutional DEI principles." The Department of Transportation clarified that the projects are under administrative review to determine if any discriminatory contracting requirements are being used. This move occurs on the first day of a federal government shutdown, which officials say will delay the review process due to furloughed staff.</p>

          <p>On the first day of the government shutdown, the Senate held procedural votes on two funding bills, both of which failed to secure the necessary 60 votes to advance. The votes mirrored the unsuccessful attempts from the previous day, indicating a continued stalemate between the two parties. Congressional leaders from both sides have continued to blame each other for the lapse in funding, with Republicans urging more Democrats to support their short-term bill and Democrats calling for Republicans to negotiate.

For many Afghans, particularly women and girls who are barred from education and most jobs, the internet serves as a crucial link to the outside world and a source of information and communication.</p>

This move commits the U.S. to take all appropriate measures, including military action if necessary, to defend Qatar's interests.

The company, known for its soft, huggable toys, saw revenue climb 66% to $449 million as more adults, or "kidults," purchase toys for comfort and nostalgia. This trend reflects a broader market shift, with adults now being the largest and fastest-growing segment of toy buyers, spending $1.8 billion in the first quarter of the year. Industry analysts suggest that in times of global turmoil, consumers are turning to nostalgic items that provide a sense of joy and escapism.</p>

Experts and survivors say the topic is shrouded in taboo, silence, and stigma, rooted in societal expectations of masculinity that frame men as dominant figures rather than vulnerable victims. This culture often leads to disbelief and ridicule when boys report abuse, preventing them from seeking help. Despite a 2007 national study indicating that over half of boys had experienced sexual abuse, their experiences remain largely invisible in public discourse.</p>

          <p>Indonesia and Pakistan have endorsed President Donald Trump's 20-point plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza, joining a statement with six other Muslim-majority countries. The nations vowed to engage constructively with all parties to implement the agreement, which includes provisions for a ceasefire, hostage exchange, and reconstruction. The support from these populous Muslim nations comes even as Hamas has not yet responded to the plan. While the move aligns the countries more closely with the Trump administration, it has generated significant backlash domestically, with critics arguing the plan is biased toward Israel.</p>

          <p>According to a key report from payroll processor ADP, U.S. private employers shed 32,000 jobs in September, marking the largest decline since March 2023 and signaling a significant softening in the labor market. This figure, which includes a downward revision for August's numbers, surprised economists who had anticipated a modest gain. The data takes on added importance as the official government jobs report may be delayed due to the federal shutdown. The job losses were concentrated in small and mid-sized businesses, while large companies with over 500 employees continued to add jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has released its contingency plan for the government shutdown, indicating that many parks will remain accessible but with significantly reduced staffing and services. Over half of the service's 14,500 employees will be furloughed. Parks that collect fees will use that revenue to provide basic services like sanitation and trash collection, but those without fee collection will have minimal to no operations. This approach risks a repeat of the 2018-2019 shutdown, which saw vandalism and sanitation issues at understaffed parks, and conservation groups warn of danger to both visitors and natural resources.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reportedly issued a new order to Apple, demanding access to the personal data of its British users when backed by a warrant for national security purposes. This is the latest move in an ongoing dispute between the Home Office and the tech giant over data privacy and encryption. The new order is understood to be a revision of a previous, more sweeping demand that sought access to Apple user data worldwide, which had drawn criticism from the U.S. government. Apple maintains it will not compromise on user privacy or build backdoors into its products, and a legal tribunal on the matter is scheduled for 2026.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have become a recurring feature of American politics over the past four decades. Before 1980, agencies largely continued to operate during funding gaps, but legal opinions from the Carter administration established that most operations must cease without congressional appropriation. Since then, there have been 14 shutdowns, with the longest being a 34-day partial shutdown under President Trump in 2018-2019. These events, often stemming from partisan disputes over policy, have resulted in furloughed federal workers and billions of dollars in economic losses.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government officially began a shutdown after Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the October 1st deadline. The impasse stems from a fundamental disagreement between Republicans and Democrats, with Democrats insisting that a temporary funding measure must also address expiring health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have rejected this condition, arguing that such negotiations should be separate from the essential process of funding the government. With both sides dug in, hundreds of thousands of federal workers face furloughs and a halt in pay.</p>

The message blamed the "Radical Left" for the impending government shutdown and praised the Trump administration's desire to keep the government open. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities in their official capacity to ensure federal programs are administered neutrally.

          <p>While a brief government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact U.S. air travel, a prolonged funding lapse could lead to major disruptions. Most TSA and FAA employees, including airport screeners and air traffic controllers, are deemed essential and must work without pay. However, travel experts warn that if a shutdown drags on, financial pressure could lead to increased sick calls and staff shortages, as was seen during the 34-day shutdown in 2018-2019. This could result in longer security lines, flight delays, and cancellations, with the U.S. Travel Association estimating a potential economic cost of $1 billion per week.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has claimed that Brexit is linked to the rise in small boat arrivals, arguing that leaving the EU's Dublin III regulation eliminated a key mechanism for returning asylum seekers. An analysis by BBC Verify confirms that before the 2016 referendum, the UK did return more people to the EU under the agreement than it received, although the numbers were relatively small. Since Brexit, the UK has also lost access to the EU's fingerprint database, making it harder to identify asylum seekers who have already claimed in another EU country. Migration experts note that while Brexit is a factor, family ties and language are also major drivers.</p>

Sales of all-electric vehicles surged by 30.2% to a new quarterly record, while sales of larger SUVs also saw significant gains. The growth in EV sales was likely boosted by consumers rushing to purchase vehicles before federal incentives of up to $7,500 expired in September. Industry-wide, EV sales are expected to have hit a record high in the third quarter, capturing a market share of around 10%. (not investment advice)</p>
