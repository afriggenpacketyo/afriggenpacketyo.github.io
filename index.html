          <p>The Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin warning of a heightened threat environment in the United States after the U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. The bulletin notes that while there are no current specific threats, low-level cyber attacks against U.S. networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against U.S. networks. The DHS also cautioned that the Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets. Law enforcement officials in New York City said they were deploying additional resources to certain sites as a precaution, demonstrating a heightened state of alert. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a former FBI assistant director told Fox News Digital that Iran and its proxies could resort to terrorism, with the border crisis under the Biden administration exacerbating the threat of terror cells in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security released a bulletin sounding the alarm to a "heightened threat environment in the United States." Over 1,200 Iranian nationals reportedly entered the U.S. during former President Joe Biden‚Äôs time in office, raising concerns regarding possible domestic sleeper cells driven by foreign terrorist organizations. The former FBI assistant director indicated the FBI has primarily focused its attention on homegrown attackers as foreign adversaries flowed into the country.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump‚Äôs decision to strike Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, Washington is bracing for a response from Iran, as U.S. military officials said the strikes caused ‚Äúextremely severe damage and destruction.‚Äù While Iran downplayed the impact, Tehran's nuclear-armed allies, in Russia and North Korea, have been critical of the military campaign. Despite the dramatic nature of the U.S. air raid, few in Washington expressed an appetite for a prolonged U.S. war with Iran and echoed Israel‚Äôs interest in a truce after assessing its initial operations a success. The Pentagon reported that seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers deployed a total of 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrators against Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.</p>

The Pentagon said it will take time to fully assess the effect of the attack, though it appears all the sites sustained "extremely severe damage." Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 U.S. military aircraft including seven B-2 stealth bombers, with three nuclear facilities targeted: Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The U.S. deployed several deception tactics, including decoys, with fighter jets clearing the airspace ahead of them, checking for enemy aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. </p>

          <p>The United States launched military strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities Sunday morning local time, igniting concerns about possible Iranian retaliation and what form such responses could take. Among them are fears Iran could block oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial trade passage that the country partly controls. The strait has become one of the most vital oil "chokepoints" in the world, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products per day. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" that an Iranian effort to block the strait "would be a suicidal move."</p>

Some lawmakers disagree with the assessment that Trump could act without seeking approval from Congress first. Republican Rep.

Top Democrats were kept in the dark about the mission until after U.S. forces left Iranian airspace, according to a U.S. official.</p>

No group immediately claimed responsibility Sunday, but the Syrian Interior Ministry said an extremist from the Islamic State group entered the church, fired at the people there before detonating himself with an explosives vest.

An attempt to block the narrow waterway between Iran and Oman could have profound consequences for the global economy, as some 20 million barrels per day of crude oil flowed through the strait in 2024.

The operation relied on a series of deceptive tactics and decoys to maintain the secrecy, U.S. officials said hours after the attack, which was preceded by nine days of Israeli attacks that debilitated Iran's military leadership and air defenses.

The key waterway lies between Oman and Iran, and connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) describes it as the "world's most important oil transit chokepoint." Around 20 million barrels of crude, condensate and fuels are estimated to flow via the waterway daily, according to data from Vortexa, an energy and freight market consultant.</p>

          <h2>US Aims for 'One-and-Done' Attack on Iran's Nuclear Sites</h2>

          <p>The Pentagon briefing was big on what happened but short on detail of what happens next, and neither defence secretary Pete Hegseth nor General Dan "Raisin" Caine, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, can answer that. Mr Hegseth called the bombing an "incredible and overwhelming success" with "focused and clear" instructions from President Trump. The briefing laid out the details of the military deception plan behind Operation Midnight Hammer. A consistent line was that the US wanted Iran to negotiate peace, coupled with the threat of further aggression if it doesn't.</p>

          <h2>JD Vance Claims US Is at War With Iran‚Äôs Nuclear Program, Not Iran</h2>

          <p>JD Vance has said the US is ‚Äúnot at war‚Äù with Iran ‚Äì but is with its nuclear weapons program, holding out a position that the White House hopes to maintain over the coming days as the Iranian regime considers a retributive response to Saturday‚Äôs US strike on three of its nuclear installations. Vance instead said that he believes the US has ‚Äúsubstantially delayed‚Äù Iran‚Äôs ability to develop a nuclear weapon. Bloomberg News said satellite images of the site undermined the Trump administration‚Äôs claims that Iran‚Äôs underground nuclear sites at Fordo and Natanz had been destroyed. Nuclear non-proliferation analysts are conflicted on whether the strikes will be effective in bringing Iran to the negotiating table or convince them to move more decisively toward enriching uranium stockpiles to weapons-grade, assembling a bomb, and manufacturing a delivery system.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, while warning Iran that closing the crucial Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move for the regime. Rubio said the U.S. has no current plans for further attacks on Iran unless "they mess around." President Trump continues to prefer the path of diplomacy, Rubio said, noting that the U.S. pushed Iran to make a deal to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions before the strikes. The question of how Iran will respond has raised fears that the regime could seek to block ships from traveling through the Strait of Hormuz.</p>

          <p>A staggering 16 billion login credentials, including usernames, emails, and passwords for Apple, Google, Facebook and more, have been leaked online, shocking cybersecurity researchers. The compromised data was scraped from over 30 databases since the start of 2025 and likely stems from malicious ‚Äúinfostealer‚Äù software designed to extract sensitive information from victims‚Äô devices. This breach isn‚Äôt just about stolen email addresses, it‚Äôs about what cybercriminals can do with your full login credentials, especially if you tend to use the same passwords across your different accounts. Experts recommend changing passwords, turning on two-factor authentication, and using a password manager to protect against cybercrimes.</p>

The Syrian Civil Defence posted photos and video from inside the church showing a heavily damaged altar, pews covered in broken glass and a bloodied floor.

Yildiz was instrumental in the opener as his angled shot forced Wydad defender Abdelmounaim Boutouil to turn the ball into his own net. Ten minutes later, Yildiz unleashed a spectacular strike from the edge of the box into the top-right corner to give Juventus a 2-0 lead. Juventus will qualify for the last 16 if Al Ain fail to beat City on Sunday evening.</p>

The rumor was shared widely on social media, but searches of major wire services found no reports about this matter. Had Iranian state TV made such an announcement, news media outlets worldwide would have reported it as major breaking news. The rumor possibly originated from an X post appearing on the account Tehran Updates, indicating the Iranian state TV announcement was likely false.</p>
