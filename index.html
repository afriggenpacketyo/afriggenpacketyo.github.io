          <p>Leaked audio from former President Bidenâ€™s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur revealed the president struggling with key memories, including when his son Beau died and when he left the vice presidency. The audio, obtained by Axios, was a clip from several interviews between the former president and Hur related to an investigation into his handling of classified documents. The special counsel's report, which was later released, described Biden as a sympathetic, elderly man with a poor memory, sparking political debate and raising questions about his cognitive fitness.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that his public expression of dislike for Taylor Swift has negatively impacted her popularity. He posted on Truth Social, questioning whether her "HOT" status has diminished since he stated, "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT." This comment followed Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris. The article notes that Trump's statement came after a four-day trip to the Middle East and amid ongoing political tensions with Swift, who has previously endorsed Trump's opponents, suggesting a deeper history of political disagreement between the two.</p>

          <p>Catherine Snowdon, a BBC employee, experienced a security breach when she unknowingly traveled to Madrid on a flight using someone else's boarding pass. Despite airport staff checking her passport and boarding pass, the discrepancy went unnoticed, and she boarded the plane under the name Huw H. Upon arrival in Madrid, she discovered that her return flight was canceled because the airline believed she was a no-show, as their records indicated she never boarded the outbound flight. British Airways has offered compensation for the error, but the incident raises serious security concerns about passenger verification protocols.</p>

Trump himself accused Comey of calling for his death, leading to the Secret Service's investigation into whether the post was a genuine threat or an attempt to inspire violence.

Brown Act, leading to questions about political motivations and the timing of the vote in relation to a union election. A do-over vote was later conducted to address the legal concerns, resulting in the same outcome.</p>

Marine biologist Dr. Patrick Collins said that while it's not something you see everyday, it's not something super unusual either, as smooth-hound sharks have been seen in other urban areas. The shark was likely feeding on crabs in the river, highlighting the unexpected presence of marine life in urban waterways.</p>
