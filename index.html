          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a previous ban, now permitting Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to Chinese companies. This new arrangement requires the tech firms to share 15% of their revenue from these sales with the U.S. government. The policy, which critics have labeled a potentially illegal export tax, has sparked concerns among trade experts about setting a "dangerous precedent" where national security-based export controls could appear to be for sale. This move highlights a transactional approach to trade policy amid the ongoing technological competition between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence weeks after her American Eagle ad campaign sparked a divided public response. The campaign, which used the tagline "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans" as a play on "genes," was criticized by some for having alleged racial undertones, while others defended it against "woke" advertising. Sweeney, who has not commented on the controversy, posted photos from a night out with friends. American Eagle released a statement clarifying the campaign was always about the jeans, while reputation experts suggest the controversy could ultimately boost the actress's career.</p>

The driver later contacted police, stating that unidentified masked men had shot at him, unaware they were federal officers. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson claimed the agents fired in self-defense after the driver refused to exit and drove his car at them, injuring two officers. The San Bernardino Police Department responded but cited the California Values Act, which prohibits local law enforcement from assisting with federal immigration enforcement, creating a tense jurisdictional situation.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the legendary West Hollywood restaurant that bears his name, has passed away at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. Tana, a former professional soccer player, opened his Italian eatery in 1964, and it quickly became a favored spot for Hollywood's elite, known for its clubby atmosphere and discreet service. For decades, celebrities from Elizabeth Taylor to George Clooney were regulars, with some even having dishes named after them. Though Tana sold the restaurant in 2009, it has remained an enduring Los Angeles institution.</p>

A portion of these tariffs was introduced as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized the measures as unfair, highlighting that many Western nations also continue to trade with Russia, creating a significant diplomatic and economic rift.

          <p>A long-standing traffic engineering guideline known as the "85th percentile rule" is coming under increased scrutiny across the United States. The rule suggests that a road's speed limit should be set at the speed that 85% of drivers travel at or below, effectively letting drivers dictate the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. In response to rising traffic fatalities, some states and cities are now exploring new methods that prioritize safety and road context over driver speed.</p>

According to the CDC, the rate of tick-related ER visits in May was the highest since 2019. Experts attribute the rise to several factors, including warmer and more humid conditions that allow ticks to thrive, the expansion of tick habitats into more populated areas, and possibly greater public awareness. The trend is concerning due to the risk of tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, which affects approximately half a million Americans annually.</p>

Investigators linked Miller to the cold cases after more than two decades using genetic genealogy.

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier based on a "scissor wing" or oblique wing concept first explored by NASA. The innovative design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates as the aircraft's speed increases, optimizing performance across subsonic, transonic, and hypersonic flight regimes. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but at Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the body, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This approach aims to solve the longstanding aerodynamic challenge of creating a vehicle that performs well at both low and extremely high speeds.</p>

The reasons include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to always be "good," the burnout from perfectionism, and having poor boundaries developed from a parentified childhood. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can lead to seeking solace elsewhere as a form of reprieve or retaliation.

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in escalating trade tensions, Chinese merchants selling on platforms like Shein, Temu, and Amazon remain worried about the unpredictable nature of U.S. tariffs. Many sellers view the U.S. as a critical market due to its large consumer base and relatively low barrier to entry. However, the threat of sudden policy shifts creates significant business risk, as exemplified by one company that had to halt its U.S. operations for two months earlier in the year when relations soured. This uncertainty complicates long-term planning for many Chinese businesses that rely on American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Shifts Stance on Ukraine, Urges Direct Peace Deal After Putin Summit</h2>

          <p>Following a summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has changed his position on the war in Ukraine, now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than a preliminary ceasefire. This marks a significant shift from his previous stance, where he had threatened Russia with sanctions if a ceasefire was not quickly established. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded that Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire complicates peace efforts. Reports suggest Putin's offer involves Ukraine ceding territory in the Donbas region in exchange for freezing the current front lines.</p>

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C. as part of President Trump's public safety initiative "may be armed." While the troops are not currently making arrests, they could carry weapons consistent with their mission to protect federal assets and deter crime. This statement marks a shift from earlier guidance, which indicated that weapons would be available but stored in an armory unless needed. The confirmation adds to the growing concerns among D.C. residents and officials about the escalating federal intervention in the city's local affairs.</p>

          <p>A new, highly contagious COVID-19 variant, nicknamed "Stratus," is driving a surge in cases across the United States, with the Southwest experiencing the nation's highest positivity rate at 12.5%. The spike coincides with students returning to school and follows a controversial change in CDC policy, which no longer recommends updated COVID shots for all children. Public health experts have criticized this decision, arguing that boosters remain effective at reducing hospitalization and death. The nationwide positivity rate has surpassed the post-holiday peak from January, highlighting the virus's continued evolution and public health challenge.</p>

          <h2>Hurricane Erin Becomes One of the Atlantic's Fastest-Intensifying Storms on Record</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 20:30:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin has undergone an astonishingly rapid intensification, strengthening from a Category 1 to a powerful Category 5 storm in just over 24 hours before settling as a Category 4. This rate of strengthening places it among the fastest on record in the Atlantic, a phenomenon scientists link to warming ocean and atmospheric temperatures caused by climate change. While the hurricane is not expected to make a direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, it is forecast to generate life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along the coast next week.</p>
