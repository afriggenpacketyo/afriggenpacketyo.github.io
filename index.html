          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and its Law Review following reports that the journal was allegedly selecting articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. This action follows previous disputes between the administration and Harvard, including a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants due to antisemitism concerns. The Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services are jointly investigating these allegations of discriminatory practices at the Harvard Law Review, citing potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The investigations will focus on the journal's membership and article selection policies.</p>

          <p>New requirements imposed on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine by the Trump administration have raised concerns about the future of updated COVID-19 shots. The FDA is requesting a new clinical trial for the Novavax vaccine after full approval, creating uncertainty about yearly strain updates.

This agreement ensures that the 1944 treaty regulating water sharing remains beneficial for both countries.

This follows President Trump's criticism of a 60 Minutes episode and a lawsuit against CBS and Paramount. The FCC, led by Trump ally Brendan Carr, is also investigating CBS' campaign coverage.</p>

          <p>Premiership Rugby is considering a revamp that could be implemented as early as next season, involving a qualification model based on financial sustainability, fanbase, and stadium criteria. The change would not be a traditional promotion and relegation system, but clubs failing to meet standards could be removed from the league. This could pave the way for teams like Worcester Warriors to return to the top flight. The Premiership is looking to expand from its current 10 teams and sees cause for optimism with potential broadcast deals and growing interest from younger demographics.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies have significantly disrupted the global economic order. His actions, including provoking a trade war and scrapping treaties, have created deep changes that will be difficult to reverse. The dismantling of governmental infrastructure and the erosion of international relationships pose challenges for any future administration seeking to undo the damage. The long-term effects of these policies could reshape global trade and economic alliances.</p>

While the plot is simple, the movie's greatest strength is its practical effects, which give the Ochi a tangible and lifelike presence. The use of puppetry creates a unique and mythic quality, offering a refreshing contrast to the often anonymous feel of CGI animals.</p>
