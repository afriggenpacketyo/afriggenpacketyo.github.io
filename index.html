          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, marking a potential shift in their strained relationship following deadly border clashes in 2020. Facing economic challenges, including U.S. tariffs, both nations are exploring reluctant cooperation despite deep-seated mistrust and significant trade imbalances favoring China. While experts remain skeptical of a long-term friendship, the summit could signal a mutual willingness to find common ground on economic issues, highlighted by India's heavy reliance on Chinese supply chains for key industries like pharmaceuticals and electric vehicles. The meeting's outcome will indicate the future trajectory of the complex Sino-Indian dynamic.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers previously convicted of charges connected to the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The decision was based on concerns of judicial bias after the original presiding judge allegedly made prejudicial comments suggesting gang infiltration within the police department. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, Jr. were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of civil rights violations causing Nichols' death. This ruling reopens a significant chapter in a case that sparked nationwide protests against police brutality.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged a former Department of Justice employee with misdemeanor assault after he allegedly threw a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington, D.C. The charge was reduced from a felony after a grand jury declined to indict on the more serious count. The incident occurred amidst heightened tensions involving federal officers deployed in the city, with the accused, Sean Charles Dunn, reportedly shouting expletives at the officers before the act. This case marks the second recent instance where prosecutors failed to secure a felony indictment for alleged assault on federal law enforcement in the district.</p>

They argue that public comments from officials, including President Trump who called Abrego Garcia an "animal," are tainting the jury pool and jeopardizing his right to a fair trial on human trafficking charges. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador despite a court order, and the administration has signaled intent to deport him again, this time to Uganda.</p>

His appointment follows the controversial firing of Dr. Susan Monarez and is expected to advance Kennedy's agenda of reshaping federal vaccine policy. O’Neill, who lacks a background in medicine or infectious disease, has previously supported unproven COVID-19 treatments and promoted conspiracy theories, raising significant concerns among public health professionals.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed the media to justify the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating it gives the team a "chance to be a better team." Jones emphasized that acquiring Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark helps address the team's long-standing weakness in stopping the run. In addition to Clark, the Cowboys received two future first-round draft picks, which Jones believes provides valuable assets for strengthening the roster. The move came after stalled contract negotiations, though Jones maintained there were no hard feelings with Parsons.</p>

Advocates for the plus-size community have criticized the change, calling it "heartbreaking" and a reversal of the airline's reputation for accessibility.

The attack, which killed at least 20 people including journalists, has drawn international condemnation. Munitions experts suggest the rapid succession of the final two strikes likely involved at least two tanks firing simultaneously.</p>

The Ministry of Local Government based its claim of significant savings on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN), which projected £2.9 billion in savings over five years. However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the mergers could result in no savings or even cost taxpayers money under certain scenarios.

          <p>A new Texas law, set to take effect on September 1st, restricts individuals and companies from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from buying or renting property, a move officials defend on national security grounds. However, the law has sparked significant backlash from the Chinese-American community and civil rights advocates, who call it discriminatory and compare it to historical exclusion acts. While the law includes exemptions for U.S. citizens, green card holders, and visa-holders purchasing a primary residence, opponents argue it will still lead to unfair scrutiny and have a chilling effect on business investment and immigration in the state.</p>

This article provides a timeline of the key events, which began with controversial nominations and mass layoffs affecting one-fifth of the agency's workforce earlier in the year. The upheaval is largely driven by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>Naomi Osaka has advanced to the third round of the US Open with a decisive 6-3, 6-1 victory, continuing her strong performance on the court. Her recent success follows a controversial final in Montreal, where she was criticized for her runner-up speech, an event she says left her feeling shame and guilt. Despite the off-court difficulties, Osaka has now won eight of her last nine matches and appears to be regaining the form that saw her win two previous US Open titles. She also commented on the recent Jelena Ostapenko controversy, describing Ostapenko's remarks towards Taylor Townsend as ill-timed and particularly hurtful in the context of the sport.</p>

The BBC gathered testimonies from the refugees, who are now with a resistance group, and their relatives in India.

According to officials and parents, older students shielded younger children with their bodies, with one taking a shotgun blast to the back to protect another child. This was partly due to a "buddy system" at the school, where older students are paired with younger ones for events like the school Mass.

          <p>Canadian officials have issued a warning after an angler discovered an unusually large, 26-kilogram grass carp in Lake Huron, highlighting the ongoing threat of this invasive species to the Great Lakes ecosystem. Grass carp are highly destructive, capable of consuming 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, which destroys fish habitats and degrades water quality. While this particular fish was sterile, reproducing populations have already been established in U.S. rivers connected to Lake Erie. Authorities are conducting surveillance and urging the public to report any sightings of the invasive fish and not release them back into the water.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's new film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, with some critics hailing it as a "midlife crisis masterpiece." In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney plays an aging, hugely successful movie star grappling with the personal sacrifices made for his career, a role that draws parallels to his own life. The film follows the character as he abruptly abandons a film shoot to reconnect with his family, forcing his entourage, including a manager played by Adam Sandler, to follow.

          <p>A recent survey of U.S. consumers suggests that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is more likely to dissuade potential buyers than attract them. According to the report from Slingshot Strategies, 35% of respondents said FSD would make them less likely to buy a Tesla, compared to only 14% who said it would make them more likely. The findings present a challenge for Tesla, as CEO Elon Musk has staked the company's future on its autonomous driving capabilities. The survey also revealed that nearly half of consumers believe the technology should be illegal, reflecting public skepticism and a desire for stronger regulation of autonomous vehicles.

The judge stated that Lake was breaking the law in her attempt to remove Abramowitz, as the law is designed to insulate the international broadcaster from political pressure. Because President Trump dismissed most of the panel's members and has not named replacements, the legal requirement for its backing cannot be met. This ruling is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles over Lake's efforts to dismantle VOA and its parent agency.</p>
