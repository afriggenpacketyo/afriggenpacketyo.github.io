          <p>Nineteen states filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order on voting, arguing that it unconstitutionally interferes with state election laws and could disenfranchise millions of voters.  The lawsuit targets provisions requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration and restricting the counting of mailed ballots.  The states argue that these changes are the purview of state legislatures and Congress, not the president.  The lawsuit is one of several legal challenges to the executive order.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while economists often criticize tariffs, a strategic and predictable approach can benefit national interests, particularly regarding production and supply chain resilience.  The author draws parallels to historical figures like Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln who advocated for protectionist trade policies.  While acknowledging the potential downsides of Trump's current tariff policy, the author suggests that some positive signs are emerging, such as increased domestic investment.  However, the author also criticizes the current policy's lack of consistency and predictability.</p>
