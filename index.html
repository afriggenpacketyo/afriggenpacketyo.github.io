          <p>A federal judge has permitted Danish company Orsted to continue building its Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Trump administration's Interior Department had issued a stop-work order on the project, which was already 80% complete and poised to power over 350,000 homes. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry, which it has criticized as being too expensive and unreliable.</p>

          <p>Parents are encountering mixed messages regarding childhood immunizations, leading to confusion and hesitancy in doctors' offices. Recent recommendations from a CDC advisory panel, whose members were appointed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have diverged from long-standing practices on COVID-19, chicken pox, and hepatitis B vaccines. In response, some states are forming coalitions to encourage vaccinations, while others, like Florida, are moving to roll back mandates, creating a fractured public health landscape.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has entered a debate over transgender bathroom policies in Virginia's gubernatorial race, accusing Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger of deflecting questions on the issue. The controversy centers on whether students can use facilities corresponding to their gender identity, a matter under investigation by the Trump administration's Department of Education in five Virginia school districts. This issue previously played a key role in the state's 2021 election, highlighting the continued prominence of "parental rights" in Virginia politics.</p>

Speaking at his party's conference, Davey argued that Reform UK aims to reshape Britain in the mold of "Trump's America," which he characterized as harsh and contrary to British values. He positioned the Liberal Democrats as the true alternative for voters disillusioned with both the Conservative and Labour parties, emphasizing policies on immigration and the cost of living.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, remains a crucial tool for retirees to manage healthcare costs not covered by Original Medicare. In 2025, the average monthly premiums for these plans can vary widely, ranging from as low as $32 for high-deductible options to over $550 for comprehensive coverage, with most beneficiaries paying between $90 and $300. Costs are influenced by factors such as location, age, plan type, and insurer, making it essential for consumers to compare options carefully during enrollment periods. (not investment advice)</p>

The trial has seen U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon frequently admonish Routh for not adhering to judicial rules, and he ultimately chose not to testify himself before closing arguments.</p>

The hearing detailed how the then-underage perpetrator acquired multiple large blades, one of which was found under his bed alongside other weapons. This first phase of the inquiry is examining the killer's history and potential missed opportunities by authorities to prevent the tragic attack on a children's dance workshop.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned White House announcement, medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, are pushing back against the administration's expected claim that acetaminophen use during pregnancy increases autism risk. Kenvue stated that "independent, sound science clearly shows" no causal link, while medical professionals warn that avoiding the drug could lead pregnant women to use riskier alternatives or leave dangerous fevers untreated. The administration is also expected to promote the drug leucovorin as a potential treatment, a claim that scientists say is based on very early-stage research.</p>
