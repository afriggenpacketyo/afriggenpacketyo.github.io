          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 19:16:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent U.S. tariffs are causing significant price increases for imported goods like coffee and tea, placing immense pressure on small businesses. Retailers and importers report that coffee prices have surged, forcing them to either absorb the costs, which slims their already thin margins, or pass the price hikes onto consumers. Business owners express concern that these tariffs disproportionately harm American small businesses, potentially squeezing them out of the market in favor of larger competitors who can better weather the economic strain. The situation highlights the direct impact of trade policy on local economies and consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Attorney General Eric Holder joined House Democrats for a call to discuss the escalating national redistricting battle, focusing on efforts to counter what they term a gerrymandering scheme. The main flashpoint is in Texas, where Republicans are pushing a new congressional map that could significantly increase their majority, prompting state Democrats to flee to prevent a vote. The controversy has national implications, with California's governor threatening to redraw his state's map in retaliation. The situation underscores the intense political maneuvering over electoral maps ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain head coach Luis Enrique made a significant decision by replacing star goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma with newly signed Lucas Chevalier for the Super Cup final. This strategic move reflects a shift towards a modern goalkeeper who is more skilled with ball distribution, a key element of Enrique's playstyle. Despite Donnarumma's crucial role in their Champions League victory, the club is prioritizing a different profile in Chevalier, who is noted for his on-ball ability. Chevalier's debut included a key penalty save in the shootout win against Tottenham after a 2-2 draw.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study suggests that drug treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) offer significant life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. Researchers found that medication is associated with reduced risks of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal activity. The study, which analyzed over 148,000 people in Sweden, provides strong evidence that by mitigating impulsivity and inattention, ADHD drugs can help prevent adverse life events. These findings could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about starting medication, despite ongoing debates about side effects and drug shortages.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization has sparked a significant confrontation, leading to over 700 arrests of supporters, many of whom are elderly. The government justifies the ban by citing millions of pounds in criminal damage and alleged assaults at an Israeli-owned defense firm, framing the group's actions as violent. However, critics, including civil rights advocates and the UN's human rights chief, argue the ban infringes on free speech and protest rights. The future of the ban and the fate of the arrested protesters now hinge on upcoming court battles.</p>

EWS, which is co-owned by seven major U.S. banks, has dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt."

          <p>Nine years after legalizing Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), Canada is grappling with complex ethical questions as demand for the procedure surges beyond all predictions. The country's approach is heavily defined by patient autonomy, where individuals must be aware of other options but are not required to have exhausted them. This places a significant burden on clinicians, who must interpret eligibility criteria that can be subjective, as highlighted by cases where patients with treatable conditions request MAID.

          <p>A new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs' inspector general has found that all VA hospitals are experiencing "severe" staff shortages, with the number of shortages increasing by 50% this fiscal year. The investigation revealed that 94% of facilities face a severe shortage of doctors, while psychology was the most frequently reported clinical staffing shortage. This report comes as the VA is undergoing a department-wide reduction of 30,000 workers, raising concerns among lawmakers that the cuts are exacerbating the crisis and negatively impacting veterans' access to care.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is on track to become the first hurricane of the season, according to forecasters. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands and is moving westward, with models predicting it will strengthen into a major hurricane by the time it nears the Caribbean islands late in the week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, there is uncertainty about its long-term path. The formation of Erin marks the fifth named storm of what is predicted to be an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

The group includes leaders from cartels like Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel, who are wanted for crimes including drug trafficking and murder. This move is part of an increased effort by the new Mexican administration to crack down on powerful criminal networks amid pressure from the Trump administration. U.S. officials praised the collaboration as a key step in dismantling dangerous organizations that bring violence and drugs to both nations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have seen their franchise valuation soar to $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable team in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys. This marks a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was valued at just $930 million. The increase is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's vision and investment in the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium and the surrounding Hollywood Park district. The valuation reflects the team's successful monetization of its new venue and its strong position in the major Los Angeles market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appeals court has denied Tory Lanez's attempt to submit new evidence in his case concerning the 2020 shooting of fellow artist Megan Thee Stallion. Lanez, who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence, sought to introduce a new statement from a security guard, but the petition was rejected. This is the latest failed effort by the rapper to challenge his 2022 felony conviction for assault with a firearm and other charges. The court's decision upholds the previous legal proceedings, and Lanez's main appeal is scheduled for oral argument later in the month.</p>

The city is a brutal frontline in the ongoing war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has maintained a 14-month blockade. Food is so scarce that residents are eating animal feed, and prices have skyrocketed, while a cholera outbreak sweeps through camps for the displaced. International aid organizations have condemned the use of starvation as a weapon of war and are urgently calling for a humanitarian pause to allow aid convoys into the city.</p>
