          <p>President Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss a detailed 21-point plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza, with the White House expressing confidence that both sides will agree. Concurrently, the administration is preparing for a meeting with bipartisan congressional leadership to avert a government shutdown. The White House maintains a firm stance, insisting on a clean continuing resolution and stating there is "nothing to negotiate," placing pressure on Democrats to pass the measure. These discussions occur as the president also announced a new 100% tariff on foreign-made films, adding another layer to a busy policy day.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in nearly two decades, enrollment in Medicare Advantage is expected to fall, with projections showing a drop to 34 million in 2025 from nearly 35 million this year. Health insurers are scaling back unprofitable plans and exiting some markets due to shrinking profits from higher-than-expected medical costs and new regulations. Consequently, seniors may face higher premiums and reduced benefits for 2026 plans, as major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and CVS Health's Aetna adjust their offerings to prioritize profitability over growth. Experts advise beneficiaries to carefully shop around during the upcoming open enrollment period, as relying on previous plans may lead to significant out-of-pocket cost increases.

          <p>President Trump will attend a major meeting of nearly every top U.S. military leader in Quantico, Virginia, an event that has fueled widespread speculation regarding its purpose. While the president described the gathering as a celebratory meeting to boost "esprit de corps" and discuss military successes, its secretive nature has raised concerns. War Secretary Pete Hegseth's push to shrink the general officer corps has led some to believe the meeting could signal mass cuts to senior officer ranks, civilian roles, and contractor positions. The summons has also prompted questions from lawmakers about the high cost and logistical complexity of concentrating so many high-ranking officials in one location.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all foreign-made films and "substantial Tariffs" on furniture produced outside the United States, citing the need to protect domestic industries. In social media posts, he claimed these sectors, particularly in California and North Carolina, have been "stolen" by other countries and that new import duties would reverse this trend. However, the announcements lacked specific details on implementation, timing, or the scope of the countries affected, raising questions about their feasibility and potential economic impact. This is not the first time the president has threatened such tariffs on films, with a similar proposal in May not resulting in any action.</p>

          <p>Iranian authorities have executed a man named Bahman Choobiasl, accusing him of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency by providing information on sensitive telecommunications projects. This execution is part of what human rights activists describe as the largest wave of hangings in Iran in decades, with over 1,000 people reportedly executed in 2025 alone. The event occurs as Iran faces renewed international pressure, with the United Nations and the European Union reimposing sanctions over its nuclear program. Human rights groups and U.N. experts have condemned the staggering scale of executions, which often follow closed-door trials where defendants lack proper legal recourse.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is set to close nearly 20 stores across the Boston area, including its well-known location beneath the steaming kettle sign at Government Center. These closures are a component of the company's broader, billion-dollar turnaround strategy aimed at improving long-term financial performance and operational efficiency. In addition to shuttering underperforming or strategically misaligned stores, the coffee giant also announced the elimination of 900 corporate positions as part of the restructuring. The company stated the changes are necessary to create the physical environment and financial results it expects, impacting both employees and loyal customers in numerous local neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>The forced removal of Southeast Asian refugees with past criminal convictions has surged under the second Trump administration, creating a "ripple effect" of trauma for families and communities. Many of those deported, including Hmong and Laotian individuals, arrived in the U.S. as children fleeing conflict and have since reformed and built lives in America. Advocates argue that these deportations represent a betrayal of U.S. duty to refugees, disproportionately affecting a group that is three to five times more likely to be deported for a prior conviction. The policy rips breadwinners from their families, often sending them to countries they have never known and creating cycles of poverty and emotional distress.</p>

          <p>Albertsons Companies has recalled five of its store-made deli products, including various pasta salads, due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The recall was initiated because the items contain bowtie pasta from a supplier, Nate's Fine Foods, which was itself recalled.

While no illnesses have been reported, listeria can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant individuals, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prospective homebuyers face a mixed landscape this fall, with several factors making it a potentially opportune yet risky time to purchase a home. On the positive side, mortgage rates have recently declined to a three-year low, housing inventory is at its highest since 2020, and the fall season typically sees less buyer competition. However, potential downsides include a smaller selection of homes compared to the peak spring and summer seasons and the possibility that mortgage rates could fall even further following recent Federal Reserve cuts. Experts suggest that while waiting could offer lower rates, it might also bring increased competition, making the current market a "sweet spot" for some buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

She pledged to keep taxes, inflation, and interest rates as low as possible but emphasized that global events and long-term economic damage have constrained the government's options. Reeves stressed a commitment to economic responsibility, subtly criticizing those within her party advocating for looser spending constraints. The chancellor's cautious tone is seen as preparing the public for necessary fiscal tightening to meet self-imposed borrowing rules amid a challenging economic environment.</p>

This move restores a comprehensive embargo that is expected to severely impact Iran's already struggling economy, potentially causing its currency to collapse and exacerbating inflation.

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S., based on signed contracts, saw a solid 4.0% increase in August, surpassing economists' expectations. The National Association of Realtors attributes this rebound to a decline in mortgage rates, which made homeownership more accessible and drew buyers back into the market. Contracts increased in the South, Midwest, and West, though they saw a slight decline in the Northeast. On a year-over-year basis, pending home sales were up 3.8%. While the lower borrowing costs provided a stimulus, analysts caution that a softening labor market could potentially limit further gains in the housing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The publication claims the system's output power and overall structure exceed those of its American counterparts, such as the Helios laser weapon, noting its significantly larger lens aperture. This weapon is expected to complement existing naval air-defence missile systems, enhancing China's naval defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a violent attack on a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, has risen to at least four, with eight others injured. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his vehicle into the church during a Sunday service, opened fire with an assault-style rifle, and set the building on fire. He was subsequently shot and killed by police in the church parking lot eight minutes after the attack began. The FBI is leading the investigation into the incident, which it has described as an "act of targeted violence," though a specific motive remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack stated that the U.S. central bank is facing a difficult challenge in balancing its dual mandate of controlling inflation and protecting employment. Speaking to CNBC, Hammack expressed continued concern about persistent inflation, noting that the Fed has missed its 2% target for over four years and that price pressures remain, particularly in the services sector. Her comments come after a recent Fed interest rate cut and suggest she believes a restrictive policy stance must be maintained to bring inflation back to its goal. She described the current economic environment as a "challenging time," with risks tilted toward higher inflation and weaker employment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a federal government shutdown looming, financial experts are advising affected workers to immediately focus on their cash flow and prepare for delayed or lost income. Hundreds of thousands of employees face the possibility of furloughs, and this year, the Trump administration has also threatened mass layoffs, creating additional uncertainty. Recommendations include conducting a thorough review of all expenses, creating a budget for reduced income, and proactively contacting lenders to inquire about hardship assistance like payment deferrals. Given the unprecedented threat of permanent job loss, workers are also encouraged to research unemployment benefits and options for continuing health coverage.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Electric Vehicle Market Faces Test of 'Natural Demand' as Federal Incentives Expire</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. electric vehicle market is poised for a significant shift as the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for EV purchases expires this week, leading to questions about the true level of "natural demand." Automakers have heavily relied on these incentives to drive sales, which hit record highs in the third quarter as consumers rushed to buy before the deadline. Industry executives from companies like General Motors and Hyundai anticipate a sharp, albeit temporary, drop in EV sales in the coming months. The end of the long-standing federal support will test the market's maturity and reveal whether consumer demand is strong enough to sustain growth without government subsidies.

          <h2>Economists Warn of Billions in Weekly Costs and Shaken Confidence from Potential Government Shutdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 09:12:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a U.S. government shutdown appears increasingly likely, economists estimate the economic cost could be around $7 billion for each week of disruption. The primary impact would be the halt in pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors, but the effects could ripple through the broader economy by delaying federal procurement and services. A shutdown could also undermine investor and consumer confidence at a time when the economy is already facing headwinds from a cooling labor market. Furthermore, a halt in government functions could delay the release of key economic data, such as the upcoming jobs report, complicating the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions.
