          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has initiated a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging defamation and libel. Trump, in a Truth Social post, accused the newspaper of being a "mouthpiece" for the Democratic Party and making false statements about him, his family, and business. This lawsuit, filed in Florida, follows Trump's previous threats and a series of other defamation cases against media companies. The article notes Trump's past legal actions against ABC News, Paramount, and The Wall Street Journal, which resulted in significant settlements.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing for U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit, which is anticipated to offer a distraction from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's mounting domestic issues. The visit will include royal engagements with King Charles III and Queen Camilla, followed by bilateral meetings focused on trade and economic partnerships. Amidst Starmer's low approval ratings and recent cabinet reshuffles, the UK hopes to secure further trade deals and investments, including significant AI and nuclear energy partnerships.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 02:38:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% in April, potentially adding over £500 annually for new state pensioners. This rise is based on the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees the pension increases by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. The Office for National Statistics reported a 4.7% total pay growth for the three months to July, which is likely to be the determining factor. This article also raises concerns that the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds will draw more pensioners into the income tax net. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-awaited "Hillsborough Law" bill, the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, will be introduced to Parliament, compelling public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. This landmark legislation will impose a professional and legal "duty of candour," with criminal sanctions for breaches. Campaigners, including families of the 97 football fans who died at Hillsborough in 1989, have welcomed the move, hoping it will end a "culture of cover-ups" and ensure justice for victims of future state-related tragedies like Grenfell Tower and the Post Office Horizon scandal.</p>

This article discusses the complexities of Ohtani's two-way status under MLB rules, which would mean losing him as a designated hitter if he enters as a reliever. The team is weighing these strategic options as the regular season concludes.</p>

          <p>The University of California President, James B. Milliken, has warned that the Trump administration's $1.2 billion fine against UCLA and proposed overhauls are just a precursor to broader actions across the entire UC system. This article reveals that all ten UC campuses and affiliated hospitals are facing federal investigations, ranging from allegations of illegal race-based admissions to discrimination against Jewish individuals. Milliken expressed concern that substantial federal funding losses, totaling $17 billion annually, could devastate the university, leading to job cuts and reduced access to healthcare and education.
