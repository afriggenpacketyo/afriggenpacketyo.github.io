        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams was awarded €100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC over a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and online article. The court found that Mr. Adams was defamed by allegations that he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, which Mr. Adams denies. The BBC argued that their reporting was fair and reasonable, but the jury sided with Adams after deliberating for nearly seven hours. Adams stated that the case was about holding the BBC accountable for upholding the ethos of the British state in Ireland, and his solicitor criticized the BBC for leaving the false allegation online for nine years, questioning potential political pressure.</p>

          <p>US technology-export restrictions targeting Chinese plane makers will delay China's jet engine indigenization process, according to analysts. The restrictions involve technologies linked to jet engines that could be built for Comac's civilian aircraft. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the US for maliciously blocking and suppressing China, vowing to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. Analysts believe China will now devote more resources to develop a home-grown jet aircraft engine within the next two to three years, potentially slowing down aircraft production in the meantime.</p>

          <p>At least 110 people have died in Nigeria due to floods caused by torrential rain in the central part of the country.

The District Head of Mokwa described the flooding as the worst in 60 years, appealing for government support. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, and authorities warn that many more people are still at risk as the rainy season begins in Nigeria.</p>

The initial trade agreement had reduced tariffs between the two countries, leading to a stock market surge. However, a federal court ruling challenged the legal justification for the tariffs, creating further uncertainty about the future of trade relations between the U.S. and China.

          <p>A report on children's health by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has come under scrutiny after it was found to contain nonexistent studies. The "Make America Healthy Again" report, which cited over 500 studies, included several that appear never to have been published or were misinterpreted. The White House acknowledged the issues and stated that the report would be updated, while maintaining confidence in Kennedy. The report is intended to inform policy recommendations and has a requested $500 million funding boost from Congress.</p>

The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that there is now no functioning hospital in the North Gaza governorate, severing a critical lifeline for the population. The IDF stated it was operating in the area against terror targets, but the charities said the hospital had been under military besiegement.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has launched a federal effort to find the cause of rising autism rates, focusing on environmental toxins. Experts argue that Kennedy is looking in the wrong place, as genetics are the most important driver of autism's development. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, and research is leading to new therapies. Researchers fear that Kennedy's fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of exciting new therapies that could help those with profound autism.</p>

          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs was a victory for the separation of powers and the rule of law. The court found that Trump did not have the authority to impose unlimited tariffs, as the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. The decision imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the tariffs. The administration has appealed the decision, but the ruling highlights the importance of limiting executive power and upholding constitutional principles. (not investment advice)</p>
