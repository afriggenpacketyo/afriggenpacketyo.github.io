          <p>Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani recount the tragic story of their sister, Paloma, who died at 23 after refusing chemotherapy for cancer, a decision they attribute to their mother's anti-medicine conspiracy theories. Kate Shemirani, their mother, gained notoriety during the pandemic for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 and was eventually struck off as a nurse. Paloma's brothers believe that social media companies should take stronger action against medical misinformation, which they say is actively recommended on several major sites. The article highlights the increasing prominence of anti-medicine views and the potential harm they pose to vulnerable individuals influenced by conspiracy theory influencers.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending and troop levels, posing significant challenges for Germany's Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to provide the necessary financial resources to make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional army in Europe, NATO's new guidelines call for member states to spend 5% of their economic output on defense by 2032. This would require Germany to allocate an estimated â‚¬225 billion per year, a substantial increase from its current defense spending. The summit will also address the need for additional troops in Europe, potentially requiring Germany to recruit between 50,000 and 60,000 additional soldiers.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 00:12:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global shipping route. This request follows reports from Iranian state media indicating that parliament has approved a plan to close the Strait, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the Strait for oil imports and warned of severe economic consequences for Iran if it disrupts the oil supply. The US has increased its defense presence in the region in preparation for potential Iranian counterattacks, and any disruption could cause global oil prices to skyrocket. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre, was detained by ICE, leaving her husband to care for their children, including a breastfeeding infant. Paola, a Mexican national, had been seeking a green card when ICE acted on a deportation order from 2018, which she was unaware of. Experts say that the Trump administration's strict immigration enforcement has reduced the discretion previously afforded to military families. While the Marine Corps continues to promote enlistment as a path to immigration benefits, USCIS has referred thousands of cases to ICE for deportation, including those of military families.</p>

          <p>New York City will be using ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate receives a majority. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support and prevents candidates with fringe views from winning in a crowded field, but it also makes races less predictable and requires more research from voters.</p>

The observatory's unique design and location in the Chilean Andes allow it to capture extremely detailed images, which will be used to study dark matter and understand the history of the universe. The UK is a key partner in the survey and will host data centers to process the detailed snapshots.</p>

Tamaki highlighted the heavy toll the battle took on the local population and acknowledged the ongoing discontent over the prefecture's disproportionate burden in hosting U.S. forces.

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that "obliteration" was an accurate description of the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear facilities following recent U.S. strikes, disputing attempts to downplay the extent of the destruction. While military officials confirmed "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, they stopped short of using the term "obliteration." The UN nuclear watchdog chief also indicated that it was too early to assess the damage at Fordo. Reports suggest that some of the highly enriched uranium at Fordo had been moved prior to the strikes. The mission, codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer, involved multiple aircraft and precision-guided weapons.</p>

He believes Iran will respond to the attacks, but in a calculated manner. The professor also suggests that the strikes could impact gas prices, depending on the stock market's reaction. While acknowledging fears of a global conflict, Sadri believes it is unlikely, suggesting the conflict will likely remain regional, limited to Israel and Iran.</p>

However, the ruling does not guarantee his release, as he may be taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody instead. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. Prosecutors allege that he conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status across the U.S., while the defense argues the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case.</p>
