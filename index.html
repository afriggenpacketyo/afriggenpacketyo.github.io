          <p>The Trump administration is at a critical juncture regarding Iran, with U.S. officials indicating that the next 24 to 48 hours will be decisive in determining the path forward. Despite heightened rhetoric and displays of military strength, including claims of complete control over Iranian airspace, the U.S. is assessing whether Iran will return to negotiations and abandon uranium enrichment. If Iran agrees to these terms, a high-level meeting led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and potentially Vice President JD Vance could occur swiftly, however, President Trump's patience is reportedly wearing thin. The U.S. military is repositioning assets in the Middle East to protect American troops and maintain options for assisting Israel. </p>

          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations centre" for the digital yuan in Shanghai, according to Peopleâ€™s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng, to enhance the renminbi's global reach. This initiative is part of eight financial policies announced at the Lujiazui Forum, aimed at promoting Shanghai as a global financial hub. These measures come amid increasing tensions with the United States over trade and technology, accelerating China's efforts to expand the yuan's overseas adoption. The trials will include refinancing schemes using credit-based relending for foreign trade enterprises, cross-border trade refinancing with rediscount support, and an expanded green finance programme. </p>

The announcement will accompany the release of two reviews into HS2, one of which highlights a "litany of failure" contributing to missed deadlines and escalating costs. Conservative governments oversaw a Â£37bn increase in HS2's cost between its approval in 2012 and the recent general election. </p>

He was taken into custody while observing court proceedings, reportedly escorting individuals to prevent ICE arrests, and was later released after New York Gov. Kathy Hochul intervened. Lander claimed his arrest was politically motivated, accusing the Trump administration of targeting Democratic cities and stoking fear among immigrant communities.

Judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals indicated they may have limited power to rule against the president's authority to deploy troops. The Trump administration argued that the deployment was justified due to violent riots and the need to protect federal property, while California contended that the federalization of the National Guard was an unlawful executive action that diverted resources from critical state functions.

This high demand for talent highlights a deepening crunch in the industry, even acknowledged by industry leaders. These soaring wages stand out in a subdued hiring landscape, as China's job market faces pressure from slowing economic growth. </p>

          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could flourish in UK waters due to rising ocean temperatures, as species shift habitats. Researchers at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas. The analysis suggests that many creatures may find new homes in the North Sea, which is expected to become a biodiversity hotspot within the next 50 years. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. </p>

          <p>An Air India flight crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, India, killing all 242 people on board, prompting an investigation into the cause of the disaster. The London Gatwick-bound aircraft, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, experienced a mayday call and loss of altitude just 40 seconds after takeoff. Investigators are examining the wreckage, flight data, and cockpit voice recorders to determine what went wrong, focusing on potential engine failures, flap issues, maintenance errors, or crew actions. The investigation involves triangulation and elimination, matching physical evidence with recorded data to build a coherent understanding of the crash. </p>
