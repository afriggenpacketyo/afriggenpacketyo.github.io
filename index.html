          <h2>South Western Railway Renationalized Under Labour Government</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 20:59:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in railway management. The nationalized service commenced operations with a route from Woking to Surbiton, though partially serviced by a bus. While the government acknowledges this as a "new dawn for rail," they refrained from guaranteeing fare reductions, prioritizing service improvements and infrastructure reinvestment using profits. Concerns from unions regarding outsourcing and opposition from Conservatives highlight the ongoing debate surrounding public versus private sector involvement in the railway system. The integration of SWR into Great British Railways (GBR) is pending parliamentary approval, with Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander emphasizing "great value for money" for passengers despite the lack of fare reduction promises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new policies limiting press access inside the Pentagon, requiring government escorts for reporters in many areas, including offices of top officials. Hegseth, citing national security concerns, argues the restrictions are necessary to protect classified information. The Pentagon Press Association and the National Press Club have condemned the move as an attack on freedom of the press and undermining public trust. The restrictions follow earlier actions by the administration to limit journalist access, including vacating news outlets from dedicated workspaces and revoking the White House Correspondents' Association's media-sharing arrangement. Hegseth previously faced criticism for sharing sensitive military plans on his private phone.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has committed to reinstating winter fuel payments for pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap, challenging Labour's stance on these issues. The party plans to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotel accommodations for asylum seekers. This announcement intensifies the political pressure on Prime Minister Starmer, who has faced criticism from within his own party regarding these policies. The winter fuel payment, which provides up to £300 for pensioners, was previously restricted to those receiving pension credit, while the two-child benefit cap affects approximately 1.5 million families.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, with visitors complaining about the insects landing on food and raising concerns about potential allergic reactions. The midges, believed to be emerging from the Water Plaza, do not bite but can cause asthma and allergic reactions when inhaled. Expo organizers are responding by spraying insecticide, treating rainwater accumulation areas with growth inhibitors, and installing insect repellent lights. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura is collaborating with an insecticide maker to combat the infestation, which is expected to persist until autumn.</p>

          <p>New York City's beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, a number significantly below full staffing levels but an improvement from last year's Memorial Day weekend. The city is actively working to address the years-long lifeguard shortage by increasing hourly wages, offering signing bonuses, and improving lifeguard stations. Despite these efforts, the city may need to reduce pool capacity if staffing doesn't reach required levels. City officials are hopeful that as students finish classes, the lifeguard numbers will increase, emphasizing the importance of beach safety for all visitors.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine conducted another prisoner swap, each side returning 307 soldiers, following a large-scale missile and drone attack on Kyiv. The exchange is viewed as a rare instance of cooperation amid ongoing conflict. Kyiv endured a series of attacks, including a major combined missile and drone assault that injured at least 15 people, followed by additional drone strikes. Ukrainian forces claim to have neutralized a significant number of incoming missiles and drones, but debris from the attacks caused damage in several city districts. The prisoner swap is part of a larger deal involving the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author whose book “Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault” redefined the understanding of sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, has died at 90. Her book, published in 1975, provided a comprehensive history of sexual assault across centuries and examined its use as a military tactic. The book contributed to the rise of anti-sexual assault groups and the rewriting of laws to facilitate prosecution of offenders. Brownmiller's work was both praised and criticized, with some calling it an anti-male polemic.</p>

          <p>President Trump, in his commencement address at West Point, congratulated the cadets and asserted his role in rebuilding the U.S. military. He reiterated his administration's shift away from nation-building and interventionist foreign policy, while also noting that critical race theory would no longer be taught at military academies. The President touted a new peacetime recruiting record and emphasized the importance of focusing the military on crushing adversaries and defending the American flag. This address follows the disbanding of cadet clubs formed around race and gender at West Point, in compliance with the administration's ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has cancelled his summer tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. Joel, 76, is undergoing physical therapy and hopes to return to performing in the future. NPH involves the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to symptoms that can be mistaken for normal signs of aging or other conditions like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The condition is treatable with surgery to drain the excess fluid, and early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve a patient's quality of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of driving lessons is increasing, causing financial strain for learners who find it essential for work, family, and care responsibilities. Rising costs, sometimes exceeding £40 per hour, force learners to cut back on other expenses or take lessons less frequently, prolonging the learning process. The practical test backlog exacerbates the issue, requiring learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills while waiting for an available test date. Driving instructors justify the price increases due to their own rising expenses, such as fuel, insurance, and car maintenance, leading to a situation where learners struggle to afford the lessons they need.</p>

          <p>Young men in the U.S. are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches that promote a virile, traditional form of masculinity. These churches, particularly those within the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), appeal to men who feel uneasy with modern American life and seek a more defined gender role. This trend is reflected in the growth of ROCOR congregations and the popularity of online figures like Father Moses McPherson, who champions a masculine lifestyle. Converts often embrace traditional values, such as home-schooling and prioritizing family over career, and express concerns about perceived negative views of men in society.</p>
