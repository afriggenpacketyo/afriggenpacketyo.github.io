          <p>The People's Liberation Army Navy is celebrating its 76th anniversary with public open day events across multiple Chinese coastal cities, displaying over 30 active-duty warships for public tours. This event marks the largest and most diverse of its kind, featuring vessels involved in international missions like escort operations and joint exercises. Notably, the Type 075 amphibious assault ship Hainan is open to the public for the first time on the mainland, a 40,000-tonne vessel designed for amphibious operations, especially concerning potential conflicts involving Taiwan. The Hainan can carry up to 30 rotary-wing aircraft and is crewed by approximately 1,100 sailors.</p>

          <p>Shota Imanaga allowed three home runs over 5-2/3 innings, giving up five runs in total, as the Chicago Cubs outslugged the Los Angeles Dodgers in a dramatic 11-10 walk-off victory in 10 innings. Despite a shaky start, Imanaga expressed gratitude to his teammates for their run support, which helped him last five innings. Seiya Suzuki contributed with a two-run double, while Shohei Ohtani remained hitless in two games since returning from paternity leave. The Cubs rallied late, with Miguel Amaya hitting a game-tying home run in the ninth and Ian Happ securing the win with a single in the 10th.</p>

          <p>Gunmen opened fire on tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir, resulting in at least 26 deaths and 17 injuries, marking the worst civilian attack in the region in years. The assault occurred in Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination, and has been attributed to rebels by police, sparking widespread condemnation. This incident coincides with U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to India, prompting him to denounce the violence. The attack raises concerns about the impact on Kashmir's tourism industry and comes as India prepares to inaugurate a new railway line aimed at boosting economic development in the region, which has been disputed by India and Pakistan for decades.</p>

          <p>The UK government's borrowing exceeded expectations due to increased spending on pay and benefits, with borrowing reaching £151.9bn in the year to March, £20.7bn higher than the previous year. This figure surpasses the official forecast of £137.3bn, prompting concerns about potential spending cuts and tax rises to adhere to fiscal rules. The increased borrowing coincides with Chancellor Rachel Reeves attending IMF and World Bank meetings to address trade tariffs and promote economic growth. While government income from taxation has increased, expenditure has risen more due to inflation-related costs.</p>

          <p>Four Czech soldiers will stand trial for alleged crimes related to the 2018 death of an Afghan soldier who was detained and interrogated. The charges include extortion, insubordination, violation of guard duty obligations, and failure to provide aid. The accusations stem from the death of 19-year-old Wahidullah Khan, who was detained after an attack on troops at the Shindand base in Afghanistan. The New York Times reported that Khan was beaten after being taken into custody by U.S. and Czech troops and died shortly afterward.</p>

Organizations like the International Leprosy Mission are working to raise awareness and provide medical assistance and microcredit to patients.

          <p>The world's coral reefs are experiencing the most severe bleaching event on record, with 84% of them now affected due to rising ocean temperatures driven by climate change. This crisis, the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, is more intense than the 2014-17 episode, which impacted approximately two-thirds of global reefs. Coral bleaching occurs when colorful algae are expelled from corals due to warming waters, leading to increased risk of disease and starvation.
