          <p>Sudan's army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, toured the recaptured presidential palace in Khartoum, declaring the capital free from Rapid Support Forces (RSF) control.  The army's swift advance follows the recapture of state institutions, marking a significant achievement but not ending the ongoing war.
