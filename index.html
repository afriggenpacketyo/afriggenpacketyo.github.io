          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, was convicted of second-degree depraved-heart murder for providing his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming drugs that ultimately led to her death. Harris's mother, Tina, became suspicious of Ryan after he admitted to noticing Sarah when she was only 14 and later provided her with surgical anesthetics like propofol and ketamine. Sarah became chemically dependent on Ryan, who prosecutors argued sought to control her through the drugs, which he sometimes administered while she was asleep. The jury found Ryan guilty based on incriminating texts and photos taken by Harris's sister, Rachel, leading to a 45-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remained steady at 6.76%, close to the highest levels of the year, according to Freddie Mac. This rate, while stable from the previous week, is lower than the 7.09% average from a year ago. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors like global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. High mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish start to the spring home-buying season, as existing home sales declined in March, marking the largest monthly drop since November 2022.</p>

Opanowski recounts her experience of being brutally attacked by her ex-boyfriend, Shawn Doyle, when she was 18 years old, including Doyle cutting off her ponytail and holding scissors to her throat. Opanowski didn't press charges at the time but later learned that Doyle murdered Lori Leonard, a mother of two, and decided to testify against him. Her testimony, along with that of another woman Doyle had attacked, was crucial in securing Doyle's conviction for Leonard's murder, with prosecutors arguing it demonstrated his pattern of violence. Opanowski now speaks out to encourage others to recognize warning signs and seek help, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and speaking up about concerning behavior.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, amounting to $26 billion, due to reduced oil prices and production.

Despite the profit dip, Aramco increased its first-quarter base dividend by 4.2% year-on-year to $21.1 billion, while cutting its performance-linked dividend payout for the fourth quarter of 2024 to $200 million, a figure repeated for the first quarter of this year.</p>

          <p>The recent appointment of several individuals with business backgrounds to top cabinet positions in Germany's new government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has raised concerns about potential lobbying influences. Critics point to the new minister of economic affairs and energy, Katherina Reiche, and the minister for digitalization and state modernization, Karsten Wildberger, as examples of individuals with close ties to industry.

          <p>Cuts to USAID funding by the Trump administration are having catastrophic consequences on healthcare in Africa, leading to HIV patients losing access to medication and the halt of essential healthcare programs. The funding cuts, which include a 90% reduction in foreign contracts and grants, could result in millions of additional deaths from treatable diseases, particularly impacting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs. Organizations like Amref Health Africa have experienced significant budget losses, forcing them to cancel educational programs and reduce critical screenings, while the lack of US support is also disrupting vaccine initiatives and water supply systems, undoing years of progress in disease prevention.</p>

          <p>Ordinary Kashmiris are bearing the brunt of the conflict between India and Pakistan, with an old-fashioned artillery battle along the Line of Control impacting villages and towns. Despite a ceasefire agreement, tensions remain high, and community leaders have reported multiple deaths due to shelling. The fighting was triggered by a terrorist attack on the Indian side of Kashmir, reigniting long-simmering hostilities and causing widespread fear and displacement among the local population, who have little say in their own fate.</p>

          <p>The British government is implementing new immigration plans to deport migrants who commit crimes, making it harder for lawyers to use human rights laws to prevent deportations. The Home Office will be informed of all foreign nationals convicted of any offense, granting officials broader powers to remove them from the UK. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper asserts that these rules are essential to regain control and end the chaos left by previous administrations, while critics question the effectiveness of the new measures.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from the trade war. President Trump hailed initial conversations as a success, but economists remain skeptical that a quick deal is likely. The tariffs have effectively cut off trade between the worldâ€™s two largest economies, leading to warnings about slowed global growth and inflation, potentially tipping the United States into a recession.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that being a perfect mother is harmful and that flaws are an essential part of a mother's job. She encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that they are good enough, highlighting the importance of children learning that flaws are okay and to accept their own. She also acknowledges the historical tendency of psychiatrists to blame mothers for their children's problems and emphasizes the need to give mothers the credit they deserve.</p>
