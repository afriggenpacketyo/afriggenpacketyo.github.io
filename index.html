            <p>The Supreme Court intervened to temporarily block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act. This action came in response to an emergency appeal by the ACLU, which argued that the immigrants were being denied due process and faced imminent removal to El Salvador. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented from the order. The ACLU argued that the government was attempting to circumvent previous court rulings requiring a fair hearing before deportation. This decision highlights ongoing legal battles surrounding immigration policies and the rights of detainees.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point, reflecting widespread discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a recent CNBC survey. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have grown increasingly pessimistic about the economy under his leadership. The survey reveals that Americans disapprove of tariffs and are concerned about a potential recession. Despite these economic concerns, congressional preference remains relatively unchanged, with a slight edge for Democratic control. (not investment advice)</p>

Advocates argue that expanding coal mining without adequate health and safety protections is counterproductive and endangers miners.

            <p>Pakistan has deported over 19,500 Afghans this month, as part of a larger effort to expel undocumented individuals. The Pakistani government cites national security concerns and pressure on public services as reasons for the deportations. Many of those expelled claim to have been born in Pakistan, raising concerns about their integration into Afghanistan. The deportations have prompted discussions between Pakistani and Taliban officials, with the latter expressing concern over the situation.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to make it easier to fire thousands of federal workers by stripping them of civil service protections. The proposed "Schedule Policy/Career" classification would affect approximately 50,000 federal employees. The White House claims this move aims to improve accountability and root out corruption, while critics argue it could lead to political interference and undermine the independence of the civil service. For the change to happen, Trump will need to sign an executive order after OPM issues a final rule.</p>

However, his anti-Israel stance could pose challenges given New York's large Jewish population.</p>

            <p>A columnist argues that the rise of populism is fueled by wealth and financial security, rather than poverty. Voters with financial security are more willing to take political risks and support radical right-wing policies that promise to cut taxes and reduce regulations. This new social contract favors affluent baby boomers who want to be left alone by the government. Academics have linked financial security to a reduced risk aversion, making voters more tolerant of political risks.</p>
