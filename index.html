          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from April's downturn, fueled by optimism surrounding potential trade discussions between the U.S. and China, according to a New York Times article. The S&P 500 has nearly erased losses incurred after President Trump's tariff announcements earlier in April, with a stronger-than-expected jobs report further boosting investor confidence. While the prospect of talks has eased some anxiety, the article notes that the market remains sensitive to the economic consequences of the Trump administration's policies, including tariffs on various imports. The article concludes by emphasizing the uncertainties surrounding trade and economic growth, as well as the potential for further market volatility depending on how the trade situation develops.

          <p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and executive chairman, intends to sell up to 25 million shares of Amazon stock over the next year, a stake worth approximately $4.8 billion, according to a CNBC article. This decision follows Amazon's recent first-quarter earnings report, which exceeded expectations in profit and revenue but fell short in operating income forecasts due to uncertainty about tariffs. Bezos' previous stock sale occurred last year, where he offloaded about $13.5 billion worth of shares, marking his first sale of company stock since 2021. Since stepping down as CEO, Bezos has focused on his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his climate fund, using Amazon share sales to fund these ventures.</p>
