          <p>Military forces from Thailand and Cambodia engaged in an exchange of fire along a contested section of their border, with each nation accusing the other of initiating the conflict. The clash occurred near the Ta Muen Thom temple, a site of recent heightened tensions. The Thai military reported that at least two of its soldiers were injured and claimed Cambodia had deployed a surveillance drone before the engagement. This incident marks a significant escalation in what has become the worst bilateral relations between the two countries in over a decade.</p>

          <p>During a summit with European Union leaders, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the need for enhanced communication and cooperation between the two global powers. Describing China and the EU as "two big guys" on the world stage, Xi called for a stable relationship to provide more certainty to the world. The meeting marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, a milestone that Xi noted was a critical juncture for both sides to make strategic choices that foster mutual respect and win-win outcomes amid ongoing trade disagreements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's ruling that President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel found the proposed interpretation, which would deny citizenship to many individuals born in the United States, to be in conflict with the Constitution. This ruling represents another significant legal obstacle for the administration's policy, which challenges the principle established in the 14th Amendment. The case is now expected to continue its path toward the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>In a move that challenges long-standing norms respecting the central bank's independence, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve. The visit is the first of its kind by a U.S. president in nearly two decades and is viewed as a significant escalation of his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has been openly critical of Powell's refusal to lower interest rates, and this direct visit to the chairman's domain is a remarkable symbolic gesture against the institution's political insulation.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet Public Health suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day is linked to significant health benefits, including a reduced risk of dementia, heart disease, and cancer. Researchers argue this is a more realistic and evidence-based target for the public than the widely-known 10,000-step goal, which originated from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. The findings could encourage more people to adopt step-tracking as a practical way to improve their long-term health and well-being.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed three executive orders as part of a new AI Action Plan designed to accelerate U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence by removing regulations and promoting exports. A key order targets what the administration calls "woke Marxist lunacy," requiring that any AI models receiving federal funding must be politically neutral and free of "ideological dogmas" like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The plan aims to streamline the construction of data centers and turn the U.S. into an "AI export powerhouse."</p>

          <p>The U.S. has concluded new trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will apply a 19 percent tariff on imports from those countries while exempting American exports from any duties. Analysts view this as an indirect strategy to reshape regional supply chains and counter China's economic influence, particularly by gaining access to rare earth mineral reserves. However, the impact may be blunted as many Chinese companies have already shifted production to facilities within Southeast Asian nations. (not investment advice)</p>

By evening, firefighters had successfully stopped the fire's forward spread and established a containment line, allowing the freeway to reopen as mop-up operations continued through the night.</p>

The surge is a result of a sweeping mandate to crack down on illegal immigration, although the number remains far below the administration's stated target of one million annual deportations, highlighting the operational challenges of such a goal.

A notable increase in housing inventory nationally is giving buyers more options, though record-high median sale prices persist, partly due to current homeowners being locked into low mortgage rates. For prospective buyers, experts recommend targeting homes that have been on the market for longer or seeking out properties that require renovations in desirable neighborhoods.
