          <p>This article explores the growing popularity of 'slow TV,' which features long, uninterrupted nature livestreams. The shows provide viewers with a calming contrast to the fast pace of modern life, allowing for reflection and relaxation. Examples include streams of elk migrations in Sweden and stork nests in England, attracting millions of viewers. Educators are also using these streams as tools to teach children about nature, social interaction, and environmental awareness, fostering a deeper connection with the natural world and inspiring conservationist attitudes. The trend highlights the positive impact of nature-focused content on well-being. </p>

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has classified the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party as a right-wing extremist organization. This decision follows a comprehensive review and a 1,100-page report, stating that the AfD's conception of the German people based on ethnicity and ancestry is incompatible with the country's democratic order. The agency noted that the AfD does not consider citizens with a "migration background from predominantly Muslim countries" as equal members of German society. While the AfD is likely to challenge the designation in court, it could lower the threshold for monitoring the party. </p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, according to flash data from Eurostat, missing economists' expectations for a decrease. Core inflation, excluding volatile food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco prices, accelerated to 2.7%. Services inflation also increased to 3.9%. Economists suggest the rise in services inflation is likely due to Easter timing effects, which are expected to reverse in the coming months. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to remain data-dependent when making interest rate decisions, with the possibility of further rate cuts in the future. </p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order seeking to cut federal funding for NPR and PBS, accusing the broadcasters of biased coverage and "left-wing propaganda."

In a close parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby, Reform secured a narrow victory, highlighting their growing influence. The party has also achieved strong results in mayoral contests, securing a substantial share of the vote. These results indicate that Reform is translating opinion poll figures into actual votes and posing a challenge to the established political order.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order aimed at blocking all federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR). The order alleges that both organizations have engaged in "biased and partisan news coverage." It directs the Corporation of Public Broadcasting to "cease direct funding" to the news organizations. The White House claims that funding of news media is "outdated and unnecessary" and that the media landscape has become more "diverse." However, the CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027.</p>

Economists expect the U.S. to have added 133,000 jobs in April, a slowdown from the previous month. The data arrives after a report showed the U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter of 2025, influenced by tariff-related uncertainty. Despite this, the labor market has remained strong, with a robust average of 170,000 jobs added each month this year.

The blockade has prevented essential goods, including food, fuel, and medicines, from entering Gaza, leading to critical shortages. The UN's World Food Programme and Unrwa have already exhausted their food aid stocks. There is growing international pressure on Israel to lift the blockade, with warnings that mass starvation could be imminent and that intentionally starving civilians is a war crime.

          <p>Kellyanne Conway, in an opinion piece, critiques the Democratic Party's actions and rhetoric in 2025. She asserts that the party is out of touch with most Americans and has failed to address key issues such as border security, tax cuts, and energy independence. Conway highlights specific instances where Democrats have allegedly alienated voters and engaged in divisive behavior. She argues that the party is more focused on the 2028 presidential election than on helping the country in 2025. </p>

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the mission, accused Israel of being behind the attack, stating that the ship was targeted while attempting to challenge Israel's blockade of Gaza. The Maltese government confirmed that everyone aboard the ship is safe and that a fire onboard was brought under control. The NGO has called for Israeli ambassadors to be summoned to answer for the alleged violation of international law.</p>

          <p>New tariffs are set to increase the cost of goods from Chinese online shopping giants Shein and Temu. Starting Friday, American shoppers will pay import duties on their orders from China, as the U.S. government ends a legal loophole that exempted tariffs on low-value packages. The Trump administration says the move is to counter fentanyl trafficking. The change will require importers to fill out more detailed information, potentially causing delays in international shipping. While the new rules mean new duties and lots of paperwork, it could also help with drug enforcement.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks is gaining traction, boosted by support from President Trump and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Recent stock trades by lawmakers around tariff announcements have raised concerns about insider trading. Several proposals aim to prevent lawmakers and their spouses from trading individual stocks, requiring them to shift to blind trusts or mutual funds. While some argue that current disclosure rules are sufficient, proponents believe a ban is necessary to address potential conflicts of interest and maintain public trust. </p>

          <p>This article examines the reasons behind the shift of Asian American voters in Nevada toward President Trump. Many Asian Americans in the state support Trump's stance on illegal immigration and his rejection of diversity initiatives. Economic issues, such as gas prices and the cost of housing, also play a significant role in their voting decisions. While some Asian Americans express concerns about Trump's deportation policies, others believe his policies are fair and necessary for upholding the law. The shift in Nevada reflects a broader trend of Asian American voters moving toward Trump nationally.</p>

          <p>China's Labour Day holiday is seeing a surge in inbound travel, suggesting a positive trend for spending. Inbound travel bookings have increased significantly compared to the previous year, driven by relaxed visa policies and improved travel services. Domestic tourism is also experiencing modest growth. However, initial data indicates that box office sales are falling short of previous years, contrasting with the positive travel demand. The rise in inbound travel is attributed to efforts to boost domestic spending amid trade tensions with the United States.</p>

Petrelintide is an amylin analog, a nascent form of weight loss treatment with potentially superior tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to GLP-1 drugs. The deal will see the two companies co-develop petrelintide as both a standalone treatment and as a combo-therapy with Roche's lead incretin asset CT-388. (not investment advice)</p>
