            <p>Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian announced the airline will not expand flight capacity in the second half of 2025 due to disappointing bookings attributed to President Trump's trade policies, which he described as detrimental to consumer and corporate confidence. This decision follows a cut in Delta's first-quarter earnings outlook due to weaker-than-expected travel demand. While international and premium travel remain resilient, main cabin bookings have declined, and companies are reevaluating business trips. Delta's second-quarter revenue is projected to either decline by up to 2% or grow by the same amount, and the company is unable to reaffirm its 2025 financial guidance.</p>

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs on imports, including a significant 104% on goods from China, have come into effect, heightening fears of a global trade war. While the White House suggests these tariffs aim to initiate negotiations with trading partners, China has vowed to retaliate. The tariffs have already impacted financial markets, with mixed results across different Asian exchanges. The EU is also considering its response to the new levies. Trump stated that the U.S. is working on 'tailored deals' with allies and hinted at major tariffs on pharmaceuticals soon.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade policies are based on the belief that trade deficits equate to losses for the US, leading to tariffs determined by the size of bilateral trade deficits. This approach is criticized by economists for ignoring the benefits of imports and the US advantage in service exports. Concerns are raised about the impact on supply chains, workforce needs, business confidence, and currency strength. The article highlights potential problems with Trump's strategy, such as increased costs for US manufacturers using imported parts, the need for more manufacturing workers, and the uncertainty created by the policy's chaotic rollout.</p>

            <p>US government bonds are experiencing a significant sell-off due to growing panic over Donald Trump's escalating tariff war with China, suggesting a loss of investor confidence in the US economy. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose sharply, and the 30-year yield briefly exceeded 5%. Analysts suggest the Federal Reserve may need to intervene with an emergency interest rate cut. Global stock markets are also experiencing turbulence, with major markets in Europe and Asia slumping, though Chinese markets rose after government intervention. China has promised further countermeasures in response to the tariffs.</p>

            <p>President Trump's latest tariffs against America's trading partners have taken effect, imposing additional taxes on imported goods, including a 104% tariff on Chinese products. Trump claims tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but economists warn that the move could harm the world economy and push up prices for consumers. The tariffs are intended to reduce the trade deficit and encourage US consumers to buy American-made goods. However, some countries, including the UK, have had tariffs applied even though they buy more from the US than they sell to it.</p>

            <p>Vice President JD Vance has publicly criticized Senator Mitch McConnell's vote against confirming Elbridge Colby as undersecretary of defense for policy, calling it an act of 'political pettiness'. Colby was ultimately confirmed in a 54-45 vote, with McConnell being the only Republican senator to vote against him. McConnell stated Colby's record suggests a willingness to discount the complexity of challenges facing America, the critical value of allies and partners, and the urgent need to invest in hard power to preserve American primacy.

Policymakers acknowledged increased economic uncertainty and concerns that new import taxes would raise inflation while curbing demand and growth. The Fed had anticipated slightly slower growth and higher inflation, but Trump's more aggressive levies have since heightened market concerns. Investors now expect the Fed to cut rates more aggressively this year. The minutes are expected to provide details on staff forecasts and scenarios under consideration.</p>

            <p>Experts told the Guardian that mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) portend a future with more infectious disease outbreaks, chronic conditions and a widening gulf in health between the most affluent and vulnerable. The Trump administration’s multi-pronged attacks on American science represent a generation-defining experience, a new chapter in the “boom and bust” cycle of health funding, and a masterclass in branding, as Donald Trump and secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr dismantle institutions in the name of improving them. All experts the Guardian spoke with expected an increase in infectious disease outbreaks from bird flu and emerging diseases abroad, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would no longer have capacity to investigate, to HIV, syphilis, measles and tuberculosis.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is being criticized for ignoring the threat of far-right terrorism in its intelligence assessments, focusing instead on criminal organizations and jihadist groups. This omission is seen as a reflection of Trump's support for certain political terrorists and political violence. The move is criticized for leaving the US vulnerable to attacks from far-right extremists and undermining efforts to counter this threat. The Trump administration is also shifting resources away from counterterrorism and toward strategic competition with countries like China and Russia.</p>
