          <p>Russia launched a prolonged 12-hour air assault on Ukraine, utilizing hundreds of drones and missiles. The attack resulted in at least four fatalities in Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl, and injured dozens more across several regions. In response, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy called for stronger international pressure on Moscow, while neighboring Poland temporarily closed its airspace. The article also notes other developments, including NATO increasing its presence in the Baltic Sea following drone incidents and the International Paralympic Committee lifting its ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes.</p>

          <p>Soaring home prices, which have risen over 50% since 2020, are compelling more Americans, particularly younger generations, to purchase property with friends or relatives. This trend of co-buying helps individuals overcome the significant financial advantage that couples have in the housing market and provides a solution to the shortage of smaller, more affordable homes. Beyond the financial benefits, many are also motivated by the desire for companionship and community, choosing to build intertwined lives while navigating the challenges of modern homeownership.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan support in Congress for a permanent solution for DACA recipients, Republican lawmakers are deferring to President Trump to initiate negotiations. As the administration intensifies its deportation efforts, concerns are growing for the nearly half a million individuals protected by the program, some of whom have already been detained. While some representatives advocate for a legislative fix, key senators believe border enforcement remains the priority, pushing any potential DACA resolution further down the road.</p>

Authorities have closed several airports and recalled fishing boats to harbor in preparation for the typhoon's impact.

          <p>Moldova is holding a high-stakes parliamentary election that is widely seen as a referendum on the nation's geopolitical future, choosing between closer integration with the European Union or returning to Russia's sphere of influence. The election is marked by tension, with President Maia Sandu accusing Russia of "massive interference" and attempting to destabilize the country. Ahead of the vote, two pro-Russian parties were disqualified over claims of illegal financing, adding to the charged atmosphere as polls suggest the ruling pro-EU party could lose its majority.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of electronic identity cards, after a previous proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data privacy concerns. The revised plan makes the digital ID system entirely optional and state-run, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue it will streamline many online transactions and bureaucratic processes, from signing contracts to age verification. Despite Switzerland's strong tradition of privacy protection, recent polls suggest voters may be more open to the idea this time.</p>

          <p>A long-running and violent feud between two of Scotland's most prominent crime families, the Lyons and the Daniels, has taken a global turn with the recent arrest of four key figures in Dubai.

This rivalry, which dates back over two decades and has resulted in multiple murders, highlights how organized crime groups have internationalized their operations.

          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team, Newcastle United has struggled to convert set-piece opportunities into goals this season, a point of focus for manager Eddie Howe. The club recently hired a dedicated set-piece coach, Martin Mark, from the Danish club Midtjylland, known for its dead-ball prowess. While there has been a noticeable shift in tactics, such as an increase in long throws, the results have yet to materialize. This analysis contrasts Newcastle's performance with that of their upcoming opponents, Arsenal, who have been highly effective from set-pieces this season.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's contentious claims about autism, this opinion piece highlights several positive traits often associated with autistic individuals that stand in stark contrast to the former president's character. The author points to the capacity for deep focus, adherence to facts and logic, and a profound sense of empathy and social justice as valuable qualities. The article argues that framing autism as a tragedy to be "cured" is deeply problematic and ignores the unique strengths and perspectives that autistic people contribute to humanity.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking a significant step to acknowledge a dark chapter in its history by unveiling a new monument commemorating the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre. During the incident, a mob of white miners killed 28 Chinese laborers and burned down their community. The new seven-foot-tall bronze statue and recent archaeological digs at the site of the former Chinatown represent a growing effort by the town to confront its violent, anti-immigrant past. The commemoration has also brought together descendants of the victims, many of whom were previously unaware of their connection to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Prices for hairy crabs, a popular seasonal delicacy in China, are significantly lower this year due to weak consumer demand and a sluggish economy. Ahead of the "super golden week" holiday, a key period for consumption, retail prices have dropped, and industry insiders predict they will fall further. This trend reflects broader consumption doldrums in the country, with households tightening their spending. The holiday period is being closely watched as a test of the strength of domestic demand across various sectors of the Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>
