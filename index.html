            <p>Christians in Nigeria face ongoing violence and persecution from Islamist militants, particularly in the Middle Belt region, where attacks have led to numerous deaths and displacement. Jeff King of International Christian Concern describes the situation as a "genocide," citing the calculated efforts by Fulani militants to displace Christians from their land. Reports detail attacks on Christian communities, including killings and the burning of homes and churches, with little government intervention. The U.S. State Department expresses concern and urges the Nigerian government to address the root causes of the violence and protect its citizens, and International Christian Concern is calling upon the State Department to list Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC).</p>

            <p>A report by the Atlantic Council cautions the United States against complacency in the global technology race with China, particularly in engaging with developing countries in the Global South. The report emphasizes that developing countries will play a crucial role in advanced technology in the coming decades, and their ties with China are likely to strengthen. Failure to actively engage with the Global South could allow China to advance its geopolitical, economic, and technological interests, shaping global technological norms and standards to the detriment of the U.S. and its allies.</p>

            <p>A former member of the Deepwater Horizon inquiry commission warns that the Trump administration's cuts to science, environmental, and safety agencies are increasing the risk of environmental disasters. The dismantling of regulations and the rollback of safety measures, including those related to offshore drilling, disregard the lessons learned from past crises like the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills. These actions undermine protections for clean air and water and jeopardize the ability to respond effectively to future crises. The administration's claims of reducing bureaucratic burdens are misleading, shifting the burden of risk onto communities and ordinary Americans.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its conflict with universities, exemplified by its actions against Harvard University, which refused to comply with demands for government oversight of hiring, admissions, and curriculum. Critics view this as part of a broader authoritarian effort to undermine higher education and control the populace's access to independent thought. The administration's actions include freezing grants and contracts to institutions and demanding the dismantling of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. This move is seen as a continuation of a long-standing conservative war against academia, reminiscent of McCarthyism, and represents a threat to academic freedom and democracy.</p>

            <p>Chris Whipple, known for his White House insights, reverses his previous positive portrayal of Joe Biden in his new book, "Uncharted," detailing Biden's mental and physical decline during the 2024 election cycle. Whipple's account, supported by sources like Ron Klain, depicts Biden as exhausted, out of touch, and ultimately responsible for his disastrous debate performance that led to his withdrawal from the race. The book also critiques Kamala Harris's campaign, suggesting her lack of authenticity contributed to her loss to Donald Trump. Whipple's shift in perspective highlights the dramatic turn of events leading to the Democratic nomination of Kamala Harris.</p>

            <p>In an era of constant political news and information overload, it's essential to strategically manage attention to preserve moral engagement, according to a Vox advice column. The column suggests reclaiming "attentional sovereignty" by intentionally limiting news intake and investing in activities that train moral attention, such as reading literature or meditating. It differentiates between empathy, which can lead to burnout, and compassion, which fosters positive feelings and motivates action. The article recommends practicing compassion through techniques like Tonglen meditation to stay present with suffering and enhance the capacity for moral attention.</p>

People living with HIV consistently report chaos and confusion as they struggle to access their medication, with many falling ill due to lack of treatment. Clinics funded by the U.S. have closed, leaving patients without medication and basic food, with several individual stories illustrating the struggles and fears of those affected, including a 10-year-old girl, a house painter, and a teenager.

The manifesto's author, Ted Kaczynski, targeted corporate executives to create a media spectacle, a tactic that bears similarities to Mangione's actions. Kaczynski's critique of technology and modern society continues to resonate with various groups, from green anarchists to neo-Nazis, due to his defiance of easy categorization and the flexibility of his ideas. While Kaczynski never expressed remorse for his violent acts, his manifesto remains a subject of debate and fascination.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan will not include security issues in trade talks with the United States, despite President Trump's calls to reduce the U.S.'s burden in defending Japan. Ishiba emphasized that security and trade should be addressed separately, focusing on security matters without linking them to tariffs. This statement comes after a close aide to Ishiba met with Trump and U.S. officials regarding recently increased levies.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, warned against repeating the tariff mistakes of the Great Depression era amidst escalating trade tensions between the two countries. Xie referenced ancient Chinese medicine philosophy, advocating for addressing the root causes of economic issues rather than merely treating the symptoms. He specifically cited the Smoot-Hawley Act as a cautionary example of protectionist policies that worsened the Great Depression, emphasizing the importance of joint efforts to foster global economic growth.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point amid discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. Economic optimism has waned, with a growing pessimism about the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are increasingly negative about his economic policies. The public disapproves of tariffs and inflation, with a majority believing a recession is imminent or already underway.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine, but its sincerity is questioned due to the short notice and ongoing conflict. Ukraine alleges that Russian forces continued isolated attempts to advance despite the ceasefire, while Russia accuses Ukraine of violations. The truce is viewed with skepticism, potentially aimed at improving relations with the Trump administration amid growing impatience from American officials regarding progress in Ukraine. This move may be an attempt by the Kremlin to portray Russia as committed to peace while blaming Kyiv for continued fighting.</p>
