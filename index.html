OpenAI stated that there was a full recovery in the API at 3:24 p.m. EDT, but the status still showed degraded performance, with the company monitoring the situation and working towards a full recovery of ChatGPT for all users.

          <p>President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in disagreement regarding a recent phone call, with Trump asserting he spoke to Newsom for about 16 minutes on Saturday to address the Los Angeles riots. Trump stated he urged Newsom to "get his ass in gear" and stop the riots, even providing a screenshot as evidence of the call. However, Newsom denies the call ever took place, claiming there was "no call, not even a voicemail," and criticizing Trump for deploying Marines without knowing who he is talking to. This dispute has escalated tensions between the two leaders amidst ongoing anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is requesting a federal judge to promptly block President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration raids. State Attorney General Rob Bonta argues that a temporary restraining order is needed to prevent immediate harm to the state, asserting that the deployments threaten state sovereignty and escalate tensions. Newsom emphasizes that sending trained warfighters onto the streets is unprecedented and threatens democracy, while Trump defends the deployments as necessary to prevent Los Angeles from burning. The lawsuit alleges that Trump acted unlawfully by federalizing the California National Guard without Newsom's consent.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig is set to rule on the press freedom of the right-wing extremist magazine 'Compact,' which was banned in 2024 but later allowed to republish after winning an appeal. The magazine was initially banned for inciting hatred against Jews, people with migrant backgrounds, and the country's parliamentary democracy. The court will determine whether the ban violates Article 5 of the Basic Law, which guarantees freedom of speech and the press, while also considering limits on speech that include provisions for the protection of young persons and their right to personal honor. The trial is expected to define the boundaries of press freedom in Germany.</p>

As the AI assistant evolves, Starbucks plans to automate IT ticketing for equipment issues and generate substitute suggestions for absent baristas. The broad launch across the U.S. and Canada is scheduled for fiscal 2026, which starts in the fall, as Starbucks aims to reduce service times to four minutes per order.</p>

Conversely, children already struggling with social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. The study emphasizes the importance of limiting recreational screen time and encouraging children to engage in activities that promote emotional development, such as interacting with friends and family.</p>
