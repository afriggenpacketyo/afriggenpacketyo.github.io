          <p>Lyft's shares experienced a 5% surge after the company revealed a significant increase in its share buyback program, now totaling $750 million, as part of its first-quarter earnings report. The ridesharing company reported earnings of 1 cent per share and revenue of $1.45 billion, marking a 14% increase from the previous year. This positive financial performance, highlighted by a net income of $2.57 million, contrasts with a net loss of $31.54 million in the same period last year, signaling a strong recovery and investor confidence in Lyft's growth trajectory.

Analysts suggest that ongoing market uncertainty and a pro-crypto administration are contributing factors to Bitcoin's strength, positioning it as a safe haven amidst geopolitical tensions. The article notes that the situation between India and Pakistan, alongside the Federal Reserve's concerns about unemployment and inflation, could further test Bitcoin's resilience.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a slight decline following mixed first-quarter results and conservative guidance for the upcoming period, compounded by concerns over President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. While Shopify reported a loss of 53 cents per share and revenue of $2.36 billion, the company anticipates slower growth in gross profit and revenue for the second quarter. The potential impact of tariffs on Shopify's merchants, many of whom are small- to medium-sized businesses, adds to the uncertainty, although the company believes its higher-income customer base may provide some insulation. Shopify is actively monitoring data and has introduced a "buy local" tool to support merchants amidst these challenges.</p>

Critics argue that the cuts will cause "damage and chaos," jeopardizing vital support for communities and potentially decimating AmeriCorps' full-time staff.

          <h2>NOAA to Stop Tracking Cost of Climate Crisis-Fueled Disasters, Drawing Criticism</h2>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would discontinue tracking the cost of the country’s most expensive disasters, those causing at least $1 billion in damage. This decision would leave insurance companies, researchers, and government policymakers without crucial information to understand patterns and economic consequences of major disasters like hurricanes, droughts, or wildfires. Critics argue that this move, part of a broader effort to restrict or eliminate climate research, would cripple efforts to set budgets or make informed decisions on infrastructure investments. The action comes as these billion-dollar disasters are increasing due to climate change.</p>

          <p>Rapper Lil Durk was denied bail in his murder-for-hire case after a judge cited reports of him violating jail rules by using other inmates' phone accounts. Prosecutors allege that Durk, whose legal name is Durk Devontay Banks, ordered the murder of a Georgia rapper and may be linked to a second murder in Chicago. While the indictment was revised to remove references to lyrics, prosecutors maintain that the case is about Banks' conduct, not his music. The defense argued that the allegations were sweeping generalizations and that Banks was willing to hire around-the-clock security to comply with court conditions.</p>

          <p>Here’s Looking at You, a celebrated Koreatown restaurant, will close in June after nearly a decade, following the closure of its Silver Lake sibling, All Day Baby. The decision was largely influenced by the death of chef Jonathan Whitener, as well as the loss of business post-pandemic. Restaurateur Lien Ta, Whitener's collaborator, felt it was impossible to continue without him. Ta says she is at peace with the decision and plans to take time to rest and recover before determining her next steps.

The move comes amid concerns about declining global giving, the Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid, and post-pandemic setbacks.

          <p>A new law in Washington state requiring clergy to report child abuse learned during confessions has sparked a conflict between the Catholic Church and the federal government. The Archdiocese of Seattle stated that priests who comply with the law will be excommunicated, while the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation, calling the law "anti-Catholic." The law removes exemptions for confession, potentially forcing priests to choose between legal obligations and religious oaths. The debate centers on the balance between protecting children and upholding the sanctity of the confessional.</p>

          <p>Several states, including Arkansas, Ohio, and Arizona, are attempting to reinstate Medicaid work requirements, raising concerns among low-income Americans about potential loss of healthcare coverage. These requirements, which were previously halted by courts, mandate that eligible adults work to qualify for Medicaid. Supporters argue the policy promotes self-sufficiency, while critics contend it is a tactic to reduce Medicaid enrollment and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Studies have shown that work requirements do not necessarily lead to increased employment and can result in significant coverage losses due to complicated reporting processes.</p>
