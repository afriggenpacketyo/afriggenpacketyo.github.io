          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Merck is implementing a multi-year optimization plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2027. This move aims to redirect resources toward new growth drivers as the company prepares for the 2028 patent expiration of its cancer drug, Keytruda. The plan includes restructuring and job eliminations, with Merck recording a $649 million charge for the program in its second quarter. The company also reported Q2 revenue below expectations and narrowed its full-year guidance, citing challenges like soft demand for its Gardasil vaccine in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant policy conflict is emerging within the Trump administration between Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, which targets environmental pollutants, is at odds with the EPA's actions to dismantle regulations on pesticides, PFAS chemicals, and heavy metals. Supporters of the MAHA movement are expressing disappointment and urging Kennedy to challenge the EPA's agenda, which they see as undermining public health. The article highlights the political and administrative challenges Kennedy faces in reconciling his goals with the administration's pro-industry stance.</p>

          <h2>Manhattan Shooting Suspect Reportedly Claimed to Have CTE in Note</h2>

          <p>The suspect in the Midtown Manhattan shooting that killed four people reportedly left a note claiming he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and requested his brain be studied. Law enforcement sources indicate the three-page note, described as rambling, also contained vague references to the National Football League. The suspect, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, had a history of playing high school football and documented mental health issues. This development adds a new layer to the investigation into the motive behind the tragic attack at an office building housing the NFL's headquarters.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old gunman killed four people, including a New York City police officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The suspect, armed with an M4 rifle, entered the building on Park Avenue and began firing, killing Officer Didarul Islam, a four-year veteran and father of two. The attack, which also left another person in critical condition, prompted a massive police response and a lockdown of the area. Authorities identified the shooter, who had a documented mental health history, and are investigating his motive for targeting the building.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group has issued a 2025 earnings outlook that falls significantly short of Wall Street expectations, citing ongoing high medical costs within its insurance division. The company now projects adjusted earnings of at least $16 per share, well below the anticipated $20.91, causing its stock to drop. This announcement signals that elevated expenses in Medicare Advantage plans, driven by seniors undergoing procedures delayed during the pandemic, may continue to affect the insurance industry. The report is the first under new CEO Stephen Hemsley, who faces pressure to restore investor confidence amid recent setbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

The report, which featured footage of the J-20, suggests a potential gap in regional surveillance capabilities or a deliberate, low-profile military maneuver by Beijing.

Imported goods like spirits, baked goods, and fish are among those that could see significant price hikes.

It delves into the history of the hormone, its paradoxical nature of being present in all sexes, and how it has become a commodified symbol of "natural" masculinity in an era of fluid gender identity.

The relentless bombardment of civilian areas continues despite a new, shortened deadline from U.S. President Trump for Moscow to cease its aggression or face consequences. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as deliberate and conscious strikes, while the Kremlin remained defiant in the face of U.S. pressure.</p>

          <p>In Nigeria's northern Zamfara state, kidnappers have killed at least 35 of the 56 people they abducted from a village in March, even after a ransom was paid. A local official reported that the victims, mostly young people, were "slaughtered like rams" after the payment was made. The gunmen had released 18 women and a boy, but murdered the remaining hostages. This brutal act highlights the escalating crisis of kidnapping-for-ransom by criminal gangs, known as bandits, in the region, and the failure of government measures to curb the violence.</p>
