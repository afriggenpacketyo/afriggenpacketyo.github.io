          <p>The Lung Wah Hotel, once a popular refuge in Hong Kong's New Territories during the 1950s and 60s, is being revived as a museum. Known for its Spanish revival villa style, Chinese garden, and famous roast pigeon restaurant, the hotel was a hub for mahjong games, children's play, and even served as a training ground for Bruce Lee. While the hotel stopped renting rooms due to fire code upgrades and its parking lot was repurposed, the restaurant remains, aiming to recapture the essence of old Hong Kong and the memories it holds for many. The museum aims to preserve and celebrate this unique history.</p>

          <p>Despite China's denial of ongoing trade negotiations, U.S. President Donald Trump asserts that discussions are underway between the two countries. China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong insists there are no current talks and calls for the abolishment of "unilateral" tariff measures. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have hinted at easing tensions, but the U.S. recently increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing, creating uncertainty in the trade relationship and signaling a complex path forward.

          <p>President Donald Trump voiced his disapproval of the deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv, urging President Vladimir Putin to cease the attacks, which killed at least 12 people. Despite this criticism, Trump maintains he is applying "a lot of pressure" on both sides to achieve a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, even as those attacks threaten peace deal efforts. Trump's special envoy is expected to meet with Putin in Moscow to discuss the situation. President Zelensky responded to the attacks during a visit to South Africa, saying he felt the US could be more forceful with Russia to secure a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers selected North Carolina running back Omarion Hampton with the No. 22 overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft. Hampton rushed for 1,660 yards and 15 touchdowns last season, and he is expected to bolster the Chargers' offense. The Chargers also added former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Najee Harris in free agency, and they have two more selections on Friday with the 55th and 86th overall picks. The Chargers are hoping to back up their reputation for physicality in Jim Harbaugh’s second season.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward with the first pick in the NFL Draft. The Jacksonville Jaguars then traded with the Cleveland Browns to gain the second pick, claiming Colorado's Travis Hunter, set to become the NFL's first genuine two-way player since the 1990s. Hunter was the first draft prospect in 27 years to have played significant time on both defense and offense in college. Ward was expected to be a late-round pick but a fine season with Miami saw him usurp Sanders in January, and Sanders' draft stock fell sharply in the final days before the draft.</p>

While China invests heavily in infrastructure projects through government-to-government initiatives, Western nations have developed extensive NGO networks that provide social services and build community ties. This approach could counter narratives of China as a neocolonial power and improve long-term community engagement. By experimenting with an NGO model, China can build stronger relationships and enhance its public image across the continent.</p>
