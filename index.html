          <h2>Poll Shows Trump's First 100 Days Marked by Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that while President Trump maintains support from his base, there's growing concern among Americans regarding his focus on tariffs and its impact on prices. Many believe he's fulfilling campaign promises, though fewer now see a clear plan for trade. MAGA Republicans have a more positive economic outlook, but others, including independents and young people, are becoming less approving of Trump's economic policies. The poll also reveals that most Americans think Trump is trying to expand presidential powers, causing frustration among Democrats. Overall, the poll suggests declining approval of Trump's handling of the economy and immigration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A university professor reflects on her Chilean father's past paranoia and finds echoes of it in the current U.S. political climate under President Trump. Drawing parallels between Trump's actions and the Pinochet regime's repression in Chile, the author expresses concerns about academic freedom, attacks on minority groups, and the suppression of dissent. She recounts the story of Victor Jara, a Chilean singer-songwriter who was tortured and murdered during Pinochet's dictatorship for his support of leftist causes. The author vows to continue speaking her mind despite potential repercussions, drawing strength from her father's resilience and love for his homeland.</p>

While China has a surplus in goods trade with the U.S., the U.S. enjoys a surplus in services trade, indicating a more balanced economic relationship overall.</p>

          <p>An investigation into a fatal Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport reveals that the crew's decision to employ "visual separation" contributed to the accident. The crew requested and received permission to navigate around other aircraft visually, rather than relying on air traffic control. While this practice is common, it can be dangerous if mishandled, and aviation experts have warned about the risks for years. The investigation is ongoing to determine the specific factors that led to the crew's fatal misjudgment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky has offered a glimmer of hope to Ukrainians, despite his generally low standing in the country. Trump questioned why Putin would continue attacking Ukraine while the U.S. is attempting to broker peace talks. This statement, along with a previous rebuke of Putin, suggests that Trump may not force Ukraine into a lopsided peace plan that favors Russia. This shift in tone is seen as a potential victory for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's battle with the US media is intensifying, raising concerns about press freedoms. A 60 Minutes executive producer resigned, citing pressure from CBS's parent company, Paramount, to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over an interview with Kamala Harris. Shari Redstone, controlling CBS's parent company, Paramount, wants to sell it to Skydance, and needs approval from federal regulators. Critics fear this reflects a broader trend of prominent organizations capitulating to Trump's demands, undermining democratic institutions. The lawsuit alleges election interference, but legal experts deem it baseless.</p>

Blumenthal draws parallels between Trump's approach and the ideas of Carl Schmitt, a legal scholar of the Nazi regime, emphasizing the assertion of emergency power and the disregard for due process.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups are raising concerns about President Trump's decision to reverse fishing regulations in the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine national monument, potentially harming fragile ecosystems and endangered species. The proclamation allows commercial fishing within the monument's boundaries and directs the Commerce Secretary to ease restrictions. Experts fear this will lead to increased illegal fishing, bycatch, and damage to coral reefs. They also criticize Trump's staffing decisions at NOAA, suggesting a move away from science-based conservation efforts. This action could negatively impact American fishers in the long term by depleting fish populations.</p>
