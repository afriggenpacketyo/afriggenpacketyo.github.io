            <p>Amid escalating tensions over Greenland and trade tariffs, Danish shoppers are increasingly boycotting U.S. products as a form of protest against President Trump's policies. The move mirrors similar actions in Canada and other European countries, with consumers seeking out locally made goods. Salling Group, a Danish grocery chain, has even introduced labels to help shoppers identify European-owned brands. While some consumers prioritize deals over origin, the boycott reflects a broader shift in sentiment, with data suggesting a decline in travel to the U.S. as well.</p>

            <p>President Trump's ambitious trade agenda faces uncertainty after a week of dramatic tariff announcements and subsequent adjustments. While the administration aims to secure better trade deals, boost American industry, and confront China, the on-again, off-again tariff moves create instability for businesses. Despite boasting about world leaders seeking deals, the long-term impact on American industry and consumer prices remains unclear. The confrontation with China, while a key goal, carries enormous risks and may alienate needed allies, making the realization of Trump's trade goals increasingly complex.</p>

The EU observed the market carnage as the market fled to safer locations, including the euro. Europe should act swiftly to shore up its weakness by depending on fossil-fuel imports. Europe can turn this into an opportunity to gain an edge with the US on clean tech, with the goal to fully replace fossil fuels with renewables designed and built in Europe.</p>

The ruling is a rebuke to the administration's deportation policies. Abrego Garcia's lawyer expressed hope for his client's immediate release and return to the United States.</p>

            <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has terminated $5.1 billion in IT and consulting contracts with firms like Accenture and Deloitte, deeming them "wasteful spending." The cuts include contracts for consulting services and cloud IT services. Hegseth stated that the savings will be reallocated to critical priorities such as reviving the warrior ethos and rebuilding the military. He thanked Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency for its assistance in identifying wasteful spending. This move aims to improve healthcare for warfighters and their families.</p>

            <p>Michelle Obama has dismissed rumors that she is divorcing Barack Obama. The former first lady attributed her absence from high-profile events to her own choices as a "grown woman." She expressed frustration that people assumed a divorce rather than believing she was making decisions for herself. Mrs. Obama also acknowledged feeling some guilt for stepping back from certain duties. She emphasized her decision to prioritize what was best for herself rather than what others expected.</p>

            <p>In the case of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, the government is asserting Secretary of State Marco Rubio's authority to determine that Khalil's presence in the U.S. poses an adverse foreign policy consequence, which is the basis for his potential deportation. Khalil's lawyers argue that the government has not presented sufficient evidence to support this claim. Rubio's memo cites Khalil's alleged role in "antisemitic protests" as the reason for his deportation. Khalil's attorneys plan to request to depose Rubio in court.</p>

            <p>The RSPB reports a decline in starling populations visiting UK gardens, with the lowest numbers recorded since the survey began in 1979. Starlings are among the UK's fastest disappearing birds, with a sharp population decline since the 1960s. The RSPB recommends actions to support starlings and other garden wildlife, such as avoiding pesticides and providing nest boxes. The Big Garden Birdwatch involved nearly 600,000 people counting over nine million birds. Starlings have fallen from being the most numerous species recorded to fourth place.</p>

They attended a three-week military bootcamp, learning military jargon, gun safety, and pushing their limits, which fostered closeness. They shaved each other's heads on day one and got tattoos at the end of filming, symbolizing their shared experience. The film, based on a real-life mission, aims to recreate the events for a soldier who suffered memory loss.</p>

Many shops remained closed in Buenos Aires, but bus drivers continued to work. The strike, the third since President Javier Milei took office, protests austerity measures aimed at tackling hyperinflation. Unions argue that the cuts disproportionately affect the vulnerable, including pensioners and low-paid workers. Protests have been met with violence.</p>
