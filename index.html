The piece suggests that a balanced view of China-US trade, considering goods, services, and local sales, reveals mutual benefits. Appeasement in the face of trade bullying is not an option.

          <p>This article discusses concerns about the increasing centralization of sensitive data by the U.S. federal government, particularly under the Trump administration's “department of government efficiency” (DOGE). It highlights the potential for misuse, abuse, and weaponization of this data, especially when combined with private-sector data. The piece explores how rapid technological advancements and the dismantling of privacy measures are creating conditions for a surveillance society. The authors caution against the erosion of privacy protections and the potential for targeting individuals and groups based on political motivations. (optimism_score: 10)</p>
