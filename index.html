          <p>US lawmakers have released a "birthday book" given to the late convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which reportedly contains a note and drawing allegedly signed by former President Donald Trump. This document, part of a larger trove including Epstein's will and address book, was subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee amidst continued calls for transparency. The White House has vehemently denied the authenticity of the alleged Trump note, which features a sketch of a woman's body and a cryptic message about "a wonderful secret," asserting the president neither drew nor signed it. This public disclosure intensifies scrutiny over Trump's past association with Epstein, three years before sex abuse allegations against Epstein became public, prompting renewed political debate.</p>

          <p>An article analyzes why Boeing aircraft frequently feature in Donald Trump's trade agreements, suggesting both performative and pragmatic reasons. Experts note that large, high-value aircraft orders serve as visible symbols of trade commitment, helping countries address bilateral trade surpluses with the U.S. without disrupting domestic industries. While the deals offer a public relations boost for the president, the rising international tourism industry also creates a genuine need for new passenger aircraft. Despite recent safety concerns and whistleblower allegations against Boeing, airlines are reportedly regaining confidence in the company's production quality, making its inclusion in trade pacts strategically beneficial for all parties involved.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high, extending gains after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation. The rally was primarily driven by the technology sector, with investors anticipating that the incoming Liberal Democratic Party leader might introduce new fiscal stimulus measures to bolster the economy. Analysts from Julius Baer foresee further upside for the Nikkei 225, projecting it to reach 46,000 within 12 months, citing expectations of greater long-term policy and political stability. This positive market sentiment also saw the Japanese yen strengthen against the U.S. dollar, reflecting investor confidence in the country's economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The deadly stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, on a Charlotte light rail last month has ignited outrage and a national debate on public safety. Surveillance video showed 23-year-old Zarutska, who fled the war in Ukraine, being attacked by Decarlos Brown Jr., a man with a long criminal record and history of psychiatric crises. Elected officials, including President Trump, have criticized local authorities for failing to keep Brown off the streets, with Trump specifically blaming Democrats and advocating for "Law and Order." This tragic incident has become a focal point in discussions about repeat offenders, mental health treatment, and urban crime, drawing federal attention and calls for bipartisan solutions.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family has reached an agreement regarding the control of Rupert Murdoch's media empire after his passing, ensuring his eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will solidify his leadership. This resolution ends litigation where other siblings contested Rupert's initial efforts to install Lachlan as the sole successor, deviating from a previous shared control agreement. The new arrangement involves Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch divesting their holdings in News Corp and Fox Corp for an estimated $3.3 billion cash settlement. This deal is expected to maintain the editorial direction of key outlets like Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, despite some political differences among the siblings.</p>

          <p>A former top National Institutes of Health (NIH) leader, Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging she was removed for clashing with the Trump administration over childhood vaccines.

She accuses the administration of pursuing actions that endangered public health and wasted funds by halting crucial projects. Marrazzo's allegations highlight a broader concern about political interference in scientific integrity and the perceived hostility towards vaccines within the current administration, raising alarms about the future of medical research.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has tacitly allowed federal immigration raids to resume in Los Angeles, targeting individuals based on their appearance, Spanish language, and perceived low-wage jobs, a decision criticized as undermining constitutional protections. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a strong dissent, warning against living in a country where the government can seize people without particularized suspicion. The ruling, delivered via the emergency docket without full argument, overturns a district court's temporary ban on such "roving patrols." Critics argue this decision strips protections from entire communities, normalizes suspicion as policy, and sets a dangerous precedent for civil liberties, particularly for Latino residents.</p>

A University of Kansas analysis attributes this trend primarily to the high cost and overwhelming demands of childcare, making it financially unfeasible for many mothers to work. The article highlights stories like Mackenzie Bruegge, who left her medical billing job because childcare costs negated her income. Experts warn this lack of support for caregivers could lead to women backtracking in the labor force, emphasizing the urgent need for better policies.</p>

Critics, including the sister of a head teacher whose suicide was linked to an Ofsted inspection, argue the changes are merely cosmetic and continue to pose risks to the wellbeing of school staff.

          <p>California lawmakers have approved Assembly Bill 519, which aims to ban online pet dealer websites and middlemen from selling dogs to consumers, targeting the pipeline from out-of-state puppy mills. This legislation follows a previous ban on pet store sales of commercially bred dogs and seeks to close loopholes exploited by resellers posing as local breeders. The bill, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, applies to dogs, cats, and rabbits under a year old. Supporters, including the Attorney General, emphasize the need for transparency to protect consumers from unknowingly purchasing sick or poorly bred pets and to combat cruel breeding practices.</p>

          <p>This year's updated COVID-19 vaccines have received FDA approval for adults aged 65 and older, and for younger individuals with specific medical conditions that elevate their risk of severe infection. While federal officials emphasize that people can get vaccinated after consulting a doctor, this narrower approval may limit access for some. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that the vaccines are available for all patients who choose them, listing numerous conditions that confer higher risk, potentially making 100-200 million Americans eligible. Coverage by public insurance is expected, but private insurance adjustments remain uncertain, and pharmacies may face state-level restrictions on administration.</p>

          <p>A group of six whistleblowers, current and former Meta employees, allege the company covered up harm to children on its virtual reality devices and apps. They claim Meta deleted or doctored internal safety research that showed children experiencing grooming, sexual assault, and violence in its 3D environments. These findings, disclosed to Congress and reported by the Washington Post, suggest Meta prioritized engagement and profit despite knowing about underage users. Meta denies the allegations, stating it has introduced safety features.

          <p>John Elkann, chairman of Ferrari and Stellantis, has agreed to one year of community service and a joint payment of €183 million to Italian tax authorities to settle an inheritance tax dispute.

While the agreement does not include an admission of liability, Elkann's lawyer stated it provides an opportunity to close this "painful affair." This resolution also led prosecutors to drop a criminal case against his siblings, though a civil case related to Gianni Agnelli's estate remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>A leading waste firm boss asserts that the UK's ban on disposable vapes is failing, with millions still being incorrectly discarded and causing increased problems, including fires, in the waste industry. Roger Wright of Biffa noted a 3% rise in vapes found in general recycling since the June ban, attributing it partly to cheap reusable devices that are still treated as disposables by consumers. The ban also prompted an influx of new vape products designed to circumvent regulations, complicating recycling efforts. The presence of lithium batteries in vapes poses a significant fire risk, costing the UK waste industry an estimated billion pounds annually, highlighting the ban's limited impact.</p>
