          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in central Texas has risen to over 100, with an unknown number of people still missing four days after the event. A Christian all-girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, confirmed at least 27 fatalities among its campers and staff. The tragedy has sparked a political debate, as the White House rejected suggestions that National Weather Service budget cuts compromised the disaster response. Search and rescue operations are ongoing amid forecasts of more rain in the devastated region.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has begun phasing out the requirement for passengers in standard screening lines to remove their shoes at select U.S. airports. This change marks a significant shift in post-9/11 security protocols, which were broadly implemented after the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. While travelers with TSA PreCheck were already exempt, this policy is now being extended to all flyers at an initial group of airports, with reports of it being observed at others like LAX and LaGuardia.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the Milwaukee Brewers 9-1, extending their losing streak to four games. The loss was largely sealed in a disastrous first inning for pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who gave up five runs in the shortest start of his MLB career. The Dodgers' offense, hampered by a string of injuries to key players, was unable to mount a comeback against Brewers' All-Star pitcher Freddy Peralta. The team's struggles were compounded by poor defense, including a critical error by Mookie Betts.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to advance a permanent ordinance aimed at preventing "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels to re-rent units at higher prices. The amendment would require landlords to obtain a government agency order to vacate a unit for renovations, effectively closing a loophole in the city's "just cause" eviction protections. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated and can return to their original units.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a provision in a recently passed bill that would suspend its Medicaid funding for one year. The lawsuit argues that the measure, which targets organizations that provide abortion services, is an unconstitutional attempt to punish the group for its legal activities. While federal law already prohibits using Medicaid for most abortions, the organization states that losing reimbursement for other health services would be devastating for its patients and clinics nationwide.</p>

          <p>South Korea has officially canceled a $2.2 billion plan to purchase an additional 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision reflects a strategic shift, influenced by the demonstrated vulnerability of traditional platforms like helicopters to modern drones and air defense systems in recent conflicts such as the war in Ukraine. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the nation must invest in capabilities that reflect the future of warfare rather than clinging to expensive legacy systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has delayed the imposition of higher, broad-based tariffs on imports but has issued letters to 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, detailing new tariff rates that will take effect on August 1. President Trump renewed threats of a 25% tax on products from key Asian allies, while other nations face levies ranging from 25% to 40%. The administration argues the tariffs protect U.S. industry, but the move creates ongoing uncertainty for global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not initiate legal proceedings against participants of the city's recent Pride parade, even though the event had been officially prohibited by the government.
