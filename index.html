          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing reciprocal 15% tariffs on Japanese exports, including a reduction for automobiles from 25%. President Trump hailed the agreement, claiming it would involve a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and create numerous jobs. The deal, which also includes provisions for U.S. agricultural products, provided a political boost for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and caused a surge in Japanese auto stocks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile are raising concerns about "overtourism," citing the proliferation of 72 tourist-focused gift shops along the famous street. Locals describe a loss of essential services like grocers and doctors' offices, which have been replaced by businesses catering exclusively to tourists, diminishing the area's livability for families. While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, the dramatic increase in international visitors and short-term lets has strained community life, a problem the city hopes to address with a new visitor levy. </p>

          <p>Leaders from the European Union and China are meeting for a high-stakes summit amid an already strained relationship over trade, technology, and security issues. The dynamic is further complicated by the United States, as President Trump's adversarial trade policies create a complex geopolitical triangle. Analysts suggest that while both the EU and China may wish to counter U.S. unilateralism, their own significant differences will likely limit any major breakthroughs. The outcome of ongoing EU-U.S. trade talks could heavily influence Brussels's future alignment and its stance toward Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice is set to deliver a historic advisory opinion on the legal obligations countries have to protect the climate from greenhouse gas emissions. The case was brought forward by vulnerable island nations, like Vanuatu, that face existential threats from rising sea levels. While the court's opinion is non-binding, it is expected to establish a significant legal benchmark that could influence domestic climate lawsuits and international agreements worldwide. The decision will address both what nations must do to prevent harm and the legal consequences for failing to act.</p>

The analysis, using 3D digital scans, suggests the caiman-like reptile either killed the powerful bird in an ambush or scavenged its remains.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed relief pitcher Tanner Scott on the injured list with elbow inflammation after he exited a game with a "stinging sensation" in his forearm. While the team is awaiting a full review of his MRI, initial reports are optimistic that the injury is not season-ending. Scott's injury underscores the team's need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the trade deadline. In his absence, the Dodgers plan to use a closer-by-committee approach, navigating yet another injury to their bullpen this season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Worcestershire musician, Anna Downes, has criticized West Mercia Police for their handling of her cyberflashing case, stating she felt ignored and was forced to investigate the crime herself. After receiving unsolicited explicit images from a man she had met once, it took nearly six months and media intervention for an arrest to be made. The perpetrator was eventually convicted and given a community order. The case highlights ongoing concerns about how law enforcement handles digital crimes like cyberflashing, which became a specific offense in the UK in 2023.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has directed its national sports governing bodies to comply with President Trump's executive order restricting transgender women from competing in women's sports. Citing its status as a federally chartered organization, the USOPC stated it has an "obligation to comply with federal expectations" that threaten to rescind funding from non-compliant organizations. The move, which follows a similar policy change by the NCAA, has been condemned by civil rights groups like the National Women's Law Center as a capitulation to political pressure that sacrifices athlete safety.</p>

The project is part of a broader Chinese strategy to harness the hydropower potential of the region, but it has heightened geopolitical tensions over water resources and environmental stability in a volatile area.</p>

          <p>This article frames recent events as a trend of capitulation to political pressure from the Trump administration. It connects the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" by Paramount Global, which is seeking federal approval for a merger, to the House GOP's move to end its session early to thwart an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The author argues these actions, along with others, show powerful institutions bending to the will of the White House to avoid conflict. Jon Stewart is quoted criticizing the belief that one can become so innocuous as to be safe from political targeting.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump accused former President Barack Obama of "treason," alleging he orchestrated a plot to undermine his 2016 election victory by manipulating intelligence on Russian interference. The claim, made without evidence, was based on a recently declassified report from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Obama's office issued a rare and forceful rebuttal, calling Trump's accusations "outrageous," "bizarre," and a "weak attempt at distraction." The statement affirmed that the intelligence community's conclusion of Russian meddling remains widely accepted and was supported by a bipartisan Senate report.</p>

Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that fought in the American War of Independence, the ship was later sold and repurposed for whaling in the Arctic. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology, archival research, and a dedicated effort by the local community, who recovered the timbers after a storm exposed them.
