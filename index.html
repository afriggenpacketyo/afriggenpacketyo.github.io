          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket has successfully completed its 11th test flight, launching from a Texas facility and achieving its goal of a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The mission saw the Super Heavy booster perform a controlled return to the Gulf of Mexico, marking another significant advancement in the development of the world's largest rocket. This successful test is a crucial step for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use a modified version of Starship for its upcoming manned missions to the Moon's south pole. The flight demonstrates increasing reliability after previous tests ended in explosions.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's government has announced the closure of its embassy in Oslo, Norway, just days after opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. While the Venezuelan government officially cited a restructuring of its foreign service, the move is widely interpreted as a diplomatic retaliation against the Nobel Committee's recognition of Machado's pro-democracy activism. Norway's foreign ministry expressed regret over the decision, reiterating that the Nobel Prize is independent of the Norwegian government and that it wishes to maintain open dialogue with Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Beijing has imposed sanctions on five U.S.-linked subsidiaries of the South Korean shipbuilding company Hanwha Ocean, causing the company's shares to fall sharply. China's commerce ministry stated the measures were a response to the Hanwha units assisting the U.S. government in investigative activities that jeopardized China's national interests. This action marks a significant escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China, occurring as both nations begin to implement new port fees targeting each other's maritime vessels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent changes in U.S. customs regulations, which now require inspection for packages valued under $800, have created significant shipping backlogs and chaos for consumers and businesses. Customers of shipping giant UPS have reported their packages, including sentimental items like wedding dresses, being marked for disposal without clear communication due to the new, more complex documentation rules. The abrupt policy shift has overwhelmed shipping companies, leading to unexpected costs, prolonged delays, and severe distress for individuals awaiting their personal belongings from abroad.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Scotland, Cameron McGerr, is advocating for CPR to be taught in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to separate heart conditions. He believes that knowing CPR could have potentially saved his father's life, as he lost critical time in a panic while waiting for emergency operator instructions. His "Pulse of Life" campaign has already successfully introduced training at his own school, and he is now urging lawmakers to implement a nationwide program to better equip young people with these life-saving skills.</p>

          <p>The England men's national football team is confronting a limited pool of available strikers beyond captain Harry Kane, sparking concerns about depth in the crucial center-forward position. With only seven English out-and-out strikers having appeared in the Premier League this season, and only one under the age of 26, the options for a reliable backup are scarce. This issue was highlighted by an injury to Ollie Watkins, the only other dedicated striker in the current squad, prompting discussion among coaches and analysts about the need to develop more traditional goal-scoring forwards.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for the implementation of a national screening program for prostate cancer in the UK. Acting as an ambassador for a cancer research charity, Sunak argued that a targeted program focusing on high-risk groups, such as men with a family history and Black men, would be affordable and could save countless lives. The proposal comes as the UK's National Screening Committee reconsiders its current stance against routine screening, though some medical experts remain cautious about the potential for over-treatment and its side effects.</p>

By analyzing the stylistic traits of the remaining text, the team's AI model was able to replicate and generate the missing characters, resulting in a complete scroll of 919 characters.

          <p>A woman who suffered a traumatic brain injury that impaired her speech has found a new way to communicate and regain confidence by learning British Sign Language (BSL). Tina, 59, sustained the injury after a fall in 2018 left her in a coma for six weeks. Learning BSL has helped her express words she struggles to speak and has allowed her to relax, as she can often recall a sign even when a spoken word escapes her. Her journey was featured in a BBC series exploring how BSL can benefit older individuals.</p>

          <p>Two Venezuelan activists, Yendri Velasquez and Luis Peche, were shot and injured in what authorities in Bogota, Colombia, suspect was a targeted attack by hired gunmen. Both men, who had been living in Colombia since fleeing alleged political persecution in Venezuela, were reported to be in stable condition. Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado condemned the attack, calling for a thorough investigation by the Colombian government and highlighting the dangers faced by those who have been persecuted by the Maduro regime.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' expectations despite a slowdown in the manufacturing and construction sectors. However, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) held its policy settings steady and cautioned that GDP growth is likely to moderate to a near-trend pace in 2026. The central bank expects global AI investment to support the nation's manufacturing sector, but anticipates a normalization of activity in trade-related areas will lead to slower overall growth.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bill that aimed to phase out the use of PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in various consumer products, including nonstick cookware, by 2030. In his veto message, Newsom expressed concerns that the bill, while well-intentioned, could negatively impact the availability of affordable cooking products for consumers. The legislation was supported by environmental and health groups due to the links between PFAS and adverse health effects, but it faced strong opposition from the chemical and cookware industries.</p>

          <p>China has announced the mass production of a highly sensitive, four-channel single-photon detector, a core component for developing advanced quantum radar systems. This technology, capable of detecting the smallest unit of energy, is expected to significantly enhance China's ability to track stealth aircraft like the F-22. The breakthrough represents a major advancement in quantum technology with powerful applications not only in national defense but also in fields like quantum communication. The development was achieved by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui province.</p>

          <p>Amazon has fired a Palestinian software engineer who was suspended last month for protesting the company's $1.2 billion "Project Nimbus" contract with the Israeli government and military. The employee, Ahmed Shahrour, was informed that an investigation found he had violated company policies by posting non-work-related messages on Slack about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Shahrour claims his termination is an act of retaliation intended to silence dissent within the company regarding its collaboration with Israel. The firing reflects growing activism and tension within the tech industry over such contracts.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed legislation that would have permitted California colleges to offer preferential admission to applicants who are descendants of individuals enslaved in the U.S. before 1900. Newsom stated that such a bill is unnecessary because educational institutions already possess the authority to decide whether to adopt these preferences. Proponents argued the bill was distinct from race-based affirmative action, which is banned in the state, but critics contended it used lineage as a proxy for race and would have faced immediate legal challenges.</p>
