          <p>The IMF has lowered its growth forecast for the eurozone, citing the negative impact of US tariffs as outweighing the benefits of increased German infrastructure spending.  Alfred Kammer, director of the IMF's European department, emphasizes that trade tensions, rather than fiscal policy, are the primary concern.  Germany's recent infrastructure investment, while positive, is insufficient to counteract the broader economic drag from tariffs.</p>
