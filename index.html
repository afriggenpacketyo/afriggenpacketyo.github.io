          <p>An Israeli airstrike struck the fourth floor of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, resulting in the deaths of at least 15 individuals, including four journalists. This incident, described as a double-tap strike, occurred amidst the ongoing conflict, drawing immediate condemnation from the Foreign Press Association. The organization demanded an urgent explanation from Israeli authorities, emphasizing the significant number of journalists killed in Gaza and the continued restrictions on independent media access. The attack underscores persistent concerns about the safety of civilians and media personnel in conflict zones, particularly within medical facilities, and highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis as casualties continue to rise in the region.</p>

Utilizing an old utility trailer as a foundation and repurposed materials, he equipped the 22-square-foot structure with essentials like a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, and a solar-powered kitchen. Kelly, who documents unique Airbnbs, aimed to prove that functional living spaces can be created with minimal square footage, even if he wouldn't live in it full-time. His project highlights creative solutions for small-scale living and encourages others to embrace minimalism in housing design.</p>

          <p>General Michael "Erik" Kurilla has retired after three years commanding U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), a tenure marked by significant military operations in the Middle East. He notably directed Operation Midnight Hammer, targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, and Operation Rough Rider against Houthi forces in Yemen. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth praised Kurilla as a "bold, dynamic, and inspiring leader," acknowledging his extensive career focus on the region. Admiral Brad Cooper has since assumed command of CENTCOM, tasked with continuing efforts to enhance regional security and stability across 21 nations in its area of operations.</p>

          <p>German prosecutors have indicted an American man, identified as Martin D., on espionage charges for allegedly offering sensitive U.S. military information to Chinese authorities. The suspect, a civilian contractor at an unidentified U.S. military facility in Germany, was arrested in Frankfurt in November. He is accused of repeatedly contacting Chinese intelligence in the summer of 2024 with his offer to provide classified data. Although German media reported no actual data transfer, the case highlights persistent concerns about foreign intelligence infiltration and the security of military information within allied nations. The court in Koblenz will now decide whether to proceed with a trial.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) confirmed the first human case of New World Screwworm infestation in the U.S., identified in a patient who traveled from El Salvador. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) verified the parasitic fly larvae, which feed on live tissue and can cause severe damage in animals and, rarely, humans. While the immediate risk to U.S. public health is considered "very low," this confirmation follows recent advisories for South Texas and new policy initiatives, including plans for an insect dispersal facility, aimed at preventing the wider spread of screwworms.</p>

          <p>Delays in student loan forgiveness, stemming from administrative backlogs and recent court actions, could expose hundreds of thousands of borrowers to unexpected federal tax bills. The American Rescue Plan Act, which made forgiveness tax-free, is set to expire at the end of 2025. Without an extension, borrowers receiving relief after this date under income-driven repayment plans could face substantial tax liabilities, potentially over $12,000 for average balances. Advocates urge the Education Department to expedite forgiveness and advise borrowers to prepare by saving payment records and planning for potential tax burdens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new bruise was observed on President Donald Trump's left hand, following a persistent mark on his right hand earlier this year. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt attributed the new bruise to the President's frequent hand-shaking, stating he "meets more Americans...than any other President in history." This explanation mirrors her previous response to the right-hand bruise, though the White House later provided a more medical reason for that instance, citing soft-tissue irritation and aspirin use. The bruise was visible in a video of Trump playing golf.</p>

While acknowledging that the high-profile incidents prompted companies to reassess travel procedures, the report suggests that the general risk of exit bans, detentions, or other complications for American travelers remains consistent.</p>
