          <h2>IMF Projects Lower U.S. Fiscal Deficit in 2025 Due to Tariff Revenues Amid Trade War Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund forecasts a slight dip in the U.S. fiscal deficit for 2025, attributing this to increased tariff revenues, even as the broader economic outlook worsens due to an intensifying trade war. The IMF's Fiscal Monitor report projects the U.S. federal deficit to fall to 6.5% of GDP, down from 7.3% in 2024, contingent on these tariff revenues. However, the report acknowledges significant uncertainty regarding the magnitude of tariff revenue increases and the potential for tariffs to negatively impact other sectors of the economy, possibly offsetting the gains. If U.S. government debt continues to surge, the IMF believes it will push up longer-term interest rates and the cost of financing the debt.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is considering a proposal to impose export restrictions on all eel species under an international agreement, a move that could impact supplies to Japan, which relies heavily on imports. The proposal aims to list all 19 eel species and subspecies in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, requiring export permits for species like the Japanese eel, American eel, and Southeast Asia's Anguilla bicolor. This regulation would apply to both live juvenile glass eels and processed products like grilled eel, with the EU likely to decide on the proposal by early June, as Japan's Fisheries Agency lobbies against it.</p>

          <p>The European Union has fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros for breaching the bloc's digital competition rules. Apple received a €500 million fine for preventing app makers from directing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, while Meta was fined €200 million for forcing Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them. These penalties, issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, aim to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech companies from dominating digital markets. Both companies have indicated they will appeal the decisions, arguing that the EU is unfairly targeting American businesses.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich is facing increasing pressure over its sponsorship deal with Rwanda, with critics pointing to Rwanda's alleged support of the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite promising to investigate the matter months ago, Bayern Munich has remained silent, even as the German government restricts its cooperation agreement with Rwanda. Fan groups have voiced their discontent, accusing the club of hypocrisy given Rwandan President Paul Kagame's authoritarian rule. Other clubs with similar deals, like Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, are also facing scrutiny, highlighting the ethical concerns surrounding sports sponsorships with countries accused of human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that the resumption of collections on defaulted student loans, impacting millions of borrowers, could contribute to an economic slowdown. The Trump administration plans to begin collecting payments in May, potentially garnishing wages and reducing consumer spending. Economists suggest that while student loan collections may not be the primary driver of a potential recession, they could exacerbate the damage. The policy, which lifts a pause initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, will affect roughly 5 million borrowers, with millions more at risk of entering collections soon.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has been on the rise for three consecutive days, nearing $95,000, driven by a broad market rally fueled by President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and reduced criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The cryptocurrency's recent surge has helped it recover more than half of its losses since Inauguration Day, bringing it close to the flat line for the year. Market analysts attribute this positive movement to investors capitalizing on a dip in an asset that serves as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.</p>

The International Monetary Fund has also lowered its growth forecast for the UK in 2025, citing tariffs and rising inflation.

          <p>A newly discovered karst cave in southwest China, dating back 480 million years, contains pristine sediment formations that experts have never seen before. However, the cave is now under threat from visitors, including social media influencers, who are causing irreversible damage to its fragile structures. Cave explorer Zhao Jieyu, who discovered the cave in 2021, is now calling for greater protection of the site to prevent further destruction of its delicate formations.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Justice Department for a meeting concerning claims of anti-Christian bias during the Biden administration, amidst controversy over Hegseth's use of Signal chats to share potentially sensitive information. Bondi has dismissed suggestions of a Justice Department investigation into the Signal chat controversy. The meeting comes as Hegseth indicated the DOJ could seek criminal charges against former Defense Department aides allegedly leaking information to the news media. Bondi emphasized the Justice Department's commitment to investigating events during the Biden administration that conservatives say showed "anti-Christian" bias.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups are claiming the Trump administration violated their free-speech rights by targeting them over language in grant documents, including terms like "equity" and "socioeconomic." These groups allege that the administration froze or canceled funding agreements for climate and environmental initiatives, particularly those aimed at assisting low-income and disadvantaged communities. A lawsuit filed in South Carolina argues that the administration attempted to coerce speech by pressuring them to use different language in their grant applications. The EPA has stated that it is reviewing grant funding to ensure it aligns with administration priorities.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that William Shakespeare's relationship with his wife, Anne Hathaway, may have been more positive than previously believed. A fragment of a letter, addressed to "good Mrs Shakespeare," indicates they lived together in London between 1600 and 1610. The letter also refers to a Trinity Lane and of the four married couples called Shakspaire (spelling of the time) known to be in London in that period, only William and Anne are likely to have lived in what was considered a moderately prosperous part of the city. The discovery could mean Shakespeare's wife did indeed spend "significant" time with her husband in London.</p>
