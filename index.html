          <p>Friday's newspapers cover a range of topics, with the Chagos Islands deal between the UK and Mauritius prominently featured. The Daily Telegraph accuses PM Starmer of "lying to the public" regarding the deal's cost, potentially exceeding Â£30bn. The Times reports the deal "could cost taxpayers billions," while the Metro headlines "Starmer's Chaos Islands cave-in." The Guardian focuses on potential NHS strikes due to "derisory" pay rises. The Financial Times leads with Donald Trump's "showpiece tax bill" passing, and the i Paper reports on a former MI6 chief's warning about Chinese technology in UK energy infrastructure. The Daily Express features an interview with Sarah Everard's family criticizing early release plans for killers.</p>

          <p>A program in Jay Em, Wyoming, called Operation Remount Corporation, is helping veterans cope with mental health challenges through equine therapy, pairing them with wild mustangs. The program addresses PTSD, depression, and anxiety, which are more prevalent among veterans, while also helping mustangs with traumatic backgrounds. Veteran Sean Walker, a participant, says his horse, Spirit, has significantly impacted his reintegration into civilian life after serving in Iraq and Bosnia. The program includes a new cabin for overnight stays and aims to expand to offer year-round therapy, fostering a therapeutic bond between veterans and horses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to pause in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, and the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama. FEMA initially halted on-site classes, citing that the government would no longer pay for travel for programs deemed not "mission critical." However, after a review, FEMA determined that certain courses provide effective training. This reversal followed criticism from Maryland's congressional delegation and firefighters, who argued that pausing training for first-responders was dangerous and nonsensical.</p>

Many donors wish to support causes related to their birthplace and life experiences, with child care, health care, and education being the most popular.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices and reduced energy subsidies. This is the highest level since January 2023, exceeding expectations. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Rice prices have doubled over the year, with the Prime Minister pledging to lower them, staking his job on the line.

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices climbed 3.5% in April, driven by reduced government utility subsidies and surging rice prices. This increase marks the fastest pace in over two years, with the key inflation gauge remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Energy prices rose significantly, while food prices also contributed to overall price growth. The United States' tariffs on Japanese automobiles have had limited impact so far, but higher rice prices may support the case for the BOJ to raise interest rates.</p>
