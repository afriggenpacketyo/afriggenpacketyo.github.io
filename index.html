Ciattarelli responded on X, saying he was "truly humbled and honored to receive President Trumpâ€™s very strong endorsement today.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that the auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York was anticlimactic, indicating potential weakness in the art market. The sale, seen as a bellwether for the auction season, struggled to meet pre-sale expectations, with some lots failing to spark bidding wars. Experts attributed the tepid interest to economic uncertainty surrounding tariffs. While some artworks sold above estimates, the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted concerns about the Warhol market, though Claude Monet's painting sold well.</p>

          <p>The EPA did not release its annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report, but data obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund reveals that the U.S. has made progress in reducing emissions. However, the U.S. is not on track to meet certain climate goals, and concerns exist that new policies from the Trump administration could worsen carbon pollution. The report indicates that the transportation sector is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions, and the U.S. is shifting towards more renewable energy sources for electricity generation.</p>

          <h2>Trump Invokes Golf Analogy to Defend Plan to Accept Qatari Jet</h2>

          <p>President Trump defended his plan to accept a $400 million plane from Qatar for use as Air Force One by invoking a golf analogy about accepting a "gimme" putt. He compared the situation to a golfer who should gratefully accept a given putt rather than risk missing it and angering their partner. The analogy serves as a revealing insight into how Mr. Trump views ethical concerns swirling around him.</p>
