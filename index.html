          <p>A federal judge in Texas has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple detained by ICE, criticizing the government's evidence linking them to a foreign terrorist organization. The couple, who fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted Temporary Protected Status, were arrested and had their TPS status withdrawn based on alleged gang affiliation. The judge, echoing a similar rebuke from another judge in March, stated the government failed to provide meaningful evidence to support the claim. The couple's attorneys emphasized the drastic consequences of the 'alien enemies' designation, which could have led to life sentences in brutal prisons. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are struggling to book driving tests, facing long waiting times and competition likened to buying Glastonbury tickets. The average waiting time is 22 weeks, with some centers at the maximum of 24 weeks. The Transport Secretary aims to reduce this to seven weeks by summer 2026, implementing measures like increased examiner training. Some learners are resorting to paid apps that alert them to cancellations, while others travel long distances to find available slots, and the DVSA does not endorse these apps. The DVSA blames increased demand and changing booking behavior for the backlog.</p>

          <p>The area burned by wildfires in the UK in 2025 has already surpassed the annual record, with over 29,200 hectares affected, according to satellite data. Prolonged dry and sunny weather in March and early April created ideal conditions for widespread burning. Most fires are started by humans, but weather conditions significantly influence their spread. Researchers are concerned about a potential second peak in the fire season during the summer when temperatures are high and vegetation is dry, but there is no guarantee of this occurring.</p>

These protests were met with counter-demonstrations, leading to arrests and clashes with police in some cities. Security agencies had warned that extremists might attempt to hijack the rallies.

          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh, a longtime loyalist, as his deputy.

However, others consider it a cosmetic reshuffle intended to appease Arab officials frustrated with the Palestinian leader. Many Palestinians view the leadership's focus on internal politics, especially during the ongoing war in Gaza, as a sign of the Palestinian Authority's complacency.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a determination to disrupt the established order, particularly in global trade. Following initial tariff increases on Chinese goods, Trump announced a package of tariff increases for US rivals and allies, then reversed course with a 90-day pause for most countries except China. These back-and-forth actions have unsettled global markets and eroded confidence in the US's ability to manage the global economy. The outcome of trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing in the coming days will likely shape perceptions of Trump's first 100 days and offer insights into his future policies.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has expressed doubts about Vladimir Putin's commitment to ending the war in Ukraine after meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral. Trump cited recent Russian strikes on Kyiv as a reason to question Putin's intentions, suggesting a different approach may be needed. Earlier, Trump and Zelensky held a 15-minute meeting described as "very productive," with Zelensky calling it potentially historic. Trump has previously blamed Ukraine for starting the war and has accused Zelensky multiple times of being an obstacle to peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Recent polls suggest that Americans, including some Republicans, are losing faith in Donald Trump, with a majority describing his second term as "scary". Trump's approval ratings are low, with disapproval of his performance, tariff policies, and federal workforce cuts. Even Republicans are not overwhelmingly convinced that Trump is focused on the right priorities. Independent voters are particularly critical, with a small percentage believing Trump is addressing the right issues.
