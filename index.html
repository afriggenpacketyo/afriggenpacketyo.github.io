          <p>Zhigang Peng's election as president-elect of the Seismological Society of America and Shan-Lu Liu's upcoming leadership of the American Society for Virology highlight a growing trend of China-born scientists holding leadership positions in US academic societies. Despite significant contributions to research and education, scientists of Chinese descent have historically been underrepresented in these roles. These appointments signify progress toward greater diversity and inclusion within US academic institutions, encouraging more Chinese-American researchers to expand their impact and serve the broader scientific community. This shift reflects a gradual but important change in representation within US academia.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at Shahid Rajaee port, a key Iranian commercial hub near Bandar Abbas, resulted in at least 18 deaths and 800 injuries, causing widespread damage and prompting school and office closures. The blast, attributed to improperly stored flammable materials, possibly ignited a shipment of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles. Maritime risk consultants suggest the affected containers held solid fuel for ballistic missiles, with reports indicating a recent shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel to the port. Iranian officials had issued prior warnings regarding the safe storage of chemicals at the port, raising questions about safety protocols.</p>

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts detective, was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Amy Fanion, after investigators uncovered inconsistencies in his account and suspicious online searches. The investigation revealed an affair with Corrine Knowles and searches for household poisons, overdoses, and gunshot residue testing prior to Amy's death. The lack of gunshot residue on Amy's head and the trajectory of the bullet raised doubts about Fanion's claim that his wife committed suicide. Despite support from some of Amy's family, Fanion was sentenced to life in prison, with his conviction currently under appeal.</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating capping the number of international students to address its housing affordability crisis, a significant shift for a country that once heavily relied on international education as a major export. Politicians argue that reducing international student intake will decrease demand for rentals and starter homes, thereby lowering prices. This move faces criticism from individuals like Ali Bajwa, a Pakistani native and naturalized citizen, who believes that improving selection criteria is a better approach than a blanket ban. The debate highlights the tension between economic interests and addressing social concerns.</p>

          <p>Tensions between China and South Korea have risen due to the presence of large steel structures in a disputed area of the Yellow Sea, with some South Korean critics comparing them to China's island-building activities in the South China Sea. While China insists these structures are for commercial fish farming, concerns persist in South Korea that they are intended to bolster China's territorial claims. Some Chinese analysts warn that this dispute could hinder efforts to improve relations, particularly as Beijing seeks regional support against US tariffs, and has fueled anti-China sentiment in South Korea.</p>
