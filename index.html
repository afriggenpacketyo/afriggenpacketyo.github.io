        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the common phenomenon of decreased sex drive for both parents after childbirth, explaining the complex factors involved. For mothers, physical healing, hormonal shifts like plummeting estrogen, and issues such as vaginal dryness contribute to reduced libido and potential discomfort. Reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth shared her personal struggle with intimacy avoidance and how open communication with her husband helped alleviate pressure. The article also notes that men can experience a dip in sex drive due to the emotional and identity changes associated with fatherhood. Experts emphasize that couples should not feel pressured by the traditional six-week postnatal checkup timeline and instead prioritize honest dialogue to navigate these significant relationship adjustments.</p>

          <p>A Colorado jury has awarded a monumental $205 million to the family of 6-year-old Wongel Estifanos, who tragically fell over 100 feet to her death from the Haunted Mine Drop ride at Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park in 2021. Investigations determined the child was not correctly secured, seated on top of already buckled restraints, and a warning alarm was overridden by an operator. The family's lawsuit highlighted not only operator negligence but also the park's alleged disregard for repeated safety complaints. While criminal charges were not pursued, this significant civil verdict aims to hold the park and the ride's manufacturer accountable, leading to the permanent closure of the attraction. The family expressed gratitude for the community's support during the lengthy trial.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old boy in Sacramento County, California, is accused of stealing his parents' truck for a joyride to his former school, leading deputies on a brief pursuit that ended in a crash. The incident occurred shortly before 7 a.m. when the boy reportedly knocked over traffic cones at the school before fleeing. The chase culminated with the truck colliding with a patrol car and a parked vehicle, though no injuries were reported. The boy was taken into custody, and authorities are now determining the next steps, noting that 12 is the minimum age for criminal responsibility in California's juvenile court system.</p>

          <p>US comedian Jimmy Kimmel will return to his late-night talk show after Disney, which owns ABC, reinstated the program following a week-long suspension. The suspension was prompted by Kimmel's jokes regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which Disney deemed "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to pull the show initially followed threats from the FCC chairman to revoke ABC's broadcast license, sparking widespread debate over free speech and drawing criticism from First Amendment advocates, celebrities, and even some conservative figures. Disney stated that "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel led to the show's return.</p>

This article highlights the strong condemnation from major medical groups like ACOG, which reiterated acetaminophen's safety during pregnancy and called the announcement "irresponsible" and "dangerously simplifying" complex causes of neurodevelopmental challenges.

Legal experts question the order's impact, as antifa is a decentralized movement rather than an organized group, and US law lacks a statute for designating domestic terrorist organizations or charging individuals with domestic terrorism.

In financials, Cramer recommended Capital One, American Express, Citigroup, KeyCorp, Charles Schwab, Chubb, and Apollo.

A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent under advice to "assuage Epstein and his threats."

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has accused FCC Chairman Brendan Carr of unlawfully intimidating broadcasters and waging a "campaign of censorship" against President Trump's critics, specifically citing the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" This article details Bonta's letter to Carr, arguing that such actions threaten First Amendment rights and are "fundamentally un-American." While Kimmel's show was reinstated, Bonta maintains his concerns, rejecting claims that poor ratings, rather than political pressure, caused the suspension. Constitutional scholars and advocates like PEN America also condemned Carr's actions as "dangerous" and "clear violations of the 1st Amendment," emphasizing the chilling effect on free speech.</p>

The article posits that self-censorship is central to authoritarianism and that comedians, through humor, play a vital role in draining fear and building camaraderie, which autocrats often suppress. It contextualizes Kimmel's situation within broader concerns about the subversion of patriotism, threats to journalists, and a "Christian nationalist rant" by Stephen Miller. The piece concludes by asking whether Kimmel's laughter can prove that society has nothing to fear but fear itself.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has closed a federal bribery investigation into its former "border czar," Tom Homan, who was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents in exchange for promises of government contracts. Homan, who boasted of running the "biggest deportation operation," was a private citizen at the time of the alleged payment. The White House denied Homan accepted the money, calling the investigation "entrapment" and "weaponization of the Biden DOJ." This article suggests the closure of the case contributes to a growing body of evidence for the politicization of Trump’s Justice Department, raising concerns about accountability and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>This article serves as an explainer, dissecting the "flimsy evidence" behind President Trump's announcement linking Tylenol to autism and promoting leucovorin as a treatment. It highlights that medical groups still recommend Tylenol for pregnant individuals, and exhaustive studies have found no link between vaccines and autism, contradicting Trump's assertions. The article details how Trump's claims outpace current science, with the NIH's comprehensive review not yet completed. It critiques the administration's fixation on rising autism rates, explaining that increases are largely due to improved awareness and broader diagnostic criteria, rather than a single environmental toxin, emphasizing the genetic factors involved.</p>

The ACLU, part of his legal team, has called for an emergency hearing, arguing his detention is due to his reporting on law enforcement and that the court misstated his previous voluntary departure order. DHS maintains Guevara is in the country illegally, citing a 2012 final removal order, escalating concerns over press freedom and immigration policy.</p>

This article highlights that tech giants like Google and Microsoft initially advised H-1B employees not to travel. Attorneys are advising clients to stay in the US until more guidance is issued, warning that the drastic cost increase will likely have a "chilling effect" on skilled foreign workers entering the country.

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced the "Trump Gold Card," a new immigration pathway offering wealthy foreigners permanent US residency in exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This article explains that the program, launched alongside new H-1B restrictions, redefines traditional employment-based visas (EB-1 and EB-2) by equating personal riches with "extraordinary ability." It contrasts the Gold Card with the existing EB-5 visa, noting the Gold Card's focus on debt reduction rather than direct investment in American businesses. The article suggests this policy reflects an administration prioritizing wealth over traditional immigration values, indicating a significant shift in US immigration philosophy.

          <p>This article recounts the significant 2012 recall of Sunland brand peanut butter, sold at Costco and other major retailers, due to Salmonella contamination. Initially affecting less than 100 products, the recall expanded to over 400 items, sickening 42 people across 20 states. The FDA, citing a history of health violations and repeated Salmonella findings since 2009, took the unprecedented step of revoking Sunland's plant registration. This effectively shut down the largest organic peanut butter producer in the US, ultimately leading to Sunland, Inc. filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the auction of its plant, underscoring the severe consequences of food safety failures.</p>
