          <p>The current international landscape is characterized by unpredictable transactional diplomacy, where alliances are conditional and major powers' intentions are opaque. This volatility poses a significant challenge for smaller nations, requiring them to adapt their security strategies to maximize immediate advantages in a rapidly changing environment.
