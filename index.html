          <p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Istanbul for the first direct peace talks since the beginning of the war, though expectations for significant breakthroughs were low. President Zelensky sent a delegation led by his defense minister out of respect for President Trump and President Erdogan. The article notes the skepticism surrounding the talks, with some viewing them as a tactic by President Putin to gain favor with President Trump and potentially pressure Ukraine into unfavorable concessions. It is also mentioned that Russia has concentrated troops near the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine for a renewed offensive, indicating a lack of seriousness in the negotiations, with the Ukrainian officer on the eastern front near Lyman saying, ‚ÄúPutin is just playing for time.‚Äù</p>

          <p>President Trump stated his intention to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, expressing urgency to make the world a much safer place. He referenced the high number of casualties, estimating 5,000 young people are being killed every week on average, and expressed a desire to address serious situations including the conflict in Gaza where many people are starving. President Trump indicated that he would meet with Putin 'as soon as we can set it up' and suggested that within two or three weeks the world could be a much safer place. He also mentioned wanting to see his beautiful grandson, referencing the birth of his daughter Tiffany's son on Thursday.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are debating a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, facing scrutiny and amendments. The government quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year from 787 to 647. The bill has undergone significant changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off on each request, replacing it with a panel of experts. The debate includes amendments to ensure no obligation for medical staff to participate and to prevent doctors from discussing assisted death with under 18s unless the patient initiates the conversation.</p>

Putin has not traveled outside of Russia this year, and sent a team of mid-ranking officials to the Istanbul talks instead.</p>

Ten fire and rescue crews were called to tackle the blaze, which is now under control, but two firefighters lost their lives while battling the flames, and two more are seriously injured. The cause of the fire is currently unknown, and Oxfordshire County Council is supporting the families of the deceased firefighters.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of their tax bill, aiming to provide relief to retirees. This "bonus" is designed as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, a concept previously supported by President Trump. The deduction would be available to those 65 and over from 2025-2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples over $150,000. A median income retiree might see their taxes cut by a little less than $500 per year with this change (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The European Union is intensifying trade talks with the United States to avoid a looming 20% tariff on its trans-Atlantic exports, following similar deals struck by the US with China and the UK. While President Trump claims Europe is 'nastier than China', economic pressures may prevent him from pushing Brussels too far, according to analysts. The EU has threatened tariffs on $107 billion of US goods in response to earlier tariffs on aluminum, steel, and European automakers, but has paused them to allow negotiations to proceed. The EU is considering curbs on scrap steel and chemical exports to the US, but a speedy deal is doubtful, according to the Swedish Trade Minister.</p>

The Trump administration plans to rescind a Biden-era 'AI diffusion rule,' which imposed strict export controls, though concerns exist that this could allow sensitive technology to reach rivals like China.

          <p>Michelle Goldberg's article reflects on the Democratic Party's delayed acknowledgment of President Biden's declining condition, suggesting a failure of groupthink and risk aversion. While Biden's inner circle may have obscured the extent of his infirmity, it was evident to many voters, raising questions about why party insiders overlooked it. The author posits that gerontocracy in American politics and a focus on policy achievements within the White House bubble may have contributed to the denial. The article also criticizes the party's lack of decisive action even after Biden's poor debate performance, highlighting a need for more courage and less deference within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>President Trump's immigration policies are facing legal challenges in the courts, particularly regarding the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. Federal judges are grappling with the administration's claim that a criminal gang constitutes an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' under the law. While some judges have rejected this claim, citing historical context and the intent of the act, others have sided with the administration, leading to a split in judicial opinions. The Supreme Court has allowed deportations to continue for now, but has yet to weigh in on the broader legal question.</p>

          <p>The article discusses China's message on trade deals, emphasizing that multilateralism is the only viable approach. By holding discussions in Geneva, China signaled to the U.S. that resolving global trade concerns requires a multilateral effort involving the World Trade Organization (WTO). The presence of Li Chenggang, China's WTO ambassador, further underscored this message. Although tariffs were slashed, the article suggests that no bilateral deal was truly struck in Geneva, as the cuts were merely an attempt to rectify non-compliant measures with WTO rules.</p>
