        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th flash floods in Texas have been intermittently suspended due to new threatening weather. Officials in Kerr County, the area hit hardest, ordered volunteers to vacate the river area as the ground is already saturated and rivers are forecast to rise again. The initial flooding killed at least 130 people, including dozens of children at a summer camp, and around 160 people remain missing in the region. The ongoing dangerous conditions and difficult terrain continue to hamper the massive search effort involving local, state, and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>The city of San Francisco has announced it will provide Microsoft's Copilot AI, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o, to its 30,000 government workers. Mayor Daniel Lurie stated the initiative aims to improve city services by allowing employees like nurses and social workers to handle administrative tasks more efficiently. The decision follows a successful six-month pilot program involving over 2,000 workers, which demonstrated productivity gains of up to five hours per week. The city will leverage its existing Microsoft license, incurring no additional cost for the AI tool, which will assist with data analytics, report drafting, and language translation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During jury selection for a federal trial over a fatal 2019 crash involving a Tesla on Autopilot, the influence of CEO Elon Musk became a central issue. Several potential jurors expressed strong negative opinions about Musk, questioning their ability to remain impartial in a case against his company. The lawsuit, the first of its kind to go to trial, was filed by the family of a pedestrian killed in the incident. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue that Tesla shares responsibility for the crash due to a defective Autopilot system, while Tesla maintains the driver was distracted and at fault.</p>

          <p>Social media platform Reddit is introducing age verification for UK users to restrict access to mature content for those under 18. This measure is in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates robust age-checking techniques for sites with adult material and comes into force on July 25. An external firm, Persona, will handle the verification process using selfies or government-issued IDs, with Reddit only retaining the user's verification status and date of birth. Companies failing to comply with the new rules face significant fines or potential service blockages from UK internet providers.</p>

          <p>MasterChef presenter John Torode has publicly confirmed he is the individual alleged to have used racist language, an allegation upheld in an inquiry into his co-host Gregg Wallace's behavior. In a statement, Torode said the incident allegedly occurred in 2018 or 2019 and that he has no recollection of it, though he apologized for any offense caused. This revelation is part of a broader investigation by production company Banijay, which substantiated 45 allegations against Wallace for inappropriate conduct. Torode emphasized that he finds any form of racial language wholly unacceptable and is shocked by the claim.</p>

The ruling stays a preliminary injunction that had ordered the administration to halt mass layoffs and restore nearly 1,400 jobs. While not a final decision on the case, this allows the administration to continue its downsizing while the legal challenge from states and school districts proceeds. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the decision threatens the separation of powers by allowing the executive branch to effectively repeal statutes by firing necessary personnel.</p>

The use of an automated signing device has been a point of contention, with President Trump claiming that pardons signed in this manner are void.

The mapping process can be influenced by political pressures, and its reliance on historical data doesn't always reflect current climate realities and development patterns.

          <p>A 57-year-old farm worker, Jaime Alanís, has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Ventura County, California. His family described him as a hardworking and innocent man who was the sole provider for his wife and daughter. The incident occurred during a large-scale operation at Glass House Farms where hundreds of workers were arrested. While DHS claims Alanís was not being pursued, his death marks the first known fatality during the Trump administration's enhanced immigration enforcement in the region, which has sparked widespread protest.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for freezing over $6 billion in federal education funding. The lawsuit claims the administration abruptly withheld the previously approved funds just weeks before the new school year, creating an impossible financial situation for school districts. The frozen grants support a wide range of K-12 and adult education programs, including professional development for teachers and services for English language learners. Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the move and urged the administration to release the funds immediately.</p>

He emphasized the indispensability of the iPhone as a core reason to remain invested in the company. The defense comes as Apple's stock has underperformed this year, down nearly 16.5%, fueling debate among investors about the company's future leadership and innovation pipeline.

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Trump has pledged to make new U.S. weapons available to Ukraine through a deal with NATO allies. Under the plan, the U.S. will sell military equipment, including Patriot air defense systems, to NATO members, who will then provide them to Kyiv, with European nations covering the cost. Simultaneously, Trump issued a 50-day deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, threatening 100% secondary tariffs on Russia and its trading partners if the deadline is not met. This dual approach marks a tougher stance on Russia while still avoiding direct U.S. financial commitment to arming Ukraine.</p>

Officials attribute the positive trend to billions in spending and an increased focus on clearing encampments and moving individuals into temporary shelter.
