          <p>Aimee Betro, a woman from Wisconsin, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder following a failed assassination attempt in Birmingham, UK, in 2019. Hired as part of a feud, Betro attempted to shoot a man at point-blank range, but her gun jammed, allowing the intended victim to escape unharmed. Disguised in a niqab, she was part of a plot involving co-conspirators who had a dispute with the target's family. The jury convicted her on multiple charges, including conspiracy and illegal importation of ammunition, after nearly 21 hours of deliberation.</p>

          <p>School district records released after a lengthy legal battle reveal the gradual decline of the Uvalde school shooter, Salvador Ramos, from a motivated kindergartener to a troubled high school dropout. The documents show a history of escalating behavioral issues, suspensions, and academic failure, culminating in his withdrawal from school seven months before the 2022 massacre that killed 19 children and two teachers. While the files offer more detail on the gunman's background, they provide few new revelations about the widely criticized police response to the attack. The release is part of thousands of pages of documents obtained by media organizations.</p>

          <p>Following a shooting at the NFL headquarters where the perpetrator requested his brain be studied for CTE, neuroscientist Chris Nowinski discussed the state of research into the degenerative brain disease. Nowinski, who co-founded the world's largest brain bank for CTE at Boston University, explained the process of acquiring brains for study and the challenges in linking CTE directly to violent acts. He noted that while the NFL has made some safety changes, the issue has faded from public view due to a fractured media landscape and the league's influence. Nowinski expressed concern that youth and college football have not adopted similar safety protocols.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer Dillian Whyte has voiced his support for a potential fight between two-time world champion Anthony Joshua and YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul. Whyte stated that if the matchup makes business sense and generates large numbers, it should happen, noting Joshua could earn a significant purse. While preparing for his own fight against Moses Itauma, Whyte also emphasized that he has "unfinished business" with Joshua. A planned 2023 rematch between the two was canceled after Whyte failed a drug test, an issue he has since been cleared of.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence has become a significant tool in K-12 education, with nearly a third of teachers using it weekly to save time on administrative work like creating assignments and grading. Platforms like MagicSchool AI are now used by millions of educators, while large school districts are rolling out chatbots like Google's Gemini for tutoring and classroom activities. This rapid adoption occurs alongside concerns about students using AI to cheat and the potential for AI-generated errors in curriculum materials. The trend is being accelerated by federal initiatives and partnerships between tech companies and teachers unions.</p>

Zelenskyy stated that intelligence indicates Russia is redeploying troops for new attacks, not a ceasefire.

          <p>Marine researchers have discovered a massive and previously unknown deep-sea ecosystem in the hadal zone between Russia and Alaska, spanning roughly 1,550 miles. This community of life, including unique clam and tube worm species, thrives in total darkness by using chemosynthesis, converting methane and other chemicals from seafloor vents into energy. The finding suggests that such ecosystems may be more common in deep oceanic trenches than previously thought. It also indicates that these trenches play a more significant role in the global carbon cycle, acting as recycling centers for methane.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden achieved a significant legal victory as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled his lawsuit against the NFL can proceed in civil court. The 5-2 decision rejected the NFL's argument that the dispute should be handled through internal arbitration, a process where the league could appoint the arbitrator. Gruden's lawsuit alleges the NFL maliciously leaked racist, homophobic, and sexist emails he wrote before he was a league employee, leading to his resignation in 2021. This ruling allows Gruden to pursue his case for reputational damage against the league and Commissioner Roger Goodell publicly.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that lung cancer is a grossly undercounted "hidden epidemic" across sub-Saharan Africa, where official statistics fail to capture the true scale of the problem. Due to a lack of resources and training, lung cancer is often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, which is prevalent in the region. This delays or prevents proper treatment, leading to high mortality rates that go unrecorded. While South Africa reports higher numbers, experts say this is because it has better diagnostic capabilities, not necessarily a higher incidence, highlighting a systemic failure to address non-communicable diseases across the continent.</p>

Workers who campaigned for the original ballot initiative describe the repeal as a "literal gut punch," forcing them to choose between their health and their income.
