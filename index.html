          <p>Elon Musk plans to significantly reduce his involvement in the US government's advisory body, the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge), following a substantial decline in Tesla's profits and sales. Musk's reduced role comes after accusations that his focus has shifted away from Tesla. The company reported a 20% drop in car sales and a 70% decrease in profits, attributing some of the challenges to changing political sentiment and Trump's tariffs on Chinese-made parts. Musk intends to allocate more time to Tesla while remaining available to the Trump administration in a reduced capacity.</p>

          <p>Eni Aluko asserts her broadcasting career has suffered since she publicly stood up to Joey Barton, citing a lack of TV opportunities in the past 18 months. Aluko faced threats and abuse on social media after Barton posted defamatory statements about her, including claims of financial corruption and using the "race card." She believes there is a double standard in the industry, with limited opportunities for female broadcasters, and that Barton's actions aim to push women off television.
