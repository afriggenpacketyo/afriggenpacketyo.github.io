          <p>A U.S. District Court Judge has accused the Trump administration of attempting to bypass legal protections for asylum seekers by deporting a group of non-Ghanaian migrants to Ghana. The judge expressed concern that these individuals, who have legal protections against being sent to their home countries due to fears of persecution, could now be deported there from Ghana. Attorneys for the migrants argued that the U.S. has a responsibility to prevent this, while the Justice Department claimed it cannot control the actions of the Ghanaian government. The judge ordered the administration to report on its efforts to ensure the deportees' safety.</p>

Quarterback Gio Lopez contributed three touchdowns, two through the air and one on the ground, while freshman Demon June rushed for 148 yards. The Tar Heels' defense was dominant, limiting Richmond to just 199 total yards and forcing three turnovers, including a fumble returned for a touchdown.

          <p>California lawmakers have approved a controversial bill designed to stabilize the state's energy market by allowing up to 2,000 new oil wells annually in Kern County. The measure, part of a deal brokered by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to counter the economic impact of planned refinery closures and rising gas prices. In exchange for the increased onshore production, the bill tightens regulations on offshore drilling and extends the state's cap-and-trade climate program. While proponents argue it is a necessary compromise for energy affordability, environmental groups and some progressive Democrats have condemned it as a giveaway to the oil industry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has launched a new pilot program to accelerate the integration of electric air taxis, also known as eVTOL aircraft. The initiative aims to establish new regulations and partnerships with private companies and local governments to foster American leadership in this emerging aviation sector. The three-year program will involve at least five pilot projects focusing on cargo delivery, emergency response, and eventually passenger transport. Companies like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation have already announced their intent to participate, which will allow them to test their aircraft before completing the full FAA certification process.</p>

          <p>In response to historic droughts that have severely restricted global trade, the Panama Canal Authority is launching a multi-billion dollar infrastructure plan to ensure future water supply. The projects include building a new dam and tunnel system to supplement water levels in Lake Gatun, which is essential for the canal's lock operations. Additionally, a "land bridge" featuring a natural gas pipeline will be constructed to transport energy products across the isthmus without relying on the waterway.

          <p>NATO members Romania and Poland both activated their air defenses in response to Russian drone activity near their borders with Ukraine. Romania's defense ministry reported a drone breached its airspace during a Russian attack on Ukrainian infrastructure, prompting the scrambling of F-16 fighter jets. Concurrently, Poland placed its military on high alert and deployed aircraft as Russian drones struck targets in Ukraine close to its territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described these incidents as a deliberate expansion of the war by Russia and called for stronger international sanctions and defense cooperation.</p>

          <p>The Sikh community, which constitutes a significant portion of the U.S. trucking industry, is facing a wave of fear and harassment following a fatal crash in Florida involving a Sikh driver. The incident has been used to target the community, with drivers reporting increased verbal abuse and racial slurs at truck stops. The crash also prompted the U.S. Secretary of State to pause work visas for foreign commercial drivers and has amplified concerns over stricter language proficiency requirements.

          <p>The UK's financial regulator has proposed allowing banks and card providers to set their own limits for contactless payments, potentially removing the current £100 cap entirely. This move has ignited a debate about consumer spending habits and security, as academics warn that eliminating the PIN requirement for larger purchases could lead to more impulsive spending and debt accumulation. While proponents argue the change aligns with the unlimited nature of mobile wallet payments, charities express concern about the potential for increased financial abuse. Banks have indicated they would allow customers to set their own personal limits if the proposal is adopted.</p>

Head coach Keith Andrews defends the tactic against accusations of being unsophisticated, emphasizing that any method that creates scoring chances is a valid tool.

The proposal, which would hinge on a request from Louisiana's Republican governor, outlines a mobilization lasting until September 2026 to supplement local police in high-crime areas. This plan is part of President Trump's broader focus on crime in cities, a strategy that critics have described as a political show of force rather than an effective crime-fighting measure.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old mother in North Carolina has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and negligent child abuse after her four young daughters, ages 2, 4, 6, and 7, died in a house fire. Authorities allege that Reagan Powers left the children unsupervised at home when the fire broke out in the early morning. When the first deputy arrived, the residence was already fully engulfed in flames, making entry impossible. The children's father expressed his profound grief, stating his heart was "shattered beyond words" by the tragic loss of his daughters.</p>

          <p>A staffer for Mexico's ruling party has resigned following public backlash over comments he made on a national news program about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The staffer, Salvador Ramírez, made remarks that were interpreted as justifying the killing, prompting a swift online response and an apparent threat from a U.S. official regarding visa statuses. The television network, Milenio, issued a public apology for broadcasting the comments. This incident is part of a broader trend where individuals have faced professional consequences for commentary deemed disrespectful in the wake of Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>Medical officials in Gaza report that at least 32 people, including 12 children, have been killed in a recent barrage of Israeli airstrikes across Gaza City. Israel has escalated its offensive in the area, which it describes as Hamas's last major stronghold, and has ordered residents to evacuate. The strikes have destroyed multiple high-rise buildings and residential homes, with one attack reportedly killing a family of ten. Despite the evacuation orders, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remain in the city, facing dire humanitarian conditions and the ongoing bombardment.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that bullet casings found at the scene of Charlie Kirk's murder were engraved with messages referencing internet memes, video games, and anti-fascist history. The inscriptions included the emoticon "OwO," associated with the furry subculture, a sequence of arrows that summons a bomb in the video game Helldivers 2, and lyrics from the Italian anti-fascist anthem "Bella Ciao." Experts caution that these "extremely online" references are often used ironically or as bait to mislead investigators and the public.

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar who reside in camps along the border. This policy shift is a response to severe cuts in international humanitarian aid, particularly from the United States, which have led to food shortages and rising malnutrition in the camps. The move is intended to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families, while also potentially filling labor shortages in the local economy. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a positive step that could set a regional benchmark for refugee rights.</p>

Ukraine asserts that nearly 20,000 children have been abducted, a figure Russia disputes, claiming the children were "rescued." The issue has become a key point in peace negotiations, with Ukraine demanding their return as a precondition for any ceasefire. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and his children's rights commissioner for the alleged war crime of unlawful deportation of children.</p>

Reports have explored Robinson's background as a student in an apprenticeship program with Republican parents, though his personal political views are unknown. In the absence of a clear motive, the shooting has been leveraged by commentators on both sides of the political spectrum to criticize opposing ideologies and assign collective blame.</p>
