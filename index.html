          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating improved conditions for immigrant detainees at a facility in Manhattan. The order requires ICE to provide sleeping mats, hygiene products, and better access to legal counsel, while also limiting the number of people held at the site. This ruling follows a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocates who described the conditions as inhumane, citing a lack of beds, medication, and adequate meals. The judge's decision has been praised by civil liberties groups as a necessary check on the treatment of detainees.</p>

While acknowledging signals from Russia about a potential willingness to end the war, Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine will not cede any territory, particularly the Donbas region. He expressed concern that a bilateral meeting between the US and Russian leaders would primarily benefit Putin by providing him with a photo opportunity and a platform.

The incident occurred Monday morning, prompting a large-scale emergency response from numerous local fire departments and EMS services. Officials have confirmed the recovery of a previously missing employee, bringing the death toll to two, and are investigating the cause of the blasts which originated in a mechanical regulator room. The plant, the largest coke manufacturing facility in the U.S., has been stabilized, and a temporary stay-at-home order for nearby residents has been lifted.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors are set to file new corruption charges against City Councilman Curren Price, adding to an existing case involving grand theft, perjury, and conflict of interest. The original charges, filed in 2023, allege that Price voted on projects that financially benefited his wife's consulting firm. The new charges reportedly involve similar conduct related to votes on contracts for the city's transportation and housing authorities. Price's attorney has dismissed the new allegations as an attempt to bolster a "weak case," arguing there is no evidence the councilman was aware of the alleged conflicts.</p>

The rally highlights the growing mobilization of local unions to protect their members and challenge federal immigration enforcement tactics in the city.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a plan to conduct a comprehensive review of exhibitions and materials at eight major Smithsonian museums. The stated goal is to ensure the content aligns with President Trump's directive to "celebrate American exceptionalism" and remove what it deems divisive or partisan narratives. This review, part of a March executive order, will examine curatorial processes and public-facing content ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary. The Smithsonian Institution responded by affirming its commitment to scholarly excellence and the factual presentation of history, stating it will collaborate constructively with the administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting was announced by Trump after a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire passed, and it follows several unsuccessful rounds of talks. The choice of Alaska, once a Russian territory, adds historical resonance to the summit, which the White House has described as a "listening exercise" for the president. Ukraine will not be present at the meeting, raising concerns from President Zelenskyy that any agreements made without Kyiv's participation will be ineffective.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed the Sonya Massey Act into law, which mandates more comprehensive background checks for law enforcement applicants across the state. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct at previous jobs. The new law requires police agencies to review all prior employment records, including disciplinary issues and fitness-for-duty examinations, before making a hiring decision. The measure, which passed with bipartisan support, aims to prevent officers with problematic histories from serving in law enforcement and to rebuild community trust.</p>

          <p>A federal trial in California is examining the legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement, a move California argues is unconstitutional. The case, which began in response to troops being used in Los Angeles during immigration protests, has gained new urgency as the administration deploys the Guard in Washington D.C. Attorneys for California contend the military is being illegally integrated with civilian law enforcement, while the Justice Department claims a "Constitutional exception" to the Posse Comitatus Act. The trial is seen as a crucial test of whether courts can limit the president's expanding use of military forces on American streets.</p>

An academic paper highlights an early phase of the conflict where Russia conducted widespread jamming of satellite navigation systems, including the US GPS, Europe's Galileo, and China's own Beidou system. This event, described as a major electronic warfare engagement between global powers, provided a valuable opportunity for China to observe the effects of such jamming on its systems and to analyze the subsequent counter-jamming efforts led by the United States.</p>

This proposal has alarmed many economists, who view it as a partisan move that could undermine the integrity of crucial economic data used by investors and policymakers. The nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous BLS commissioner, whom he accused of "rigging" the numbers after a report showed slowing job growth.</p>

The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning and predicts the Mendenhall River will crest at a new record level on Wednesday.

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's political tactics consistently place his opponents in dilemmas with no good options, thereby challenging democratic norms. For example, Democrats who advocated for fair redistricting are now considering gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts, creating a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" scenario. The piece cites other examples, such as the decision to prosecute a former president and how to respond to his use of the National Guard, where any choice carries significant risks.

          <p>The U.S. Army has charged Sgt. Quornelius Radford with multiple counts of attempted premeditated murder and aggravated assault following a shooting at Fort Stewart, Georgia, that injured five soldiers. One of the charges includes a domestic violence specification, as prosecutors revealed one of the victims was Radford's "intimate partner." Radford, who used his personal weapon in the attack, made his first appearance in a military courtroom and will remain in pretrial confinement. The motive for the shooting has not been disclosed, but the charges provide new insight into the circumstances surrounding the incident at the major Army post.</p>

          <p>DermaRite Industries has voluntarily recalled four of its over-the-counter skin-cleansing products and one anti-itch lotion due to potential microbial contamination. The products may be contaminated with Burkholderia cepacia, a bacteria that can cause serious and potentially life-threatening infections, especially for individuals with compromised immune systems. The recalled items include DermaKleen, DermaSarra, KleenFoam, and PeriGiene, which are often used in healthcare settings. The company has notified its distributors and customers to destroy all affected products, although it has not yet received any reports of adverse events related to the recall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce admitted in a recent interview that his on-field performance has not met his own high standards over the past two seasons. He suggested that his focus may have "slipped a little bit" due to his increasing off-field activities, which include hosting television shows, acting roles, and his popular podcast. Kelce, whose relationship with Taylor Swift has also brought him into a brighter spotlight, fell short of 1,000 receiving yards in the last two seasons after seven consecutive years of reaching that milestone. He expressed a strong motivation to return to his top form for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Shares of Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, dropped over 5% in extended trading after the company announced a public offering of 10 million Class A shares.

          <p>Following the ouster of its long-standing dictatorship, Syria is now facing the monumental task of rebuilding its shattered economy. A new government formed by former opposition fighters is trying to manage a severe financial crisis, hampered by a significant lack of liquidity. The United States has provided a potential boost by lifting most sanctions, a move intended to support the country's recovery efforts. However, the path to a functioning economy remains fraught with challenges after years of conflict, corruption, and systemic destruction under the previous regime.</p>

          <p>This article details the legal framework governing President Trump's deployment of the National Guard and federal takeover of the D.C. police. Under the Home Rule Act, the president can assume control of the city's police in an emergency, a power now being exercised. The 800 D.C. National Guard troops are activated under Title 32, which grants them arrest powers but officials state their current mission is to support law enforcement, not lead it. This deployment is distinct from the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the U.S. military's domestic law enforcement role, creating a unique and complex situation in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>A review of the play "Berta, Berta" at the Echo Theater Company highlights the powerful connection between the performance and its audience, particularly during a designated "Black Out" night. The play, set in 1923 Mississippi, tells the intense story of two lovers torn apart by the brutal realities of the Jim Crow South. The critic, who is white, notes that attending the performance with a predominantly Black audience provided a unique perspective, making the historical throughline of oppression and resilience feel immediate and deeply resonant. The production is praised for its mythic scope and the emotionally charged performances of its two leads.</p>
