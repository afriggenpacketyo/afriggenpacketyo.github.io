          <p>Singapore's economy experienced stronger-than-expected growth in the third quarter, expanding by 2.9% year-on-year, surpassing economists' predictions of 1.9%. Despite this positive performance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has issued a warning that economic growth is projected to moderate in 2026, aligning with external developments and a normalization of activity in trade-related sectors. Manufacturing and construction sectors saw a slowdown, while global investment in artificial intelligence is expected to support the manufacturing sector. The central bank also forecasts core inflation to ease in the near term before gradually rising.</p>

          <p>China has commenced mass production of the world's first ultra-low noise, four-channel single-photon detector, a breakthrough poised to impact quantum communication and national defense. This 'photon catcher' device can detect individual photons, making it crucial for technologies like quantum radar, which could track stealth aircraft such as the F-22. The Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui province achieved this feat, highlighting China's advancements in cutting-edge quantum technologies. This development signifies a major step in China's strategic technological capabilities.</p>

Amazon cited violations of company conduct and acceptable use policies, alleging misuse of company resources for non-work-related messages regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. Shahrour views his firing as retaliation designed to silence Palestinian voices and shield Amazon's involvement in the conflict. This incident follows similar actions by other tech giants like Microsoft and Google against employees protesting their ties to the Israeli military, highlighting growing activism within the tech industry.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its mammoth Starship rocket on its 11th test flight, aiming to complete a journey halfway around the world and release mock satellites. The booster separated as planned, entering the Gulf of Mexico, while the spacecraft skimmed space before descending towards the Indian Ocean. This test flight, originating from Starbase in Texas, incorporated more maneuvering for the spacecraft, practicing for future landings. Elon Musk intends for Starship, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, to transport humans to Mars, and NASA relies on it for lunar missions by the decade's end.</p>

          <p>The Scottish National Party (SNP) is demonstrating a significant political resurgence, challenging earlier predictions of deep trouble after a substantial loss in the general election. Under First Minister John Swinney, the party has regained stability, and support among rivals has fragmented, positioning the SNP to potentially secure a majority in Holyrood. While a majority would be a remarkable achievement, enabling their argument for another independence referendum, the UK government remains opposed. The article notes that the SNP's enduring support is rooted in Scotland's near 50/50 split on the constitutional question, allowing them to defy conventional political gravity.</p>

          <p>Several leading US news organizations, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and CNN, have formally refused to sign the Pentagon's new policy that restricts journalists' access and prohibits obtaining unauthorized information. This policy, introduced by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is widely criticized for undermining First Amendment protections and stifling press freedom. News outlets argue it creates unnecessary constraints on reporting about the military and could expose journalists to prosecution for doing their jobs. The Pentagon maintains the policy is for national security, but media associations view it as an unprecedented act of intimidation.</p>

          <p>A UK minister has refuted claims that National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell influenced the collapse of the China spy case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry. Security Minister Jarvis stated that Powell was not involved in decisions about evidence content, despite participating in national security discussions. The charges were dropped because prosecutors deemed that China had not been classified as a "national security threat" at the time of the alleged offenses, a requirement exposed by a legal precedent. Jarvis attributed the case's failure to antiquated legislation and criticized the previous government for not updating security laws sooner.</p>
