          <p>The Trump administration is evaluating whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible or if military action may be necessary. Despite heightened rhetoric, U.S. officials believe Iran is in a weak position and could be compelled to negotiate on nuclear enrichment. The U.S. is seeking concrete commitments from Iran before de-escalating, with potential for high-level meetings if Iran agrees to drop uranium enrichment. The U.S. military is deploying assets to the region, including additional aircraft and a second aircraft carrier, while maintaining a defensive posture to protect American troops.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced their sharpest decline in eight months, falling 1.7% year-over-year in May, primarily due to a significant drop in shipments to the United States. Exports to the U.S. decreased by 11.1%, with automobile exports to the U.S. plummeting by 24.7%. The Bank of Japan noted that this trade slowdown is likely to moderate the country's economic growth. This decline in exports contributed to Japan's GDP shrinking by 0.2% in the first quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An L.A. County supervisor, Kathryn Barger, expressed concerns that some individuals detaining residents may not be immigration officials but rather impersonators. Barger recounted an incident involving a staff member's godson who was pulled over by men in an unmarked car, raising questions about their authenticity. The discussion occurred during a board meeting addressing the impact of recent immigration raids on the county's economy. Supervisors also considered supporting a state law to ban law enforcement, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks while on duty.</p>
