          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a slight dip following the release of mixed first-quarter results and a cautious outlook for the current period. The company's CFO, Jeff Hoffmeister, addressed concerns about President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, noting that the expiration of a favorable trade loophole is not expected to significantly impact Shopify in the near term, as only a small percentage of its gross merchandise volume is related to affected imports. Hoffmeister also highlighted that Shopify's consumer base tends to be higher-income, making them less sensitive to potential price fluctuations. The company is actively monitoring data to support merchants and adapt to potential market changes.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, in an interview on ABC's "The View," expressed his belief that sexism and racism contributed to Vice President Kamala Harris's defeat in the 2024 presidential election. Biden defended Harris's qualifications, emphasizing the consistent campaign to undermine the notion of a woman, particularly a woman of mixed race, leading the country. He also mentioned ongoing self-reflection and plans to write a book, while acknowledging Harris's difficult decision regarding her future political involvement, including potential gubernatorial or presidential ambitions.

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to cut funding for over 1,000 AmeriCorps grant programs has triggered widespread criticism and legal action. Impacted organizations argue that these cuts, disproportionately affecting states and communities that supported Trump in the 2024 election, will cause significant damage to vital community assistance projects. The programs targeted include child abuse prevention, rural education, flood relief, and urban safety initiatives. Lawsuits have been filed, contending that the cuts threaten the livelihood of AmeriCorps staff and jeopardize critical support for communities nationwide, particularly in impoverished and rural areas. The administration defends the cuts by citing AmeriCorps's history of failed audits and alleged waste of taxpayer dollars.</p>

Despite claims of not seeking further escalation, both nations continued to accuse each other of aggression, with reports of drone strikes, missile attacks, and civilian panic in border cities.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will cease tracking the financial costs of weather disasters linked to the climate crisis, citing shifting priorities and staffing changes.

          <p>Bill Gates announced that the Gates Foundation will close its doors permanently on Dec. 31, 2045, committing over $200 billion to health and human development in the meantime. This decision comes amid the Trump administration’s cuts to foreign aid and a changing landscape in philanthropy. Gates expressed concern over the reduction in global giving and the potential for millions of additional childhood deaths due to these cuts. Despite the challenges, he remains optimistic about the potential for innovation and the importance of the Golden Rule.</p>

          <p>A new law in Washington state requires priests to report child abuse disclosed during confessions, sparking outrage from the Catholic Church and prompting a federal investigation. The Seattle Archdiocese has threatened to excommunicate priests who comply with the law, while the Justice Department has labeled the legislation "anti-Catholic." The law, which applies to all clergy, aims to protect children, but critics argue that it violates religious freedom and the sanctity of confession. Supporters of the law emphasize the need to end cycles of abuse and ensure that children receive help when they ask for it.</p>

          <p>Several states are trying to revive Medicaid work requirements, a move that is causing concern among low-income Americans who rely on the program for health insurance. These requirements, which were previously blocked by courts, would mandate that Medicaid recipients work to maintain their coverage. Advocates argue that these policies are simply a tactic to reduce Medicaid enrollment and save money, while critics contend that they will lift low-income individuals out of poverty by motivating them to get jobs. Studies have shown that most eligible adults on Medicaid are already working or are exempt due to disabilities or caregiving responsibilities.</p>
