          <p>Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve received a one-game suspension and a fine for her conduct during and after an 84-76 loss to the Phoenix Mercury. Her actions included aggressively confronting an official, failing to leave the court promptly after ejection, making inappropriate comments to fans, and criticizing officiating in a post-game press conference. This marks a believed first in WNBA history for a coach suspended from a playoff game. The incident stemmed from a controversial no-call on a game-sealing steal, which Reeve called "fucking malpractice."</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel stated that 274 plainclothes agents were deployed to the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, after the riot began, for crowd control—a role he claims is against FBI standards. Patel accused former Director Christopher Wray of lying to Congress by not disclosing the agents' presence, despite a Justice Department Inspector General report finding no evidence of undercover agents inciting violence. Former President Trump also called for Wray to explain the deployment, suggesting agents might have acted as agitators. This article highlights ongoing controversy regarding the FBI's involvement in the January 6 events.</p>

          <p>Europe has secured a commanding 11½–4½ lead against the United States going into the final day's singles matches at the Ryder Cup, needing only 2.5 more points to retain the trophy. This historic lead marks Europe's largest ever pre-singles advantage. The event was marred by unsportsmanlike conduct from American galleries, who directed "thuggish, moronic, and personal insults" at European players like Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, leading to ejections. Despite the controversy, Europe's exceptional performance has positioned them for a decisive victory.</p>

Garcia-Hernandez, a Mexican national in the U.S. without legal status, is on life support, shackled despite being unconscious, making family visits difficult. The shooting killed one detainee and injured another, with authorities identifying the shooter as Joshua Jahn, who died of self-inflicted wounds, targeting ICE agents. Gauffeny hopes for increased security at such facilities and worries about her family's future without their primary income earner.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler experienced an unprecedented poor performance at the Ryder Cup, losing his first four matches and becoming the first American to do so. Despite his dominant individual season, Scheffler's game faltered in the team format, exposing weaknesses in his putting that are usually masked in stroke play. The article suggests that the Ryder Cup's intense, high-pressure environment, which demands clutch moments rather than consistent accumulation, proved challenging for the usually composed golfer. His struggles highlight how even top-ranked players can be overwhelmed by the unique demands of this prestigious team competition.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the swing vote on pivotal cases. Kennedy expresses deep concern about the current state of American democracy, citing the replacement of reasoned discourse with antagonism, and even worries about the tone of some Supreme Court opinions. He details his evolving views on same-sex marriage and abortion, emphasizing that "liberty must be understood over time" and that a moral wrong isn't always a legal one. Kennedy also recounts a touching reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia before his death.</p>

          <p>Devastating floods in Arizona have resulted in at least four fatalities, with three deaths reported in Globe and one in suburban Phoenix.

          <p>Swiss citizens are voting on Sunday on a revised proposal to introduce electronic identity cards, after a similar plan was rejected in 2021 due to privacy concerns. The new proposal ensures the system remains public, stores data on users' smartphones, and is optional, with traditional ID cards still available. Supporters argue it will streamline online bureaucratic procedures, while opponents fear potential privacy erosion and data misuse for tracking or marketing. Despite Switzerland's strong privacy traditions, recent opinion polls suggest voters might now be more open to the e-ID, possibly influenced by their positive experience with Covid ID.</p>

          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of ongoing debate and skepticism within the scientific community. While some users report benefits like brighter skin and stronger hair, dermatologists question whether orally ingested collagen peptides can effectively reach and stimulate collagen production in the skin. Consultant dermatologists recommend marine collagen over vegan options due to its Type 1 collagen content, but emphasize that robust evidence is lacking, with industry-funded studies often showing more positive results than independent research. Experts suggest sun protection, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking are far more impactful for skin health.</p>

          <p>Bali, once idealized as a tropical paradise, is increasingly facing disillusionment from tourists who find the reality of crowds, traffic, and construction starkly different from its Instagrammable image. A post-pandemic tourism surge, expected to hit record numbers this year, has strained the island's infrastructure and environment. Recent deadly floods, exacerbated by poor waste management and unchecked development, prompted the local government to restrict new construction. This article highlights the challenge of balancing economic benefits from tourism with preserving Bali's cultural richness and natural beauty, urging travelers to engage more responsibly with destinations.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a major Category 5 storm, is swirling north of the Caribbean, with forecasts indicating it won't make landfall.

This phenomenon involves two storms merging or rotating around a common center. While unlikely for Humberto and the weaker Imelda to fully merge, their interaction could slightly alter their projected paths. The region, including the Bahamas and parts of the southeastern U.S., is bracing for potential heavy rainfall and flooding from Imelda.</p>

          <p>California faces a chronic housing shortage, a consensus acknowledged by state government and academics, yet the precise scale of the problem remains elusive, with estimates ranging from 56,000 to 3.5 million units. This article highlights the complexities in quantifying the "housing you need," as different methodologies, data vagaries, and definitions of affordability lead to varied figures. Despite the numerical discrepancies, experts agree the shortage is substantial, necessitating aggressive policy changes to address the crisis. The state's Department of Housing and Community Development issues its own planning goals every eight years, providing official estimates for regional housing needs.</p>

The settlement marks another legal and financial setback for Giuliani, who has also been disbarred and ordered to pay millions to defamed election workers, highlighting the severe consequences of spreading false information.</p>
