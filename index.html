          <p>Gilead Sciences has agreed to a $202 million settlement with the U.S. government and several states to resolve claims that the company provided kickbacks to doctors through speaker programs. These programs, which ran from 2011 to 2017, allegedly incentivized doctors to prescribe Gilead's HIV medications, violating the Anti-Kickback Statute and resulting in false claims to federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Prosecutors contend that Gilead spent millions on speaker fees, meals, and travel to influence prescriptions, leading to substantial reimbursements for tainted prescriptions. Gilead stated the agreement was to avoid litigation costs, asserting that its speaker programs educated healthcare professionals on the appropriate use of its HIV medicines.</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation held steady at 2.4%, marking a four-year low and aligning with expectations. The most significant price increases were observed in housing, education, and food, offset by decreases in recreation, culture, and household goods. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) previously cut rates to 4.1% due to softening inflation since its peak in late 2022. Economists anticipate continued economic growth and a strong labor market, although global uncertainties persist. The inflation data was released as Australia prepared for an election, with the Labor Party holding a slight lead in polls.</p>

          <p>One hundred days into his second term, President Trump's proposed reciprocal tariffs, especially on China, are raising concerns among economists. They warn that these tariffs, intended to lower prices and create jobs, could instead disrupt global supply chains and trigger a recession. Trump's announcement of tariffs in April caused significant market instability, and although he paused them for 90 days, uncertainty remains. Experts suggest that the tariffs are unlikely to achieve their goals and could harm American consumers and businesses, potentially leading to a financial panic reminiscent of 2008.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity contracted in April, falling to a near two-year low as the trade war with the U.S. intensifies. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped below the 50-level threshold, indicating contraction for the first time since January. The decline is attributed to escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S., with cumulative new tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods. Experts warn of severely disrupted trade flows between the two countries and potential impacts on China's GDP and manufacturing jobs, despite some tariff exemptions granted by both governments.</p>

While a 25% tariff on imported vehicles remains, carmakers will be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, phased out over two years. The move aims to reduce the burden on U.S. manufacturers, although analysts say the policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers and their suppliers.</p>

          <p>The 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the only Black, all-female unit serving in Europe during World War II, received the Congressional Gold Medal at the U.S. Capitol. The unit, known as the "Six Triple Eight," processed a backlog of 17 million pieces of mail in three months before serving in France. The honor comes after years of campaigning for the overlooked battalion, with Speaker Mike Johnson presenting the award to the family of the unit commander. This recognition marks a significant milestone in acknowledging the contributions of Black women in the military.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly supported legislation that would make soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex a felony, disagreeing with fellow Democrats in the state Assembly who weakened the bill. Newsom emphasized that the law should treat all sex predators who solicit minors the same, regardless of the victim's age. Democrats had removed the felony charge for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds during a public safety committee hearing, prompting criticism from Republicans and raising questions about the party's priorities.</p>

          <p>Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party in Canada, lost his seat in Parliament to a Liberal political novice, a surprising upset attributed to his embrace of populist tactics. His support for the Freedom Convoy of 2022, which protested pandemic restrictions and occupied Ottawa, appears to have played a significant role in his defeat. Voters also expressed concerns about his alignment with President Trump's rhetoric and his style of attack politics. Poilievre's loss underscores the potential pitfalls of adopting divisive strategies.</p>

          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are sharply declining due to the Trump administration's tariffs, leading to warnings of potential supply shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%, prompting retailers to caution about impending gaps on store shelves. The Port of Los Angeles has reported a significant slowdown in cargo flow, and experts predict consumers could face out-of-stock situations by summer.
