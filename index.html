          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck Tennessee on Saturday morning, with tremors felt as far away as Atlanta, Georgia, and western North Carolina. The earthquake's epicenter was located approximately 12 miles from Greenback, Tennessee, which lies about 30 miles south of Knoxville. Residents reported feeling the shaking, and while earthquakes are not uncommon in the region's Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, this event reminded locals of a similar 4.4 magnitude earthquake that shook the area in 2018. The U.S. Geological Survey continues to monitor the situation, but initial reports indicate only minor damage.</p>

          <p>Yankees prospect Jasson Dominguez had a memorable Friday night, becoming the youngest Yankee to hit three home runs in a single game. What made this achievement even more remarkable was that Dominguez, a switch-hitter, hit home runs from both sides of the plate, joining a select group of players including Mickey Mantle and Eddie Murray. Dominguez's performance contributed to the Yankees' 10-2 victory over the Athletics, highlighting his potential and solidifying his place as a key player for the team. The article notes that Dominguez hits significantly better from the left side, making his home run from the right side a positive sign for his development.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland visited Kyiv, Ukraine, to jointly call on Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day unconditional cease-fire or face further sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors. The European leaders coordinated their efforts with the White House, and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha released a photo of the leaders speaking with President Trump. The visit underscored Europe's increasing role in resolving the conflict as the United States potentially pulls back, with leaders discussing ways to strengthen the Ukrainian military. The Kremlin dismissed the threat of new sanctions, indicating Russia's continued opposition to a cease-fire unless Western nations cease military aid to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>China is hosting a delegation of nearly 100 young and mid-career African military officers from 40 countries to deepen defense ties across the continent. The officers will visit top military academies in Beijing, Changsha, and Shaoshan to learn about China's military systems and modern technologies. Observers suggest that by engaging with future leaders of African armed forces, China is building lasting relationships and influence. This is the fourth such event organized by the Chinese defense ministry, highlighting China's strategic focus on strengthening its military partnerships in Africa.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying over President Donald Trump's tax agenda, with the House Ways and Means Committee releasing a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the package without Democratic support through a process called 'reconciliation,' but competing priorities and budget constraints could complicate the process. Key proposals under discussion could impact millions of Americans. The narrow Republican majority in the House is expected to make the process very difficult.</p>

          <p>The Labour government is set to unveil comprehensive immigration plans aimed at restoring control over the system, addressing public concerns about rising numbers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's White Paper will focus on strictly time-limiting work visas for non-graduate jobs, potentially restricting foreign students' ability to stay after graduation, and requiring overseas workers to demonstrate better English proficiency. Companies failing to prioritize UK-based staff recruitment may face restrictions on sponsoring foreign workers. The plans aim to link immigration more closely to the labor market, encouraging employers to invest in training and hiring domestic workers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, citing that Congress did not authorize the large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. The ruling sided with a coalition of unions, non-profits, and local governments, preventing mass layoffs known as 'reductions in force' for 14 days. The judge stated that the president may only broadly restructure federal agencies when authorized by Congress.
