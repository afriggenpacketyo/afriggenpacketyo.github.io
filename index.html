            <p>A shooting at Florida State University's Tallahassee campus resulted in two fatalities and six injuries. The suspect, identified as 20-year-old FSU student Phoenix Ikner, was shot by responding officers and taken into custody. The incident prompted the cancellation of classes and sporting events through the weekend, and authorities are investigating the motive behind the attack. President Trump addressed the shooting, reaffirming his support for the Second Amendment and calling the incident a "shame."</p>

            <p>A coroner's inquest into fatal crashes caused by drivers with impaired vision has prompted calls for stricter eyesight regulations for motorists in the UK. The coroner's report highlighted that the UK has some of the laxest visual standards enforcement in Europe, relying on self-reporting of visual conditions. The report has been sent to the Transport Secretary, urging action to prevent future deaths, and reassessment of the current rules is being considered as part of the government's road safety strategy.</p>

The detection is based on light collected from K2-18b's host star, and the presence of dimethyl sulfide is not definitively confirmed. Despite the excitement, much about K2-18b remains a mystery.</p>

Tariffs on goods from China and Canada are hurting farmers, small businesses, and consumers, while also dampening industrial investment.

            <p>New tariffs on imported vehicles and car parts are expected to push auto insurance rates higher. The tariffs increase the cost of repairs and maintenance, leading to higher expenses for auto insurers. This is because tariffs are pushing up the prices of parts, so the cost of maintenance and repairs are also poised to rise. As a result, consumers can expect to see their insurance premiums increase, even if they have liability-only coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

The case involved the disappearance of Aaron Friar and his daughter, Ellie, from their Medford home. Detective Bill Ford interviewed Russell Jones, who initially taunted investigators but eventually confessed to helping load Friar's body after being offered a cigarette. The confession ultimately led to the location of Friar's body in a rural mountain pass.</p>

            <p>David Cronenberg's new film, "The Shrouds," explores themes of grief and biotechnology, centering on a widower named Karsh who invents a system to watch the real-time decay of loved ones' corpses. Karsh's obsession leads to a techno-intrigue involving his wife's death and potential sabotage of his business. The film blends thriller elements with speculative conversations and erotic detours, creating a disquieting vision of the future where technology enhances and threatens our understanding of the body and death.</p>

Vasquez Sura maintains her husband is not a member of MS-13, and vows to continue fighting for his return home to the United States.

Under the U.S. plan, the yearslong war would be considered frozen, Ukrainian areas currently occupied by Russia would stay under the Vladimir Putin-led country's leadership, they said. Ukraine would not enter the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance better known as NATO, under the proposal, the sources said.</p>

            <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has upheld the Democratic governor's use of his veto power to lock in a 400-year school funding increase. The 4-3 ruling affirms the broad partial veto power of Wisconsin governors, allowing them to reshape spending bills passed by the Legislature. Gov. Tony Evers used a partial veto to extend a school funding increase until 2425, which was challenged by the Legislature and a business lobbying group. The court's decision has sparked debate over the extent of the governor's authority.</p>

Emphasizing education over class risks portraying political behavior as a function of intelligence or achievement, rather than economic interests. Democrats have focused their appeals on the edges of the working class (the very poor and the not-so-professional-class). Democrats are now seen as defenders of the status quo, representatives of the well-heeled and well-educated and totally unequipped to challenge Trump’s national-populist narrative.</p>
