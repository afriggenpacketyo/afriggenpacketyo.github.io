          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, pledging to resolve ongoing border disputes. This marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years, following deadly border clashes in 2020 that strained diplomatic ties. Both leaders emphasized focusing on economic development and rebuilding trust, signaling a potential reset in the relationship between the two Asian powers amid their respective trade tensions with the United States. The meeting highlights a strategic effort to stabilize relations and bolster regional cooperation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by researchers from the People's Liberation Army suggests that the complex undersea topography of the Paracel Islands could be used to create a sophisticated anti-submarine zone. The plan involves deploying intelligent sea mines in "acoustic shadow zones" created by submerged mountains, making them difficult for enemy sonar to detect. This strategy aims to enhance China's maritime security and challenge U.S. naval dominance in the contested South China Sea. The research highlights the increasing focus on leveraging natural geography for advanced underwater warfare capabilities in the region.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 03:57:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, has caused significant price increases and supply shortages. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled over the last decade, with tencha, the tea used for matcha, seeing its auction price jump 170% this year. The labor-intensive farming process and an aging agricultural workforce are creating a production bottleneck, forcing retailers to ration supplies. This has prompted major companies like Ito En to create dedicated divisions to manage the intense competition for sourcing and producing the popular green tea powder.</p>

          <p>As investors return from summer holidays, market analysis indicates a cautious outlook for September, which has historically been the weakest month for major stock indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones. Despite record highs in August, concerns about a potential economic slowdown in the second half of the year persist, although some experts remain optimistic about a long-term bull market. Key economic data, including inflation figures and non-farm payrolls, will be closely watched to gauge the economy's resilience against these historical trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Entrepreneur Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire at age 30, attributes her drive to a frugal upbringing by Chinese immigrant parents. Her entrepreneurial journey began in childhood, trading Pokémon cards on the playground, and evolved into creating websites and bots for online games. She later dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, co-founding the AI data company Scale AI, which was recently acquired by Meta. Guo now runs the content creator platform Passes and a venture capital firm, though her company currently faces a class-action lawsuit.</p>

          <p>New figures from the UK's Department for Education reveal a strong correlation between missing school in the first week of term and persistent absence later in the year. According to the data, 57% of pupils in England who were absent during the first week of September 2024 went on to miss at least 10% of the school year, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance initially. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged schools and parents to prioritize attendance from the start of the new term to combat what she describes as critically high absence levels that risk children's futures.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the UK's Reform party is increasingly adopting tactics similar to those used by Donald Trump to undermine and control the press, pointing to a recent ban on the Nottingham Post by the Reform-led Nottinghamshire council. This move is seen as part of a broader trend among hard-right politicians who benefit from turning the media into a foil and engaging directly with supporters, bypassing traditional journalistic scrutiny. While press-bashing may not have immediate electoral consequences, the author suggests that dodging local scrutiny on governance issues could ultimately harm the party's credibility with voters.</p>

The MCC, which provides infrastructure and energy compacts to developing nations, has been preserved as a leaner, deal-driven entity, with recent investments in countries like Nepal and Kosovo aimed at bolstering U.S. national security interests.</p>

          <p>Protesters in cities across Mexico, including the capital, marched to demand government action and justice for the more than 130,000 people who have disappeared in the country. The vast majority of these disappearances have occurred since 2007, coinciding with the government's "war on drugs." While drug cartels are the primary perpetrators, security forces have also been implicated. Relatives of the missing, known as "buscadores," often conduct dangerous searches for mass graves themselves, highlighting a crisis the United Nations has called a "human tragedy of enormous proportions."</p>

          <p>A profile details the background of Alix Tichelman, who was charged with manslaughter following the 2013 heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes aboard his yacht. Security footage captured Tichelman on the boat with Hayes on the night he died. Tichelman, an aspiring model who met men through a "sugar daddy" website, had a history of drug use and had previously been with her nightclub-owner boyfriend when he also died of an overdose.

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed plans for a new Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the company of being complicit in federal immigration raids. The statement follows several enforcement operations targeting the parking lots of Home Depot locations, which are common gathering places for day laborers. Jurado argued that the company's silence on the issue amounts to complicity with actions that terrorize the community. In response, a Home Depot spokesperson stated that the company is not notified of planned ICE operations and is required to follow all federal and local regulations.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid concerns of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to bar city departments from participating in federal actions that violate civil rights and prohibits federal agents from wearing masks while on duty in the city. The move is a largely symbolic preemptive measure against what the mayor described as credible reports of impending "militarized activity" by the federal government. The White House dismissed the order as a publicity stunt, criticizing the city's focus on crime.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" report details the case of Dino Guglielmelli, a millionaire supplement company owner who was convicted of attempting to hire a hit man to murder his wife, model Monica Olsen, during their contentious divorce. Guglielmelli offered his business associate, Rick Fuhrmann, $80,000 to carry out the killing. However, Fuhrmann instead went to the authorities and agreed to wear a wire, capturing Guglielmelli confirming his intentions on tape. Guglielmelli ultimately accepted a plea deal for second-degree attempted murder and was sentenced to nine years in prison, having been released on parole in 2019.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans started their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, marking the most points the team has scored in a game since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, never punting, while the defense also impressed with five sacks and a pick-six by safety Bishop Fitzgerald. While the performance was dominant, the lower-tier competition makes it difficult to gauge the team's true strength ahead of more challenging matchups.</p>
