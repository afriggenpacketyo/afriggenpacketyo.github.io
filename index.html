          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure is voicing her concerns about the comeback of "scary" weight-loss trends in Hollywood, such as the use of drugs like Ozempic. In an interview, she reflected on her own past struggles with body image, contrasting it with the more body-positive outlook of the younger generation. Bure emphasized that her Christian faith helps her focus on inner worth over external appearance, stating that God's love is not dependent on one's body size. She encourages people to understand the "why" behind their health choices rather than just following fads.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a recent clinical trial. Researchers reported that all 10 participants, including children and adults, showed significant hearing improvement after a healthy copy of the OTOF gene was introduced into their inner ear. The therapy, which addresses a protein deficiency that hinders sound signal transmission to the brain, proved safe and was particularly effective in younger patients. This breakthrough opens avenues for treating other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>A shopkeeper in Durham, UK, who personally apprehended a thief stealing beer from his store, has criticized the legal outcome as an inadequate deterrent. The offender was handled through a community resolution, requiring him only to pay for the stolen goods and accept a ban from the shop, thereby avoiding a criminal conviction. The store owner, Andrew Board, argues this sends the wrong signal and reflects a national problem where a majority of reported shoplifting cases do not result in charges. This incident highlights the ongoing struggle for small businesses against rising retail theft.</p>

          <p>Monasteries and convents across Germany are facing a crisis of declining membership, forcing many to close their doors and sell their historic properties. The number of nuns and monks has plummeted over the last few decades, a trend attributed to the church's diminished influence and increased opportunities for women outside religious orders. This decline has societal consequences, as these orders have historically run schools and hospitals. Experts are now working with the remaining communities to find sustainable new uses for the large, historic buildings, such as communal housing or cultural centers.</p>

Simultaneously, the OPEC+ group is expected to meet to decide on a potential oil output hike, which could impact crude prices that have already seen a volatile month.

This claim comes ahead of Monica's trial, where prosecutors allege she conspired with Baker for financial gain.

The war, which Israel initiated over fears of Iran's nuclear program, resulted in hundreds of deaths and significant damage.

          <p>Japan plans to export six used Abukuma-class navy destroyers to the Philippines in a move aimed at bolstering deterrence against China's maritime activities in the region. The agreement, reported by the Yomiuri newspaper, marks a significant step in the growing military cooperation between the two U.S. allies. To navigate its pacifist constitution, Japan will reportedly treat the outfitting of the vessels for the Philippines as a joint development project. This transfer will significantly enhance the capabilities of the Philippine Navy, which currently does not operate any destroyers.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains belonging to seven people who were missing after a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The facility, operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, was the site of a powerful blast that also sparked an 80-acre grass fire. The investigation has revealed that the warehouse was operating without the required local licenses on an agricultural property. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is assisting Cal Fire in the investigation into the cause of the deadly incident.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is facing a severe funding crisis, exacerbated by the prospect of drastic cuts from its largest contributor, the United States, under the Trump administration. A White House review of funding for all international organizations is due next month, with proposals seeking to slash international spending and UN contributions by over 80%. This threatens the operations of key agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme at a time of rising global conflict and hunger. The article argues that a diminished UN would leave a void, increasing global instability and suffering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's security service, MI5, has been found to have repeatedly provided false and misleading evidence to three different courts regarding an abusive neo-Nazi informant known as "X". The case began when a BBC journalist investigated X's violence against women, prompting MI5 to falsely claim to the court it had not confirmed the agent's status to the journalist. Despite being exposed with recordings, MI5's subsequent internal and external inquiries were ruled "deficient" by the High Court for withholding key information. The revelations highlight a pattern of deception and raise serious questions about the agency's credibility and accountability.</p>

          <p>A new travel trend is emerging in China, with young people, particularly recent university graduates, embracing cruise ship holidays as a social and convenient way to travel. Organizers like Dong Wenxin are chartering trips for alumni groups, finding that the all-in-one environment of a cruise ship fosters bonding and community without the logistical hassles of other group travel. This demographic shift is providing a boost to the cruise industry in the region, as it taps into a desire for communal experiences among China's younger generation. The trips offer a range of recreational activities and shared spaces for groups to connect.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced on his social media platform, X, that he is launching a new political party called the "America Party." The move comes weeks after a public falling out with U.S. President Donald Trump, under whom Musk briefly served in an advisory role. Musk positioned the new party as a challenge to the two-party system, stating it aims to "give you back your freedom." It remains unclear if the party has been formally registered with election authorities or who would lead it, as the South Africa-born Musk is ineligible to run for president himself.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to roll out "Best Start" family hubs to every local authority in England by 2026. These hubs are designed to provide a "lifeline" to families, especially in disadvantaged areas, by offering a wide range of services in a single location. Services will include everything from midwifery support and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs, building on the model of the earlier Sure Start centres. The opposition Conservatives have questioned the announcement, suggesting it may be a rebranding of existing services rather than a genuinely new initiative.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 50 fatalities, including 15 children, with dozens more, primarily from a children's summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming Camp Mystic and surrounding communities, leading to a massive search and rescue operation involving hundreds of personnel and aircraft. Governor Greg Abbott has declared a disaster, while officials face questions about the adequacy of the warning systems in a region known as "flash flood alley." Rescue efforts are ongoing, but the scale of the tragedy continues to grow.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered another dominant but short pitching performance for the Los Angeles Dodgers, throwing two scoreless innings and striking out the side in the second. However, the team's bullpen could not maintain the lead, as long reliever Justin Wrobleski gave up five runs in a 6-4 loss to the Houston Astros. The game highlighted the Dodgers' current pitching dynamic: immense hope for the future with the eventual return of injured stars, but continued vulnerability in their current depth. Despite a home run from Mookie Betts, the Dodgers' offense couldn't overcome the deficit.</p>
