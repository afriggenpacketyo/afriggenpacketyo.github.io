        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Stanford study indicates that artificial intelligence is increasingly displacing entry-level workers, particularly in fields like software engineering and customer service, where early-career employment has seen a 13% drop since 2022. The research, utilizing ADP payroll data, highlights that AI's capabilities often overlap with the initial "book learning" acquired by younger professionals, making their roles more susceptible to automation. Conversely, more experienced workers, possessing tacit knowledge and "soft skills," appear less affected, suggesting a significant shift in the labor market. This article emphasizes the need for young workers to adapt by learning to leverage AI tools to enhance their productivity.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon, Jimmy Lai, has concluded his national security trial, which lasted 160 days and saw closing arguments presented. Lai, founder of the critical Apple Daily newspaper, faces charges of "conspiracy to collude with foreign forces" and "seditious publication" under Beijing's imposed national security law. If convicted, the 77-year-old British citizen could face a sentence ranging from three years to life in prison. His case is widely seen as a significant test of press freedom and civil liberties in Hong Kong, with Reporters Without Borders condemning his treatment.</p>

          <p>Kyiv experienced one of Russia's largest combined drone and missile attacks since the 2022 invasion, resulting in at least 14 deaths, including three children, and dozens wounded. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the "horrific and deliberate killing of civilians," calling for stronger international sanctions against Moscow. The assault struck numerous civilian buildings, including homes, offices, and notably, the European Union Delegation to Ukraine's premises. Ukrainian forces reported intercepting most of the 598 drones and 31 missiles launched, yet the widespread destruction underscores the ongoing humanitarian crisis and challenges to peace efforts.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is reportedly replacing Nin Pandit, his principal private secretary, after only ten months in the role. This marks the third senior staff change in his Downing Street office within a year, following the departures of his chief of staff and director of communications. While Number 10 disputes concerns about Pandit's effectiveness, the BBC understands the Prime Minister had grown dissatisfied. Pandit is expected to transition to a new policy delivery role within Downing Street, with a broader reshuffle of junior ministers also anticipated amidst recent Labour parliamentary rebellions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe experienced a significant 40% year-on-year decline in July, marking the seventh consecutive month of decreases for the electric vehicle giant. Concurrently, Chinese rival BYD saw its new registrations surge by 225% annually, capturing a growing share of the European market. This shift occurred even as overall battery electric car sales in Europe rose, highlighting Tesla's challenges, including intense competition and a lack of major lineup refreshes. Analysts suggest Tesla's focus on AI and robotics over its core automotive products may be contributing to its struggles against aggressive Chinese players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article strongly criticizes President Donald Trump's deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to Washington D.C., ostensibly to combat a fabricated crime wave, but in practice, to perform tasks like spreading mulch and picking up trash. The author argues this constitutes a cynical and wasteful use of military personnel and taxpayer money, estimating the cost at over $1 million per day. The piece suggests this action undermines the National Guard's warrior ethos and compensates for cuts to the National Park Service, portraying soldiers as pawns in Trump's authoritarian maneuvers.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, an article explores the profound and lasting impact on children who lived through the disaster, many of whom are now adults. The storm, which killed 1,200 and displaced hundreds of thousands, left young survivors with persistent mental health problems and disrupted community bonds. Many children struggled to process their experiences for years, with a documentary "Katrina Babies" helping to bring these stories to light and foster healing. The article also warns that New Orleans remains vulnerable to future climate change impacts due to coastal erosion and potential cuts to federal disaster agencies.</p>

          <h2>China Cautions Against External Interference in its Relationship with South Korea</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 02:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, issued a warning against external interference in the China-South Korea relationship, emphasizing that their ties are based on mutual interests and not targeted at a third party. This statement follows South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's assessment that Seoul needs to rebalance its relationship with Beijing amidst intensifying US-China competition. Lee had previously stated that South Korea could no longer maintain a strategy of relying on the US for security while cooperating economically with China, indicating a complex geopolitical balancing act for Seoul.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China's second-largest liquor distiller, reported its slowest profit growth in a decade, with first-half net profit increasing by only 2.3%. This downturn is attributed to an intensified anti-corruption campaign curbing ostentatious consumption and a slowing economy, impacting the broader baijiu industry. Peers like Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor also reported their slowest or worst earnings in ten years, respectively. The article highlights how government austerity measures have significantly reduced baijiu consumption, a staple of Chinese culture, leading to a notable drop in sales for mainstream products.

          <p>Argentinian authorities are actively searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago, after it surfaced in a real estate advertisement. The painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, was part of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection before being seized by Nazi officials. Police raided a seaside villa in Argentina, reportedly owned by descendants of the Nazi fugitive Friedrich Kadgien, finding German documents but not the artwork.

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has incurred a significant fine of nearly £31,500 ($42,500) for his unsportsmanlike behavior during his first-round exit from the tournament. Medvedev's meltdown, which included obliterating his racket, was reportedly triggered by a photographer on the court during his match against Benjamin Bonzi. The penalty, imposed by the United States Tennis Association, means the Russian player will forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money. Medvedev had anticipated a hefty punishment, choosing to refrain from further comment on the incident.</p>

Hopkin recounted bravely intervening when the girl, now sentenced to 15 years, lunged at a colleague with a knife, sustaining stabs to her leg, neck, and back. A multi-agency review highlighted the assailant's troubled childhood and mental health challenges, suggesting that better information sharing could have prevented the incident.
