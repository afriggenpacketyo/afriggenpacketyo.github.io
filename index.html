          <h2>Social Security Recipients May Qualify for Credit Card Debt Forgiveness</h2>

          <p>Americans relying on Social Security for income can still qualify for credit card debt forgiveness programs, which typically involve negotiating a reduced lump-sum payment with creditors. While a fixed income can demonstrate the financial hardship required for eligibility, the ability to save for a settlement offer remains a significant challenge. Federal law protects Social Security benefits from being garnished by most creditors like credit card companies, providing leverage in negotiations. However, individuals should weigh this against the stress of collection efforts and compare it with other debt relief options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 1,000-acre wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, has led to mandatory evacuation orders and the temporary closure of the Grand Canyon's North Rim. The fire, which started after a thunderstorm, remains active with zero containment, prompting officials to warn hikers about extreme heat and smoke within the canyon. Over 2,100 responders are on the scene, with air tankers assisting ground crews in suppression efforts. The incident has also forced the closure of a section of Highway 89A, with no estimated time for reopening as a Complex Incident Management Team takes over operations.</p>

          <p>Two female residents of a Sunderland care home, one in her 90s and another in her 80s, have died following an incident where a stolen BMW crashed into the building during a police chase. The car, reported stolen from Newcastle, caused significant damage, leading to the evacuation of residents and hospitalization of eight others with non-life-threatening injuries. Two 21-year-old men, initially arrested in connection with the crash, have been rearrested on suspicion of manslaughter. Northumbria Police has made a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct due to the preceding police pursuit.</p>

          <p>Iranian authorities have confirmed the arrest of Lennart Monterlos, an 18-year-old Franco-German tourist who was on a round-the-world cycling trip and had been missing since mid-June. Iran's Foreign Minister stated the teenager was detained for an unspecified "crime" and that the French embassy has been granted consular access. The French government has urged Tehran not to "persecute the innocent," reiterating its strong travel advisory against visiting Iran due to the risk of arbitrary detention. This event highlights ongoing tensions over what Western nations describe as Iran's "hostage diplomacy" to gain political leverage.</p>

          <p>High-yield savings accounts continue to offer attractive interest rates, easily surpassing those of traditional savings accounts and providing a straightforward way for savers to grow their money. However, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates later this year, the high rates on these accounts are variable and could fall preemptively, unlike the fixed rates of CDs. A key advantage is the flexibility to access funds without penalty, which is valuable in an uncertain economic climate. Potential savers should also consider that the best rates are typically offered by online banks. (not investment advice)</p>

According to UEFA rules, two clubs with the same influential owner cannot compete in the same competition.

          <p>This opinion article argues that while public outrage over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case is understandable, it is unlikely to become a decisive political issue. The author notes the bipartisan frustration with the official conclusion that Epstein's death was a suicide and that no "client list" exists, particularly after earlier statements by the Attorney General suggested otherwise. However, the writer contends that elections will be decided by core issues like the economy and immigration, not this "tawdry soap opera drama." The piece encourages people to focus on more meaningful aspects of life and politics.</p>

          <p>Virginia has fallen to fourth place in CNBC's annual "America's Top States for Business" ranking, its lowest position since 2018, largely due to the Trump administration's efforts to cut the federal workforce. The state, which has a significant number of federal employees and contractors, has seen its Economy ranking drop as a result. While Governor Glenn Youngkin insists that the state's 250,000 open private sector jobs can absorb the losses, economists note a mismatch in skills between the highly educated federal workforce and available positions.

          <p>According to the CDC, emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. are at their highest point in six years, with a notable spike in the Northeast. Experts attribute the rise to record-high tick populations and a longer tick season, both of which are linked to climate change causing milder winters and wetter springs. This trend increases the public's risk of exposure to tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, babesiosis, and Powassan virus. Health officials are urging people to take preventive measures, such as using insect repellent and performing thorough tick checks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the national conversation about boosting birth rates, including debates around IVF, consistently overlooks a critical factor: male infertility. Despite male factors contributing to roughly half of infertility cases among heterosexual couples, men are often not evaluated, and treatments for them are less likely to be covered by insurance. The author suggests that instead of focusing solely on female-centric solutions, a more effective approach would be to expand access to male-infertility care. This could include funding more specialists, reforming telemedicine laws, and mandating insurance coverage for male-specific treatments, reducing the medical burden on women.</p>
