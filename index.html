          <p>The United Kingdom is facing an increased risk of widespread drought, with parts of England already in an official drought state following the country's sixth driest spring since 1836. The prolonged lack of rainfall has led to exceptionally low levels in rivers and reservoirs, particularly in northern England. These conditions are already impacting farmers, who face higher costs for irrigation, and harming wildlife habitats. Forecasts suggest dry weather will persist, heightening concerns about water supplies and environmental resilience.</p>

          <p>After intense last-minute negotiations to secure votes, the U.S. Senate narrowly passed a massive Republican policy bill with a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. Republican leaders overcame resistance from holdouts concerned about the bill's cuts to Medicaid and its fiscal impact by adding billions in targeted funding, including for rural hospitals. The tumultuous passage highlights deep divisions within the party, and the bill now moves to the House of Representatives for another challenging vote.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature policy bill, having narrowly passed the Senate, now faces a precarious path in the House of Representatives, where Republican leadership may lack the votes for approval. Several conservative members have voiced opposition to the Senate's version, citing its higher price tag and larger increase to the national debt. With a very slim majority, Speaker Mike Johnson has little room for error as the party rushes to pass the legislation before a self-imposed July 4 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>
