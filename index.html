            <p>A bus driver in Kyoto, Japan, with 29 years of service, was fired and lost his $84,000 retirement package after being caught stealing $7 from passenger fares. Despite initially winning a court case arguing the punishment was excessive, the Supreme Court overturned the decision, citing the importance of maintaining public trust in the transportation system. The driver had previous reprimands for smoking on duty, further influencing the court's decision. Kyoto City officials emphasized the seriousness of the embezzlement, given that bus drivers handle public money independently.</p>

            <p>The rising cost of attending Dodgers games has ignited a debate about whether the team is pricing out its loyal fan base, particularly families. With ticket prices among the highest in Major League Baseball, many fans are finding it increasingly difficult to afford a day at the ballpark. While team president Stan Kasten emphasizes efforts to provide free and discounted tickets, critics argue that the overall cost remains prohibitive for many. Commissioner Rob Manfred defends the prices, citing the team's significant investment in players and the need to run a profitable business.</p>

Critics argue that these bills, fueled by unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, could disproportionately affect eligible citizens and undermine confidence in elections. The proposed measures include stricter voter ID laws, limitations on mail voting, and restrictions on ballot initiatives. Voting rights advocates contend that these efforts are designed to make it more difficult for certain groups to vote and perpetuate false narratives about election integrity.</p>

            <h2>Small Nuclear Reactors Not a Viable Solution for California's Energy Needs, Expert Argues</h2>

            <p>A contributor to the Los Angeles Times argues that small modular reactors (SMRs) are not a practical solution for California's energy challenges, citing high costs and historical failures. Despite hype from various sources, SMRs are deemed less economically viable than larger nuclear plants and face competition from cheaper renewable energy sources. The analysis highlights cost overruns and cancellations of SMR projects, emphasizing the need for focusing on wind, solar, and battery storage as more effective and sustainable energy solutions. The author concludes that SMRs are another overhyped energy technology.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has fallen in the global rankings of the world's busiest airports by passenger count, due to a drop in domestic travel and challenges in recovering from the pandemic. The airport, once ranked third globally, has slipped to fifteenth place, while also experiencing a decline in cargo handling. Airport officials attribute the drop to factors such as consumer confidence, immigration policies, and trade dynamics. Despite the decline, LAX is undergoing a $30 billion overhaul in preparation for the 2028 Summer Olympics.</p>
