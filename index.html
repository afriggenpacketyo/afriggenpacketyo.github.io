        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trygroup Inc., a major Japanese tutoring company, issued a public apology for inaccurately portraying Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials.  The false claim, featured in a junior high school video lesson, described the disease's development through mercury exposure via the placenta but incorrectly labeled it "inherited."  Following criticism, the company removed the video and corrected the information, responding to pressure from patient groups and the Environment Ministry. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning, affecting thousands near Minamata Bay.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways in the UK has been renationalized, marking the first step in the Labour government's plan to return the entire rail network to public ownership by the end of 2027. This move aims to improve passenger services, address issues like frequent cancellations and high ticket prices, and save money on compensation fees paid to private operators.  The renationalization follows decades of privatization and is expected to be completed by 2027.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that dog owners who ruminate about work stress after hours may inadvertently cause their pets to experience increased stress. The research, published in Scientific Reports, surveyed 85 working dog owners and found a correlation between work-related rumination and increased stress-related behaviors in their dogs.  This highlights the impact of human stress on pet well-being and suggests that managing work stress outside of work hours is crucial for both owner and pet health. The study points to emotional contagion and inconsistent care as potential mechanisms.</p>

          <p>Internal documents reveal the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) draft plan to eliminate all greenhouse gas emission limits for fossil fuel-fired power plants.  The EPA argues that US power plant emissions are a small and declining share of global emissions, thus eliminating them would have minimal impact on climate change.  Critics strongly disagree, highlighting the significant contribution of the power sector to US greenhouse gas emissions and the potential health consequences of the proposed deregulation. The plan is expected to face legal challenges.</p>
