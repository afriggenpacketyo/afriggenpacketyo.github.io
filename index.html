          <p>China is preparing for the 80th anniversary of its victory over Japan in World War II with a significant military parade, aiming to showcase the strength and solidarity of the People's Liberation Army. This display of power, however, is set against a backdrop of internal challenges, including the recent removal of former navy chief of staff Li Hanjun on corruption suspicions, which some question could hamper war readiness. President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the goal of creating a fighting force "capable of winning wars," and the parade is intended to demonstrate progress towards this 2027 objective. The world eagerly awaits next week's event, where Beijing is expected to unveil its latest weapons and a new generation of commanders, providing insight into the PLA's current capabilities and future trajectory.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's extensive cuts to USAID have resulted in a chaotic "fire sale" and abandonment of millions of dollars' worth of aid equipment, including mosquito nets, medical supplies, and vehicles. With over 5,000 foreign-aid projects canceled, usable goods are being auctioned off at extreme losses or simply left stranded, lacking proper inventory and distribution. This disorganized closeout has raised serious concerns from federal and humanitarian workers about national security risks, potential for sensitive data exposure on sold electronics, and the broader impact on global aid. Experts warn this American pullback could contribute to more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030, underscoring a profound waste of taxpayer dollars and a humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Identity software maker Okta reported robust fiscal second-quarter results, significantly exceeding Wall Street's projections for both earnings per share and revenue, which grew approximately 13% year-over-year. CEO Todd McKinnon attributed this strong performance to economic conditions being "much better than we thought," leading the company to bump up its fiscal 2026 forecast. Okta also announced the acquisition of Israeli startup Axiom Security to bolster its offerings in managing artificial intelligence agent identities, a key growth area. Despite increased caution from U.S. government customers and a competitor's acquisition of a rival, Okta remains confident in its market position and suite-selling strategy.

Although the child has not been located, he is presumed dead, and extensive searches for his remains are underway, with the father even accompanying detectives. Jake Haro previously pleaded guilty to willful cruelty to a child in 2018, adding a disturbing context to the current charges.</p>

This incident, which prompted a shelter-in-place order and a bomb squad response, underscores a concerning trend. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons reported a 1,000% increase in assaults against ICE agents since the beginning of the Trump administration, impacting training and preparation for operations. The Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Services officer called 911, and the U.S. Attorney's Office is now considering pursuing federal charges against Wilkinson for terroristic threats.</p>

          <p>A Trump-appointed federal judge, Thomas Cullen, dismissed an "unusual" lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against all 15 federal judges in Maryland. The Department of Homeland Security had challenged a court policy requiring automatic, temporary administrative pauses in deportation cases to allow for judicial review. Judge Cullen harshly criticized the administration's "confrontational" approach, citing judicial immunity and the executive branch's lack of standing. He further observed that the administration's "concerted effort to smear and impugn individual judges" who rule against it is "unprecedented and unfortunate," signaling a broader concern about attacks on judicial independence. The Trump administration has since appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock experienced a notable jump of over 5% after President Donald Trump weighed in on the company's controversial logo rebranding. Trump suggested the company revert to its old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response, and leverage the "Billion Dollars worth of free publicity" as a "great opportunity." This intervention followed criticism from some conservatives and a stock drop after the new logo's unveiling, which removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" character. The White House's official X account further amplified the sentiment, tweeting "Go woke, go broke" alongside a reimagined logo featuring Trump.</p>

          <p>U.S. financial markets displayed a muted reaction, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite all edging higher, despite President Trump's unprecedented decision to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Trump cited unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, but Cook has firmly stated he lacks the legal authority to fire her and will not resign, setting up a potential legal showdown. This apparent shrug from investors contrasted with sharp declines in global markets, yet traders maintained a high probability of a September rate cut. The stability suggests investors are currently undeterred by the potential challenge to the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NFL teams undertook significant roster cuts, reducing squads from 90 to the mandated 53 players, resulting in many notable athletes seeking new employment. Among the "shocking" cuts were several quarterbacks, including former UCLA star Dorian Thompson-Robinson from the Eagles and Dresser Winn from the Rams, who were outplayed by new acquisitions. Prominent offensive and defensive players also lost jobs, such as former Rams running back Cam Akers, Super Bowl champion Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and Deion Sanders' son, Shilo Sanders.

If successful in replacing Cook, Trump could appoint a majority of the Fed board, potentially gaining a "dangerous degree of power" over U.S. monetary policy.

          <p>A Utah judge has ordered the state legislature to redraw its congressional maps, ruling against a bipartisan state law from 2020 that was found to have "unconstitutionally impaired" a voter-passed proposition for independent redistricting. This significant decision could potentially open a path for Democrats to gain a U.S. House seat in the Republican-dominated state, where all four current seats are held by the GOP. The ruling adds to a national wave of contentious redistricting battles, as both parties seek to gain an advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Utah's senior GOP Senator Mike Lee lambasted the court's decision, calling it a "terrible day for everyone else—and for the rule of law."</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has abruptly canceled its decades-long Creative Writing Fellowships program, which historically provided $50,000 grants and supported acclaimed authors like Alice Walker and Charles Bukowski. Notices sent to applicants confirmed the cancellation of the FY 2026 program, stating the NEA is now re-focusing its grants on projects aligned with the Trump administration's priorities. These new priorities include supporting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-serving institutions, the upcoming 250th anniversary of America's independence, houses of worship, and "AI competency," marking a significant and controversial shift in federal support for literary arts.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have charged a total of 67 individuals, ranging in age from 21 to 83, for allegedly showing support for Palestine Action, a proscribed group, during central London protests in July. These individuals face charges under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act, which carries a maximum sentence of six months' imprisonment. Hundreds more have been arrested since the group's proscription on July 5th. Palestine Action is challenging the ban in the High Court, arguing it infringes on free speech and legitimate protest, while the home secretary defends the ban, citing the group's alleged involvement in crimes assessed to have a "terrorism connection."</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, a prominent Trump donor and the current director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), is spearheading an effort to accuse President Trump's political adversaries of mortgage fraud. Pulte has referred three such claims to the Justice Department, targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James, Senator Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, all of whom deny wrongdoing. This unusual use of a regulatory position, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, raises significant concerns about impartiality and the potential weaponization of government agencies for political retribution. The legal basis for Cook's attempted firing is particularly contentious, given the Supreme Court's recognition of the Fed's "uniquely structured" independence.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages present a particularly smart financial option for seniors aged 62 or older this September, offering a means to access significant home equity without the burden of immediate monthly repayments. With the average home equity level recently hitting a new record high of around $200,000, senior homeowners, especially those who have largely paid off their mortgages, have substantial funds available. This option also effectively eliminates concerns over the current unpredictable interest rate climate, as borrowers are not subject to variable rates or frequent repayments. Furthermore, a reverse mortgage can be instrumental in helping seniors pay down high-interest debt, like credit card balances, fostering greater financial independence. (not investment advice)</p>

The move upends a decades-old waiver, shifting from reliance on FBI background checks to more intensive, localized scrutiny.
