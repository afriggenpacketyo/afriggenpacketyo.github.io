          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May increased by 2.4% annually, slightly below the anticipated 2.5%, indicating a cooler-than-expected rise in inflation. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.8%. The lower inflation rate is attributed to a sharp decline in gasoline prices, offsetting price increases in groceries and housing costs. Wall Street anticipates the Federal Reserve will maintain steady interest rates at its upcoming meeting, while economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on future inflation data.

According to a new study, AI models are poor at representing concepts with sensory components, such as the smell or touch of a flower. This limitation stems from AI's lack of a body and organic human experience. Experts suggest that AI's creativity is "hollow and shallow" because it cannot replicate the depth of human sensory perception. </p>
