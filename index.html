          <p>Eurozone inflation eased to 2.2% in March, down from 2.3% in February, according to Eurostat.  Core inflation also decreased, while services inflation fell to 3.4% from 3.7%.  These figures have increased market expectations for a further interest rate cut by the European Central Bank, potentially by 25 basis points. The uncertainty surrounding US tariffs is also a contributing factor.</p>
