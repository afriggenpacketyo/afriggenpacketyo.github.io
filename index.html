          <p>A 45-year-old Oasis fan, Lee Claydon, died after falling from an upper tier at the band's reunion concert at Wembley Stadium in London. His family described him as a loving and hardworking man, stating the fall was a tragic accident and refuting suggestions of drug use. The incident has raised questions about stadium safety measures, though Wembley officials maintain they operate to high standards. The Metropolitan Police are investigating and have appealed for witnesses or video footage, while the band expressed their shock and condolences to the family.</p>

The Rwandan government stated it will provide the deportees with workforce training, healthcare, and accommodation, while retaining the right to approve each individual. This agreement is part of a broader U.S. effort to find third countries to take migrants whose home nations refuse their return. Human rights groups have raised concerns about the legality of such transfers and Rwanda's own human rights record, though the government insists it can provide a safe haven.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Open Network reveals that a cancer diagnosis leads to a substantial increase in out-of-pocket expenses for privately insured patients under 65. Researchers found that costs jumped by an average of over $590 per month in the six months following a diagnosis. The financial burden escalates with the severity of the disease, with stage 4 cancer patients facing an additional $720 monthly. The report highlights the significant financial toxicity of cancer care and underscores the need for policy changes, such as paid sick leave, to support patients.</p>

The governor has signed an executive order to provide more resources to the multi-agency search effort, with authorities believing the suspect is armed and hiding in a mountainous forest area. In a separate case, police in Tennessee have arrested Austin Robert Drummond, who was wanted for the killing of four people. Drummond's arrest followed a weeklong search after an infant related to the victims was found abandoned.</p>

The results, while positive, did not meet the exceptionally high expectations set by Wall Street for the AI-related stock. Eaton's revenue grew 10% to $7.03 billion, with significant strength in its data center business, where orders surged 55% year-over-year. Management expressed confidence in future growth, citing capacity expansions and strategic partnerships, including one with Nvidia, to meet sustained demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the strong performance, some analysts remain cautious, pointing to the stock's high valuation relative to its earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are opposing the U.S. Justice Department's effort to unseal grand jury testimony from her sex trafficking case. In a court filing, her lawyers argued that releasing the documents would violate grand jury secrecy and prejudice her ongoing legal challenges, as she is still appealing her conviction. They contrasted her situation with that of the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Maxwell's due process rights remain viable. The DOJ has stated that much of the information is already public and that the testimony in question came from only two law enforcement officers, not victims.</p>

The banks have denied closing accounts for political reasons, with JPMorgan suggesting that burdensome federal regulations are the root cause.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to release $140 million in delayed funding for its key overdose prevention program, which states rely on to combat the fentanyl crisis. The news provides relief to public health departments that had been warning of dire consequences from the funding holdup by the Trump administration. However, CDC staffers report a new challenge, as the Office of Management and Budget has now frozen budget lines for dozens of other programs. These new freezes primarily affect initiatives related to chronic disease, violence prevention, and health promotion.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering a plan for the full military occupation of the Gaza Strip to achieve his war aims. According to Israeli media, Netanyahu met with the army chief to discuss options for the next phase of the conflict, with the prime minister favoring a complete seizure of the enclave. This potential escalation, which would require approval from the security cabinet, has raised concerns among military leaders about the high risk to both Israeli soldiers and the remaining hostages. The war, which began after the October 7 Hamas attacks, is now approaching its 22nd month.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has announced it will restore and reinstall a statue of Confederate General Albert Pike that was toppled by protestors in Washington D.C. in 2020. The statue, the only one of a Confederate general in the capital, was pulled down and set on fire during social justice protests following the murder of George Floyd. The NPS stated the restoration aligns with federal preservation laws and recent executive orders from President Trump to "beautify" the capital and reinstate statues. The decision has been criticized by local officials, who have long campaigned for the controversial monument's permanent removal.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Florida are warning of the dangers of drinking unpasteurized raw milk after 21 people were sickened by bacteria linked to a single farm. The outbreak involved E. coli and campylobacter infections, leading to seven hospitalizations and severe complications in two individuals. Although selling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida, it can be sold as pet food, a loophole that allows it to reach consumers. Public health agencies like the FDA and CDC strongly advise against consuming raw milk, as it can carry dangerous bacteria that are eliminated through the pasteurization process.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was a preventable tragedy caused by OceanGate's disregard for safety and use of "intimidation tactics" to evade regulation. The 300-page report found that the vessel's design was fundamentally flawed and that the company continued operations despite previous incidents compromising the hull's integrity. The investigation also described a "toxic" safety culture, where co-founder Stockton Rush's overconfidence led to ignoring warnings from staff. The report states Rush exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of the four other people on board.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, stock market volatility, and geopolitical tensions, some investors are turning to physical gold as a safe-haven asset. This article suggests that 1-ounce gold bars are a particularly strategic choice, offering a balance of value and liquidity. The rationale is supported by a recent Citi forecast raising the short-term gold price target to $3,500 per ounce, citing a negative U.S. economic outlook. Gold's historical performance as a hedge against inflation and the flexibility of smaller bars for trading make them an appealing option for preserving wealth. (not investment advice)</p>
