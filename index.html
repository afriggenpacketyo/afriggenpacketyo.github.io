          <h2>Auto Industry Expresses Concern Over China's Rare Earth Export Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 01:36:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automotive industry groups are increasingly worried about a potential shortage of rare earth elements due to China's recent export controls. Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already experienced shutdowns, and Germany's car industry is also raising concerns. China imposed these restrictions in response to U.S. tariffs, impacting components vital for both combustion engines and electric vehicles. While some export license applications have been approved, the industry fears further production delays and stoppages if the situation persists, urging lawmakers to address the issue with China. Optimism among auto manufacturers remains relatively steady as they seek long term solutions and alternative rare earth suppliers.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspapers lead with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected "winter fuel U-turn," restoring the payment but clawing it back from better-off pensioners through higher taxes. Concerns are raised about potential chaos and bereaved families being pursued by tax officials. Other headlines include immigration policy debates, with the Mail highlighting opposing policies from Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch. Additionally, the Telegraph reports Reeves dropping net-zero cuts, and the Daily Mirror covers the expansion of free school meals, while the Daily Star reports on a Holy Grail hunt in the UK.</p>

          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often-complicated medical needs. Many of these dogs face chronic health issues and injuries from their service, costing adopters thousands of pounds in vet bills. Stories are shared of dogs like Marco, who tracked a vulnerable man in camouflage clothing, and Audi, who was stabbed in the head while apprehending a suspect. With rising vet costs and no pension support, there are concerns that fewer people will be willing to adopt retired police dogs.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein have seen a significant decrease in U.S. demand following President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the "de minimis" trade loophole. Temu's U.S. daily active users dropped by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's decreased by 25%. Monthly active users also declined for both platforms, reflecting reduced user engagement. These declines coincide with a pullback in U.S. advertising spend by both companies since the tariff announcements, which ended the tariff exemption for low-cost goods worth less than $800.</p>

The lawyer argues that the payout is insufficient and allows Boeing to sidestep true criminal accountability for the two crashes that killed 346 people.

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition using Chinese solar panels, creating a model for the Global South. The influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants, creating stranded assets. A Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is too expensive to be true. Pakistan has seen a rapid transition to distributed solar power, importing 39 gigawatts of solar panels, mostly from China, in the past five years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Cornell University professor, tariffs disrupt the global trading system and undermine economic links that stabilize international relations. The constant threat of tariffs weakens trade and disregards free trade agreements, undercutting the international rules-based order. Denying low-income countries the opportunity to develop through trade could lead to increased migration and political discontent. While a full-scale retreat from global trade is unlikely, commerce is shifting in ways that can deepen geopolitical fissures. (not investment advice)</p>

The order would suspend the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard for an initial six months.

          <p>Italians are participating in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for citizenship, from 10 to five years. This referendum is a rare chance for Italians to make the country's bureaucracy slightly more benevolent, as the Italian state has been tightening its citizenship rules for the past three decades. A "yes" vote would recognize the dignity and diversity of millions more of their should-be-compatriots, and enriching their own national story with new protagonists in the process. However, Meloni's government is hoping that fewer than 50% of Italians will turn up to the polls, so that the referendum will not reach quorum.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, enabling birds to surpass dinosaurs in conquering the skies.
