          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced the company's plans to re-enter the cryptocurrency investment business, reversing its 2023 exit that was a condition of receiving a bank charter. This decision follows new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, signaling a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. SoFi aims to provide comprehensive crypto and blockchain capabilities across its product areas, aligning with the broader trend of banks increasingly exploring crypto opportunities. Other financial institutions like Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have expressed readiness to engage with crypto, while crypto firms are pursuing bank charters, blurring the lines between traditional and digital finance.

          <p>Novo Nordisk will now offer its weight loss drug Wegovy through telehealth providers like Hims & Hers Health, Ro, and Life MD, aiming to improve access to the medication. This move comes as compounding pharmacies face restrictions on producing cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy due to the end of shortages. The partnerships will enable patients to access Wegovy directly from their telehealth providers, with the drug shipped to their homes. Novo Nordisk is also introducing its direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare, offering Wegovy at a reduced cash price for uninsured patients.</p>

          <p>While sibling relationships are often formative, this article explores how these bonds evolve into adulthood, emphasizing that maintaining closeness becomes a voluntary choice. Factors such as childhood experiences, birth order, and cultural expectations influence sibling sentiment, characterized by affection, ambivalence, and ambiguity. The article suggests that while close sibling relationships can positively impact well-being, it's not essential to force intimacy, and functional relationships based on mutual respect are equally valid. For those seeking stronger connections, acknowledging past resentments and open communication are key, but ultimately, acceptance of differing perceptions is crucial.</p>

          <p>General Motors exceeded Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but is reassessing its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties surrounding potential automotive tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.

          <p>Pfizer reported first-quarter profit that exceeded expectations, despite a decline in sales attributed to reduced revenue from its Covid antiviral pill Paxlovid. The company is expanding its cost-cutting program to achieve additional savings of roughly $1.2 billion by the end of 2027, primarily through enhanced digital enablement, including automation and artificial intelligence. Pfizer also anticipates around $500 million in research and organization re-organization cost savings by the end of 2026, which will be reinvested into its product pipeline. These measures aim to offset the decline in Pfizer's Covid business and bolster its financial performance.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured a federal election victory, driven by concerns over President Trump's annexation threats and tariff tactics. Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the need to safeguard Canada's sovereignty and economic interests in response to Trump's policies. The election saw a record number of Canadians casting their votes, with voters citing tariffs and the affordability of goods as key issues. The election outcome reflects a shift in Canadian politics, with a focus on protecting national interests amidst external pressures.</p>

          <p>This article explores the trend of universal fitness goals promoted on social media and how they can be detrimental to individual well-being. It critiques the "bro-ification" of fitness, where performance is prioritized over individual needs, often leading to unrealistic expectations and body negativity. Experts emphasize that exercise should be tailored to personal circumstances and that generic fitness advice can be harmful and unsustainable. The article also highlights the societal pressures and time constraints that disproportionately affect women's ability to adhere to strict fitness routines.</p>

          <p>A large fire at an electricity substation in north-west London led to the evacuation of a nearby block of flats after the roof caught alight. Approximately 80 residents were safely evacuated, and no injuries were reported, although local residents were advised to keep doors and windows closed. The fire, which sent large clouds of smoke into the air, was caused by a "fault on a piece of equipment" in the substation, according to UK Power Networks, who confirmed the substation remained operational and there had been no interruption to the electricity supply.</p>

          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply due to the Trump administration's steep tariffs, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about impending supply shortages.
