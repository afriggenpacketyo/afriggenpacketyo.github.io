          <p>Authorities in Kerala, India, have issued an alert after a cargo ship capsized off the coast of Kochi, leaking oil and hazardous materials into the Arabian Sea. The incident raises concerns about potential harm to residents, marine life, and the local tourism industry. All 24 crew members were rescued, but some of the ship's containers are drifting ashore, prompting evacuations. The Indian Coast Guard has deployed resources to control the spill, as the vessel was carrying hazardous cargo, including calcium carbide and significant quantities of diesel and furnace oil, posing a substantial environmental risk. The coastal stretch is rich in biodiversity and is also an important tourist destination.</p>

          <p>Israeli military actions across Gaza have reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least 54 Palestinians, according to hospital officials. A strike on a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City caused numerous casualties, with reports of bodies severely burned. The Israeli military stated that it targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control center, accusing Hamas of using the Gazan population as human shields. Separately, a strike on a house in Jabalia resulted in additional fatalities, contributing to an escalation of violence in the region over the past week. The IDF said it hit 200 targets across Gaza in 48 hours as it continued its operations against what it called "terrorist organizations".</p>

The results come after a disputed presidential election in which Maduro also claimed victory despite evidence suggesting he lost.

The delay follows discussions with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who requested additional time to reach a trade agreement.

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD experienced a significant drop following the company's announcement of price reductions on multiple models. The price cuts, affecting both electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, are aimed at boosting sales amidst increasing competition in the EV market. Analysts expect the price reductions to increase foot traffic at BYD dealerships, but also signal heightened competition and a potential price war in the sector. Other Chinese automakers also saw their shares decline as investors reacted to the news. (not investment advice)</p>
