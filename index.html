          <p>President Trump's assertion that low tariffs caused the Great Depression is refuted by economist Dean Baker.  Baker points out that tariffs were not eliminated before the Depression and that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased tariffs, actually worsened the economic crisis.  He emphasizes the various factors contributing to the Great Depression, including the 1929 stock market crash and monetary policy decisions.  Baker warns that Trump's current tariffs significantly increase the risk of a recession.</p>
