          <p>Toyota's global sales for April increased by 10% year-on-year, according to a Kyodo News report. The announcement comes as the automotive industry anticipates potential impacts from forthcoming U.S. tariffs. While the article is brief, it suggests a positive trend for Toyota amidst broader economic uncertainties. The sales increase could be attributed to various factors, including pent-up demand, successful marketing strategies, or favorable market conditions in specific regions. The report highlights the company's performance just before possible trade policy changes that could affect future sales and strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 17,000 people in Manitoba, Canada, are being evacuated due to widespread wildfires, prompting a province-wide state of emergency. Premier Wab Kinew has requested military assistance from Prime Minister Mark Carney to aid in both evacuation and firefighting efforts, with military aircraft expected to deploy imminently. The evacuations include the town of Flin Flon, and most evacuees are being transported to Winnipeg.

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade has blocked reciprocal tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Trump on numerous countries, deeming them beyond the scope of presidential authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The court's ruling halts the tariffs and prohibits future modifications, dealing a blow to Trump's economic agenda and trade negotiations. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, potentially leading to a Supreme Court review. The article quotes a White House spokesperson who argues that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment has fueled America's trade deficits, creating a national emergency.</p>

          <p>Despite recent tariff cuts, remaining duties on imports from the U.S. could force Chinese buyers of Boeing jets to pay millions of US dollars more than before, which, along with worldwide delivery delays, could contribute to a sharp slowdown in the growth of China‚Äôs aviation capacity, according to analysts. China‚Äôs civil aviation passenger capacity is likely to grow by an average of 3.1 per cent a year until 2028, significantly lower than the 15.4 per cent average annual growth rate in the decade to 2019. Amid this year‚Äôs trade upheaval, some Chinese airlines refused to accept deliveries of Boeing planes.</p>

However, other intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA, disagree with the FBI's analysis.
