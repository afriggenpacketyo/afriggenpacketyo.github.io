          <p>A former EU trade negotiator, John Clarke, suggests that the current tensions between China and the European Union over electric vehicles are not critical, as both sides are interested in collaborating on trade and the green transition to counter potential disruptions from a second Trump presidency. Clarke emphasizes the potential for collaboration in sectors like energy, space, pandemic preparedness, and especially green technology. He notes the EU's need for Chinese environmental technology and goods to achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2050, viewing China as a key part of the solution for an affordable transition.</p>

          <p>The UK government's negotiations to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius have been temporarily suspended due to a last-minute injunction granted by a High Court judge, following a case brought by two Chagossian women. The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years. The women are seeking the right to return to the islands, which is currently prohibited under both the existing and proposed arrangements. The court order prevents the UK from finalizing any legally binding steps regarding the transfer of the British Indian Ocean Territory until further notice, while representatives of the Chagossian community meet with Foreign Office officials to discuss the territory's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Two Israeli embassy staff members, identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended at the scene and allegedly shouted "free, free Palestine" following the shooting, leading the FBI to investigate the incident as a potential targeted attack. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar condemned the shooting as a result of antisemitic incitement and President Trump expressed condolences. The victims were attending an American Jewish Committee event, and the shooting has prompted increased security measures at Israeli missions worldwide.</p>

          <p>Jack Teixeira, serving a 15-year sentence for leaking classified U.S. national defense secrets, claims he doesn't regret his actions and would do it again, stating his intent was to educate the American public and expose lies. Teixeira is appealing to President Trump for a pardon, arguing his case was politicized by the Biden administration. He maintains that no one was harmed by his actions and believes he was made an example of, while his mother, Dawn Dufault, also believes his prosecution was malicious and the case sensationalized. Despite superiors warning him to stop accessing classified information unrelated to his duties, Teixeira says he felt compelled to reveal what he believed were misleading narratives about the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, President Trump surprised South African President Cyril Ramaphosa by raising concerns about the alleged persecution and killings of white farmers (Afrikaners) in South Africa. Trump presented a video with discredited claims of a "white genocide," showing crosses he claimed marked burial sites of murdered farmers. Ramaphosa responded by stating that his government's policy opposes such actions and that the individuals in his delegation, including white South Africans, would not be present if a genocide were occurring. Despite the tension, Ramaphosa expressed hope that Trump would listen to the voices of South Africans on the issue and acknowledged the presence of criminality affecting all races in his country.</p>

          <p>David French reflects on the life and career of Justice David Souter, emphasizing his decision to retire from the Supreme Court at a relatively young age, setting an example of knowing when to step aside. The article contrasts Souter's choice with the trend of many politicians and judges clinging to power well into old age, leading to potential negative consequences. It argues that the desire to remain powerful, combined with the support of enablers and a culture obsessed with career success, contributes to this problem. The author concludes by advocating for a shift in values, prioritizing family and humility over the pursuit of power and influence.</p>

The proposed deal calls for the archdiocese, its affiliates, and insurers to pay between $180 million and $230 million.

Researchers discovered that orange cats have a unique alteration near the ARHGAP36 gene, which activates the gene in pigment cells. This finding intersects with the same pathway responsible for red hair in humans but affects it in a different way, providing new insights into hormonal signaling in various cell types and animals.</p>

The $TRUMP coin, launched shortly before the inauguration, reached a $27 billion market cap but is considered highly speculative and risky. Critics, including ethics advisors and some Republican lawmakers, argue the event could violate the Emoluments Clause and create opportunities for quid pro quo arrangements with foreign entities.

          <p>President Trump's tariff policy has created a pattern where initially high tariffs are later reduced or exempted, making even a 30% tariff feel like a relief to businesses. This strategy, known as the anchor effect, has been used throughout Trump's career to recontextualize numbers in negotiations. While this may provide some psychological relief, the uncertainty caused by the constant changes creates problems for businesses, hindering long-term planning and investment. Despite Trump's claims that tariffs will lead to long-term gains in U.S. manufacturing, the unpredictability makes it difficult for businesses to make informed decisions.</p>

The FAA has now capped Newark flights at 56 per hour, a 15% reduction, following multiple system failures. The controller attributes the problems to the FAA's decision to move Newark airspace control from Long Island to Philadelphia, causing technical issues and staffing shortages, and says the situation is worse than predicted.</p>

          <p>A wrongly deported Maryland man to El Salvador ignited internal conflict within the Trump administration, involving multiple federal agencies, including Homeland Security, Justice, and State, over how to handle the mistake. The government was accused of attempting to downplay the danger he would face in a Salvadoran prison and falsely portray the man as an MS-13 leader. Erez Reuveni, a Justice Department lawyer who advised bringing the man back to the U.S., was fired for not zealously advocating for the government. Despite court rulings demanding his release, the man remains imprisoned in El Salvador, highlighting the administration's resistance to judicial intervention.</p>

They argue that the evolving policies and lack of a clear endgame have created issues and collateral damage, leading to questions about the overall strategy.</p>

          <p>The UK's government borrowing exceeded expectations in April, increasing to Â£20.2 billion, which puts pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Experts predict that taxes will likely need to rise in the autumn to meet economic rules. The Office for National Statistics reported that borrowing was up Â£1 billion from April last year, marking the fourth highest figure for April since monthly records began in 1993. While tax receipts increased, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increases in pensions and other benefits.</p>
