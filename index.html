        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate once again failed to advance legislation aimed at funding the government, ensuring the ongoing shutdown persists into its first full day. Two procedural votes, one on a Democratic proposal and another on a House-backed Republican bill, both fell short of the 60-vote threshold needed for passage. Congressional leaders from both parties continue to publicly blame each other for the impasse, with Democrats focused on including healthcare provisions and Republicans pushing for a clean, short-term funding extension. The stalemate suggests the shutdown will continue for at least several more days as negotiations remain stalled.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been formally charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice, a move widely seen as politically motivated by the Trump administration. The charges, signed by a former personal lawyer for President Trump who was recently appointed as a U.S. attorney, relate to Comey's 2020 Senate testimony. This action is part of a broader pattern of the administration allegedly using the Justice Department to target political opponents and critics. Observers view these developments as evidence of a "retribution presidency" that potentially undermines the traditional independence of the Justice Department.</p>

Christina Derevjanik from Stamford, Connecticut, reached the bonus round and correctly solved the puzzle "PACK OF COYOTES," revealing the million-dollar prize envelope. This marks the fourth million-dollar win in the show's history but the first since Ryan Seacrest took over as host. Seacrest, who had previously expressed a goal of giving away a million dollars in 2025, celebrated the record-breaking moment on the show.</p>

          <p>A 20-story residential building in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx experienced a partial collapse following an explosion in its boiler room. The blast tore away an entire corner of the New York City Housing Authority building, sending a cascade of debris onto the street below. Despite the extensive structural damage, Mayor Eric Adams confirmed that there were miraculously no reported injuries or fatalities. Firefighters and emergency crews conducted thorough searches of the rubble to ensure no one was trapped, while officials began evacuating affected apartments and inspecting the building's structural integrity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her role while her lawsuit against President Trump's attempt to fire her proceeds. The court deferred the administration's request to remove her, scheduling oral arguments for January 2026. President Trump has sought to oust Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies and for which she has not been charged.

          <p>Australia launched its ICC Women's Cricket World Cup title defense with an 89-run victory against New Zealand in Indore. All-rounder Ash Gardner was instrumental in the win, scoring a powerful 115 runs from just 83 balls to help Australia recover from a precarious position and post a total of 326. New Zealand captain Sophie Devine mounted a strong challenge with a century of her own, but her dismissal triggered a late-game collapse. Australian bowler Annabel Sutherland took three key wickets in a single over, quickly ending New Zealand's chances and securing the win for the defending champions.</p>

The evidence challenges the Met's claims of reform following previous scandals, suggesting that toxic attitudes have simply been driven underground rather than eliminated.

          <p>A military court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has sentenced former President Joseph Kabila to death in absentia after convicting him of treason and war crimes. Kabila was accused of supporting the M23 rebel group, which controls large areas in the country's east. The ruling has raised serious concerns about the nation's stability, with Kabila's supporters calling the trial politically motivated and warning it could derail fragile peace efforts. While some activists support the verdict, citing the need for accountability for years of conflict, analysts are skeptical that the sentence will ever be carried out, given Kabila's unknown whereabouts.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup player Tyrrell Hatton has called on home supporters to refrain from retaliatory behavior when the tournament is held in Ireland in 2027. His plea follows the recent event at Bethpage in the U.S., where European players, particularly Rory McIlroy, faced hostile and abusive comments from American fans. Hatton, who secured the victory for Europe, stated that he prefers a respectful atmosphere where the outcome is not influenced by attempts to distract players. The PGA of America's chief executive has since pledged to apologize to McIlroy and the European team for the conduct of the home crowd.</p>

          <p>During the U.S. government shutdown, National Park Service (NPS) sites will remain partially open, with trails, roads, and open-air memorials accessible to the public. However, gated facilities and visitor centers will be closed, and staffing will be reduced by roughly 64%, with only essential employees remaining to protect life and property. Parks can use funds from previously collected fees to maintain basic services like restrooms and trash collection. This approach differs from a damaging 2018-2019 shutdown where parks were left open but completely unstaffed, leading to significant vandalism and environmental harm.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party has claimed that leader Nigel Farage's publicly funded security protection was reduced by 75% two weeks ago for "inexplicable reasons." According to the party's head of policy, private donors have stepped in to cover the security costs. The claim comes amid a heated political dispute with the Labour Party, which Reform UK accuses of inciting violence against Farage. A House of Commons spokesperson stated that they do not comment on individual security arrangements but assured that a rigorous, risk-based assessment process is in place for all Members of Parliament, conducted by security professionals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) posted a banner on its official homepage blaming the "Radical Left" for the government shutdown, a move that an ethics watchdog group has called a "blatant violation" of federal law. The message claimed Democrats were inflicting pain on Americans to achieve a "$1.5 trillion wish list." The nonprofit group Public Citizen filed a complaint, arguing the partisan language on a government website violates the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in certain political activities. The group contends this action is part of a broader pattern of ethics enforcement being weakened under the current administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has placed a hold on approximately $18 billion in federal funding for two major New York infrastructure projects: a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and the Second Avenue subway expansion. The White House budget director cited the administration's opposition to "unconstitutional DEI principles" as the reason. However, a Department of Transportation statement attributed the hold to the government shutdown, which has forced the furlough of staff responsible for processing the funds. New York Governor Kathy Hochul condemned the move, suggesting the administration was using "culture wars" as a pretext to halt critical projects.</p>

The job losses were spread across several sectors, with leisure and hospitality seeing a significant decline. This key data release adds to concerns about the labor market and increases pressure on the Federal Reserve as it considers future interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A $30,000 home equity loan with a 10-year repayment term would now have an approximate monthly payment of $369, while a 15-year term would cost around $290 per month. These payments are marginally lower than they were earlier in the year, reflecting the modest drop in interest rates. The article advises homeowners to compare these fixed-rate loan costs with variable-rate options like a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to determine the most suitable financial product.

          <p>The recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has contributed to a drop in mortgage rates, making homeownership more affordable for borrowers. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a $600,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $3,648, which is about $360 less per month than it would have been at the start of 2025. This reduction in borrowing costs provides significant potential savings for new homebuyers and current homeowners who may be considering refinancing their existing higher-rate mortgages.
