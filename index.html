          <h2>Judge Temporarily Halts Trump Administration's Workforce Cuts at Federal Agencies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 23:49:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from implementing significant job cuts and reorganizations across 20 federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Departments of State and Treasury. The lawsuit, brought by federal employee unions, argues that the administration's actions, led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), exceed its legal authority and require Congressional approval. The judge sided with the plaintiffs, stating that the administration's actions appear to be exceeding its authority and the restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days while the case is considered. The administration defends its actions as necessary to cut bureaucratic bloat and save taxpayer money, but unions and Democratic lawmakers view them as unlawful and disruptive.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, leading to further flight delays and cancellations. The outage, lasting approximately 90 seconds, impacted communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark's airspace. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system, citing outdated equipment as the cause of the disruptions, and multiple controllers took trauma leave after the initial equipment failure. United Airlines has limited flights to and from Newark, and officials insist that the airspace remains safe, despite the delays.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested by federal authorities for allegedly trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in his city. Baraka, who is running for governor of New Jersey, was taken into custody after demanding to be let through a security gate at the Delaney Hall ICE facility, where protesters and members of Congress were gathered. His administration had previously filed a lawsuit to block the facility's opening, arguing that it lacked proper permits.

          <p>India and Pakistan engaged in a dangerous escalation of military conflict, with Pakistan accusing India of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting multiple air bases, including one near Islamabad. Pakistan retaliated by targeting Indian air bases and a missile storage site, calling its campaign "Operation Bunyan al-Marsus." The conflict, which began after militants killed 26 people in India-controlled Kashmir, has intensified with the use of drones and exchanges of gunfire, leading to civilian casualties and prompting diplomatic pressure from international bodies. There are no signs of de-escalation, and the mobilization of soldiers and suspension of cricket leagues indicate the severity of the situation.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) edged down by 0.1% year-on-year in April, fueling fears of deflation amid ongoing trade tensions. High tariffs continue to stifle bilateral trade, leaving Chinese manufacturers with mounting stockpiles of unsold goods. Food prices declined by 0.2% from a year earlier, while service prices rose by 0.3%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Prices for other goods and services and clothing rose by 6.6% and 1.3% respectively, while housing saw an increase of 0.1%.</p>

          <p>House Republicans introduced the initial components of a $4 trillion tax cut plan, aiming to make key provisions of President Trump's 2017 tax cut permanent while introducing temporary, more generous tax breaks for the next few years. The legislation seeks to lock in place the larger standard deduction and lower individual income tax rates from 2017, while temporarily increasing the standard deduction and child tax credit. The bill does not address the cap on state and local tax deductions or Trump's campaign pledges to exempt certain income forms from taxes, and Democrats have criticized the plan for favoring the wealthy at the expense of programs for the poor.</p>

The settlement divides the funds equally between Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi, with payments due by June 9.

Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller argued that the U.S. is facing a national security threat due to undocumented migrants "invading" the country, justifying the potential suspension. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus and that a president cannot do so unilaterally, but the administration believes that the courts will make the correct decision.

          <p>US-China financial ties are experiencing increased strain due to declining trust and escalating trade tensions, impacting cross-border investments and economic cooperation. New regulations, such as the Outbound Investment Rule and the America First Investment Policy, have added complexity to fundraising activities for Chinese companies in the US. The trade war has resulted in tariffs of up to 145% on goods from China, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors. The world's two largest economies, intertwined across sectors from trade to finance, have been driven further apart, impacting mutual trust and sustainable finance.</p>

          <p>Japanese figure skating prodigy Taiga Nishino, though too young for the next Winter Olympics, is making waves in the sport after mastering two quadruple jumps at the age of 15. The high school student landed a quad toe loop in a competition for the first time and has previously executed a quad salchow, drawing comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata. Despite recent growth spurts requiring adjustments to his equipment, Nishino continues to deliver strong results, including winning the junior high national championship.

          <p>A recent government survey in Japan revealed that approximately 39% of people experience loneliness at times, with little change since a law addressing isolation took effect last year. The survey also examined the relationship between smartphone usage and feelings of loneliness, finding that those who used smartphones for more than eight hours a day were more likely to feel lonely. The most frequently cited factor contributing to loneliness was the bereavement of a family member, followed by living alone and serious health issues. The survey targeted individuals aged 16 and over across Japan.</p>

China has over 100 operational and under-construction commercial reactors, more than any other country, many located in geopolitically sensitive areas.
