          <h2>Legal Experts Dismiss Trump's Threat to Revoke Rosie O'Donnell's Citizenship as Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 10:07:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump's recent social media post threatening to revoke Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship has been widely dismissed by legal experts as unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment establishes birthright citizenship, which cannot be unilaterally revoked by a president for native-born citizens. This incident is part of a long-standing public feud between Trump and O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland citing the political climate. The discussion also highlights the Trump administration's broader efforts to challenge birthright citizenship and increase denaturalization for naturalized citizens, raising significant legal and constitutional questions.</p>

          <p>The American woman who was sexually assaulted by Mark Gordon in 1989 has spoken out, calling him a dangerous psychopath who should have been imprisoned for life. Court documents from his 1990 sentencing in Florida reveal the brutal details of the four-hour attack, which occurred when he was 14. Gordon and his partner, Constance Marten, were recently convicted in the UK for the gross negligence manslaughter of their baby. The victim stated she was 'floored' to learn he was on the run in the UK, believing his violent nature was evident even decades ago.</p>

          <h2>Wildfire Destroys Historic Grand Canyon Lodge and Dozens of Other Structures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 10:04:13 EDT</div>

          <p>A major wildfire near the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge along with 50 to 80 other structures, including National Park Service buildings. The Dragon Bravo Fire grew rapidly due to strong winds, complicating firefighting efforts and forcing evacuations. A resulting chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment facility further hampered operations and posed health risks. While no injuries have been reported, the loss of the iconic lodge, a central feature for visitors since the 1930s, is being mourned as a significant blow to Arizona's state history.</p>

          <p>Emergency crews in Kerr County, Texas, paused search operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4 floods due to new flood threats. The initial disaster killed at least 132 people, and around 160 individuals remain missing in the Hill Country area. Renewed heavy rains are causing rivers like the Guadalupe and San Saba to rise again, creating dangerous conditions and flooding roads and bridges. Authorities have issued new flash flood warnings, urging extreme caution as recovery efforts are intermittently halted by the severe weather, compounding the tragedy for the affected communities.</p>

The malware tracked every website visited and redirected users to fraudulent or ad-heavy pages. The article lists the specific extensions and advises affected users to immediately uninstall them, clear their browser data, and run a full system malware scan.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that Republican-led legislation signed by President Trump will cause a significant surge in electricity costs, disproportionately affecting residents in states that voted for him. By removing tax credits and support for cheaper renewable energy sources like wind and solar, the bill is projected to increase average annual household energy costs by $170 by 2035. States like Missouri, Kentucky, and Texas are expected to see the largest spikes. Critics argue this contradicts Trump's promises to lower energy costs and will force a greater reliance on more expensive fossil fuels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chris Kirby, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, has grown his company, Ithaca Hummus, from a farmers market venture into a major brand expected to generate $50 million in revenue this year. After leaving a burnout-inducing restaurant career, Kirby started the business while studying at Cornell, using a $450 blender and hand-squeezing lemons to keep costs low. By focusing on deep market penetration rather than rapid geographic expansion, the brand built a strong reputation and is now sold in over 8,000 retailers. Kirby has maintained control by avoiding outside investors, focusing on profitability and long-term growth.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has quietly pushed back against escalating criticism from the Trump administration regarding its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. In response to accusations of mismanagement and extravagance from officials like OMB Director Russell Vought, the Fed posted a new FAQ page on its website. The page justifies the project's costs and necessity, directly refuting claims about 'VIP dining rooms' and explaining cost increases. This defense comes as the Trump administration appears to be building a case to remove Chairman Jerome Powell from his position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid rising tensions with the Trump administration over government subsidies and regulations, speculation is growing that Elon Musk could move more of his tech empire's operations to China. After Trump suggested Musk's businesses would fail without U.S. subsidies, experts noted that escalating conflict could push Musk to relocate research or manufacturing abroad. China, with its advanced supply chains and infrastructure, is seen as a potential destination for companies like Tesla and SpaceX. Such a move would have significant implications for the U.S. tech industry and its geopolitical standing.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has strongly denied allegations that he was incapacitated or unaware of the numerous pardons and commutations issued in his name during the final days of his presidency. In an interview, he called those making the claims 'liars,' insisting, 'I made every single one of those' decisions. The controversy stems from the use of an autopen to sign the documents, which conservatives argue makes them non-binding. Biden defended the practice as legal and necessary due to the large volume of orders, a method also used by his predecessor, Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The president of the global players' union, Fifpro, has sharply criticized FIFA's expanded Club World Cup, labeling the tournament a 'fiction' that disregards player welfare. Comparing FIFA President Gianni Infantino to the Roman emperor Nero, Sergio Marchi condemned the competition for creating a 'dangerous disconnect' from the reality faced by most footballers. The criticism highlights an escalating dispute over the packed international match calendar and a perceived lack of consultation with players, which has already led to the pursuit of legal action against FIFA by Fifpro and other football bodies.</p>

          <p>Financial and legal experts are advising older Americans to be highly cautious about sharing sensitive personal information to protect themselves from fraud and manipulation. Revealing details about net worth, passwords, power of attorney arrangements, wills, or health issues can create significant vulnerabilities. Scammers and even opportunistic family members often target seniors, who hold a majority of the nation's wealth. To mitigate risks, it is recommended to keep such information private, sharing it only with trusted, licensed professionals and ensuring legal documents like a power of attorney have clear, protective limits.</p>

The incident occurred when the Shanghai-to-Milan flight climbed from 34,100 to 36,000 feet without being instructed to do so by air traffic control. One possible explanation being investigated is that the Air China pilot may have misheard or misunderstood an instruction that was intended for the other aircraft involved in the incident.</p>
