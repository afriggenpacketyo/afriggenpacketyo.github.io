The company, recently valued at $3.3 billion, is planning significant global expansion, targeting new hubs in Europe, Asia, and South America to scale its operations. CEO Mati Staniszewski noted that while a listing location has not been decided, London is a possibility if the UK market environment for tech firms improves. This strategic move follows a recent $180 million funding round and reflects the company's ambition to become a long-lasting public entity in the rapidly growing AI industry.

          <p>House Republican leadership is struggling to gather enough support to pass President Trump's significant domestic policy package, facing resistance from both moderate and conservative members. A key procedural vote to begin debate on the bill was delayed for hours and remained unresolved late into the night, with several GOP lawmakers voting 'no'. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed confidence in eventually securing the necessary votes, while President Trump publicly voiced his frustration with the holdouts. The bill, which passed the Senate by a narrow margin, includes major tax cuts and spending increases but has been criticized by some House members for changes made in the upper chamber.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has acknowledged that he failed to properly engage with his party's MPs regarding proposed welfare reforms, leading to a series of embarrassing U-turns. The government was forced to make last-minute concessions to its plan to overhaul disability benefits to avoid a significant rebellion from over 120 Labour MPs. This episode has gutted the bill of its key measures and raised questions about Starmer's authority and policy coherence. In an interview, Starmer took responsibility for the flawed process but insisted he remains committed to pragmatic welfare system reform.</p>

          <p>Senior U.N. officials have issued a stark warning that criminal gangs now have 'near-total control' of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, with an estimated 90% of the city under their influence. The state's authority is rapidly diminishing as gangs expand their territory, paralyze commerce, and establish parallel governance structures, leading to soaring prices for essential goods. The violence is also spreading to previously peaceful regions of the country. The U.N. warned that without greater international action, a total collapse of the state's presence in the capital could become a reality, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's historic 3,000th career strikeout, Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Plaschke makes the case that Kershaw is the greatest pitcher in the history of the Dodgers franchise, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The argument centers on Kershaw's remarkable longevity and endurance over 18 seasons, contrasting it with Koufax's brilliant but shorter five-year peak. The article highlights that Kershaw has outlasted Koufax in nearly every significant pitching category, including innings pitched and total strikeouts. While acknowledging Kershaw's postseason struggles, the piece emphasizes that his sustained excellence and cultural impact on the team solidify his status as the franchise's best.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. House of Representatives operating with a slim Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote on legislation has become more relevant. According to House rules, if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure is considered lost and does not pass. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. This procedural reality was highlighted in a February 2024 vote to impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which initially tied before a Republican changed his vote to allow the bill to be reconsidered later.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new, home-grown turbine with a record-setting single-unit capacity of 500 megawatts, designed for a major hydropower plant in Tibet. The massive 80-tonne turbine was developed over four years by Harbin Electric Machinery Company and is constructed from durable martensitic steel. Two of these powerful turbines will be installed at the Datang Zala Hydropower Station, located on a tributary of the Nu River in southwest China. The development represents a significant engineering achievement for the country's renewable energy infrastructure and has been described as the 'heart' of the new power unit.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings has seen a dramatic revival, with new listing volumes surging to $14 billion in the first half of the year, an eightfold increase from the same period in 2024. This boom is largely driven by mainland Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, spurred by supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of domestic A-share listings, and ample market liquidity. This renewed frenzy has positioned Hong Kong to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year, a stark turnaround from several years of lackluster IPO activity.

In an interview, Bacon acknowledged concerns over changes to Medicaid but argued that voting against the bill would effectively raise taxes on middle-class families by about 20%. The bill faces opposition from both moderate Republicans, who are worried about millions losing insurance, and conservatives concerned about its impact on the national debt.

While a narrow majority of 51% of Latinos voted for Kamala Harris, the dramatic shift toward the Republican candidate has caught the attention of political experts. Analysts suggest the trend reflects a growing populist sentiment among Latino voters, driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic Party's messaging and policies, particularly on immigration. The results are seen as a major wake-up call for Democrats regarding the evolving priorities of this key demographic.</p>
