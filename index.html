          <p>Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, framing it as a necessary step to dismantle Hamas's remaining strongholds. He stated the goal is not occupation but to "free Gaza," outlining a short timetable for demilitarization and establishing a non-Israeli civilian administration. The plan has drawn condemnation over humanitarian concerns and the safety of remaining hostages, though the U.S. has defended Israel's right to determine its security needs at the UN. The announcement was followed by heavy Israeli bombardment in the area, resulting in further casualties, including several journalists.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, leading to significant shifts in marine ecosystems. This warming trend, driven by climate change, has attracted new species like octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish to UK waters. While these new arrivals are remarkable, the rising temperatures are also creating challenges for native cold-water species such as cod. The phenomenon highlights the broader impacts of climate change, affecting both marine biodiversity and local fishing communities that depend on specific catches.</p>

          <p>A violent shooting outside a nightclub in Santa Lucia, Ecuador, has left eight people dead and two others injured. According to police, gunmen arrived in two pickup trucks and opened fire on a crowd gathered outside the establishment in the early morning hours. Among the deceased was the nightclub's owner, who is the brother of the town's mayor. The attack occurred in the Guayas province, which is currently under a state of emergency declared by President Daniel Noboa to combat rampant gang violence in the region.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in western Colorado are battling two large, lightning-caused wildfires that have burned over 120,000 acres, driven by high winds and drought-stressed conditions. The larger Lee Fire has forced evacuations in two counties, including for a prison, and at one point threatened the town of Meeker. Crews are working to establish containment lines to protect homes and infrastructure, but dangerous conditions have sometimes required them to pull back. The fires are also causing poor air quality across the region, with forecasts predicting continued hot and dry weather.</p>

Starter Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance, but relievers Blake Treinen and Alex Vesia couldn't hold the lead. Shohei Ohtani had a productive day, reaching base four times, but the team struggled overall with runners in scoring position, leaving the bases loaded in both the eighth and ninth innings. The loss, combined with a San Diego Padres win, narrowed the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to just two games.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the BBC's Jeremy Bowen reveals that Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank have intensified their efforts to drive out Palestinian communities since October 2023. Ultra-nationalist settlers, supported by hardline ministers in the Israeli government, are accelerating the expansion of settlements, which they view as a religious and national mission. The report highlights a sharp rise in settler violence and alleges that Israeli security forces often fail to protect Palestinians. This campaign is effectively extinguishing hopes for a future Palestinian state and severing local communities from their land.</p>

          <p>In an interview, historian Rana Mitter emphasizes the profound and often underestimated impact of World War II on modern China. Mitter, a leading expert on the topic, explains that the devastating conflict, particularly the invasion by Japan, shattered China's pre-war infrastructure and society, forcing a complete restart after 1945. He argues that this historical trauma is a key factor in understanding China's contemporary political and strategic outlook. According to Mitter, this experience informs China's current interest in maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for the immediate removal of homeless individuals from Washington, D.C., stating they should be relocated to places "FAR from the Capital." In a series of social media posts, he linked homelessness to crime and squalor, vowing to make the city safer and cleaner, and announced a press conference on the matter. This follows a recent order to increase federal law enforcement presence in the city and hints at a potential federal takeover of D.C.'s governance. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, noting that violent crime in the city has actually been declining.</p>

          <p>A large gorse fire spread rapidly across Arthur's Seat, a prominent hill in the center of Edinburgh, during one of the city's busiest festival weekends. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service dispatched multiple crews to tackle the blaze, and police urged the public to avoid the area. Smoke from the fire billowed across the city, and a large section of Holyrood Park was closed to pedestrians. No casualties were reported in the incident, which follows several wildfire warnings issued across Scotland this year due to an unusually warm and dry summer.</p>

          <p>NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Connor Zilisch sustained a broken collarbone after an accident during his victory celebration at Watkins Glen. After winning the race, the 19-year-old was climbing onto the roof of his car when he lost his balance and fell headfirst onto the ground. He was transported to a hospital where CT scans for a head injury came back clear. Zilisch later confirmed the collarbone fracture on social media, expressing gratitude that the injury wasn't more severe. The incident has ruled him out of the upcoming Cup Series race.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked a Trump administration move that would have allowed commercial fishing within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The ruling overturns a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had reversed Obama-era protections for the area. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups filed the lawsuit, arguing the administration violated federal law by changing the rules without the required public notice and comment period. The decision immediately halts any commercial fishing in the protected waters, which are vital ecosystems for endangered species and Indigenous cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Liverpool showcased its revamped lineup under new manager Arne Slot in a 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace in the Community Shield, ultimately losing on penalties. Four new signings started, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, who was a standout performer in a new, freer attacking midfield role. The team displayed flashes of brilliant, fluid attacking play, with debut goals from Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong. However, defensive vulnerabilities were also apparent as they twice surrendered the lead, indicating that while promising, the new system still has issues to resolve.</p>
