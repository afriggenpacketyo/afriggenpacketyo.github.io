            <p>Wells Fargo's shares experienced a drop following the bank's report of lower-than-expected quarterly revenue and a decrease in net interest income. Despite adjusted earnings per share exceeding expectations, revenue fell short, contributing to investor unease. CEO Charlie Scharf addressed the economic uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's trade policies, advocating for a swift and beneficial resolution. The bank also bought back a significant amount of its own shares during the quarter, signaling confidence in its financial position, while also setting aside funds for potential credit losses.

            <p>A group of Senate Democrats has formally requested the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate President Trump and potentially other members of his cabinet and administration for possible securities law violations. The request stems from Trump's announcement of a pause in reciprocal tariffs, which the senators suggest may have led to insider trading or market manipulation. The Democrats are specifically concerned with Trump's statement that it was a "GREAT TIME TO BUY" into the stock market, which preceded the announcement of a 90-day tariff pause and a subsequent market rally. The letter asks the SEC to determine whether Trump or other officials illegally profited from non-public information. (not investment advice)</p>

Democrats and members of the medical community have previously requested the release of his medical records. This marks the first physical examination of Trump's second term in office.</p>

They focus on building relationships with pet owners and providing comprehensive care tailored to individual needs, often accommodating financial constraints. This shift is driven by concerns about burnout and the prioritization of quantity over quality in corporate veterinary medicine, aiming to create a more sustainable and fulfilling environment for both veterinarians and pet owners.</p>

Experts worry about the financial consequences for the IRS, which collects trillions in tax revenue annually, and its ability to address the tax gap.

            <p>Ukraine's European allies have committed €21 billion in new military support to Kyiv, emphasizing the critical nature of the year for the ongoing war. Germany is contributing over half of the total aid, with €11 billion pledged over four years. The pledges include air defenses, missiles, and other essential equipment. The support aims to fill the gap left by the changed priorities of the U.S. under Donald Trump. Air defense and artillery are prioritized, in response to the increasing use of glide bombs and drones by Russian forces.</p>

            <p>President Trump's proposed tariffs on pharmaceutical imports are raising concerns about potential consequences for drugmakers and American patients. Experts warn that the tariffs could disrupt the pharmaceutical supply chain, increase drug prices, and worsen existing drug shortages. Generic drug manufacturers, which often rely on ingredients from China and India, could be particularly vulnerable. Some experts believe that the tariffs could undermine efforts to control healthcare costs in the U.S., where prescription drug prices are already significantly higher than in other developed countries.

            <p>Hollywood is facing challenges in the Chinese box office, compounded by the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. While the Chinese market was once a lucrative source of revenue for American films, its audiences have increasingly favored domestic productions. The expiration of the U.S.-China Film Agreement and the rise of sophisticated Chinese filmmaking have contributed to this trend. As a result, Hollywood studios are becoming less reliant on the Chinese box office for film profits. The article notes that a weakening currency is a more pressing economic issue for Hollywood than restricted film releases. (not investment advice)</p>

The export restrictions demonstrate China's ability to weaponize its control of rare earths, which are vital to various industries. The restrictions are likely to accelerate diversification efforts away from China. (not investment advice)</p>
