          <h2>Government Borrowing Rises Due to Increased Spending on Pay and Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 03:28:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK government borrowing exceeded expectations in the year leading up to March, primarily due to heightened expenditure on public sector pay and benefits. The borrowing reached £151.9bn, surpassing the forecast of £137.3bn, a figure significantly higher than anticipated. This news arrives as Chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares for the IMF and World Bank annual meetings, where she intends to advocate for a US trade agreement. Some economists suggest potential spending cuts and tax increases may be necessary to adhere to borrowing regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia in London have been downgraded, with key US figures no longer attending. This comes amid speculation that Russia might be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in return for significant concessions, including US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, though Ukrainian President Zelensky has rejected this proposal. Putin had unilaterally called for a temporary ceasefire for the Easter weekend, but UK Defence Secretary John Healey reported no evidence of a let-up in attacks. The conflict, ongoing since 2014, has resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties and nearly seven million Ukrainian refugees worldwide.</p>
