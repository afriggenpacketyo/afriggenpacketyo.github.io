          <p>The Trump administration announced an agreement with AstraZeneca to lower drug prices in the U.S. This deal, following a similar one with Pfizer, will make AstraZeneca's primary care medications available at "most-favored nation" pricing on TrumpRx.gov. The initiative aims to address high drug costs and encourage pharmaceutical investments in the U.S. by threatening tariffs if deals are not made. This effort seeks to bring more affordable medicines to American consumers.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports, effective next month, citing new Chinese export controls on rare earth metals. This move significantly escalates the U.S.-China trade war, with existing tariffs already at 30%. The announcement also included export controls on critical software and led to a sharp decline in major stock indexes. This action complicates upcoming trade talks and a potential meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced new 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, effective November 1, citing China's "extraordinarily aggressive position on trade" and export controls. This declaration came after an earlier threat that triggered a stock market sell-off, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all tumbling. The move also includes export controls on critical software and casts doubt on Trump's planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. This marks a significant escalation in the ongoing trade dispute.</p>

          <p>Tesla's release of less expensive Model 3 and Model Y Standard cars has disappointed many, as the models are significantly pared down and offer only modest savings.
