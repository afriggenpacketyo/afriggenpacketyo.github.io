        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will accelerate its military buildup to meet NATO's 2% of GDP defense spending target by March of next year, significantly earlier than the previously pledged 2030 or 2032 deadlines. This decision is motivated by increasing threats from Russia, China, and concerns about Arctic security, with Carney emphasizing the need for Canada to act in a world facing challenges akin to those at the end of World War II. The new strategy involves investing in soldiers and equipment, expanding military capabilities, strengthening the domestic defense industry, and diversifying defense partnerships, backed by a C$9.3bn cash increase for this fiscal year. The plan includes investments in new submarines, aircraft, ships, armored vehicles, artillery, drones, and sensors for Arctic monitoring, along with the creation of a new defense procurement agency to expedite decision-making.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 Marines have been activated for deployment to Los Angeles to support National Guard troops amid tense protests, according to U.S. officials. The Marines will serve in a support role, similar to the National Guard, as the city grapples with ongoing demonstrations. Secretary of State Pete Hegseth had previously placed Marines at Camp Pendleton on high alert, ready to deploy if violence escalated. Their activation follows a period of increased tensions and protests in Los Angeles, prompting the federal government to increase its presence in the city.</p>

In his 2023 memoir, "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)," Stone detailed his revolutionary music style and his struggles with addiction.

The program, previously referred to as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts," would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The provision to create these accounts passed the House as part of a major tax-cut bill and is currently pending in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Merck’s RSV shot, Enflonsia, for infants, creating a competitor to Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus in the market for infant respiratory syncytial virus protection. Merck plans to begin taking orders for the shot in July, aiming to deliver shipments before the typical RSV season begins in the fall. This approval provides doctors with another option to combat RSV, a leading cause of hospitalization among newborns, and comes as Sanofi reveals efforts to increase the supply of Beyfortus following shortages in the previous season. Both Enflonsia and Beyfortus are preventative monoclonal antibodies, but they target different parts of the virus, and Merck's shot can be administered regardless of an infant's weight, offering potential dosing convenience.</p>

          <p>A new House GOP bill, introduced by Rep. Nick Langworthy and supported by Sen. Ted Cruz, aims to defund sanctuary cities like Los Angeles that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act would allow the executive branch to withhold federal funds from states and localities that obstruct Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The bill also seeks to empower state and local officers to work with federal authorities, even if local laws mandate otherwise, addressing concerns such as New York's Green Light Law, which restricts sharing DMV records with federal authorities. This legislative push follows recent violence in Los Angeles related to ICE raids, with Republicans criticizing Democratic officials for hindering federal authorities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed actor Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against actor Blake Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and The New York Times. The lawsuit stemmed from Lively's legal complaint alleging she was sexually harassed during the making of the 2024 movie *It Ends With Us*, directed by Baldoni. Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, which he co-founded, filed the defamation suit in response to Lively's allegations and a related article in The New York Times. Judge Lewis J. Liman ruled that Baldoni failed to demonstrate actual malice in Lively's allegations, leading to the dismissal of the case.</p>

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the federal deployment of the state's National Guard to Los Angeles. Attorney General Rob Bonta stated that the federalization of the California National Guard deprives the state of resources needed to protect its citizens. The suit argues that the governor is the commander-in-chief of the guard and must consent to its federalization, which Gov. Gavin Newsom did not. The legal action follows a series of escalating exchanges between President Trump and Gov. Newsom regarding the protests against federal immigration enforcement operations in the area.</p>

          <p>The global transition to clean energy is heavily reliant on a set of "critical minerals" essential for producing technologies like solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. Demand for these minerals is expected to surge in the coming years, but their uneven distribution across the world poses potential supply chain vulnerabilities and environmental challenges. The United States, a major consumer of these minerals, is seeking to increase domestic production and secure supplies, while scientists are exploring alternative materials to reduce reliance on critical minerals. However, the need for mining and refining these materials raises concerns about environmental impacts and social equity.</p>

The R360 event, planned to run in two blocks, would clash with domestic rugby in Europe and risk the Test careers of England players, who are contractually obliged to play for Premiership clubs. Concerns also include the lack of sanctioning from governing bodies and the need for significant investment to attract players and market the event. Critics argue that rugby needs established roots rather than temporary "pop-ups" and that the new competition risks undermining the gains of recent years.</p>
