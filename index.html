          <p>Kenton Cool, a 51-year-old British mountain guide, has successfully scaled Mount Everest for the 19th time, setting a new record for the most ascents by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool's climbing journey began in 2004, with only interruptions in 2014 due to an avalanche that killed 16 Sherpa guides, in 2015 due to an earthquake-triggered avalanche, and in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. This achievement underscores his extensive experience and expertise in navigating the world's highest peak, as hundreds of climbers and guides aim to summit Everest during the spring climbing season before the weather deteriorates with the monsoon. Kami Rita, a Nepali Sherpa guide, holds the overall record with 30 climbs.</p>

          <h2>AI Tool Enables Real-Time Detection of Blood Clots</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 05:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed an AI-powered tool that allows doctors to observe blood clot formation in real time, offering a non-invasive method to monitor platelet activity. The tool uses a high-powered microscope and AI to analyze blood cell movement, distinguishing between single platelets, clumps, and white blood cells. This technology could significantly improve treatment for coronary artery disease by allowing doctors to directly assess the effectiveness of anti-platelet drugs, potentially leading to more personalized and safer treatments. While the technology is not yet ready for widespread use, it holds promise for transforming patient care in the future.</p>

          <h2>Simple Brick Stacking Technique Could Reduce Air Pollution in Bangladesh</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that a simple change in how bricks are stacked in kilns could significantly reduce air pollution in Bangladesh, where brick kilns contribute substantially to the country's poor air quality. By stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow and ensuring more consistent coal fueling, kilns can operate more efficiently and reduce fuel consumption by approximately 23%. This low-cost intervention not only decreases pollution but also improves worker conditions and increases profits for kiln owners, presenting a feasible solution for a country grappling with severe air pollution issues. The research team is now collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to expand the implementation of this training.</p>

          <p>Small, religiously affiliated colleges in rural areas are increasingly facing financial challenges due to declining enrollment and demographic shifts, leading some to consider mergers or closures. St. Ambrose University and Mount Mercy University are exploring a partnership to avoid this fate, reflecting a broader trend among religious institutions seeking collaborative solutions. While some religious colleges are experiencing enrollment gains due to growing political divisions and a desire for values-based education, many continue to struggle with rising costs and limited access for low-income students. These institutions often serve as vital educational resources in rural communities, offering a personal touch and a sense of belonging for students from small towns.</p>

          <p>A recent presentation by activist investor David Webb has ignited discussions about the legal system that will govern Hong Kong after 2047, when the "one country, two systems" framework is set to expire. Webb questioned whether Hong Kong law students should continue studying the existing system or begin learning mainland law, particularly concerning contract law and land leases. While some express concerns about the transition, others urge calm, recalling similar anxieties leading up to 1997. The debate highlights the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Hong Kong's autonomy and its integration with mainland China.</p>

          <p>This year's Cannes Film Festival is marked by a prevalence of films exploring dark and challenging themes, where characters often face legal, moral, and psychological storms, resulting in pessimistic endings. Ari Aster's "Eddington" satirizes the shared PTSD of the pandemic era, while Dominik Moll's "Dossier 137" portrays a police officer's disillusionment with her inability to affect meaningful change. Despite the grim narratives, the festival also features promising works like Harris Dickinson's directorial debut, "Urchin," which offers a 21st-century Dickensian take on life on the streets of London, showcasing the resilience and small joys found amidst hardship.</p>

          <p>A recent internal survey by the German military's Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences (ZMSBw) indicates that the Bundeswehr does not have "systemic" extremism within its ranks, with only a small percentage of soldiers exhibiting right-wing extremist attitudes. However, the study did identify problematic chauvinistic and xenophobic views among some soldiers, and external researchers remain skeptical due to past incidents of far-right networks and terrorist plots involving military members. Despite safeguards and anti-extremism measures, concerns persist about the potential for extremist attitudes to infiltrate the military, particularly given the normalization of right-wing views in wider society.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) battery maker, is diversifying into clean technology ahead of its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO). CATL established CharGo to develop mobile storage and charging robots for EVs, aiming to become a leader in the new-energy industry. CharGo plans to deploy thousands of charging robots globally, starting in mainland China, and aims to enter overseas markets by 2026. CATL's EV battery business remains its largest revenue source, but the company seeks to create a closed-loop ecosystem encompassing power generation, storage, and conversion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the revitalization of night trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance public transport in the United States. He notes that Europe is expanding its network of nocturnal routes to compete with short-haul flights, driven by concerns about climate change. In contrast, the United States is slashing funding for public infrastructure and prioritizing cars and planes. The author argues that investing in rail networks would improve Americans' well-being and reduce car dependence, but the country continues to prioritize expensive, niche transportation projects over proven mass transit systems.</p>

          <p>Poles are participating in a presidential election marked by heightened security concerns due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and worries about the U.S. commitment to European security. The main contenders are Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski, aligned with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the Law and Justice party. The election is also a test for other political forces, including the far right. The outcome will shape Poland's domestic and foreign policies, particularly its stance on issues such as abortion rights, LGBTQ protections, and relations with the European Union.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody, bare footprints, led to a decades-long search for justice in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. The investigation took a turn in 2015 when forensic scientists identified an unknown DNA profile repeating itself at the crime scene, which eventually led to Jerry Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Westrom was convicted of the murder after his DNA matched the unknown profile, and footprint analysis confirmed his presence at the scene. This case highlights the power of forensic science and genetic genealogy in solving cold cases.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using public-private partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, offering long-term operating rights to Chinese companies in exchange for construction financing. This model represents a shift from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative, as African governments seek to avoid debt concerns. Projects like Nairobiâ€™s mega-highway and Zambiaâ€™s Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are now being pursued under PPPs. Under one plan, Chinese companies would have exclusive rights to construct and operate the railway for a minimum of 25 years after completion to recoup their investment through toll fees.</p>
