        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs on certain imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum, marking the first trade deal since President Trump increased tariffs in April. The deal aims to strengthen the economic relationship between the two countries, with leaders from both sides expressing optimism, though details are still being finalized. The agreement reduces the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and slashes tariffs on steel and aluminum, while also including reciprocal access for beef exports. Kemi Badenoch, Conservative Party leader, criticized the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US.</p>

          <p>World Central Kitchen (WCK), a leading aid organization, has been forced to close its community soup kitchens across Gaza due to the ongoing blockade of humanitarian assistance, leaving warehouses empty. This closure impacts 133,000 meals per day, exacerbating hunger among a population already suffering from 19 months of war. UNICEF reports that a significant portion of Gaza's water system is damaged, and fuel shortages hinder desalination efforts. WCK founder José Andrés states that trucks loaded with aid are waiting in neighboring countries but cannot enter Gaza without permission, while Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer claims Hamas is engineering the hunger.</p>

          <p>Economic data indicates that many companies plan to pass tariff-related costs on to consumers, potentially leading to rising inflation. Surveys reveal that a majority of manufacturers intend to increase prices to offset tariff expenses, with economists predicting a significant rise in inflation over the next six months. While President Trump asserts that foreign exporters will absorb the tariff costs, experts suggest that U.S. consumers will likely bear the brunt of these increased expenses. Several companies, including Stanley Black & Decker and Procter & Gamble, have already announced price hikes in response to the new tariffs.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has announced its acquisition of Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange based in Dubai, for $2.9 billion, in a cash-and-stock transaction. This acquisition is poised to establish Coinbase as a leading international player in crypto derivatives, enhancing its ability to compete with industry giants like Binance. Deribit facilitated over $1 trillion in trading volume last year and has about $30 billion of current open interest on the platform. The deal is expected to diversify Coinbase's revenue streams and improve profitability amid regulatory tailwinds for the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by positive market sentiment following trade deal announcements between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's rise is attributed to its resilience as a bouncebackability asset amid brightening prospects for U.S. trade deals. The recent market uncertainty and pro-crypto Trump administration have bolstered bitcoin's appeal, with investors viewing it as a safe-haven asset. Rising tensions between India and Pakistan, coupled with the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts, are expected to further test bitcoin's resilience.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats have blocked legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency, due to concerns that the bill lacked sufficient protections and could potentially benefit President Trump. Trump's involvement in the crypto industry, including the launch of a meme coin and a family-linked stablecoin venture, has complicated the bill's progress. Democrats are proposing changes that would bar elected officials and their families from owning, controlling, or promoting stablecoin business ventures. The bill aimed to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a slight decline following mixed first-quarter results and soft guidance for the current period, with CFO Jeff Hoffmeister citing tariff "uncertainty". The company expects revenue to expand at a mid-20s percentage rate compared with a year earlier, while Wall Street had forecast roughly 22% growth. As many of Shopify's merchants are small- to medium-sized businesses, President Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports, which total 145%, are a concern. Roughly 1% of its gross merchandise volume is related to imports from China that were subject to the de minimis exemption.</p>

          <p>Tesla is threatening to sue the Canadian government following a freeze in EV tax credits, alleging the move deprives the company of $30 million. This action follows Tesla's suspicious claims for iZEV rebates right before the January freeze, where the company placed claims for tens of millions of dollars worth of iZEV rebates. Most of those claims came from just four dealers, with a single Tesla showroom in Quebec City claiming it had sold some 4,000 eligible vehicles over a single weekend. The Canadian government has since frozen iZEV payments for Tesla specifically, a move seen as retaliation for Donald Trump's unprecedented tariff threats.</p>
