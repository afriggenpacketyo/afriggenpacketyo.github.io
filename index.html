          <p>South Korea has reportedly indicted former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and ex-first lady Kim Keon Hee, marking significant legal developments in the nation's political landscape. Han faces charges of abetting the short-lived martial law bid by ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, alongside allegations of perjury and falsifying official documents. Kim, Yoon's wife, is accused of corruption, including involvement in a stock manipulation scheme, receiving free opinion polls for the 2022 presidential election, and accepting luxury gifts from a religious movement for business favors. These high-profile indictments follow President Lee Jae Myung's approval of investigations into Yoon's administration, which Yoon had previously vetoed while in office, leading to raids on a church and a military base.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 00:09:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has officially ended its tariff exemption for global parcel shipments valued under $800, a policy shift expected to significantly increase costs and disrupt supply chain models for various businesses. This change, which the Trump administration has declared permanent, broadens the earlier cancellation of the de minimis exemption for goods originating from China and Hong Kong. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro asserted that the policy aims to restrict the flow of narcotics and other dangerous items, while also adding up to $10 billion annually in tariff revenues. The de minimis exemption, established in 1938 and raised in 2015, had seen a nearly tenfold increase in package volume by 2024, enabling new direct-to-consumer business models for e-commerce firms like Shein and Temu.</p>

          <p>New Orleans and the broader Gulf Coast region are solemnly marking the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which made its devastating landfall on August 29, 2005. The catastrophic storm resulted in nearly 1,400 deaths and remains the costliest in US history, with damages estimated at approximately $200 billion in today's currency. The historic Lower 9th Ward, a predominantly Black community known for its multi-generational homeownership, was particularly ravaged by extensive levee breaches, causing widespread fatalities and the destruction of countless homes. This article reflects on the profound and enduring legacy of the catastrophe, illustrating the region's journey from immense devastation towards resilience and determination through a collection of powerful images.</p>

          <h2>UK Businesses Voice Concerns Over New US Small Parcel Tax</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 00:01:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK firms are expressing significant concerns over new US taxes on low-value parcels, warning of considerable uncertainty and potential price increases that threaten their cross-border trade. The Trump administration's decision to end the "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed goods valued under $800 to enter the US duty-free, now subjects these parcels to tariffs, including a 10% rate for UK goods. This policy shift has prompted small businesses, such as hand-dyed wool company Nellie and Eve, to halt US shipments due to opaque costs, while others, like Knots of Pine, have ceased selling to the US entirely, severely impacting their sales. The Federation of Small Businesses emphasizes that this will escalate operational costs and erect new barriers, compelling many small firms to rethink their export strategies to the US market.</p>

          <p>Tencent Holdings is strategically aiming for "aggressive" growth within the international cloud computing market, driven by a burgeoning overseas appetite for Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) models. Dowson Tong Tao-sang, Senior Executive Vice-President and CEO of Tencent's Cloud and Smart Industries Group, emphasized that the company's overseas cloud operations are currently its fastest-expanding segment, consistently achieving high double-digit growth over recent years. Tong sees substantial opportunities in bringing Chinese open-source AI models to a global clientele, especially in regions that prefer to host large language models locally. This sharpened focus underscores Tencent's efforts to remain competitive amid rapid AI advancements and intense rivalry with other major tech players like Alibaba and Baidu.</p>

          <p>Elderly survivors, known as "comfort women," in China are still awaiting court acceptance of landmark lawsuits filed against the Japanese government. In March, six survivors from Shanxi province filed a lawsuit, followed by eight more from Hunan province four months later, demanding a formal apology and 2 million yuan (US$276,000) in compensation for each victim. Despite the historical importance, provincial high courts have not responded or provided a timeline for these cases. With the plaintiffs now averaging 96 years old, their lawyers emphasize the urgency, stating the fight is not just for restitution but for crucial recognition of their immense suffering before time runs out.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley admitted he was caught "off guard" by the famously noisy New York crowd during his US Open second-round defeat to German third seed Alexander Zverev. Fearnley, ranked 60th and making his main-draw debut, ultimately lost 6-4 6-4 6-4, attributing some of his difficulty to the constant background chatter on Louis Armstrong Stadium, a court known for its hubbub. Despite showing commendable spirit by saving five match points against the three-time major finalist, his relative inexperience at the highest level and persistent issues with double faults proved to be significant challenges. Fearnley views this as a crucial learning experience, acknowledging the need to adapt to such unique atmospheres as he continues his rapidly progressing professional career.</p>

          <p>Florida executed Curtis Windom, 59, by lethal injection, thereby extending the state's record to 11 executions this year, the highest in the nation. Windom was convicted of the brutal 1992 triple murder of his girlfriend, Valerie Davis, her mother Mary Lubin, and Johnnie Lee, whom he claimed owed him money. His execution proceeded despite multiple appeals arguing incompetent legal representation concerning his mental health struggles, and heartfelt pleas from his own daughter and even the victims' relatives for clemency. These family members expressed forgiveness and a desire for healing that they felt was undermined by state-sanctioned punishment. Governor Ron DeSantis has notably signed numerous death warrants, solidifying Florida's position as the state with the most executions in 2025, with a 12th execution already set for September.</p>

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, whom President Donald Trump is actively attempting to remove from her position. The new referral alleges misrepresentations concerning Cook's mortgage for a condominium in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and two other homes in her government ethics filings during her tenure as a Fed governor. This aggressive action by Pulte, a Trump appointee who has been critical of the Fed, comes as Cook has simultaneously sued President Trump to legally block her unprecedented removal from the central bank. The escalating dispute underscores the Trump administration's broader pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and raises significant questions about the perceived independence of federal financial institutions.</p>

Officials revealed Westman, who died by suicide, previously attended the church's school and left a note, though a definitive motive remains elusive.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was recently detained by ICE again after release, facing potential deportation to Uganda while awaiting a criminal trial for allegedly transporting undocumented immigrants, charges he denies.

The 39-year-old leader, in power for just a year, faces removal over a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen, where she reportedly addressed him as "uncle" and a Thai military commander as her "opponent." This sparked fury and accusations of undermining the military, leading to a petition from 36 senators alleging poor ethical standards. The ruling could destabilize Thailand, which recently entered a ceasefire with Cambodia after deadly border clashes, and risks making Paetongtarn the fifth prime minister removed by the court in 17 years.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Biloxi, Mississippi, continues to struggle for federal funding from FEMA to complete critical rebuilding projects, including a stronger city pier and upgrades to its sewage and stormwater system. Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich reports FEMA still owes $34 million for past projects and has twice denied requests for increased funds, citing a lack of documentation for rising costs. This ongoing dispute reflects broader issues, with 254 other post-Katrina FEMA projects remaining unfinished in Louisiana and Mississippi. The Trump administration's efforts to overhaul FEMA and recent staff suspensions further complicate the situation, raising concerns about the agency's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Fire investigators are reportedly examining what role, if any, a prestigious Napa Valley winery, Hundred Acre, played in sparking the nearly 7,000-acre Pickett fire, which continues to threaten hundreds of buildings and dozens of wineries. A spokesperson for the Calistoga-based winery confirmed that company representatives had recently spoken with fire investigators, who are reportedly looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard ignited the major blaze. The Pickett fire, which started on August 21 at an address confirmed to be part of the Hundred Acre property, broke out amid a significant heat wave, prompting ongoing evacuation orders and warnings. While the cause remains under investigation, the incident highlights critical concerns about fire safety practices, especially within economically vital agricultural regions susceptible to wildfires.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its "customer of size" policy, no longer guaranteeing refunds for extra seats purchased by plus-size travelers, effective January 27 next year. Previously, the airline refunded the cost of an additional seat if one was available at takeoff, a policy cherished by advocates for the plus-size community. Critics argue this shift, alongside the upcoming implementation of assigned seating, creates financial burdens and accessibility barriers, potentially increasing anxiety for travelers who may need two seats. Advocates like Tigress Osborn of NAAFA view this as a reversal of Southwest's previous stance on inclusivity, attributing it to broader corporate financial cutbacks.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of new video footage has found that Israel struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack, not twice as initially reported. The incident, which killed at least 20 people including five journalists, involved two staircases being hit almost simultaneously in the first wave. Later, what was thought to be a single strike on first responders and journalists was in fact two separate projectiles hitting the same spot milliseconds apart. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially expressed regret and later claimed a Hamas camera was positioned nearby, but has not acknowledged multiple strikes, raising questions about potential violations of international law.</p>

Prosecutors allege Salazar hired the president of the Screamin' Demons Motorcycle Club to set fire to his underperforming Blackstone Avenue restaurant after he terminated its lease. Salazar reportedly renewed and increased the insurance policy before the April 2024 blaze, subsequently collecting $980,739 from his insurance company while denying involvement. Investigators found evidence of arson and surveillance footage, with a witness confirming Salazar paid them. Salazar also has an alleged history of arson and offering money for false testimony.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed an international network of spammers profiting from AI-generated images of Holocaust victims on Facebook, causing distress to survivors and their families. These "AI slop" images, often fabricating historical details and narratives, attract high engagement, allowing creators to game Meta's content monetization program. Organizations like the Auschwitz Memorial criticize Meta for permitting users to turn the atrocity into an "emotional game," warning that the influx of fake images undermines efforts to raise Holocaust awareness. The network, primarily based in Pakistan, uses AI chatbots to generate continuous fake history content, often impersonating official entities to build audiences.</p>
