          <p>Labour MPs are publicly and privately angered by the appointment of Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US, followed by his dismissal due to links with Jeffrey Epstein. Despite prior knowledge of the friendship, No 10 claimed new information emerged, leading to his sacking. Critics like Charlotte Nichols questioned the initial appointment, while others, including Clive Lewis, expressed concern over Sir Keir Starmer's leadership and a "dangerous atmosphere" within the party, fearing the rise of Reform UK. The prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, faces blame for the handling of the situation.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is buying 80 shares of Boeing at approximately $217, increasing its total holdings to 240 shares. This move aims to build up their newest position at a price more than 5% below their initial basis, following the strategy of reducing the overall weighted average cost. The purchase comes after Boeing shares fell due to CEO Kelly Ortberg's comments about delays in 777x certification. The Trust views this as a short-term dip, believing the company's long-term cash flow trajectory and improved balance sheet remain intact (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a France and Saudi-backed resolution supporting a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, explicitly without Hamas involvement. The "New York Declaration" calls for Hamas to free all hostages, end its rule in Gaza, and hand over weapons to the Palestinian Authority. This move precedes a September 22 summit where French President Emmanuel Macron plans to formally recognize Palestine, increasing pressure on Israel. The article highlights this significant diplomatic step, which also condemns Hamas's October 7 attacks and seeks collective action to end the Gaza war.</p>

          <p>Brian Gavidia, a U.S. citizen, is suing the Trump administration, alleging "blatant racial profiling" by federal immigration agents in Los Angeles. Gavidia recounts being accosted and physically restrained by agents despite asserting his citizenship, an experience that has left him fearful and with his business closed. The lawsuit, supported by the ACLU, challenges operations that target individuals based on race, language, or job. This article notes the Supreme Court's recent decision to lift restrictions on such stops, a move that immigration advocates warn effectively legalizes racial profiling and has reignited fear in communities.</p>

          <p>China's DF-5C nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has reportedly achieved significant advancements in its capabilities, enabling it to reach targets globally with improved readiness. Military experts suggest that upgrades, such as membrane-protected rocket nozzles, indicate a leap in fuel storage technology.
