          <p>A new poll indicates that Republicans overwhelmingly support the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, while a majority of the overall public disapproves. Bipartisan concerns exist regarding the potential for a wider war with Iran, but opinions diverge on the effectiveness of the strikes in preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. A significant majority believes President Trump needs congressional authorization for military action against Iran, including a third of Republicans. The poll also reveals that most Americans think Iran will likely attempt attacks against the U.S. or its interests instead of negotiating. (not investment advice)</p>

The prosecution presented over 30 witnesses, including former employees and escorts, detailing alleged drug-fueled sexual encounters. Combs' defense moved for acquittal, arguing the government failed to prove the charges, and chose not to call any witnesses. Closing arguments are scheduled for Thursday, with deliberations potentially beginning the following Monday.

Some House Freedom Caucus members are threatening to vote against the bill if the Senate's version is not amended.

The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following an Israeli offensive.

          <p>An early intelligence assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that the U.S. air campaign against Iranian nuclear sites only set back Iran's nuclear enrichment program by "a few months," contradicting President Trump's claim that it was "obliterated." The assessment suggests limited damage to critical infrastructure, particularly at the Fordo facility. Independent experts analyzing satellite imagery support these findings, stating that Iran's nuclear enterprise is far from destroyed.

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the Trump administration's postponement of a classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict, calling it "outrageous" and "evasive." Schumer stated that senators deserve transparency regarding the recent strike, the conflict's scope, and the administration's strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The postponement came as an early intelligence assessment suggested the attack did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries emphasized the need for a congressional briefing in light of the assessment. (not investment advice)</p>
