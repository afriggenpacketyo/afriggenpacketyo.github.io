          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a 90-second radar and communication outage, prompting renewed concerns about the airport's aging infrastructure. This incident, similar to a previous outage, occurred despite Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's recent announcement of a modernization plan. Controllers were unable to communicate with aircraft during the outage, highlighting the urgent need for technological upgrades. Federal officials are working to address the technical issues and plan to install new fiber optic cables to prevent future disruptions, with a goal to fully upgrade the system by summer. The incident underscores the challenges faced by one of the nation's busiest airports and the importance of investing in air traffic control infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Digital advertising market results for the past quarter showed strength for tech giants like Meta and Alphabet, but executives are expressing caution about the rest of the year due to President Trump's trade war.

Meta CFO Susan Li noted reduced spending from "Asia-based e-commerce exporters" due to trade policy changes.

          <p>President Trump indicated openness to reducing tariffs on China as negotiators from both countries prepare for high-stakes trade talks in Switzerland. Trump suggested an 80% tariff "seems right," a significant decrease from the current 145% imposed on Chinese imports, although this level would still heavily restrict trade. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that any reduction would require concessions from China, emphasizing that the President will not unilaterally lower tariffs. Economists have warned that Trump’s tariffs are increasing the chances of a recession in the United States, with the International Monetary Fund downgrading its outlook for both the U.S. and global output.</p>

Sessions III stated that her continued detention could chill the speech of millions of noncitizens, citing a lack of evidence that Ozturk posed a threat to American foreign policy interests. Ozturk's lawyers argued that she was detained in unconstitutional retaliation for protected speech, and video footage of her detention went viral, sparking public outrage. The Department of Homeland Security had previously concluded that Ozturk supported Hamas, a claim disputed by her legal team and supporters.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio is no longer sufficient for long-term retirement planning due to increasing lifespans. Edelman suggests that investors should allocate 70% to 80% of their portfolios to equities to ensure they do not outlive their savings. He emphasizes that advancements in health and science will lead to humans routinely living to 100 and beyond, requiring more aggressive investment strategies. This perspective challenges conventional wisdom, advocating for a shift towards greater equity exposure to address the financial implications of increased longevity.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi can remain free from immigration custody while he challenges his detention, denying the Trump administration's request to re-detain him. The court found that the government was unlikely to succeed in its arguments against the lower court's jurisdiction and authority to order Mahdawi's release. Mahdawi's legal team argues he was detained for his role in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia, violating the First Amendment, while the Trump administration accuses him of antisemitic statements and threatening rhetoric. Mahdawi has criticized Columbia University for agreeing to policy changes sought by the Trump administration, accusing the school of inciting violence.</p>

          <p>Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, held a mezuza affixing ceremony at his office, drawing praise from some Jewish leaders but criticism from Jewish environmental activists. These activists highlight a disconnect between Zeldin's religious principles and his role in weakening environmental regulations. They argue that his actions contradict the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, the obligation to repair the world, as he oversees the reduction of staffing and the repeal of regulations protecting air, water, and climate. Zeldin defended his actions, stating that his decisions are based on law, obligations, and science, not religious interpretations.</p>

          <p>The new acting head of FEMA, David Richardson, issued a stern warning to staff, stating that he would "run right over" anyone attempting to undermine President Trump's agenda. This followed the firing of the previous acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton, who publicly disagreed with the administration's plan to eliminate FEMA. Richardson emphasized his commitment to reducing FEMA's scope and transferring responsibilities to the states. He also directed staff to provide internal memos assessing FEMA's preparedness and identifying gaps in its capabilities, promising a town hall to address employee questions after they review the memos.</p>

          <p>South Africa has criticized the United States following reports that Washington may accept white Afrikaners as refugees, describing the move as "politically motivated." The South African foreign ministry stated that allegations of discrimination against the country's white minority are unfounded. The US state department says they are interviewing individuals interested in resettling in the US, and prioritizing "Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination", but would not confirm when the resettlement would begin. The Trump administration has also accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, something Pretoria has repeatedly denied.</p>

          <p>President Trump fired all three Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) via email, raising concerns about the agency's future. This action follows warnings from consumer protection groups and lawmakers about Trump's potential dismantling of the CPSC. One of the fired commissioners, Richard Trumka Jr., stated he would challenge the decision in court. The firings occurred after the commissioners refused to comply with demands from members of DOGE, Trump's informal Department of Government Efficiency, to slash staff. Critics argue that these removals are illegal and undermine the agency's independence and mission to protect consumers.</p>

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to modernize the air traffic control system, but the latest outage intensifies pressure on officials and lawmakers to act swiftly.

          <p>A 2019 California law, A.B. 218, has led to a surge in child sexual assault lawsuits against public institutions, pushing some to the brink of financial collapse. The law lifted the age limit for filing claims, resulting in multimillion-dollar judgments and settlements for victims. Santa Monica, for example, has paid out nearly $230 million, lowering its bond rating and depleting city funds. While victims and their lawyers see the lawsuits as long-overdue compensation, communities face difficult choices in allocating scarce resources, prompting calls for a retooling of the law to ease the burden on taxpayer-funded entities.</p>
