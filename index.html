          <p>Spanish car-part supplier Gestamp is actively seeking acquisition opportunities in China's automotive sector, despite a trend of international firms reducing their presence due to intense competition and overcapacity. Executive Chairman Francisco Jose Riberas Mera emphasized Gestamp's commitment to investing and growing in China, focusing on technologies that prioritize safety and low weight for electric vehicles. This strategic move bucks the trend of foreign carmakers losing ground to local rivals amidst a brutal price war. Gestamp aims to strengthen relationships with Chinese car assemblers, positioning itself as a partner both in China and abroad.</p>

          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, has resulted in at least 25 deaths and 800 injuries. The blast caused widespread damage, blowing out windows and roofs of nearby buildings, and destroying cars. Initial reports suggest the explosion may have been linked to improperly stored solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles, though Iranian officials later cited a fire in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot as the likely cause. The incident has prompted the closure of schools and offices in the region, with investigations ongoing to determine the exact circumstances and prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. defeated Conor Benn after 12 rounds at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, in a boxing match filled with personal and historical significance. The fight marked a reconciliation between Eubank Jr. and his father, Chris Eubank Sr., after years of estrangement, with Eubank Jr. crediting his father's presence for giving him the edge. The rivalry between the two boxers was intensified by the history of their fathers' iconic duels in the 1990s and a failed drugs test that led to the cancellation of their scheduled 2022 bout. Benn took the defeat with humility, acknowledging the special relationship between a father and son.</p>

The author argues that Trump's actions, including attacks on democracy, global economic disruption, and potential nuclear threats, make him uniquely dangerous. While various mechanisms such as impeachment, the courts, and media scrutiny could play a role, the author suggests that Trump's own failures, instability, and greed may ultimately lead to his demise. The piece concludes that Trump's biggest enemy is himself, and containing his actions requires democratic means and highlighting his self-destructive tendencies.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's job approval rating has hit a historic low for a president's first 100 days, with only 39% of Americans approving of his performance, according to a recent poll. The poll also reveals widespread economic discontent, with a majority fearing a recession and disapproving of Trump's handling of the economy and trade. Additionally, concerns are growing about Trump's efforts to expand presidential powers and disregard federal court orders. Despite these negative assessments, Trump maintains a lead over Democrats in Congress regarding trust in handling the nation's problems.</p>

          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential disruptions as President Trump threatens to impose higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals. The move could significantly impact the flow of drugs like insulin, heart treatments, and antibiotics, which have historically been exempt from tariffs.

The potential consequences for drug availability and pricing remain uncertain.</p>
