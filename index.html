          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the Department of Homeland Security warned of a "heightened threat environment," prompting increased security measures in major U.S. cities. While no credible threats have surfaced, concerns remain regarding potential Iranian reprisals, particularly murder-for-hire plots targeting political figures and dissidents. The U.S. Justice Department previously disclosed a disrupted plot to kill Donald Trump and other plots against figures like John Bolton and journalist Masih Alinejad. Authorities emphasize the need for vigilance and coordination between federal and local law enforcement to prevent potential acts of violence inspired by the Iranian regime.</p>

Iran's foreign minister initially denied any ceasefire agreement but stated that if Israel halted its strikes, Iran would cease its response.

          <p>China's control over the rare earth market is significantly influenced by supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's rare earth imports last year. Myanmar is a key source of heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium, essential for high-tech manufacturing. However, China's reliance on Myanmar poses supply chain risks due to the ongoing civil war and the Kachin Independence Army's control over key mining sites. Disruptions in Myanmar have led to price spikes in heavy rare earths, highlighting the vulnerability of China's supply chain.</p>

          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about the proposals to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments, aiming to save £5 billion a year by 2030. The amendment cites concerns about the number of people expected to be pushed into poverty, a lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The Labour MPs' opposition could potentially defeat the government's bill if all opposition parties unite against the plans.</p>

          <p>Florida is constructing a migrant detention center, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' on an air strip in the Everglades to temporarily hold migrants. The facility, costing approximately $450 million a year to run, is intended to support mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens. Officials claim the location acts as a natural deterrent for escapees due to the presence of alligators and pythons. However, critics, including the mayor of Miami-Dade County, argue that the center could have devastating environmental impacts on the Everglades ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the 2001 'Roadless Rule,' a policy that protected 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. The USDA argues that the rule is outdated and overly restrictive, hindering proper management of natural resources and increasing the risk of wildfires. Environmental groups denounce the decision, arguing that it will harm wildlife habitats, water sources, and recreational opportunities. The move aligns with Trump's efforts to expand mining, logging, and drilling on public lands, sparking concerns about the exploitation of natural resources.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own without advance warning. This decision lifts an injunction that had blocked the practice, which was implemented following an executive order signed by President Trump. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, stating that the ruling represents a gross abuse of the Court's equitable discretion. The decision raises concerns about due process and the potential for individuals to face torture or death in the countries to which they are deported.</p>

Combs has admitted to domestic violence but pleaded not guilty to the prosecution's charges, some of which rely on laws once aimed at mob bosses. The prosecution called over 30 witnesses, including ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura and rapper Kid Cudi, who testified about Combs's abusive behavior. Legal experts say the testimony has helped prosecutors present a compelling case, but a conviction remains far from assured.</p>

Coop Cooper, manager of the marina at Camp Richardson, south of D.L. Bliss State Park, spent 10 years in the Coast Guard and said it is crucial to come prepared before boating.</p>
