          <p>Nottingham Forest is actively seeking a new head coach following the recent departure of Nuno Espirito Santo. Ange Postecoglou, despite being sacked by Tottenham after a challenging Premier League season, has emerged as a strong candidate, having previously led Spurs to a historic Europa League victory. Initial contact has been made, and an agreement appears possible as the club prioritizes securing a replacement. This managerial change aims to inject new leadership and strategic direction into the team, hoping to improve future performance.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded with mixed results, influenced by a tech rally on Wall Street and significant regional political developments. Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed course to decline after hitting a record high, following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation, with investors anticipating potential new fiscal stimulus. South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slid. Indonesia's Jakarta Composite Index also experienced a notable loss after President Prabowo Subianto unexpectedly dismissed the finance minister, causing the Indonesian rupiah to weaken.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally oversaw the final ground test of a new high-thrust solid-fuel engine designed for intercontinental ballistic missiles, as reported by state media. This event, described as the ninth and last development test, signals that a full missile launch, potentially before the end of the year, is now imminent. Solid-fuel technology is particularly concerning for the West because it enables missiles to be fueled in advance, making them faster to deploy and significantly harder to detect. This strategic advancement follows the recent unveiling of the Hwasong-20 ICBM and deepened cooperation with Moscow.</p>

          <p>France is facing intensified political instability after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's centrist minority government lost a confidence vote over budget plans. This marks the fifth prime minister in less than two years for President Emmanuel Macron, who now faces limited options, including appointing another centrist or calling snap elections, both fraught with challenges. The budget deficit, at 5.8% of GDP, remains a critical issue, with Fitch Ratings expected to update France's credit rating soon.

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, voiced "real worry" that the UK might require an International Monetary Fund bailout similar to 1976, urging the government to prioritize economic growth and welfare spending cuts. She offered to collaborate with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, emphasizing the need to escape a "doom loop" of rising taxes and precarious public finances. While some economists support her concerns about the UK's bond prices and lack of growth, others dismiss the IMF bailout prospect as hyperbole, reflecting a divided economic outlook.

          <p>European stocks saw slight gains, buoyed by an 8% surge in Anglo American shares after the company announced a "merger of equals" with Canada's Teck Resources. The new entity, Anglo Teck, will be headquartered in Canada and aims to become a global leader in copper production. This deal, which will see Anglo American shareholders own 62.4% of the combined company, is expected to provide significant benefits for Canada, strengthening its position in critical minerals. Investors also monitored ongoing political turmoil in France, though the merger was the primary driver. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Multinational companies (MNCs) are significantly increasing investments in China's high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals, with continued optimism for consumption-related industries, according to HSBC co-CEO David Liao Yi-chien. This shift reflects MNCs positioning China as a global hub for innovation, consumption, and growth. A recent HSBC survey indicated China as the top target market for companies expanding global trade capabilities, with approximately 40% planning to increase manufacturing there. China's vast market, comprehensive industrial facilities, and dynamic innovation ecosystem continue to attract international capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation, Japan's next leader will face the challenge of navigating complex relations with China, with analysts expecting continued strategic competition between the two nations. Ishiba cited the conclusion of US tariff negotiations as a reason for his departure, which saw Japanese car import tariffs cut. While China's foreign ministry refrained from commenting on Japan's internal affairs, the change in leadership is anticipated to maintain Tokyo's cautious approach towards Beijing, emphasizing the delicate geopolitical balance in the region.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the populist right, from Washington to Westminster, seeks to "pull the train of history backwards" by rewriting national narratives and eroding democratic foundations. It cites the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" museum exhibits highlighting minority experiences, and Reform UK's call for a "patriotic" history curriculum that downplays imperialism. This historical revisionism, the article contends, provides ideological justification for policies that dismantle civil rights, women's rights, and worker protections, ultimately aiming to "repeal the 20th century" and its democratic expansions.</p>
