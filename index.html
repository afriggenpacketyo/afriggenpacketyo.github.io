          <p>Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez has completed a transfer from Liverpool to the Saudi Pro League team Al-Hilal for a reported fee of €53 million. Nunez, who joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial £64 million, scored 40 goals in 143 appearances but saw limited starting opportunities in the recent title-winning season. Liverpool expressed gratitude for his contributions and wished him well for the future. His departure could potentially create space for Liverpool to pursue other transfer targets, such as Newcastle's Alexander Isak.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, from funding Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican redistricting plan. Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the PAC, alleging it engaged in bribery by covering travel and lodging for the absent legislators. O'Rourke has responded with a countersuit, accusing Paxton of attempting to suppress dissent and dismantle a major voter registration organization. The legal battle highlights the intense political fight over redistricting in Texas.</p>

The nations described the plan as a "dangerous and unacceptable escalation" and a flagrant violation of international law. The proposal, approved by Israel's Security Cabinet, has faced widespread international criticism, with even Israel's own army chief reportedly warning against it.

Both teams are preparing for the upcoming Women's Rugby League World Cup scheduled to be held in Australia in 2026.</p>

          <p>A wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, has burned nearly 5,400 acres near Los Angeles, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. The blaze, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, spread rapidly since igniting on Thursday. A Kern County firefighter sustained serious injuries when his truck rolled over a ridge while battling the flames. While favorable weather overnight allowed crews to achieve 28% containment, officials are urging residents to remain vigilant as high temperatures are forecast to continue, exacerbating the risk across the fire-prone region.</p>

          <p>The depiction of Kashmir in India's Hindi-language film industry, Bollywood, has dramatically shifted over the decades, reflecting the region's changing political landscape. Initially portrayed as a scenic, romantic paradise in films from the 1950s and 60s, the narrative changed following the rise of anti-India militancy in the late 1980s. Kashmir began to be depicted as a conflict-ridden battleground, a theme that has become more pronounced in recent years. Contemporary films often align with government narratives, sparking debate over one-sided portrayals that some critics argue deepen sectarian divides.</p>

She accuses Salmond, who died last year, of being willing to destroy the Scottish National Party (SNP) rather than see it succeed without him. Sturgeon writes that Salmond's reaction to sexual misconduct allegations, and his expectation that she would intervene in the investigation, made the end of their political partnership inevitable.

The protest is one of several similar actions that took place across England, highlighting growing tensions around immigration issues.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon has killed six Lebanese soldiers. The soldiers were inspecting the depot near the Israeli border as part of an effort to dismantle its contents, in line with a US-brokered ceasefire agreement with Israel. The blast occurred in the Tyre district while troops were removing munitions and unexploded ordnance left over from the recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the deadly explosion, which Lebanese leaders have described as a painful incident.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is facing a severe environmental crisis due to a combination of plastic pollution, overfishing, and the impacts of climate change. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report their nets catching more plastic than fish, while industrial trawlers deplete fish stocks, including juvenile populations. Sewage and coastal reclamation further damage marine habitats. While countries like Egypt and Algeria are launching national plans to protect coastlines and monitor fishing, local fishermen and activists remain skeptical about the effectiveness of international commitments, urging for more direct involvement and resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article traces the origins of modern, extreme partisan gerrymandering to the 2010 "Redmap" project by Republican strategists. The plan focused on winning state legislative races to control the redistricting process after the 2010 census, using new technology to create durable advantages. This strategy successfully locked in GOP majorities in Congress and statehouses for a decade, even when Democrats won more votes. The article notes how subsequent court battles and citizen-led reform efforts were ultimately stymied by a 2019 Supreme Court decision that removed federal courts from adjudicating such cases.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff with a posthumous Soviet-era award for the son of a senior CIA official. The award, the Order of Lenin, was intended for Michael Gloss, 21, the son of CIA deputy director Juliane Gallina, who was killed last year while fighting with Russian forces in Ukraine. Gloss, who reportedly suffered from mental health issues, was never a CIA employee. The unusual gesture occurred as plans were confirmed for a summit between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has detailed a point-based system to distribute settlement funds to survivors of clergy sexual abuse as part of its bankruptcy case. Court documents show different types of abuse are assigned varying point values, with sexual assault receiving the highest score. However, the monetary value of each point will not be known until all claims are assessed. The proposed settlement, worth up to $235 million, requires approval from two-thirds of the voting survivors, but a significant number are being urged by their attorneys to reject the plan.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James, ordering her to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump.

James's office condemned the subpoena as a "weaponization of the justice system" and an act of political retribution by the Trump administration. This move escalates the conflict between the federal government and the New York state official who has been a prominent legal adversary of the president.</p>

          <p>Official documents reveal that radioactive water leaked into a Scottish loch from the Coulport naval base, where the UK's Trident nuclear warheads are stored. The leaks, which included low levels of tritium, were caused by repeatedly bursting pipes that the navy had failed to properly maintain. Scotland's environmental watchdog, Sepa, attributed the incidents to "shortfalls in maintenance." While the Ministry of Defence and Sepa both stated the releases posed no significant risk to the public or environment, the information was only disclosed after a six-year freedom of information battle.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders are signaling a strategic shift towards more aggressive, hardball tactics in response to what they see as Republican anti-democratic maneuvers, particularly gerrymandering. Spurred by a Republican push to redraw congressional maps in Texas, Democratic governors in states like California and New York have threatened to retaliate with their own partisan redistricting. This "gloves are off" approach marks a departure from past calls to "go high," with prominent figures now arguing that Democrats must fight back forcefully to protect democracy, even if it means using similar controversial methods.</p>

          <p>A development partnership has completed a $104 million project to convert the abandoned St. John's College campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The historic 1869 building, which had been deteriorating for decades, now features 205 apartments, with 62 designated for affordable housing. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church and preserved many of the original architectural details, including exposed brick and arched windows, while adding modern amenities like a gym and underground parking.</p>

          <p>Several German cities have offered to take in and provide medical care for seriously ill or traumatized children from Gaza, but the federal government is reluctant to support the initiative. Government officials have cited security concerns and stated that the focus should remain on providing aid on the ground in the region. The hesitation from the conservative-led interior and foreign ministries is also seen as being fueled by fears of a new wave of migration, as relatives could follow through family reunification programs. This contrasts with other European nations like Italy and Spain, which have already evacuated children.</p>
