          <p>Former President Donald Trump has intervened in the ongoing border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, announcing that both nations agreed to pursue a ceasefire. The mediation comes as shelling continues despite the diplomatic efforts, which both countries have acknowledged. This intervention occurs just before significant US tariffs on goods from both nations are set to take effect, with Trump linking the resolution of the conflict to future trade negotiations.

          <p>The Chinese government has condemned a failed recall vote against Kuomintang lawmakers in Taiwan, labeling it an unpopular act of "political manipulation" by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). A spokesperson for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office accused the DPP of fostering political strife and attempting to suppress dissent. This statement reflects the heightened political and military pressure Beijing has exerted on Taiwan since the election of President William Lai Ching-te.</p>

          <p>President Trump has shifted his approach towards Russia, issuing an ultimatum to Vladimir Putin: negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine or face severe international sanctions on Russian oil sales. This pivot, which includes supporting a NATO arms agreement for Ukraine, has been met with mixed reactions, with some experts believing it could be effective over time while others question its immediate impact. The article explores this new tactical direction, contrasting it with Trump's campaign promises and noting the complexity of ending the ongoing war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese and American trade negotiators are set to meet in Stockholm, Sweden, for their third round of talks, a choice of venue that signals a shift in diplomatic approach. Unlike previous dialogues held in the involved countries, the selection of neutral European territories like Geneva, London, and now Stockholm suggests a move towards a more level playing field.

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed how a convicted fraudster, James Kenny, orchestrated an elaborate, nonexistent music festival called Monmouth Rising. The event promised a major lineup including Glastonbury headliners and claimed to be the world's first hydrogen-powered festival, drawing in employees, suppliers, and even gaining some local support. However, it was discovered that no deposits were paid for bands, no licenses were filed, and claimed investors had no knowledge of the project, leaving many unpaid and questioning the man's motives.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering reforms to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales to help protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints. Under the proposal, developers building new residential properties near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, potentially reducing conflicts that have led to the closure of many establishments. The changes are part of a broader effort to revitalize struggling town centers and reverse the steady decline of the pub industry.</p>
