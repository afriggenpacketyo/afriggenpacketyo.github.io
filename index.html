          <p>A long-standing succession battle within the Murdoch family has concluded with an agreement that places Lachlan Murdoch in control of the conservative media empire. The deal solidifies the future direction of properties like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Under the arrangement, Lachlan will manage a new trust, while his siblings will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts holding Fox or News Corp shares, instead receiving cash from the sale of their holdings. This resolution ends years of family tension that famously inspired the television show "Succession."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates that Americans' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to its lowest point since data collection began in 2013. The perceived probability of securing new employment after a job loss dropped significantly, while concerns about losing current jobs have increased. This sentiment aligns with recent jobs data showing weaker-than-expected growth and a slight rise in the unemployment rate. Experts describe the current environment as "low-fire, low-hire," with employers retaining staff but hesitating to create new positions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting federal immigration agents in Los Angeles to resume raids and make stops based on factors such as race, language, or type of work. The 6-3 decision allows these enforcement tactics to continue while the underlying legal challenge proceeds through the courts. The conservative majority argued the lower court's order was too restrictive, while the dissenting liberal justices warned the ruling risks constitutional freedoms. The White House praised the decision, while California officials strongly criticized it as dangerous and un-American.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has reportedly ceased providing a security detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris. This decision follows significant backlash from the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the city's police union. The union had criticized the use of an elite LAPD unit to protect Harris after her federally provided security was withdrawn by the Trump administration. The union argued that Los Angeles taxpayers should not be responsible for the costs associated with this security arrangement, labeling the situation as "ridiculousness."</p>

          <p>A virtual summit of the Brics nations, intended to present a united front against U.S. trade policies, concluded with a more cautious tone than anticipated. Key members, notably Brazil and India, appeared hesitant to take actions that could further escalate trade tensions with the Trump administration. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's absence, with a foreign minister attending instead, signaled a desire to maintain a careful balance with Washington. The meeting highlighted the bloc's internal divisions and reluctance to directly challenge the "America-first" trade agenda.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that lifted restrictions on their enforcement tactics, U.S. immigration officers have promptly resumed large-scale sweeps in Los Angeles. The head of the local border patrol confirmed operations were restarting, stating they were "going hard" in the city. The ruling allows agents to consider factors like ethnicity and language when conducting stops, which critics argue amounts to racial profiling. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent highlighted that people have been detained simply for their appearance and accents, a concern echoed by immigrant rights advocates.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has achieved a significant diplomatic victory, transforming his image from an isolated pariah to an influential global figure. His recent appearance at a military parade in Beijing alongside other world leaders marks a stark contrast to a decade ago when North Korea was largely excluded from such events. The author contends that through strategic engagement, including past negotiations with a U.S. president, Kim has successfully elevated North Korea's international standing. This represents a fundamental shift in the global perception of his regime and its role on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently filmed a coyote swimming across the Raccoon Strait, a deep waterway separating the island from mainland Marin County. This sighting provides a fascinating glimpse into how the island's coyote population, first established in 2017, likely arrived. Researchers believe the original breeding pair swam over a mile through strong currents to reach the island, where they have since established a new predator niche. The growing population, now estimated at 14 to 17 related individuals, is part of a broader expansion of coyotes across the Bay Area.</p>

The suit alleges that hundreds of engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data without adequate monitoring, potentially violating a 2020 FTC privacy settlement.

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood surged more than 15% after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index. The addition, which will be effective September 22, ends months of speculation and is a significant milestone for the company. Being added to the benchmark index typically acts as a major catalyst for a stock, as passive index funds are required to purchase its shares to track the S&P 500. The news marks a positive turn for the stock, which has now gained over 210% year-to-date after a difficult period following its 2021 IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous artist Banksy, depicting a judge beating a protester with a gavel, appeared on the historic Royal Courts of Justice building in London. Shortly after Banksy claimed the work on Instagram, authorities covered it and announced its removal. Because the courthouse is a legally protected historic site, officials are obliged to maintain its original character. Activist groups have interpreted the artwork as a commentary on the U.K. government's recent ban on the protest group Palestine Action, seeing it as a powerful depiction of the state's response to dissent.</p>

          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances where the monthly premium can be delayed or reduced. The most common method is to delay enrollment while still actively employed and covered by a creditable employer health plan. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs can help cover or eliminate the premium costs. It is crucial to understand, however, that forgoing Part B can make one ineligible for supplemental coverage like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs for healthcare.

          <p>Retired tennis superstar Serena Williams, through her venture capital firm Serena Ventures, has invested in the women's 3-on-3 basketball league, Unrivaled. The investment was part of a funding round that valued the two-year-old league at $340 million. Unrivaled was created to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option during their offseason and claims to offer the highest average salary in women's professional sports league history. Williams joins other prominent sports figures like Alex Morgan and Billie Jean King in backing the league, which is set to begin its second season in January 2026.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding where to deposit a large sum like $40,000, savers should consider the key differences between a Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account. A CD offers a fixed interest rate for a set term, protecting earnings from future rate cuts, but requires the money to remain untouched to avoid penalties. A high-yield savings account provides more flexibility with easy access to funds, but its variable interest rate will likely decline as the Federal Reserve cuts rates. The best choice depends on an individual's long-term earning goals versus their need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

Bonta stated that he believes the tactics are unconstitutional and violate the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. He expressed disappointment in the decision, particularly criticizing the use of the court's emergency docket, which he argued lacks transparency.

The left-leaning alliance is expected to secure a slim majority of seats in the parliament. The election campaign focused primarily on domestic issues such as the rising cost of living, wealth taxes, and the quality of public services.

The crash occurred early Monday in an industrial area northwest of Mexico City. Video of the incident appears to show the bus moving slowly across the tracks in heavy traffic when it was struck by the fast-moving train. The force of the impact ripped the bus apart and carried it down the tracks. Authorities have opened an investigation into the collision, which highlights a rising trend of accidents at grade-level crossings in the country.</p>

This strategy, once famously employed by Stoke City's Rory Delap, is seeing a resurgence in English football as a way to create scoring chances from the sidelines. Data shows a notable increase in the use and effectiveness of long throws in the Premier League. With limited preparation time for the tournament, experts suggest that focusing on set-piece tactics like throw-ins could be a smart and efficient way to improve the team's offensive threat.</p>

The confrontation saw Suárez place an opponent in a headlock and later spit on the Seattle Sounders' security director. The MLS suspension is separate from and less severe than the six-game ban issued by the Leagues Cup's own disciplinary committee. The ban will sideline Suárez for three crucial matches as his team pushes for a better playoff position, though he escaped punishment for other actions during the melee.</p>
