          <p>A federal judge in New York has blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens detained under the Alien Enemies Act, stating that the administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion, or predatory incursion as required by the 1798 law. This ruling marks the second time a federal judge has barred the administration from using the proclamation to remove certain Venezuelan migrants. Challenges to Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act have been filed nationwide, following a Supreme Court decision that allowed removals under the law but required due process. The judge in this article was appointed by President Bill Clinton.</p>

          <p>In an Oval Office meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rejected the idea of Canada joining the U.S. as the 51st state, stating Canada is "not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever." This exchange occurred after Trump romanticized the idea of Canada joining the U.S., suggesting it would be a "wonderful marriage." Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and building together, despite tensions on trade and borders. Trump, however, insisted "never say never" to the idea, despite Carney's firm stance.</p>

          <p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the largest international organization fighting hunger, is facing a projected 40% reduction in funding due to dwindling donations and cuts from the Trump administration. This reduction will result in job cuts of 25-30%, affecting operations worldwide. The U.S. State Department cited concerns about funds ending up in the hands of terrorist groups as the reason for cutting $680 million for Afghanistan and Yemen. Experts warn that these cuts will lead to increased deaths in humanitarian settings and have generational effects due to increased child malnutrition.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, has announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases. Tillis's decision could effectively doom Martin's chances of confirmation, as his opposition may prevent the nomination from being reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire soon.</p>

The couple claims the security guard asked for their IDs to verify their gender, and they were ultimately asked to leave the hotel.

          <p>Israel has approved a military plan for Gaza, dubbed Operation Gideon’s Chariots, aimed at destroying Hamas and maintaining a permanent Israeli presence, potentially forcing more of the population into a shrinking "humanitarian zone" while exploring options for their permanent displacement. Critics argue intensifying military operations would endanger hostages and that the plan aligns with calls from key ministers for occupying Gaza, expelling its population, and establishing Israeli settlements. The plan's announcement may be primarily political, designed to reshape international and domestic discussion amid growing public pressure around the hostages and scandals tied to the Netanyahu government. Meanwhile, the starvation of Gaza intensifies due to the longest, harshest, and most hermetic siege in Gaza’s recent history.</p>

The film showcases the damage of bottom trawling and how it releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing to the warming of the planet. Despite the dire situation, Sir David expresses optimism that the ocean can recover faster than imagined, highlighting the recovery of whale populations after the ban on commercial whaling.</p>

          <p>Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz stated that toy manufacturing is unlikely to return to America despite President Trump's tariffs against China. Kreiz explained that while design, development, product engineering, and brand management happen in America, manufacturing in other countries allows for affordable pricing. Mattel has been diversifying its global manufacturing for nearly a decade to reduce its dependence on China, and by the end of the year, less than 40% of Mattel's product will be sourced from China. Kreiz noted that in two years, no country will represent more than 25% of Mattel's sourcing.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have agreed to a trade deal after three years of talks, which aims to boost trade by an additional £25.5 billion a year by 2040. The agreement will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars, and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. UK consumers are likely to benefit from lower tariffs on goods coming from India, including clothing, footwear, and jewelry. Tariffs on gin and whisky will be halved to 75%, with further reductions in later years.</p>

          <p>Coterra Energy is cutting back on its oil drilling in response to sagging crude prices and spending more on natural gas production, leading to a stock sell-off. The company's decision to spend less on oil, influenced by a decline in crude prices and concerns about a global economic slowdown, is a sensible one. Some operational issues in Culberson County, Texas, where some wells were producing higher-than-normal water volumes, also contributed to the stock's decline. Coterra's free cash flow outlook for this year was cut by 22% to $2.1 billion, which could limit share repurchases.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport lost contact with aircraft heading to and from the airport, leading to massive flight delays and raising concerns about aging U.S. aviation infrastructure and staffing shortages. The controllers temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them. Staffing shortages followed the incident, and some of the controllers involved have taken time off to recover from the stress of multiple recent outages. The FAA said it is working to ensure the current telecommunications equipment is more reliable in the New York area.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested turning Alcatraz back into a federal prison, prompting disbelief from tourists visiting the island. The idea has been met with skepticism due to the deteriorated state of the prison, which closed in 1963. The exterior walls of the cellblocks are so weak that they are reinforced with netting to prevent chunks of concrete from crumbling onto tourists’ heads. The administration indicated that it was following through on the president’s announcement and said that it had ordered an immediate assessment of Alcatraz.</p>

          <p>Tesla sales in Germany and Britain fell to their lowest point in more than two years in April, indicating a broader trend of declining demand for the U.S. automaker in Europe. Experts suggest that the decline is due to a backlash against President Trump’s tariffs and anger at Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, for supporting far-right parties. Chinese-made electric vehicles are growing in popularity in Europe, and Germany’s Volkswagen has also seen a recovery. Tesla reported a profit drop of 71 percent in the first three months of the year.</p>
