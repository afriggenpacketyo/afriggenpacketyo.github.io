          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman now suggests that investment portfolios should allocate between 10% and 40% to cryptocurrencies, a significant increase from his previous 1% recommendation. He attributes this shift to the maturation of crypto into a mainstream asset class and the obsolescence of the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio model due to increased human longevity. Edelman argues that crypto's lack of correlation with traditional assets and its potential for high returns make it a crucial component for modern long-term investment strategies. The article also notes a record $2.1 billion in crypto hacks in the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has successfully brokered a peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, aiming to end a conflict that has lasted nearly three decades and caused millions of deaths.

The agreement also grants the United States access to the DRC's substantial mineral deposits, including gold, copper, and lithium.

Sources suggest Brentford is holding out for a higher upfront fee for the 25-year-old Cameroonian international, who scored 20 goals last season.

          <p>A recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts finds that approximately 56 million private-sector workers in the U.S. do not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401(k). This lack of access creates a significant barrier to building wealth for retirement, contributing to a widening gap between retirement 'haves' and 'have-nots.' Experts note that workers are 15 times more likely to save when they have access to automatic payroll deductions. The findings highlight a potential crisis as millions may have to rely solely on a strained Social Security system in their later years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The increasing capability of artificial intelligence to write computer code is causing a shift in the job market for entry-level tech positions, leading some to question the long-term stability of a computer science degree. Tech executives have noted that AI makes senior engineers more productive, reducing the need for junior coders, which contributes to an already high unemployment rate for young college graduates. This trend is prompting universities to adapt their curricula to focus on durable, human-centric skills rather than specific technologies. This article suggests this disruption reinforces the need for higher education to prove its value beyond pre-professional training.</p>

Justice Sonia Sotomayor read her dissent from the bench to protest a decision curbing lower courts' power to block presidential orders, warning that 'no right is safe.' Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson described the ruling as an 'existential threat to the rule of law.' These powerful dissents highlight a sharp ideological divide on the court and a fear among the liberal wing that executive power is being dangerously expanded.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has voted to more than double the state's annual film and television tax credit program, increasing the cap from $330 million to $750 million. This move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have been lobbying for support as productions are increasingly lured to other states with more generous incentives. The expansion aims to bring production back to California and revitalize the local industry, which has faced challenges from strikes and competition. A related bill seeks to broaden eligibility and increase the credit percentage to make the state more competitive.</p>

The Foreign Office still advises against all travel to Gaza and specific areas near the borders.

          <p>The new independent film 'Ponyboi' offers a rare cinematic exploration of an intersex character's journey, written by and starring intersex artist River Gallo. The film, which evolved from Gallo's USC thesis project, tells the story of a Latine sex worker in New Jersey seeking to escape a life of crime and reconcile with a difficult past. Gallo, a first-generation Salvadoran American, uses the film to explore themes of identity, masculinity, and freedom. The project aims to shed light on the intersex community, which Gallo notes is often invisible in cultural conversations and negatively impacted by anti-trans legislation.</p>

          <p>Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase were the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by its inclusion in the index, positive regulatory developments, and new product launches. The stock is on track for its best month since November, gaining over 40% in June alone. Analysts attribute the surge to diminishing concerns over fee compression and regulatory uncertainty, particularly after the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins. Some experts believe the stock has further room to grow, citing the company's strong revenue-sharing agreement with the newly public and soaring Circle Internet Group. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that the early July deadline for reinstating high tariffs on numerous countries is not set in stone, suggesting his administration could extend or shorten the timeline. His April executive order had paused the 'reciprocal tariffs' at a 10% rate for 90 days, with the original, much higher rates set to return on July 8 unless the order is formally revised. Despite the approaching deadline, the White House has only secured limited trade frameworks with China and the UK.

          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that curbs the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his executive orders. Speaking from the White House, Trump called the 6-3 ruling a 'monumental win,' although the court did not rule on the constitutionality of his order to end birthright citizenship. The decision is a significant victory for the administration, which has seen many of its policies halted by single judges. Democratic leaders strongly condemned the ruling, with Senator Chuck Schumer calling it a 'terrifying step toward authoritarianism' that weakens judicial checks on presidential power.</p>

The court ordered the school board to provide advance notice and allow students to be excused.

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2's use of an LCD screen instead of an OLED has led to a new controversy among gamers and tech analysts regarding its performance. Critics and testers have pointed out that the screen has a slower pixel response time compared to typical gaming displays, which can result in motion blur or 'ghosting' in fast-paced games. Furthermore, while the console is marketed with HDR capabilities, its screen's peak brightness falls short of the technical specifications for a true High Dynamic Range image. Despite these objective technical shortcomings, many users still find the display to be bright and enjoyable for gaming.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the use of 'universal injunctions,' a legal tool that allows a single federal judge to block a government policy nationwide.

This ruling is a victory for the administration, as it restricts a key method used by opponents to halt executive actions.
