          <p>Taiwan's crucial semiconductor sector is facing significant pressure following President Trump's threat to impose a 100% tariff on imported chips. The policy is designed to compel companies to establish manufacturing facilities within the United States to avoid the levy. This has sparked an urgent debate among Taiwanese tech firms about the high costs of either relocating operations or absorbing the tariffs to maintain access to the vital US market. While major investors like TSMC may be exempt due to their existing US commitments, the move creates profound uncertainty for the rest of Taiwan's export-dependent economy.</p>

          <p>India has initiated diplomatic contact with Syria's new interim government, sending its first official delegation to Damascus since the fall of the Assad regime. The meetings focused on understanding the new leadership's priorities and exploring cooperation in health, education, and future reconstruction efforts. Analysts suggest this pragmatic outreach is driven by India's strategic interests in regional stability, secure trade routes, and a desire to not be sidelined in post-war Syria. The move reflects India's non-aligned foreign policy approach as it navigates a shifting West Asian geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor has significantly lowered its annual operating profit forecast, citing the substantial impact of U.S. auto tariffs. The world's largest carmaker reported an 11% year-on-year drop in its June-quarter operating profit, attributing significant losses directly to the American import duties. In response, Toyota has revised its full-year operating income forecast down by 600 billion yen. This development highlights the broad financial strain that U.S. trade policies are placing on major global manufacturers, even those experiencing strong worldwide sales demand.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL Players Association has clarified that players are still permitted to use smelling salts on gamedays, resolving confusion that arose from a league-wide memo. The NFL's new policy only prohibits teams and their staff from distributing ammonia inhalants, but it does not ban players from possessing and using their own. The initial memo, which cited FDA warnings and the potential for masking concussion symptoms, prompted concern from players who use the substance for a pre-game boost. The union's clarification ensures that players can continue their personal gameday routines as long as they provide the smelling salts themselves.</p>

          <p>Shares in the semiconductor company Intel experienced a significant drop in premarket trading after President Donald Trump publicly called for the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. In a social media post, Trump labeled the CEO as "highly CONFLICTED" without providing specific details, causing the stock to fall by 5%. The demand follows recent scrutiny from a Republican Senator who raised concerns about Tan's past ties to Chinese companies and the potential implications for U.S. national security. The incident underscores the market's sensitivity to political pressure directed at major corporate leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

The move comes just a week after the city implemented a new legal framework for stablecoins, signaling a push into regulated digital assets. Ant Digital is positioning Jovay, a self-developed Layer 2 public blockchain, as a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. The platform is designed specifically for real-world asset tokenization in overseas markets and is slated for an official launch in September, when it will be capable of handling real-money transactions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that will pave the way for alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, private equity, and real estate, to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The order directs the Department of Labor to review existing guidance on such investments under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). This move is seen as a significant victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for access to the trillions of dollars held in American defined-contribution plans. These assets are traditionally considered riskier due to higher fees and less transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion for the fiscal year.

          <p>A new, broad set of U.S. tariffs targeting more than 90 countries has officially come into effect, marking a significant escalation in President Trump's global trade policy. The import duties, which vary by country, are intended to encourage manufacturing to return to the United States. While some major economies like the UK, Japan, and the EU negotiated lower rates, others face steep levies, such as a 40% rate for Laos and Myanmar and 39% for Switzerland. The move has been criticized for potentially disrupting the global economy, though Asian markets remained relatively stable, having anticipated the implementation after months of uncertainty.</p>

Policymakers are balancing persistent inflation, which rose to 3.6% in June, against a cooling labor market and a slight economic contraction in May.

The initiative, which asks billionaires to commit at least half of their wealth to charity, has struggled to recruit new members at its initial pace. According to a report from the Institute for Policy Studies, the number of American billionaires who have signed on has fallen from 14% to 12% of the total. While the pledge has helped normalize large-scale philanthropy, the rapid growth of billionaire wealth has made it difficult for signatories to give away their fortunes fast enough, raising questions about its effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's recent decision to cut its main interest rate to 4% has direct consequences for household finances across the UK. For homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, this will likely lead to lower monthly payments, though those on fixed-rate deals will see no immediate change. Conversely, savers will probably see the interest earned on their deposits decrease further. The central bank uses rate changes to manage inflation, with lower rates intended to encourage spending and stimulate the economy. However, with UK inflation at 3.6%, well above the 2% target, the move reflects a difficult balancing act.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Israel's actions in Gaza, including a near-total siege and severe restrictions on humanitarian aid, amount to the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon of war. From the conflict's outset, Israeli officials announced the blockage of food, water, and fuel, leading to widespread malnutrition and preventable diseases. Unlike famines caused by natural disasters, the situation in Gaza is described as entirely human-made, as Israel has the capacity to allow sufficient aid but has chosen not to. This method of warfare is a violation of international law and a clear form of collective punishment against the Gazan population.</p>

While the government has not ruled out a payout, a significant gap remains between the two sides' valuations, creating a stalemate that threatens the long-term sustainable future of the UK's only remaining blast furnaces.</p>

          <p>Senior Democrats are demanding answers about President Trump's plan to retrofit a luxury Boeing 747 jet gifted by Qatar to serve as a new Air Force One. The conversion is estimated to cost taxpayers $1 billion, and reports suggest the funds may be diverted from the Sentinel nuclear missile modernization program, which is already over budget and behind schedule. In a letter to the Air Force secretary, lawmakers including Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff questioned the cost and the potential impact of shifting funds from a critical national security program. They also raised concerns that the gift itself could violate the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural and historical roots of survivalism, tracing the movement from its origins in 1970s right-wing circles to its modern "prepper" incarnation. It examines how fiction, from *Robinson Crusoe* to *The Road*, has shaped the public imagination around catastrophe and distinguishes between the temporary survivor and the permanent survivalist who craves societal collapse. The author argues that survivalism often serves as a power fantasy for those feeling impotent in modern life, a way to renarrate the self as a hero. The piece contrasts this individualistic worldview with evidence that real-life disasters typically inspire community solidarity and mutual aid.</p>

          <p>Several prominent U.S. universities, including Columbia and Brown, have agreed to multi-million dollar settlements and policy changes to resolve antisemitism claims leveled by the Trump administration. In exchange for restoring frozen federal funds, the universities are adopting measures that critics warn undermine their academic independence and autonomy. The deals are part of a broader campaign by the administration to exert ideological control over higher education. Education advocates fear these settlements will embolden further coercive tactics, putting pressure on all institutions to capitulate to the government's demands and creating a chilling effect on campus discourse and research.</p>

          <p>A political movement among Israel's settler right to re-annex the Gaza Strip and establish new Jewish settlements is gaining significant traction within the Israeli government. Over a third of the lawmakers in Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition now support the cause, which aims to reverse the 2005 disengagement from the territory. Despite opposition from the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the public, the movement has been emboldened by its political leverage over Netanyahu's fragile coalition and supportive statements from U.S. President Trump. This has effectively moved the agenda from the political fringe to a potential government policy, escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner after a surprisingly weak jobs report has sparked alarm among economists and policy experts. The July report showed modest job growth and major downward revisions for previous months, contradicting the administration's narrative of a resilient economy. Trump called the data a "scam" and ordered the commissioner fired, vowing to install someone more "competent." Critics argue this move threatens the independence and credibility of U.S. economic data, which is vital for businesses, the Federal Reserve, and global markets. The action raises fears of political manipulation of key government statistics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and computer chips. However, he specified that the levy would not apply to companies that are building or have made firm commitments to build manufacturing facilities in the United States. The announcement is a major escalation of the administration's strategy to pressure businesses to onshore their production and supply chains. While details on the criteria for exemption are not yet clear, the move directly impacts the global tech industry and major chipmakers, many of whom have already pledged billions in U.S. investments.</p>

          <p>Britain's homelessness minister, Rushanara Ali, is facing accusations of hypocrisy after reportedly increasing the rent on a property she owns by £700 a month. The increase allegedly occurred shortly after the previous tenants' contract ended and they were given four months' notice to leave. A source close to the minister stated that the tenants were on a fixed-term contract and chose to leave while the house was for sale, and that all legal requirements were met. However, critics and opposition parties have called the action shocking, especially given her role in government and the ongoing debate over renters' rights and protections.</p>

The show, along with new board and mobile games simulating cross-strait conflict, reflects a growing willingness in Taiwan to publicly imagine and discuss a potential war. Inspired by the war in Ukraine, creators say they want to raise awareness about modern warfare tactics like political infiltration and information warfare. While some praise these works for breaking a taboo, others, particularly from the political opposition, criticize them for promoting a "sense of national doom" and increasing public anxiety.</p>

          <p>A fabricated story claiming that Russian special forces captured three senior British military officers in Ukraine has been debunked as disinformation. The narrative, which spread on social media and was amplified by some former UK politicians, used poorly generated AI images and featured names of officers who do not exist in British military records. Experts identify the story as a typical Russian disinformation campaign, designed to be seeded on fringe websites and laundered through various media channels. The primary goal of such propaganda is often to bolster domestic Russian morale by portraying the military as mighty and framing the West as covertly directing the war.</p>

          <p>The potential for the first meeting between a U.S. and Russian president in four years is being met with cautious analysis, with some experts suggesting it may be more for political theater than a genuine step toward a ceasefire. While a face-to-face summit between Trump and Putin could signal a breakthrough, it could also be a Kremlin tactic to diffuse U.S. pressure and avoid sanctions without offering real concessions. There has been no indication that Moscow is softening its position on the war in Ukraine. Furthermore, any condition requiring Putin to first meet with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy could be a non-starter, as the Kremlin has long viewed him as illegitimate.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 years after the crime, authorities have arrested and charged the former live-in boyfriend for the 1995 murder of D.C. police officer Denna Fredericka Campbell. The suspect, now named Amir Jalil Ali, was initially charged shortly after the killing, but prosecutors dropped the case. Campbell, 24, was found shot five times in her Maryland apartment, and Ali had claimed it was a burglary. Colleagues told investigators at the time that Campbell feared Ali and had ominously warned that if she went missing, "you'll know he killed me." The cold case was reopened, bringing a long-awaited development for the victim's family.</p>
