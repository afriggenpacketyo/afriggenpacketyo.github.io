          <h2>Singapore Inflation Remains Low Amidst Upcoming Elections</h2>

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index increasing by 0.9% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher food and private transport costs. This inflation reading arrives as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, where cost-of-living pressures are a significant concern for voters. The Monetary Authority of Singapore eased monetary policy for the second time in April, anticipating potential zero growth this year after a lower-than-expected first-quarter GDP expansion. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, reflecting declines in manufacturing and some service sectors.</p>

          <p>Leading newspapers highlight a proposed peace deal for Ukraine, where Donald Trump would reportedly allow Vladimir Putin to retain seized territory in exchange for halting the war. The agreement would recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea and freeze the current front line. The IMF has also weighed in on Trump's tariffs, projecting a "major negative shock" to the world economy and cutting growth forecasts for the US, UK, and globally. Meanwhile, the UK is hosting US and European negotiators for Ukraine peace talks, and front pages feature images of the Pope lying in state.</p>

          <p>More travelers are using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services to finance flights, hotels, and cruises, with companies like Klarna and Affirm reporting significant growth in travel-related transactions.

Despite this increase, demographers caution against drawing definitive conclusions due to ongoing economic uncertainty, housing costs, and childcare challenges faced by families. The report also noted a record-low number of teenage births and an increase in births among women aged 40-44.</p>

          <p>Increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., driven by the "America First Investment Policy," has raised concerns about the potential delisting of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. A White House memo calls for a review of U.S. investments in Chinese entities and renewed enforcement of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The House Select Committee on China is pressuring investment banks to withdraw from underwriting the Hong Kong IPO of a Chinese battery giant. Despite these pressures, worries over delisting could be exaggerated, and investors may choose to act cautiously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leading policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are jointly lobbying the Trump administration against imposing 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups, representing franchised dealers, suppliers, and major automakers, warn that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production and harm already distressed suppliers. They argue that the tariffs could lead to production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies throughout the industry. The letter is addressed to key Trump administration officials and underscores the industry's concerns about the potential economic impact of the tariffs.</p>

The Dodgers struggled to hold onto their leads, with their bullpen faltering in the later innings. Despite scoring a season-high in runs, the Dodgers' inability to capitalize with runners in scoring position contributed to their defeat.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments suggesting a potential easing of tariffs against China have been interpreted by analysts as a sign of anxiety, potentially giving Beijing an advantage in trade negotiations. Trump indicated that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced but not eliminated, following earlier claims of progress in trade talks. Experts suggest that these statements reveal the U.S.'s eagerness to reach a deal, while China remains less pressured. The situation could allow China to secure a more favorable agreement in the ongoing trade dispute.</p>

The plan is based on an "understanding" with major food companies to remove the dyes in response to consumer demand, but the enforcement mechanism remains unclear.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP projections for major Asian economies, including China and India, citing trade tensions and "high policy uncertainty." The IMF also cut its global growth forecast, attributing the downgrade to tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners. The forecast aligns with a broader trend of research firms and banks reducing growth expectations for Asian economies due to the intensifying U.S.-China trade war.
