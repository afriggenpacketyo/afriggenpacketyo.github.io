          <p>A new study published in Nature Communications reveals that multinational enterprises were responsible for approximately 25% of all corporate carbon emissions in China over a 20-year period. Researchers from institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that economic benefits were concentrated in eastern coastal regions, while central and western areas faced greater environmental burdens. The findings highlight the significant, yet often overlooked, role of foreign firms in China's carbon footprint and raise new questions about assessing carbon responsibility for international corporations operating within the country.</p>

          <p>A recent decision by the Trump administration to impose 39% tariffs on Swiss exports has sent shockwaves through Switzerland's economy, which heavily relies on the US as its primary export market. This move has shattered the country's long-standing sense of economic stability and political isolation, forcing a national identity crisis. The Swiss government, previously confident in its relationship with the US, is now scrambling for a response with limited leverage, prompting a reevaluation of its relationship with the European Union. The tariffs are seen as a significant psychological and economic blow to the nation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has expanded its agricultural trade with Cambodia by launching a direct air corridor for fresh fruit, marked by the arrival of a two-tonne shipment of Cambodian durians. This initiative, part of China's 'durian diplomacy,' allows for rapid four-hour transport using cold chain logistics, ensuring freshness for Chinese consumers. Durian is now the fifth Cambodian fruit approved for direct import into China, following bananas, mangoes, longans, and coconuts. The development signifies strengthening economic ties and improved customs efficiency between the two nations, although some industry insiders express caution about the fruit's market competitiveness.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 prominent cartel members to the United States to face justice. The group includes leaders from cartels like Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel, such as Abigael González Valencia of 'Los Cuinis.' This move is part of a broader effort by the US Justice Department to dismantle dangerous drug networks. The transfer follows a previous extradition of 29 figures and occurred after the US agreed not to seek the death penalty, highlighting ongoing security collaboration between the two countries amid trade negotiations.</p>

While Ukraine's President Zelenskyy is not expected to attend, he will meet virtually with Trump and European leaders beforehand, emphasizing that any agreements made without Ukrainian input would be unacceptable.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has deployed 800 National Guard troops and 500 federal agents to Washington D.C., and temporarily assumed control of the city's police force, citing concerns over violent crime. The move has been met with resistance from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who described it as an 'authoritarian push' and denied that crime is out of control. While crime data shows a significant drop in violent offenses, the deployment coincides with a manhunt for a homicide suspect near the White House, fueling the debate over federal intervention in the city's affairs.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants for UCLA, totaling a significant portion of the $584 million in funds that were abruptly frozen. The judge ruled the suspension violated a previous injunction against terminating science grants, dismissing the administration's argument that these were 'suspensions' not 'terminations.' The administration had frozen the funds citing alleged antisemitism and discrimination at the university, but the ruling provides UCLA with more leverage to resist demands for a $1 billion payment to restore all funding.</p>

Cancers like melanoma now have 10-year survival rates above 90%, but progress for others, such as pancreatic, lung, and esophageal cancer, has been minimal, with survival rates remaining below 20%. Researchers point to advances in early detection and treatment for the improvements but note that the cancers with the worst outcomes are often the hardest to detect and have fewer treatment options.

The review will scrutinize everything from public-facing text to curatorial processes, raising concerns about political influence over the world's largest museum and research complex. Eight major museums will be targeted in the initial phase.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Expand Police Use of Live Facial Recognition Vans</h2>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding the use of live facial recognition (LFR) technology by providing ten new surveillance vans to seven police forces across England. The technology, which scans faces in public and compares them against wanted lists, is intended to help locate suspects for serious crimes like homicides and sexual offenses. While the government touts its effectiveness, citing 580 arrests in London, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have condemned the move as an alarming expansion of the surveillance state without a proper legal framework in place.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillator use to the driving theory test starting in early 2026. The goal is to equip the 2.4 million people who take the test annually with life-saving knowledge, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of a cardiac arrest. Learning materials have already been updated to include information on how to perform chest compressions and use a public access defibrillator, which could significantly increase survival rates from as low as 10% to as high as 70%.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France used 'repressive violence' in Cameroon during the country's fight for independence in the 1950s. This admission came in a letter to Cameroonian President Paul Biya, following a historical report which found that French colonial forces were responsible for mass displacements and supported brutal militias. The report detailed how French repression, which cost tens of thousands of lives, continued even after Cameroon gained independence in 1960. This move is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial past in Africa.</p>

Cases are now being reported further north than previously common, including in Connecticut and New York, highlighting a growing public health concern.

          <p>U.S. stocks surged toward record highs following the release of better-than-expected inflation data for July. The report, which showed inflation holding steady at 2.7%, has increased traders' bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting. Lower rates would reduce borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, potentially stimulating the economy. This positive market reaction comes amid President Trump's persistent calls for rate cuts, though the Fed remains cautious due to potential impacts from tariffs on consumer prices.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's peach farmers are facing a 30% reduction in their harvest this year due to warmer winter temperatures disrupting the essential sleep cycles of their fruit trees. Stone fruit trees require a specific number of chilling hours below 45 degrees to regulate nutrient flow for a healthy crop. The lack of consistent cold has led to smaller yields and, in some cases, total crop failure for some growers, causing a rise in consumer prices. One family farm has found that its older groves, irrigated with traditional methods that sustain soil health, have better tolerated the climate shifts.</p>
