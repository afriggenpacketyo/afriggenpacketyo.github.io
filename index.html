          <p>Members of the USA Swimming team are contending with an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis during the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. The team's medical staff is actively treating affected athletes and implementing preventative measures to curb the spread of the illness. The stomach bug has forced some swimmers, including Olympians Torri Huske and Claire Weinstein, to withdraw from individual events to conserve energy for relays. Despite the health challenges, the team has shown resilience, securing silver and bronze medals in relay events and demonstrating their determination to compete at the highest level.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a trade agreement, averting a potential trade war ahead of an August 1st deadline. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump but higher than the EU's goal. As part of the agreement, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments into the U.S. While some European leaders expressed relief, others noted the new tariffs will still make transatlantic trade more challenging.

The author suggests that to fully realize this potential, the region must integrate these hardware advancements with innovative systems and partnerships that cater to environmentally conscious travelers. By leveraging its progress in smart infrastructure and climate innovation, the Greater Bay Area can create a connected, eco-friendly travel corridor that sets a new global standard.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at his Turnberry golf course to discuss pressing international issues. The agenda is expected to be dominated by the ongoing crisis in Gaza and the specifics of the transatlantic trade relationship. Starmer aims to press for further reductions in U.S. tariffs on UK goods, building on a previous deal. He must also navigate a delicate diplomatic path regarding the Middle East, balancing the U.S. stance with that of European allies, particularly after France's recent decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move President Trump dismissed.</p>

          <p>The recently announced trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union provides both President Trump and European Commission President von der Leyen with a political victory, yet key details remain ambiguous. The analysis suggests that while the EU avoided the threatened 30% tariffs, the new 15% rate is still significant, and the specifics of the promised $600 billion in EU investment are unclear. The agreement is presented as a landmark moment that averts a damaging trade war and rebalances a relationship the U.S. viewed as unfair. This deal also strengthens the U.S. negotiating position ahead of upcoming trade talks with China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite criticism from some prominent right-wing figures, many of Donald Trump's supporters in middle America seem unfazed by the controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Interviews conducted in states like Pennsylvania and South Carolina reveal a constituency that remains loyal, prioritizing issues like the economy and border security over the Epstein matter. Many expressed a belief that the president is being unfairly targeted and that the focus on the files is a distraction created by political opponents. This sentiment highlights a complex and varied response within Trump's voter base, challenging the notion of a monolithic political movement.</p>

          <p>In this sports analysis, the author contends that England cricket captain Ben Stokes must learn to manage his own physical limits, as it is clear no one else can tell him when to stop. Stokes, who appeared to be struggling with injuries during the recent Test against India, feels a deep responsibility to his team, but his long-term health is critical for England's future success, particularly in the upcoming Ashes series. The article highlights Stokes's world-class bowling ability and notes that without him, the team is significantly weakened. The author suggests that it is now up to Stokes himself to look at the bigger picture and prioritize his fitness.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has voiced "deep concern" over reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a man named James Kenny, a convicted fraudster, for orchestrating a make-believe music festival called Monmouth Rising. The event promised a star-studded lineup including The Killers and Pulp, and was billed as the world's first hydrogen-powered festival. However, the entire plan was based on lies, with no bands booked, no licenses secured, and no real investors. Kenny, operating from his mother's kitchen, deceived employees and suppliers, leaving some with unpaid bills and using what appear to be forged documents to feign financial backing.

Lehrer rose to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s with his darkly humorous and politically charged songs, such as "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" and "The Vatican Rag." Despite his musical success, he spent most of his life in academia, teaching mathematics at institutions like Harvard and MIT. In 2020, he famously placed all of his work into the public domain, relinquishing all copyrights and allowing anyone to use his songs for free, cementing his legacy of generosity and wit.</p>
