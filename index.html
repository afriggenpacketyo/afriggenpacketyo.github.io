          <p>The National League clinched the 95th MLB All-Star Game in a dramatic first-ever home run swing-off, a new tie-breaking format akin to a baseball shootout. Dodgers' third base coach Dino Ebel played a pivotal role, pitching to NL hitters who secured a 4-3 win in the swing-off, leading to a 7-6 overall victory. This innovative conclusion energized fans and players, with Kyle Schwarber earning MVP honors for his three home runs in the tie-breaker. The event highlighted a unique blend of strategy and individual performance in a high-stakes, novel format.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate rose to a higher-than-anticipated 3.6% in June, according to the Office for National Statistics. This figure surpassed economists' forecasts of 3.4% and followed a 3.4% rate in May. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like energy and food, also increased to 3.7% annually, up from 3.5% in the previous month. This report indicates persistent inflationary pressures within the UK economy, potentially influencing future monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>The long-standing dominance of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency is increasingly challenged by eroding global trust, fueled by geopolitical shifts and the rise of blocs like BRICS. Nations are pushing for de-dollarization, conducting bilateral trade in local currencies and repatriating gold reserves, signaling a potential transition to a multipolar monetary system. This article highlights concerns over Washington's financial weaponization and ballooning national debt, suggesting that the dollar's future hinges on the US's willingness to reform its financial order.

          <p>The UK retail and hospitality sectors are experiencing a significant downturn, marked by accelerating store closures and job losses, defying Napoleon's historical 'nation of shopkeepers' observation. Thousands of outlets, including well-known brands like Claire's, Hamleys, and New Look, are shutting down, with nearly 202,000 jobs expected to be lost this year. This crisis is attributed to a 'perfect storm' of factors, including increased employer National Insurance Contributions, rising minimum wages, and long-term issues like business rates favoring online retailers.

          <p>The murder trial of James Craig, a Colorado dentist, has begun, with prosecutors alleging he poisoned his wife, Angela Craig, with cyanide and eye drops. Craig denies the charges, while the prosecution claims he was motivated by an affair and life insurance payout, attempting to make her death appear as suicide. The victim suffered worsening symptoms before dying, with prosecutors asserting Craig administered a final fatal dose in the hospital. The defense questions witness credibility and suggests Angela may have taken her own life, highlighting the complex and tragic nature of the case.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, stating it includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian exports to the US and 'full access' for American firms into Indonesia.

This article highlights the political interference in the TVA's operations, a utility serving 10 million Americans, and revives long-standing speculation about its privatization, which could impact electricity rates and future infrastructure projects.</p>
