          <p>Standard Chartered reported first-quarter profits exceeding expectations, driven by strong growth in wealth management and global markets. The bank's profit before taxation reached $2.103 billion, surpassing the estimated $1.905 billion, with earnings per share up 19%. While the article mentions the increasing global economic and geopolitical complexity due to trade tariffs, it notes that the earnings do not fully capture the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which were put on hold. Standard Chartered is also undergoing a cost-saving initiative, aiming to save $1.5 billion over three years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced that it is considering U.S. overtures to begin trade negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade war. A spokesperson for the commerce ministry stated that senior U.S. officials have repeatedly reached out to initiate talks, but China insists that the U.S. must first remove all unilateral tariffs to demonstrate sincerity and build mutual trust. Analysts caution that reaching a comprehensive deal will be complex due to Trump's unpredictability and the differing strategic priorities of both sides. U.S. officials have suggested that easing tensions is possible, and that a larger trade deal could follow de-escalation.</p>

          <p>The Runcorn and Helsby by-election is undergoing a recount due to a narrow margin of just four votes separating Reform UK and Labour. Triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, this by-election serves as Prime Minister Keir Starmer's first major electoral test. Early results indicated Labour retained the North Tyneside and Doncaster mayoralties, but saw a significant drop in vote share as Reform came in close second in all three races. Reform hopes to make further gains in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest and council elections, targeting councils like Kent and Lincolnshire.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially closed a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, leading to increased prices for U.S. consumers shopping from online retailers like Shein and Temu. The de minimis exemption, which allowed packages worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. without duties or taxes, has been eliminated due to concerns about its use for smuggling illegal goods and harming American businesses. This action is expected to significantly raise costs for consumers, with Chinese retailers already increasing prices in anticipation of the change. The move also aligns with Trump's broader trade policies aimed at cracking down on goods from China.</p>

The military's traditional strong hold on public sentiment is becoming more complicated due to political turmoil and economic crises. Despite these challenges, Pakistanis are displaying resilience, with some using humor to cope with the situation, although this is seen as a distraction from the underlying issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially eliminated a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs. This move, affecting products up to $800, aims to help U.S. manufacturers struggling to compete with low-cost Chinese products, but has already led to higher prices for consumers. The decision also addresses concerns about the loophole's use for fentanyl trafficking and its impact on U.S. jobs in warehousing and logistics. The changes, applying to shipments from mainland China and Hong Kong, are expected to cause confusion and financial strain for consumers and small retailers.</p>

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene, which caused debris to cover many East Tennessee waterways. The data collected will help determine the impact of the debris on the sport fish population by comparing it to surveys from the past 30 years. Structures in the water, such as debris, provide fish with places to lay eggs, hunt, and feed, and the disruption in shoreline habitat may force fish to find a new place to congregate. Cleanup efforts on Douglas Lake are about 90% complete.</p>

          <p>The Senate approved an effort to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule designed to limit seven of the most hazardous air pollutants emitted by heavy industry. The 52-46 party-line vote marked the first time Congress has moved to weaken the Clean Air Act. The rule, finalized by the Biden administration in 2024, required all major sources of these pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount, a policy called "Once in, Always In." Republican lawmakers argued that the rule disincentivized companies from deploying new technology to reduce pollution, while environmental groups criticized the move.</p>
