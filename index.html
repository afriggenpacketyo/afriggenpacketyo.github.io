          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new executive order requiring a $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The policy, intended to curb perceived abuse of the program and encourage hiring American citizens, has drawn criticism for potentially hindering the ability of U.S. companies, particularly smaller businesses and startups, to attract top global talent. Proponents argue it forces companies to prioritize domestic workers, while opponents warn it could drive operations overseas and damage American competitiveness in key sectors like technology.

The event is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners and has been designated a high-security event. Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, will be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His death has intensified the national debate over political violence, with bipartisan condemnation mixed with partisan rhetoric about its causes.</p>

          <p>Major German cities are bracing for large-scale demonstrations this weekend, centered on two contentious issues. Anti-abortion groups, supported by some Catholic bishops, are holding "March for Life" rallies in Berlin and Cologne, which are expected to be met by significant counter-protests. Simultaneously, climate activists from "Fridays for Future" are organizing rallies in dozens of cities to protest the government's energy policies, particularly its recent decision to build new gas-fired power plants while scaling back the expansion of renewables.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting software from Collins Aerospace has caused significant disruptions at several major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin's Brandenburg. The attack affected electronic check-in and baggage drop systems, forcing airlines to resort to manual processing and leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. The service provider acknowledged the "cyber-related disruption" and is working to resolve the issue, while airports have deployed additional staff to manage the situation and advise passengers to check their flight status before traveling.</p>

        </div>

          <p>A book by neuroscientist Tom Bellamy, titled "Smitten," delves into the psychological state of "limerence," defined as an intense romantic infatuation characterized by extreme emotional highs and lows. The condition often involves intrusive thoughts and idealization of the other person, which can become distressing if the feelings are unreciprocated or the object of affection is unavailable. The article outlines Bellamy's research and offers practical strategies for breaking the cycle of obsession, such as limiting contact and reframing daydreams to regain emotional control.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is highlighting a deep schism in American public understanding, a gap actively widened by social media. Within minutes of the event, graphic videos spread online, but the context and motive became battlegrounds for competing political narratives. Influencers on both the right and left quickly framed the killer's potential motives to fit their worldviews, often ignoring nuances that emerged from official documents. This article analyzes how algorithmic incentives to be first and provocative are fragmenting shared reality around major news events.</p>

          <p>Cyberattacks on U.S. water treatment facilities are increasing in frequency and severity, with recent incidents linked to hackers from Iran, Russia, and China. These attacks pose a significant threat to critical infrastructure, which is often managed by small, under-resourced teams. In response, a new initiative called Project Franklin is pairing cybersecurity experts from the DEF CON hacker community with rural water operators to bolster their digital defenses. The program aims to improve security practices and raise awareness before more systems are brought online and become vulnerable.</p>

          <p>Female artists in Turkey are facing increasing legal scrutiny from the government, with the girl band Manifest being the latest target of an investigation for "indecent and immoral acts." This case is part of a broader pattern where female performers, writers, and musicians have been targeted for allegedly violating societal values, often following social media campaigns by pro-government figures. Observers argue this is a political strategy by the ruling AKP to silence dissent and enforce conservative religious norms, further eroding artistic freedom and women's rights in the country.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing a difficult diplomatic decision as allies like France, Canada, and the UK move towards recognizing Palestine as a state. The German government maintains that recognition should only be the final step of a peace process, a stance critics call unrealistic. This position is deeply rooted in Germany's historical commitment to Israel's security, which Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called a matter of "reason of state." The government is under growing pressure from domestic political parties and EU officials to take a stronger stance amid the escalating Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study has uncovered alarming security vulnerabilities and deceptive practices among several widely used VPN providers, potentially exposing millions of users to surveillance. The report highlights that many services, some with over 100 million downloads, have opaque ownership structures linked to China and share the same underlying infrastructure despite being marketed as separate products. Critical flaws, such as using weak protocols with hard-coded passwords, mean these VPNs provide a false sense of security and fail to protect user data as advertised, posing immense risks especially for users in authoritarian countries.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is emerging as a double-edged sword in the fight against workplace burnout. Companies are increasingly using AI tools to automate repetitive tasks and reduce employees' cognitive load, with some studies showing a decrease in emotional exhaustion. However, other research indicates that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout, as the efficiency gains often lead to increased workloads and the pressure to be constantly productive. Experts suggest that while AI can be a helpful assistant, its implementation requires careful management to prevent it from becoming another source of stress.</p>

          <h2>Rapid Weight Loss from Popular Injections Leads to Unwanted Loose Skin for Some Users</h2>

          <p>While weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro have helped many people shed significant pounds, some users are now facing an undesirable side effect: large amounts of loose skin. The rapid weight loss can prevent skin from retracting, affecting areas like the arms, thighs, and stomach, which in turn impacts self-confidence. Corrective surgery, known as body contouring, is often the only effective solution but is typically considered cosmetic and not covered by the NHS, leaving individuals to face substantial private medical costs.</p>

          <p>U.S. Northern Command is actively testing various counter-drone systems at Eglin Air Force Base to combat the rising threat of incursions over sensitive national security facilities. With an estimated 350 drone incursions over military installations in 2024, the Pentagon is collaborating with dozens of private companies to evaluate technologies ranging from acoustic detection to interceptor drones that capture threats with nets. The goal is to establish rapid response teams on both coasts and in Alaska to neutralize any drone threat within 24 hours.</p>
