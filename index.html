          <p>The U.S. government entered its second day of a shutdown, marked by a continued blame game between Republicans and Democrats over funding. Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats for their stance, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of refusing negotiations. The Trump administration, through OMB Director Russ Vought, threatened mass layoffs of federal workers and cuts to projects in Democratic states, citing an "unprecedented opportunity" to reduce waste. This stalemate highlights deep partisan divisions, with no immediate resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the creator of the FICO score, saw its shares surge over 20% after announcing a new pricing model allowing mortgage lenders to license credit scores directly. This change aims to eliminate mark-ups by credit bureaus, which previously held a near-monopoly on distribution. While Fair Isaac plans to offer both pricing models to credit bureaus, the news caused significant drops in the stocks of Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte praised the move as a creative solution benefiting American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared the ongoing government shutdown an "unprecedented opportunity" to slash federal agencies and cut Democratic priorities, blaming Democrats for the stalemate. This article highlights his administration's move to freeze $18 billion for New York City infrastructure and cancel $8 billion for climate projects in Democratic states. Trump plans to meet with OMB Director Russ Vought, a key author of Project 2025, to identify "political SCAM" agencies for temporary or permanent cuts. The White House press secretary stated that thousands of federal layoffs are likely, intensifying the partisan conflict.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has called on his X followers to cancel Netflix subscriptions, citing a "transgender woke agenda" linked to the animated show "Dead End: Paranormal Park." The controversy stems from conservative backlash against the show, which features a transgender character and was canceled in 2023. While the show's creator, Hamish Steele, acknowledged the "odd day," analysts believe Musk's boycott call is unlikely to significantly impact Netflix's substantial subscriber base or market capitalization. This article notes that similar boycotts, like the one against Bud Light, have varied in their destructive power.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of a deadly mass shooting at a Michigan church, a unique fundraiser has emerged, organized by a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to support the family of the accused shooter, Thomas Jacob Sanford. The article highlights that the fundraiser, which has raised over $285,000, aims to assist Sanford's widow and children, one of whom has serious medical challenges. Despite police identifying Sanford as an individual who "hated people of the Mormon faith," the church members' response emphasizes forgiveness and care.

          <p>Morocco is experiencing escalating protests led by an anonymous collective known as GenZ 212, demanding better healthcare and education services while denouncing misplaced political priorities. The demonstrations, which began small in Rabat and spread nationwide, have turned violent, resulting in hundreds of arrests, injuries, and two deaths. This article notes that protesters criticize significant public investment in football stadiums over underfunded schools and hospitals. The Gen Z age group, overrepresented in unemployment statistics, is driving these protests, prompting a conciliatory but cautious response from the government, with calls for the King's intervention.</p>

The administration justifies these actions as self-defense and part of a sustained conflict, accusing the boats of carrying members of a Venezuelan drug gang.

          <p>A new study in the journal Science reveals a dramatic acceleration in the financial costs of wildfires, with nearly half of the 200 most costly fires on record occurring in the last decade.

The research, drawing on insurance data, shows a "step change" in fire disasters since 2015, driven by extreme weather conditions. The surging price tags strain governments and financial systems, leading to rising insurance rates and demanding reforms in how communities manage and price fire risk.</p>
