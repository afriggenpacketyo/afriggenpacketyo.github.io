        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of military action against Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, with sources indicating he views disabling the site as a necessary measure given the risk of rapid weapons production. Although attack plans have been approved, Trump has not made a final decision, holding out for potential negotiations with Iran to abandon its nuclear program. The UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is actively engaged in diplomacy, seeking a resolution and presenting Iran with a take-it-or-leave-it offer, while other European nations are also involved in diplomatic efforts. Despite intelligence reports suggesting Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons, congressional committees have been told that no order to weaponize has been given. The president said he will make a decision within two weeks. Optimism score will be based on the outcome of the decision (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The ruling allows the continued deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they are assisting federal law enforcement. Newsom had sued the president over the federalization of the California Guard. The court sided with Trump, stating he likely lawfully exercised his authority to federalize the Guard under Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents. The court rejected the argument that Trump needed Newsom's permission to call up the Guard. The optimism score here reflects the ongoing tension between state and federal powers and the potential for escalation. </p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has upheld President Trump's authority to maintain control over California's National Guard, despite a lawsuit from Governor Gavin Newsom challenging the legality of the troop deployment. The court extended a pause on a previous ruling that deemed Trump's federalization of the Guard unlawful. The decision stems from protests and unrest in Los Angeles related to immigration raids. The Justice Department argued that the president's determination of an emergency warranting National Guard use is not subject to judicial or gubernatorial review. The court's decision has sparked debate regarding the balance of power between federal and state governments in response to civil unrest. </p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's efforts to attract investment may be undermined by political motives, as seen in the Nippon Steel Corp.'s buyout of United States Steel Corp. The U.S. administration's earlier blocking of the deal suggests that corporate executives can no longer base decisions regarding their U.S. operations solely on business criteria. This wrangling could lead global companies to reconsider investments and acquisitions in the U.S. market, potentially reducing their exposure. Nippon Steel finalized the acquisition after agreeing to invest $11 billion by 2028 and accepting a golden share for the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a whip due to disagreements over the government's plans to cut disability benefits. She stated that while she understands the need to address the increasing welfare bill, she believes that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. A government spokesman said that the reforms will ensure those who can work should, that those who want to work are properly supported, and that those with the most severe disabilities and health conditions are protected. The government published its bill, which tightens the criteria people have to meet in order to get personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit.

          <p>Germany, France, and the UK are actively pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. An explosion occurred outside the Norwegian ambassador's residence in Tel Aviv. The incident involved a grenade thrown into the yard, but no injuries were reported.
