          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday his potential travel to the Middle East by the end of the week, possibly Sunday, as ongoing negotiations for a Gaza peace agreement continue. Speaking from the White House, Trump expressed strong optimism about the progress, noting that discussions are proceeding "very well" with both US and Middle Eastern representatives involved. His comprehensive 20-point peace plan, unveiled in late September, outlines provisions such as granting amnesty to Hamas terrorists who disarm and establishing Gaza as a "deradicalized terror-free zone." This framework has reportedly led to Hamas agreeing to release all Israeli hostages, signaling a significant and hopeful movement towards a potential resolution in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>After more than six decades, authorities in Albany, New York, have successfully identified Joseph Nowakowski as the individual responsible for the 1964 murder of 50-year-old Catherine Blackburn. DNA evidence, meticulously preserved from the crime scene and matched through a collaborative effort involving the Criminal Investigation Resource Center at Russell Sage College, linked Nowakowski, who died in 1998, to the horrific incident. Blackburn was discovered by her niece, having been sexually assaulted, stabbed, and bludgeoned to death in her home. Nowakowski had a history of criminal activity, including an attack on an elderly woman in 1973. This long-awaited identification provides crucial closure and a measure of justice for Blackburn's family.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the final inmate from a group of ten who escaped the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, was successfully apprehended in southwest Atlanta on Wednesday after a brief standoff. His capture concludes a multi-agency manhunt that began following the May 16 jailbreak, which exposed significant security flaws in the facility. Law enforcement located Groves in a home's crawl space after deploying gas canisters, taking him into custody without incident. New Orleans District Attorney Jason Rogers Williams highlighted the escape as a "serious breach of public safety" and a "historic failure of custodial security," promising to pursue full legal accountability for Groves' past violent crimes and his evasion of justice.</p>

          <p>AST SpaceMobile announced a definitive commercial agreement with Verizon on Wednesday, aiming to provide cellular service directly from space to Verizon users beginning next year. This expanded partnership seeks to deliver direct-to-device broadband coverage, extending Verizon's 850 MHz low-band spectrum into areas of the continental United States that currently lack robust connectivity. Following the announcement, AST SpaceMobile shares surged over 8%, adding to a year where the volatile space stock had already seen significant gains. The company has demonstrated its space network capabilities through recent tests, positioning itself as a leader in creating the first global cellular network operating directly from space for standard mobile devices.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, delivered a confident and well-received speech at the party's annual conference, unveiling a policy blitz designed to reinvigorate the party's public image and capture political attention. The most significant announcement was her plan to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases in England and Northern Ireland, a tax she described as detrimental to housing market fluidity and social mobility. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to portray the Conservatives as prudent managers of public finances, differentiating them from political rivals. Badenoch hopes these comprehensive new policies will provide activists with compelling arguments and secure her position amidst challenging poll numbers.</p>

The firm's previous meme-focused ETF, launched in late 2021, closed two years later after the Nasdaq Composite experienced a significant decline, serving as a cautionary tale. While Roundhill CEO Dave Mazza frames meme stocks as a "revolution," some market analysts, like Krisnky, interpret the relaunch as a sign of "some exuberance" or market froth potentially reaching its peak. This raises questions about the timing and whether the trade, and broader market, might already be losing momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The IRS announced on Wednesday that it is furloughing approximately 34,000 employees, representing nearly half of its total workforce, as the federal government shutdown extends into its eighth day.

Furloughed workers have been assured they will receive back pay once the shutdown ends, though an earlier internal draft memo had raised questions about the administration's obligation to provide it.

Growing up amidst gang violence in East LA and Boyle Heights during the 1990s, the band members credit their passion for music with providing a positive alternative.

This attack unfolded during intensifying indigenous-led protests against Noboa's austerity measures, specifically the removal of fuel subsidies, which have sparked widespread unrest.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned on Wednesday that ongoing air traffic control shortages could exacerbate flight delays, amplifying concerns about the government shutdown's impact on U.S. aviation. While disruptions eased slightly on Wednesday, approximately 10,000 flights were delayed earlier in the week, partly due to staffing issues that necessitated slowing or halting arrivals at several airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy observed a "slight uptick" in sick calls among controllers, who, despite being designated "essential," are working extended shifts without pay during the shutdown. This predicament mirrors a previous month-long shutdown in 2018 that significantly snarled air travel in major hubs.</p>

          <p>This article examines the cost-effectiveness of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) versus a credit card for borrowing in October 2025, in an environment of declining interest rates. It highlights that with an average credit card interest rate of 22.25% and a median HELOC rate of 7.89%, a HELOC is substantially cheaper, approximately 182% less expensive. While both options feature variable interest rates that will respond to future Federal Reserve cuts, the HELOC's significantly lower initial rate ensures it will become more affordable. Furthermore, HELOCs provide potential tax benefits if used for qualifying home repair projects, positioning them as a superior borrowing product for homeowners seeking sizable funding.

          <p>Christopher Lambie, a former Royal Marine, is suing the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for noise-induced hearing loss, alleging that he and other unit members deliberately cheated hearing tests with the help of military medics to secure deployment. Lambie, one of approximately 10,000 former personnel taking legal action, claims there was an institutional emphasis on ensuring Marines passed necessary tests for deployment, leading to manipulated results. While the MoD accepts a duty of care and "primary causation" in his case, it disputes the extent of his hearing loss and the claimed £400,000 in damages. This High Court trial highlights serious questions about military health protocols and accountability.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Officials Divided on Pace of Future Interest Rate Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting indicate a strong inclination among officials to lower interest rates due to a weakening labor market, although they were divided on the precise number of cuts for 2025. A narrow majority favored two additional quarter-point reductions by year-end, following the initial cut approved in September. Discussions also addressed the impact of President Trump's tariffs, with a general belief they would not cause major lasting inflation after an initial price push. However, the ongoing government shutdown presents a significant challenge by limiting access to crucial economic data, which could complicate future monetary policy decisions.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated Wednesday that his family's immigration to the U.S. would have been unattainable under the Trump administration's new H-1B visa policy, which mandates a $100,000 fee for each visa. Huang, who immigrated from Taiwan at nine years old, emphasized that his family could not have afforded such a cost, asserting that immigration is "the foundation of the American dream." While some tech executives, including Netflix's Reed Hastings and OpenAI's Sam Altman, have expressed support for the changes as a way to streamline high-value jobs, Huang confirmed Nvidia would cover the fees for its 1,400 H-1B employees, while hoping for policy "enhancements" to preserve opportunities.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla weakened to a tropical storm off Mexico's Pacific coast on Wednesday, falling below the threshold for a Category 1 hurricane. The Miami-based National Hurricane Center reported that Priscilla was generating high surf conditions and gusty winds across Baja California Sur, where a tropical storm watch remains in effect from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. As of late Wednesday morning, the storm maintained maximum sustained winds of 70 mph and was tracking northwest at 7 mph. Forecasters anticipate Priscilla will continue to weaken over the next 48 hours while moving parallel to the coast, though large swells are still expected to cause life-threatening surf, rip currents, and coastal flooding.</p>

These entities are accused of facilitating the purchase and use of American components and technology found in weaponized drones, reportedly operated by Hamas and Houthi militants in Yemen. Ten companies were specifically designated for aiding the acquisition of drone parts, while an additional Chinese firm was blacklisted for its alleged involvement in an "illicit network" supplying drones and other weapons components to "front companies" associated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This measure, requiring export licenses likely to be denied, aims to protect American national security interests.</p>

          <p>The Covid inquiry heard that children suffered harm due to the "fundamentally flawed" decision to redeploy health visitors during the pandemic, according to Alison Morton, CEO of the Institute of Health Visiting. Many health visitors were redirected to other NHS roles in March 2020, resulting in some remaining staff being left with unmanageably large caseloads, sometimes exceeding 750 children. Morton testified that "We let families down," and that "some children paid the highest price," referencing research that linked Covid-era adaptions, such as virtual visits, to child deaths and serious incidents. The inquiry underscores a critical systemic failure in safeguarding vulnerable children during the national health crisis.</p>

          <p>Latino voters are emerging as a potentially decisive demographic in New Jersey's tightening gubernatorial race between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is backed by Donald Trump. Although Sherrill currently holds a lead, national Democrats are concerned, particularly given Trump's significant inroads with Latino communities in New Jersey during the 2024 presidential election. Turnout rates among Latino voters and registered Democrats notably declined from 2020 to 2024, contributing to these shifts in voting patterns. Sherrill's campaign is now strategically emphasizing "kitchen table" issues like inflation and cost of living, while simultaneously linking Ciattarelli to Trump, in an effort to win back these crucial voters.</p>

          <p>This article examines what constitutes a "good" Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rate in October 2025, in the wake of recent Federal Reserve rate cuts and anticipated further reductions. While the exceptionally high rates seen in previous years are no longer available, short-term CDs continue to offer competitive rates, such as 4.30% for 6-month terms and 4.20% for 1-year terms. Savers are advised to act promptly, as rates have likely peaked for this cycle and are expected to decline further. The article recommends exploring online banks, which typically provide higher CD rates compared to traditional brick-and-mortar institutions, to maximize savings. (not investment advice)</p>
