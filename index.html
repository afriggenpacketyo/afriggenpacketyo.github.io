          <p>Two Columbia University maintenance workers have settled a complaint with the school after alleging they were held hostage and assaulted by anti-Israel protesters inside Hamilton Hall in April 2024. The janitors, Lester Wilson and Mario Torres, claimed they were subjected to antisemitic slurs and physical violence when demonstrators occupied the building. While the settlement amount with the university is undisclosed, the two men are proceeding with a separate lawsuit against 40 of the individual protesters. The incident was part of a broader campus upheaval that led to a federal civil rights probe into the university.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell engaged in a public dispute over the cost of renovating the Fed's Washington headquarters. During a joint visit to the construction site, Trump claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately contested, stating it incorrectly included a building completed five years ago. Despite the disagreement and Trump's previous suggestions that the cost overruns could be a fireable offense, he stated firing Powell was not necessary. The president reiterated his desire for the Fed to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, becoming the first G7 nation to do so. The decision was framed as part of a commitment to a just and lasting peace, contingent on a ceasefire, hostage release, and the demilitarization of Hamas. The move was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who argued it "rewards terror." This announcement adds to the growing international pressure and diplomatic maneuvering surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, the professional wrestler known globally as Hulk Hogan, has died at the age of 71 from an apparent cardiac arrest at his Florida home. A towering figure in pop culture, Hogan was instrumental in pushing professional wrestling into the mainstream in the 1980s with his "Hulkamania" persona. He was a six-time WWE champion and a central figure in the industry for decades, later appearing in films, television, and endorsing political figures. WWE and President Trump were among the many who paid tribute to his massive cultural impact.</p>

          <p>Immigrants deported from the U.S. are encountering major challenges as they try to build new lives in countries they are often unfamiliar with, such as Mexico. Many, like Juan Carlos who lived in the U.S. for 19 years, are sent to border towns with limited resources after being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). While the Trump administration has increased removals, the numbers have not yet reached the targeted one million per year. Non-profit organizations are providing essential support, but the process is difficult for deportees who have lost their homes, jobs, and communities.</p>

The plan, which includes a shift towards larger regional hubs and virtual volunteering, has sparked concern among volunteers. They fear the changes will dismantle a 70-year-old support system, lead to an exodus of volunteers, and undermine the personal, community-based nature of their work.</p>

This article analyzes how Hogan, born Terry Bollea, pioneered a form of brand management and direct-to-fan engagement that has become a template for celebrity in the social media age. He masterfully transitioned between heroic and villainous personas, building a billion-dollar industry and surviving numerous scandals, including a sex tape and racist remarks.

Their firings come as the nation's immigration court backlog approaches four million cases.

          <p>Heavy rainfall caused dangerous flash flooding in the mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, leading to multiple water rescues and road closures on Thursday. The area has been highly vulnerable to flooding this summer due to burn scars from past wildfires that have stripped the surrounding hillsides of vegetation. This event comes less than three weeks after a massive flood in the same community killed three people and damaged hundreds of homes. Videos shared by residents showed a wall of muddy water destroying property as it coursed through the town.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democrats are already making strategic media appearances, signaling the unofficial start of the 2028 presidential primary. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are engaging with non-traditional and ideologically diverse outlets, a shift from typical Democratic campaign strategy. This new approach appears to be a course correction following the 2024 loss, with candidates adopting a more centrist tone and directly addressing controversial topics like gender identity. Analysts suggest this is an effort to reach new voters and avoid being perceived as too extreme by the general electorate.</p>

          <p>A record-breaking heatwave is gripping Finnish Lapland, with temperatures in the Arctic region hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks. The prolonged heat is disrupting life in Rovaniemi, the official hometown of Santa Claus, and affecting the region's famed reindeer, which are fleeing to roads to escape insects. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events to climate change, noting the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The unusual heat has puzzled tourists and worried locals about the future of Lapland's winters.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major tech companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence, but are in fact "underspending." He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and companies must invest heavily to secure a leading position. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures for its cloud and AI services, Cramer believes the spending is justified. He suggests that the company that develops the most accurate AI chatbot could achieve a near-monopoly, similar to Google's dominance in search. (not investment advice)</p>

The shift presents challenges, as natural colors can be more expensive and have a shorter shelf life than their synthetic counterparts.

This move is part of a broader strategy to streamline operations, which also includes laying off 15% of its workforce, as Intel aims to regain market share and make its costly foundry division profitable.
