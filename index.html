          <p>South Korea's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, removing him from office.  The unanimous decision followed Yoon's controversial declaration of martial law, which lasted only six hours before being overturned by the legislature.  A presidential election must now be held within 60 days, with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo serving as acting president. The impeachment centered on Yoon's violation of the law by deploying troops to parliament.</p>

          <p>The recent surge in Chinese stocks is threatened by President Trump's imposition of a 34% reciprocal tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing tariffs.  This casts a shadow over China's economic recovery and may lead to further fiscal stimulus measures.  The tariffs also impact Southeast Asian countries, preventing the diversion of Chinese goods to avoid the levies. This underscores the significant impact of US trade policy on global markets (not investment advice).</p>
