          <p>In an emotional interview with the BBC, Prince Harry conveyed his desire for reconciliation with the Royal Family, acknowledging that he doesn't know how much longer his father, King Charles, has. Harry expressed his frustration over the ongoing dispute regarding his security arrangements in the UK, which he believes is preventing him from fully reconnecting with his family and safely bringing his children to his homeland. He stated that he has been 'devastated' after losing a legal challenge over his security in the UK. Harry also mentioned that King Charles will not speak to him due to the security issues.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is considering plans for a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., potentially coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday and the Army's 250th anniversary. The parade could involve nearly 7,000 troops, tanks, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The timing of the event and the White House's involvement have raised concerns that Trump is using the Army's birthday as an excuse to stage a grand military parade, reminiscent of his previous attempt that was scrapped due to high costs. City officials have also voiced concerns about potential damage to roads from heavy vehicles.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration intends to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, escalating the ongoing feud with the Ivy League school. Trump has previously suggested taking such a step, claiming the school is abusing the designation. Harvard's president expressed doubt about the legality of revoking the status, stating it would severely impair the university's mission of education and research. This decision follows a series of actions targeting Harvard, including freezing $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts after the university rejected demands to discontinue its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is aiming to establish a company town called Starbase in Texas, raising concerns among local residents about access to Boca Chica Beach and potential environmental impacts. SpaceX has submitted a petition to the state of Texas to create a new municipality, which would function as its own city. Residents fear that SpaceX's ambitions, including frequent rocket launches and potential beach closures, will disrupt their everyday lives and limit their access to the sandy shoreline guaranteed by the state's Open Beaches Act. The company is seeking permits that would allow SpaceX to launch up to 25 times a year.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly cut at least $160 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government, according to Fox News. Some of the most outrageous examples include funding a former Taliban member, lavish parties at Caesars Palace using COVID-relief funds, and millions spent on 'Sesame Street' in Iraq. The department has also announced cuts to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) contracts, redirecting funds towards a meritocracy-based system. Senator Joni Ernst has collaborated with Musk to identify areas of government waste to cut.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive information held by the Social Security Administration. This request stems from an injunction issued by a federal district court judge in Maryland, who blocked DOGE's access due to concerns that it violated the Privacy Act. The judge emphasized that the issue is not about the work DOGE wants to do, but about how they want to do it, specifically regarding access to millions of Americans' confidential information.</p>

          <p>Recent election results across England reveal significant challenges for both the Labour and Conservative parties, with Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats making substantial gains. Labour's early decision to means-test the winter fuel allowance and tighten eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment has been criticized. The Conservatives are facing an existential crisis, with the Reform surge evident in opinion polling translating into real gains in local elections. The Liberal Democrats have made solid gains across what was once traditional Tory territory.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry expressed his desire for reconciliation with the Royal Family after losing a legal battle over his security protection in the UK. He noted that his father, King Charles, is no longer speaking to him because of the security dispute. The Duke of Sussex has told the BBC he "would love a reconciliation" with the Royal Family, in an emotional interview in which he said he was "devastated" at losing a legal challenge over his security in the UK. He added that he did not want to fight anymore and did "not know how much longer my father has".</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson warns that a "large number of foreign investors" are skittish about investing in America. Outside of the Trump administration's tariff policy, she finds foreign investors and policymakers are losing faith in the U.S. on broader fears about the potential weaponizing of capital markets to achieve its economic goals. That may put global investors' U.S. holdings at risk, according to Patterson. Even a small reduction in global participation could present a problem for U.S. markets, Patterson warns.

The professor emphasizes that scientific expertise does not automatically grant authority over political matters, and that universities should prioritize developing critical thinking skills in students.</p>
