        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has accused Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement, focusing on the escalating costs of the central bank's headquarters renovation. The Office of Management and Budget claims the project is now $700 million over budget, reaching $2.5 billion, and features ostentatious elements not approved by planning commissions. In his testimony, Powell denied the existence of these lavish features, such as VIP dining rooms and rooftop gardens. The administration alleges these deviations violate federal law and is calling for an immediate halt to construction pending a new approval process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Senate bill proposing severe sanctions against Russia and its energy trade partners is gaining significant momentum with broad bipartisan support. The legislation, which could impose tariffs up to 500% on countries buying Russian energy, had previously stalled but now appears to have President Trump's backing after a shift in his tone toward Vladimir Putin. Proponents, including Senators Graham and Blumenthal, believe the measures are necessary to cripple Russia's war machine, arguing that Putin has no genuine interest in peace. However, some senators like Rand Paul have voiced strong opposition, calling the bill an economically illiterate worldwide embargo.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Financial Relationship Between Annuities and Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 14:03:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities can serve as a crucial supplement to Social Security, providing a guaranteed income stream that helps cover retirement expenses where federal benefits fall short. This article explains that by creating a reliable income floor, an annuity can allow retirees to delay claiming Social Security, which increases their monthly benefit amount by approximately 8% for each year of deferral past full retirement age. Furthermore, a well-structured annuity can help manage the tax liability on Social Security benefits by controlling a retiree's overall taxable income. This strategy aims to provide greater financial security and peace of mind throughout retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Greater Manchester police officer testified that she was "absolutely terrified" after being punched in the face while attempting to arrest an assault suspect at Manchester Airport. The officer suffered a broken nose in the incident, which occurred when she and her colleagues approached two brothers following a report of a headbutting at a cafe. The situation quickly turned violent, with the officer describing a forceful blow that knocked her to the ground. The two men, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad, deny the assault charges, with one claiming he acted in self-defense, believing he was being attacked.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and France have agreed to a new pilot scheme to address illegal Channel crossings, which will involve returning some migrants to France within weeks. Under this "one in, one out" deal, the UK will accept an equivalent number of vetted asylum seekers who have not attempted illegal entry. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the plan aims to break the business model of people smugglers by showing that the dangerous journey is futile. The agreement has drawn criticism from conservatives, who argue it is insufficient, and from others who raise concerns about potential legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement its Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System during the upcoming All-Star Game, marking a significant step toward its potential regular-season use. Under the system, each team will receive two challenges that can be initiated by the pitcher, catcher, or batter to review a plate umpire's call. If a challenge is successful, the team retains it. This trial follows extensive testing in the minor leagues and spring training, where the system showed high accuracy and was generally well-received by players and fans. The experiment could lead to the system's full adoption for the 2026 season.</p>

          <p>Police in Belfast have announced they will not assist in dismantling a controversial bonfire built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations, despite significant safety concerns. The structure is located near an electricity substation vital to two major hospitals, and asbestos has been discovered at the site. Following a multi-agency meeting, the police concluded that the risk of letting the bonfire proceed was lower than the risk associated with attempting to remove it. The decision has been met with disappointment from some politicians who fear for public safety, while others have praised it as a common-sense approach to a tense cultural issue.</p>

Forssell said he was unaware of his son's online activities until being contacted by the security service and that his son is now remorseful and has cut ties with the groups. The incident has sparked accusations of double standards against the government, which collaborates with a radical anti-immigration party with historical ties to Nazi sympathizers.</p>

Root anchored the innings with crucial partnerships, first adding 109 with Ollie Pope and then an unbroken 79 with captain Ben Stokes.

It explains that the West African nation was founded in the 19th century by freed African-American slaves, which is why English is its official language and many of its institutions and cultural norms have a strong American influence. The capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and the country's flag closely resembles that of the U.S. This context clarifies why a Liberian leader speaking fluent, American-accented English is not surprising.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has certified a class action lawsuit and issued a preliminary injunction, effectively pausing President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The ruling, which the government can appeal, blocks the policy that would deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or are living in the country temporarily. The judge found the plaintiffs' arguments persuasive, stating that the deprivation of U.S. citizenship constitutes irreparable harm. This decision comes after the Supreme Court limited the scope of previous nationwide injunctions, pushing opponents to refile their challenges in lower courts.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the historical and cultural significance of the term "middlebrow," tracing its origins to early 20th-century literary debates. It highlights the views of Virginia Woolf, who famously championed the "highbrow" pursuit of ideas while disdaining the "lowbrow" and reserving her strongest contempt for the "middlebrow." Woolf defined middlebrows as intellectually dishonest consumers who chase fashion rather than art or life itself. The essay reflects on how the term has evolved over time, softening to describe anything perceived as commercially safe and pedestrian, from popular music to department stores.</p>

          <p>The mother of Dontae Melton is demanding answers after her son died in Baltimore police custody on June 24 following a mental health crisis. Just one day before the fatal encounter, a judge had denied the mother's emergency petition to get her son an evaluation. During the incident, Melton was placed in handcuffs and leg restraints while waiting for a medic that never arrived, reportedly due to a failure in the city's computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system. Police eventually transported him to the hospital, where he died hours later, leaving his family devastated and questioning a series of systemic failures.</p>

          <p>A high-ranking officer from Ukraine's domestic security service, the SBU, was shot and killed in a brazen daylight attack in Kyiv. CCTV footage shows the agent being approached and shot multiple times by an assailant in a car park before the attacker fled the scene. While the SBU has not officially named the victim, Ukrainian media have identified him as Colonel Ivan Voronych. The assassination occurs in the context of the SBU's active role in counter-intelligence and sabotage operations against Russia, though no immediate motive for the killing has been confirmed by officials.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in central Texas has reached at least 120, with 161 people still reported missing in the hardest-hit Kerr county. Recovery efforts are ongoing, with over 2,100 personnel on the ground, but the number of victims found has begun to plateau. The disaster has brought the federal emergency response into focus, as the Trump administration recently discussed overhauling FEMA to shift more responsibility to the state level. Questions are also being raised about the adequacy of local flood warning systems prior to the devastating event.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a stark warning that the country faces a "rising" and "unpredictable" threat from Iran, urging the government to adopt a more robust, long-term strategy. The report from the Intelligence and Security Committee highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 plots to murder or kidnap UK-based individuals since early 2022. It accuses Iran's intelligence services of being well-resourced and targeting dissidents, journalists, and Jewish and Israeli interests in the UK. The committee calls for a better-resourced response beyond simple crisis management.</p>

          <p>The original Hermès Birkin bag, created for the late singer and actor Jane Birkin in 1985, has become the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction, fetching €8.6 million (£7.4m) at Sotheby's in Paris. The iconic black leather bag was famously designed after Birkin complained to the head of Hermès on a flight that she couldn't find a practical yet stylish large bag. This prototype, which she owned for a decade, features unique marks and her initials. Its record-breaking sale to a private collector demonstrates the enduring power and legendary status of the Birkin bag in fashion history.</p>

          <p>The Catholic bishop of San Bernardino, California, has taken the rare step of formally excusing parishioners from their weekly obligation to attend Mass. The decision comes in response to the "real fear" gripping immigrant communities following immigration enforcement actions on two local parish properties. Bishop Alberto Rojas, himself an immigrant, stated that he wanted to lift the spiritual burden from those who are too afraid of being apprehended and possibly deported to venture into public settings. This pastoral act highlights the profound impact of federal immigration tactics on the daily lives and religious practices of the community.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, six Secret Service agents have been suspended without pay for their roles in the security failure. The suspensions range from 10 to 42 days.

Congressional investigations described the lapses as preventable, blaming poor leadership and coordination.

The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" who participated in the October 7 attack and said it was investigating the incident while regretting any harm to civilians.

These swarms of modified Iranian-supplied Shahed drones, some acting as decoys, are designed to overwhelm and deplete Ukraine's precious air defense resources. The attacks have become more frequent and intense, setting new records for the number of drones used and forcing hardened civilians back into bomb shelters. Experts warn that this war of resources poses a grave threat, as Russia's production capacity for these weapons continues to ramp up.</p>

The company's premise is that the microgravity environment of space allows for the creation of drug crystals that are difficult to produce on Earth. Varda has already completed three space launches and successfully created the drug Ritonavir in orbit on a previous mission. This new capital will allow the company to increase its flight cadence, expand its pharmaceutical lab, and work on more complex molecules, driving forward the concept of an orbital economy.</p>

          <p>A new, non-addictive painkiller called Journavx is offering hope as an alternative to opioids, but it remains out of reach for many due to high costs and restrictive access. The FDA has only approved the drug for short-term acute pain, such as after surgery, leaving chronic pain sufferers without an option for coverage. Even for approved uses, insurance coverage is limited, and the drug's high price presents a significant barrier compared to cheap, generic opioids.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's nomination of Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize is a cynical and absurd act of political theater. The author contends that Netanyahu is using extreme flattery to manipulate Trump, aiming to prolong the war in Gaza and maintain his own grip on power, thereby avoiding domestic political fallout and a personal corruption trial. The piece suggests the nomination is a distraction, exploiting Trump's desire for recognition while undermining any genuine efforts toward peace, especially as Israel's military campaign continues with U.S. support.</p>
