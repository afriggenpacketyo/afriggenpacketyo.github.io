          <h2>Wales to Ban Plastic Wet Wipes by 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 12:58:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wales will become the first UK nation to ban plastic wet wipes starting December 2026 to combat environmental harm. The ban, passed by the Senedd with no objections, aims to reduce plastic and microplastic pollution. There will be an exemption for medical-grade wipes and the ban does not extend to business-to-business supply. Research from Cardiff University highlighted that wet wipes pose a significant risk to the environment, with substantial quantities entering Welsh river systems annually, and the ban seeks to encourage a shift towards reusable and non-plastic alternatives, allowing manufacturers time to adapt their business.</p>

          <p>An analyst close to the Iranian regime, Hamidreza Gholamzadeh, acknowledged that Iran's regional power has been weakened following attacks by Israel. However, Gholamzadeh insisted that Iranians remain united and that social cohesion is strong, despite surveys indicating widespread opposition to the ruling clerics. He warned the U.S. against active involvement in the conflict, suggesting American military bases in the region would become easy targets. Gholamzadeh's statements come amid ongoing conflict and threats of retaliation, with Iran preparing missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign.</p>

          <p>President Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the U.S. for another 90 days. The video-sharing app has faced scrutiny over national security concerns due to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Trump, who previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order delaying enforcement of the law requiring the app to be sold or banned. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support in keeping the app online for its 170 million U.S. users.</p>

Hegseth has continued to espouse anti-DEI talking points, claiming without evidence that these policies put military service members in harm’s way. The Pentagon said that the Department of Defense “may engage in the following activities, subject to applicable department guidance: holiday celebrations that build camaraderie and esprit de corps; outreach events where doing so directly supports DoD’s mission; and recognition of historical events and notable figures where such recognition informs strategic thinking, reinforces our unity, and promotes meritocracy and accountability”.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, questions arise about the UK's potential role in the conflict. While Britain has called for de-escalation, it is unlikely Israel will be listening due to soured relations and a determination to act militarily. The UK maintains a diplomatic role and possesses military assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean. Diego Garcia, a joint UK-US base, could serve as a staging ground for USAF B2 Spirit bombers, while RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus could be involved in monitoring and intercepting Iranian drones. The Royal Navy's presence in the Gulf could also play a vital role in keeping the Strait of Hormuz free from sea mines.</p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. for the third time, pushing the deadline back to mid-September. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year, requiring ByteDance to sever ties with TikTok or face a ban from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The president said this extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure. TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension.</p>

          <p>Fox Corp. has acquired Caliente TV, a Mexican sports broadcasting platform, to expand its sports programming and attract more customers to its streaming services. Carlos Martinez has been appointed as executive vice president and managing director of Latin America for Fox Corp. The acquisition reflects Fox's commitment to building a leading sports streaming business in Mexico with a broad portfolio of original sports content. Fox plans to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, Fox One, later this year, adding to its existing Tubi service.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount, providing £150 off energy bills to twice as many households this winter. Anyone on means-tested benefits will automatically receive the discount, regardless of property size. While debt charities and energy groups welcome the move, some argue that it excludes those on non-means tested benefits. The expansion will be funded by energy companies, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers, though the government aims to offset this with savings from reduced company expenditure.</p>

          <p>The TSA has warned travelers about the cybersecurity risks of plugging phones into airport USB ports, as hackers can install malware and steal information. To avoid this risk, travelers are advised to bring their own portable battery packs. Several portable chargers are available, including the Sabani and Charmcast chargers with built-in cables, the Miady two-pack, and the thin INIU charger. For frequent travelers, the Anker power bank is a durable option, while solar charger power banks stay charged in the sun.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Living in the Age of Offense, where polarization and online broadcasting make it easier to insult and denigrate, it's more beneficial to learn to be less offended than to try to stop others from being offensive. Research shows that people are often offended by threats to dominance or competence, triggering ancient brain responses. Strategies to become less offended include laughing it off, using the prefrontal cortex to manage emotions, and tuning out offense-making machines like controversial media. Being less offended can lead to a happier life and better relationships.</p>

This practice stems from animistic and Brahmanistic beliefs, where spirits are appeased with food and drink.

The prevalence of Fanta in Thai spirit houses is also linked to the brand's long-standing presence in the Thai region.
