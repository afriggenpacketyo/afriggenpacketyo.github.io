          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 21:24:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant wildfire in New Jersey's Ocean County has triggered mandatory evacuations for residents in Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township, impacting approximately 3,000 people. The blaze, which began at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has consumed around 3,200 acres and is only 5% contained as of Tuesday evening. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service is battling the fire with the aid of helicopters and planes dropping water, while Jersey Central Power & Light reported widespread power outages due to the de-energization of lines near the Oyster Creek substation. There have been no reported injuries, but officials are urging the public to avoid flying drones in the fire zone, as it hinders the efforts of the firefighters.</p>

          <p>With the Real ID deadline less than a month away, a significant number of states are not yet fully compliant, potentially leading to disruptions at airport security checkpoints. A recent data analysis reveals that at least 17 states have compliance rates below 50%, with New Jersey having the lowest at 17%. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipates potential delays and plans to implement secondary identity verification processes for travelers with non-compliant IDs, advising them to arrive at the airport at least three hours before departure. The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to enhance the security of state-issued identification, and travelers without compliant IDs may face additional screening or be denied entry through security checkpoints.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo is pausing its elephant program and relocating its two remaining elephants, Billy and Tina, to the Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma, following decades of criticism from animal rights advocates. The zoo cited the need for elephants to live in larger social groups and the infeasibility of replacing recently deceased herd members as reasons for the relocation. Animal welfare organizations have long criticized the L.A. Zoo's elephant enclosure for its small size and the health challenges faced by its inhabitants, with some advocating for the elephants to be moved to a sanctuary instead. The Tulsa Zoo offers a larger, more suitable habitat for the elephants, but some animal advocates express disappointment that the animals will not be moved to a sanctuary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While China grapples with declining birth rates, Guangdong province, particularly the Chaoshan region, stands out for bucking the trend due to its strong cultural emphasis on lineage and larger families. In Chaoshan, ancestral halls are prevalent, and the tradition of having multiple children, especially sons, to carry on the family name remains deeply ingrained. Guangdong recorded 1.13 million births in 2024, making it the leading province for new births for the seventh consecutive year, with a birth rate of 8.89 per thousand people, which is among the highest in the country. This cultural adherence to traditional family values sets Guangdong apart from other regions in China facing demographic challenges.</p>

The 88-year-old pontiff died on Monday morning from a stroke and heart failure, shortly after returning from a five-week hospital stay battling double pneumonia. Despite appearing exhausted, Francis insisted on greeting the crowd from his popemobile and delivering a short Easter message, with his nurse's reassurance. The College of Cardinals has announced that Pope Francis' funeral will be held on Saturday at St. Peter's Basilica, with plans for a conclave to elect the next pope to begin within a few weeks.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, collaborating with the FDA and food companies. The initiative aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and eliminate six remaining dyes commonly used in cereals, snacks, and yogurts. The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives, and is requesting food companies to expedite the removal of Red No. 3, previously linked to cancer in rats. While some industry groups have expressed concerns about the proposed timeline, the Consumer Brands Association has indicated its members will work with the administration to address food dye priorities.</p>

          <p>China has formally requested Japan's cooperation in opposing U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, as trade tensions escalate between the world's two largest economies. The communication, delivered by Chinese Premier Li Qiang to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, likely called for a united front against protectionism, though Japan's response remains cautious given its close alliance with the United States. This comes as the IMF has sharply downgraded its outlook for global growth due to the tariffs, and Trump asserts that the tariffs on China will ultimately decrease substantially, anticipating a trade deal with President Xi Jinping.</p>

The FDA is encouraging the use of natural food dyes and aims for industry cooperation by the end of next year, prompting mixed reactions from industry groups and consumer advocates.

Despite the challenges, Musk maintains that demand for Tesla vehicles remains strong and that the company's long-term profitability depends on robotaxis and autonomous robots. Investors have expressed concerns about Musk's focus on government work and DOGE, urging him to prioritize Tesla's business, and Tesla's share prices rose in after-hours trading following Musk's announcement.</p>

The justices are considering whether a Maryland school board unconstitutionally burdens parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom by requiring children to participate in instruction that violates their religious beliefs. The court's conservative majority seemed receptive to the families' arguments, questioning the school board's refusal to allow opt-outs, given that it allows them for other areas of instruction.

The judge faces a potential sentence of 40 years to life in prison, and the state Commission on Judicial Performance will review his case for formal removal from the bench.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported disappointing first-quarter earnings, with automotive revenue dropping 20% and net income plummeting 71%. The company attributed the decline to production line updates and lower average selling prices, refraining from promising growth this year. CEO Elon Musk's involvement in President Donald Trump's administration and sweeping tariffs plans have raised concerns about increased costs for essential components. Despite the challenges, Tesla shares initially remained stable in extended trading, before rising after President Trump stated that he does not plan to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

          <p>Archaeologists are increasingly puzzled by a medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport, as new discoveries challenge initial understandings. The site, dating back to the 6th or 7th century, contains skeletons buried in unusual positions, with nearly all being women, displaying signs of both hard labor and unexpected wealth. Artefacts, including imported glass, suggest a community of significant status, while the discovery of a woman tossed in a ditch contrasts with the careful burials of others. Further analysis of the skeletons' teeth reveals a consistent diet lacking meat and fish, adding to the mysteries surrounding this unique community.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, has been found guilty of conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona. Prosecutors argued that Daybell schemed with her brother to kill Vallow for his life insurance and to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, using twisted religious beliefs as justification. Evidence presented included text messages indicating a pre-planned scheme and references to religious figures, leading the jury to reach a guilty verdict. Daybell, who represented herself in the trial, now faces another life sentence in addition to her existing sentence for the murders of her children.</p>

          <p>The Education Department will resume collecting payments for defaulted student loans, including wage garnishment, starting May 5, potentially impacting millions of borrowers. The department will begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, withholding payments such as tax refunds, federal salaries, and Social Security benefits. Over 5 million borrowers are currently in default, with millions more at risk, prompting the Education Department to send out emails urging borrowers to explore repayment options. This action follows the end of the COVID-19 pandemic payment pause, with the Biden administration's efforts to wipe out student loan debt having been rejected by the courts.</p>

          <p>The FDA has announced its intent to phase out several synthetic food dyes, including Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1, and Green 3, by the end of next year, signaling a victory for the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement. The decision follows concerns about the dyes' potential neurobehavioral effects, particularly in children, and pressure from states introducing similar bans. While food companies have expressed concerns about differing state laws, they may welcome the FDA's less restrictive approach, which involves an "understanding" rather than a formal ban. The success of this initiative will depend on the food industry's cooperation and the FDA's ability to address broader challenges in the American diet, such as excessive sugar and sodium.</p>
