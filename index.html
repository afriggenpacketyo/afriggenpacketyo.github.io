          <p>President Trump intensified pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "numbskull" for not lowering interest rates. Trump asserted that a 2% rate cut would save the U.S. $600 billion annually, criticizing Powell's reluctance. This attack follows similar remarks from other administration officials, who believe lower rates would benefit the economy. Markets remained largely unaffected by Trump's comments, with traders anticipating a potential rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is promoting a $5 million pathway for wealthy immigrants to obtain legal U.S. residency, dubbed the "Trump card." A new website, Trumpcard.gov, allows potential applicants to join a waitlist for the program, which Trump says will offer access to the U.S. for those willing to invest. The card is intended to replace the EB-5 visa and could raise $5 trillion if one million cards are sold.
