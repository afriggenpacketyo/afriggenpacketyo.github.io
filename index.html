          <p>At least 37 people have died in India's northern state of Himachal Pradesh due to devastating floods and landslides caused by continuous heavy monsoon rains. The mountainous region has experienced significant damage to infrastructure, with the Mandi district being the most severely affected and dozens more people reported missing. State officials have initiated large-scale relief and rehabilitation efforts, but the meteorological department has issued an alert for more rain to come. The disaster highlights the growing impact of climate change on the Himalayan region, with initial loss estimates already exceeding $46 million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) report that a small meteor, observed as a bright orange glow and a loud bang over the UK, likely scattered debris across the west Highlands of Scotland. The meteor, originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, was tracked descending to approximately 12 miles above the ground. Potential landing sites for the meteorite fragments are estimated to be in a vast, mountainous area between Loch Treig and Loch Etricht, near Ben Nevis. UKMON is appealing to the public for help in locating the pieces, though acknowledges the challenging terrain will make discovery difficult.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party Public Accounts Committee has criticized the UK Home Office for its failure to track whether foreign workers on skilled worker visas leave the country or remain illegally after their permits expire. The committee's report states that since the visa route was introduced in 2020, the Home Office has not analyzed exit check data, relying on outdated airline passenger records. This lack of oversight comes amid evidence of worker exploitation, including debt bondage and excessive hours, which the department has been slow to address. The findings raise significant questions about the management and enforcement of the UK's post-Brexit immigration system.</p>

          <p>One year after a landslide election victory, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is struggling with significant challenges, including a decline in public approval and a stagnant economy. Key promises to boost growth have not materialized, with high inflation and borrowing costs continuing to pressure households and businesses. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has faced criticism for policy U-turns, particularly on welfare, leaving her with limited fiscal options. With the potential for tax hikes in the upcoming Autumn Budget, the government also faces a rising political threat from the Reform UK party, which is gaining support amid public disaffection.</p>

Russia's foreign ministry stated the recognition would boost bilateral cooperation in areas like energy, transport, and security, and would help in fighting terrorism and drug trafficking. This comes despite widespread international condemnation of the Taliban's human rights record, particularly the severe restrictions imposed on women and girls.</p>

          <p>A drive-by shooting outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and at least fourteen others injured. The incident occurred late Wednesday night as a crowd was leaving an album release party for a local rapper. Police state that a dark vehicle drove past and occupants opened fire into the crowd in what appears to be a targeted attack. No arrests have been made, but authorities believe three shooters were involved and are investigating the possibility of gang-related motives. The venue has been temporarily shut down by the city as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>China's government has vowed to tackle the issues of oversupply and excessive, low-price competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a meeting with industry leaders, Minister Li Lecheng emphasized the need to govern the sector according to regulations and guide companies toward improving quality and phasing out outdated production capacity. The move follows a directive from President Xi Jinping to address "disorderly low-price competition" and reduce excess industrial capacity. The goal is to ensure the healthy and sustainable development of China's solar industry, which continues to be a dominant force in global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

She described an internal war against the Iranian people that has now become more difficult for democracy advocates. Mohammadi, who is currently on medical furlough from Evin Prison, also raised concerns about the harsh conditions and treatment of political prisoners transferred after the facility was struck by Israel.</p>

Newsom will tour eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, a move his advisors claim is focused on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms and highlighting how rural communities are being left behind. However, the visit to South Carolina, which will hold one of the first Democratic primaries in 2028, is being widely interpreted as groundwork for a future national run, following other high-profile overtures to voters in southern states.</p>

The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, reported that the human-cell-derived heart structure continued to beat unaided for 21 days. To achieve this, scientists reprogrammed human stem cells to improve their survival within the pig embryo before implanting them. This development follows a previous success by the same team in growing humanized kidneys in pigs, advancing the potential for creating human organs for transplantation.</p>

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are filing a legal brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit that aims to prevent the Trump administration from overhauling the U.S. Department of Education. Lawmakers argue that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish or dismantle a federal agency created by Congress. The legal action comes after the administration slashed the department's workforce and paused over $6 billion in congressionally approved education programs. The brief contends that these actions violate the separation of powers and threaten access to education for students across the country.</p>

The warnings advise the public to avoid swimming, surfing, or any activity involving getting wet at affected locations, including areas of Santa Monica Beach, Avalon Beach on Catalina Island, and Mothers Beach in Marina Del Rey. The high bacterial counts are attributed to street runoff. Public health officials warn that contact with the contaminated water can cause illness or skin infections, with children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals at higher risk.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the U.S. national park system to implement higher entrance fees for foreign visitors while keeping prices lower for American citizens. The order instructs the Interior Secretary to develop a strategy to increase fees for non-U.S. residents at all parks that currently charge for entry, framing the move as an "America first" policy to fund system improvements. The Interior Department estimates such a surcharge could generate over $90 million annually. The order also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in park lotteries and permitting systems, and it revokes an Obama-era memorandum promoting diversity and inclusion.</p>

At a virtual news conference, advocates stated that such deployments are inappropriate, placing troops in situations for which they are not trained and pitting them against American citizens.

According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the 56,000 people currently in ICE detention have no criminal record, a figure that has nearly doubled since May. This trend contradicts administration claims of focusing on "the worst of the worst," instead showing a broad crackdown on individuals whose only offense is their immigration status. The report highlights the human cost of the policy, citing cases like a pastor who was deported after living in the U.S. for 30 years.</p>
