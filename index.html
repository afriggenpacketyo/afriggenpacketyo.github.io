          <h2>House Passes Trump's Tax Bill Amidst Republican Divisions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, a significant victory for Republicans despite unified Democratic opposition and some Republican dissent. The bill includes making Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, eliminating taxes on tips, and increasing the SALT deduction cap for certain taxpayers. The bill's passage was marked by internal GOP wrangling and last-minute amendments to appease various factions within the party. Concerns persist about the bill's impact on the federal deficit and its potential to disproportionately benefit wealthier households, as well as potential impacts on clean energy incentives.

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's efforts to reset relations with the U.S. were undermined when President Trump focused on unsubstantiated claims of white genocide in South Africa during their Oval Office meeting. Trump presented video clips of anti-white chants and highlighted attacks on white South Africans, overshadowing Ramaphosa's attempts to discuss trade and investment. Despite the contentious meeting, Ramaphosa claimed progress on trade negotiations and secured Trump's tentative commitment to attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg. The New York Times article analyzes the difficulties South Africa faces in maintaining a strong relationship with the U.S. amid these tensions.</p>

          <p>A last-minute injunction by the High Court has temporarily halted the UK government from finalizing talks to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Two Chagossian women brought the case, seeking the right to return to the islands, particularly Diego Garcia, home to a UK-US military base. The proposed deal would allow the UK and US to continue using the base for 99 years, preventing Chagossians from returning. Representatives of the Chagossian community express anger and disappointment, feeling excluded from negotiations and concerned about their rights.</p>

The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, with clothing and equipment also seeing increases, but popular Air Force 1 trainers and children's products will be exempt.</p>

The team successfully tested an oblique detonation engine (ODE) chamber, simulating flight conditions at Mach 8 and an altitude of 30km. The experiment sustained stable detonation waves for over two seconds, potentially proving the concept's feasibility for military applications. The ODE concept promises propulsion without moving parts by coupling shock waves with combustion.</p>

          <p>Higher-than-expected government borrowing figures in the UK have increased the likelihood of Chancellor Rachel Reeves raising taxes in the autumn. Borrowing in April was £20.2bn, up £1bn from the previous year, marking the fourth-highest April figure since 1993. Experts suggest Reeves may struggle to meet her spending and borrowing rules, potentially leading to tax rises.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other experts argue that U.S. chip export controls on China have been a failure, causing more harm to American businesses than to China. The restrictions have incentivized China to become self-sufficient in chip production, accelerating domestic innovation. While the curbs aimed to limit China's military advancement and maintain U.S. leadership in AI, loopholes and existing stockpiles have complicated these aims. Nvidia's GPU market share in China has fallen significantly, leading to revenue losses.</p>

          <p>Educators are concerned that homeless students could be targeted by Trump administration cuts as the U.S. Education Department faces closure. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act provides legal protections and federal grants to ensure these students receive an education. Advocates fear the law's protections could be eliminated, leading to increased challenges for homeless students. The Trump administration has not clarified its plans for McKinney-Vento if the Education Department is closed.</p>
