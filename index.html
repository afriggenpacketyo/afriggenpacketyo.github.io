          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for "direct talks" with Ukraine, saying they should "start without delay, as early as 15 May". It comes hours after European leaders visited Ukraine and urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said Moscow would "have to think this through" - but warned that "trying to pressure us is quite useless". Putin suggested the talks should happen in Turkey's capital Istanbul. The Russian leader said he would speak to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday to discuss the details.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was welcomed back to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detainment by ICE in March. Ozturk, who co-authored an op-ed critical of Israel's war with Hamas, expressed gratitude for the support she received from her community and others. Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley attended the event, emphasizing the importance of due process and free speech. The article highlights that a federal judge ordered her release, citing a lack of evidence for her detainment besides the op-ed, and that the Trump administration had until May 14 to comply with the order to transfer Ozturk to Vermont.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration grew concerned that the conflict between India and Pakistan could spiral out of control after Vice President JD Vance suggested that the conflict between India and Pakistan was not America’s problem. Intense fighting broke out between India and Pakistan after 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, were killed in a terrorist attack on April 22 in Kashmir, a border region claimed by both nations. President Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a cease-fire. U.S. officials decided that Mr. Vance should call Prime Minister Narendra Modi directly, and Mr. Rubio talked with General Munir.</p>

          <p>David Thornley, a pedigree livestock farmer, is taking legal action against East Midlands Airport, claiming a leaking pipe polluted a brook running through his grazing land, leading to the loss of 25 valuable pedigree lambs. The airport pleaded guilty to charges of exceeding environmental permit limits by releasing water containing chemicals into the brook in 2022, but denies any direct link to the bacterial pollution affecting the lambs. Thornley reported a strong odor and brown substance in the brook, later confirmed by lab results to be bacteria unfit for livestock consumption. While the airport initially paid for alternative grazing land, they are now refusing to continue the arrangement, prompting Thornley to seek compensation.</p>

          <p>A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman suggested that three Democratic members of Congress might face assault charges after a confrontation outside an immigration detention facility in Newark during the arrest of the city’s mayor. The three lawmakers were inside the facility for a congressional oversight visit. Newark’s mayor, Ras J. Baraka, was arrested by the head of Homeland Security Investigations in a brief but volatile clash that involved a team of masked federal agents wearing military fatigues and the three lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have charged Willie Eugene Sims, 69, with her death. Ralston was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. The breakthrough came last year when a fingerprint from the crime scene matched Sims in the F.B.I.’s database after an upgrade to its search algorithm. Sims, who had a prior conviction for attempted murder and robbery, was identified through DNA evidence and an old sketch that resembled his booking photo from 1977.</p>

          <p>China's calculated export controls on rare earth elements, used for the manufacture of key commercial and military products and space technology, have stirred anxiety in the US defence industry. China is the world’s largest producer and consumer of rare earths, accounting for 90 per cent of the global supply, and dominates production capacity. China’s export restrictions on rare earth elements went into effect earlier in April in retaliation for Trump’s decision to hike “reciprocal tariffs” against most Chinese products to 54 per cent, which was later expanded to 125 per cent.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth midfielder Alex Scott suffered a fractured jaw after a "very violent" elbow from Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings during a Premier League match. Scott went down in the sixth minute after being hit by Mings' elbow, requiring treatment but continuing to play before being substituted at half-time. Aston Villa's Jacob Ramsey was later sent off, but Mings did not receive a caution, which angered Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola. Iraola expressed concern about Scott's ability to finish the season, noting the severity of the injury.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations, except where explicitly required by law. This directive effectively shelves the "social cost of carbon," a tool used to weigh the costs and benefits of policies by estimating the economic damage from global warming. The White House argued there were too many uncertainties in calculating the figure and doubted the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. Scientists and environmental groups criticized the decision, arguing it ignores the reality of climate change's harmful effects.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's pursuit of personal profits through cryptocurrency ventures is jeopardizing his administration's ability to pass crypto legislation, as lawmakers express concerns about conflicts of interest. The rejection of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill, was partly attributed to Trump's involvement with meme coins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, as well as his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Critics argue that these ventures create opportunities for individuals to enrich the president personally, undermining public trust and endangering national security. Several Democrats have called for investigations into Trump-linked coins, and some industry insiders worry that these conflicts could hinder broader legislative achievements and damage the reputation of the U.S. crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces the potential of being labeled "Too Late" by President Donald Trump, mirroring historical criticisms of Fed leaders being slow to act on economic challenges. Economists suggest Powell's cautious approach, influenced by volatile policies and threats to the Fed's mandate, leaves him vulnerable to criticism, regardless of his actions. Trump has been urging the Fed to cut rates, while Powell has dismissed any idea of a pre-emptive rate cut. Given the history of the Fed's reluctance to hike or lower rates, the concern is that they may be too late in responding to economic shifts.</p>
