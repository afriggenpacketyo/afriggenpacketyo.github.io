          <p>NYU Stern professor Suzy Welch recommends that job seekers ask, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" during interviews. This question often elicits candid, unrehearsed responses that reveal a company's true values beyond generic platitudes like "innovation" or "empowerment." The answers, such as "someone who wants to try out different roles," provide genuine insight into the workplace culture, helping candidates assess if it aligns with their personal values. Welch advises asking this question late in the interview process, after an offer is made, to maintain rapport.</p>

          <p>A cyber group linked to Iran is threatening to release a new collection of emails allegedly stolen from high-profile Trump administration officials and allies, including Susie Wiles and Roger Stone. The threat comes after recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, with the hackers attempting to publicize a sale of the stolen data. U.S. officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, have condemned the act as an "unconscionable cyberattack" and vowed to prosecute those responsible. This follows a previous leak by the same group during the 2024 election campaign.</p>

          <p>Ford announced a significant 14.2% increase in vehicle sales for the second quarter compared to the previous year, far exceeding the estimated 1.4% industry-wide growth. The company sold 612,095 new vehicles, with strong performance from its F-Series trucks, which saw their best second quarter since 2019. Sales of "electrified" vehicles, which include both hybrids and EVs, rose by 6.6%, although pure EV sales saw a notable decline while hybrid sales surged. This growth comes amid a market affected by President Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. (not investment advice)</p>

The prolonged process involves Democrats introducing numerous amendments to highlight controversial aspects of the bill, such as cuts to Medicaid and changes to EV tax credits.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet caused a major spike in U.S. consumer prices, with key inflation gauges remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to "front-load" inventory before the duties took effect. Additionally, some businesses are temporarily absorbing the extra costs or using loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay tariff payments amid ongoing trade policy uncertainty. However, experts caution that this buffering effect is likely temporary, and price increases could still materialize later in the year if tariffs remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced criminal charges in a widespread scheme where North Korea allegedly placed thousands of its IT workers in remote jobs at American companies to fund its weapons program. These workers used stolen or fake identities to pose as U.S.-based employees, with their salaries being funneled to North Korean-affiliated conspirators. The nationwide operation has led to arrests and the seizure of websites and financial accounts, with prosecutors saying the scheme generated millions in revenue. The fraud not only evaded sanctions but also gave workers potential access to sensitive corporate and military data.</p>

          <p>A Yale Budget Lab analysis concludes that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would disproportionately benefit high-income households while financially harming the lowest earners. The report estimates that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9% (about $700), primarily due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Conversely, the top 20% would experience an average income gain of 2.2% ($5,700), largely from the extension of tax cuts. The analysis highlights a significant shift of resources from lower-income to wealthier Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reviews Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core" within the context of the mainstreaming of literary kink. It notes that as BDSM and related practices become more destigmatized, nonfiction works tend to focus on normalization, while fiction like Newell's explores the complex psychological and emotional landscapes of these worlds. "Soft Core" follows Ruth, a San Francisco sex worker, whose life blurs between her various personas as she navigates work, existential dread, and the mysterious disappearance of her ex-boyfriend. The review praises Newell's ability to capture the loneliness and surrealism of the industry.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested three former senior managers from the Countess of Chester Hospital on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.

This corporate manslaughter investigation is separate from Letby's conviction and does not impact it.

Judge Deborah Boardman specifically asked if the government plans to deport babies subject to the order while legal challenges are pending.

          <p>North Korea is reportedly preparing to send an additional 6,000 military engineers and workers to assist Russia in its war against Ukraine, deepening the military ties between the two nations. This deployment follows previous provisions of millions of artillery rounds and missiles to Moscow. In return, Pyongyang receives crucial economic aid and advanced military technology, bypassing international sanctions. Analysts suggest this mutually beneficial arrangement helps Russia sustain its war effort without expanding domestic mobilization, while North Korea gains resources, international prestige, and a powerful ally, thereby helping to ensure the regime's survival.</p>
