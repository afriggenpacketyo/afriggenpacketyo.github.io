          <p>Google has announced its decision to sign the European Union's voluntary AI guidelines, a move that contrasts with Meta's recent refusal. While Google expressed hope that this would promote access to AI tools in Europe, it also shared concerns that the EU's AI Act could potentially slow down technological development and harm the continent's competitiveness. Meta previously rejected the code, arguing it introduces legal uncertainties and goes beyond the scope of the AI Act, which could stifle innovation in the region.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has prompted tsunami warnings across the Pacific, affecting Japan and several U.S. states, including Hawaii, Alaska, and California. Evacuation orders were issued in parts of Hawaii and Japan, with flights being diverted or canceled as a precaution. While initial waves reaching Hawaii were reported to be smaller than feared, authorities urged continued caution, as tsunamis can involve a series of waves over many hours.</p>

          <p>Colombian international winger Luis Diaz has officially transferred from Liverpool to Bayern Munich in a deal valued at £65.5 million, signing a four-year contract with the German champions. The 28-year-old, who joined Liverpool in 2022, was a key player, contributing 41 goals in 148 appearances and winning both the FA Cup and EFL Cup. His departure leaves a significant void on Liverpool's left flank, a role that may now be filled by Cody Gakpo or other emerging talents.</p>

          <p>HSBC reported second-quarter pre-tax profits of $6.3 billion, falling short of analyst expectations due to impairment charges and lost income from divested businesses. In response, the banking giant announced a new $3 billion share buyback program. The bank's CEO highlighted structural economic challenges and market volatility as sources of uncertainty, though HSBC stated it is well-positioned to manage these risks. The results reflect ongoing restructuring efforts aimed at simplifying operations and cutting costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This essay examines the public and social media reaction to New York Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns, particularly the use of the term "zesty" to mock his mannerisms and expressions of joy. The author connects this scrutiny to broader cultural anxieties about Black masculinity, softness, and homophobia, drawing parallels to their own experiences of being policed for not conforming to rigid gender norms. The article argues that despite having the best season of his career, Towns became a target for expressing a form of aesthetic and emotional freedom that unsettles traditional expectations for male athletes.</p>

          <p>A new documentary suggests that 200 missing pages from an autobiography by Moors murderer Ian Brady may contain crucial clues about the location of his last undiscovered victim, 12-year-old Keith Bennett. The manuscript, titled "Black Light," is believed to be in the possession of Brady's solicitor, and the victim's family is calling for the material to be released to police. The documentary also reveals newly rediscovered defense files from the original trial, including photos that raise new questions about the search for the victims' bodies on Saddleworth Moor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of global civil society organizations has placed the United States on a watchlist due to "sustained attacks on civic freedoms" during the Trump administration. The report from the non-profit Civicus cites the deployment of military forces against protesters, increasing restrictions on journalists, and the targeting of anti-war advocates as key concerns. This action assigns the U.S. a "narrowed" civic space rating, indicating that while rights can still be exercised, the government is actively impeding them, setting a dangerous precedent for a democracy.</p>

          <p>Unlike many Western counterparts still heavily investing in development, Chinese companies, from startups to tech giants like Tencent, are already generating revenue from artificial intelligence by focusing on business-to-business applications. Firms are providing AI-powered tools for industries like manufacturing and customer service, with a strong focus on using business-specific data to deliver reliable results. This practical, application-focused approach has led to a surge in demand for data-labeling services and a shift in the job market, as engineers move from model creation to industry-specific AI development.</p>

          <p>The Chinese city of Shenzhen is adjusting its pioneering personal bankruptcy scheme by introducing stricter supervisory measures aimed at preventing "debt evasion." Under the new rules, a debtor's bankruptcy information will be publicly disclosed for up to eight years after their debts are discharged. Since launching the pilot program in 2021, the first of its kind in mainland China, over 500 cases have been processed, primarily involving entrepreneurs and small business owners, but some experts feel the pace of reform is too slow to meet societal demand.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has announced it will be phasing out its pickup-only store formats in the U.S., which lack customer seating. The decision comes after the company reported a sixth consecutive quarterly decline in same-store sales and a significant drop in net income. CEO Brian Niccol stated that the transactional nature of these outlets did not align with the brand's emphasis on warmth and human connection. The company will instead focus on revamping its traditional cafes and improving speed of service at both cafes and drive-throughs.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists in China have discovered exceptionally preserved 436-million-year-old fossils of brachiopods, or "lamp shells," that suggest the creatures arranged themselves in a regular, checkerboard-like pattern on the sea floor. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, posits that the invertebrates used hundreds of thin, bristle-like structures called setae to maintain this spacing. This "social distancing" behavior likely improved their chances of survival by providing each individual with adequate space for filter feeding.</p>

          <p>This analysis by the BBC's international editor frames the UK's new policy on recognizing a Palestinian state as a major diplomatic maneuver designed to break the current stalemate and revitalize the two-state solution. The move, prompted by the devastating situation in Gaza, is intended to empower moderates on both sides, despite Israel's immediate and forceful rejection. The article notes the historical context of Britain's role in the region and suggests the policy shift signals Israel's growing diplomatic isolation and could create new friction in transatlantic relations.</p>

          <p>New York City's mayor has revealed that the gunman who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan office building was intending to target the NFL's headquarters. The shooter, Shane Tamura, left a note indicating he believed he had the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition. Investigators say Tamura took the wrong elevator, which led him to a different company's offices where he carried out the attack before taking his own life. The investigation is ongoing, with police looking into his past and how he assembled the weapon used.</p>

          <p>Six months after a midair collision between a regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter killed 67 people near Washington, D.C., the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is set to begin a fact-finding hearing. The investigation into the deadliest U.S. aviation accident since 2001 has renewed concerns about the congested airspace around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). The hearing will examine factors like the helicopter's data systems, air traffic control communications, and whether the helicopter's altimeters were functioning correctly.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that a decade of European policy focused on militarizing borders and stopping migrant arrivals has created a dangerous fantasy of control that only fuels far-right narratives and dehumanizes people. The author contends that mainstream politicians have amplified crisis talk, leading to the erosion of human rights, the normalization of violence at borders, and a desensitization to mass death in the Mediterranean. The article concludes that these repressive policies fail to stop migration but succeed in creating a more divided and authoritarian Europe.</p>

          <p>The Australian government is widening its landmark social media law to include YouTube, banning children under 16 from having accounts on the platform. The decision reverses a previous exemption for the video-sharing site, which was granted due to its educational use. The government cited a regulator's survey showing a high percentage of minors reported encountering harmful content on YouTube as the reason for the change. The law, which also covers platforms like TikTok and Instagram, is set to take effect in late 2025.</p>
