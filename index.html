          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded without a clear direction as investors analyzed the outcomes of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin. Sentiment was dampened by ongoing uncertainty regarding U.S. tariff policies, particularly after a federal court ruled many of President Trump's tariffs illegal. Indian markets were a key focus following reports that the country had offered to significantly reduce tariffs on U.S. imports. Meanwhile, economic data from South Korea and Australia showed mixed results, with South Korea's inflation slowing and Australia's current account deficit narrowing slightly.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant policy change impacting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is set to alter the grocery purchasing power for over 40 million low-income Americans. The new rules, part of a broader tax law, are expected to be the largest cuts in the program's history, potentially reducing family benefits by hundreds of dollars per month. While this will create hardship for many recipients, some analysts predict that large discount grocers like Walmart may benefit from an influx of shoppers seeking to stretch their budgets. Conversely, independent and smaller grocery stores, which often have thin profit margins, are bracing for a substantial negative impact on their sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that the justice secretary will receive the authority to veto any new guidelines proposed by the independent Sentencing Council. This reform means that both the justice secretary and the lady chief justice must approve any changes before they can be issued to courts in England and Wales. The move follows a recent public disagreement over proposed guidance that would have required courts to consider the backgrounds of offenders from certain minority groups. The government stated the change ensures greater democratic oversight of sentencing policy while maintaining judicial independence in individual cases.</p>

          <p>Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, former President Donald Trump sharply criticized the trade relationship between the United States and India. In a social media post, he labeled the ties a "totally one sided disaster," accusing India of imposing excessively high tariffs on U.S. goods while selling massive amounts of its own products to America. This rhetoric intensifies recent trade tensions, which have seen the U.S. impose significant tariffs on India, partly in response to its purchase of Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed that a recent U.S. appeals court ruling deeming his tariffs unconstitutional could lead to the immediate cancellation of a record $15 trillion in planned investments in the country. In a social media post, he argued that these tariffs are the primary reason for the investment and that their termination would turn the U.S. into a "Third World Nation." The court's decision found that the president had overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose the levies, a ruling that could be appealed to the Supreme Court.

          <p>The Bishop Montgomery High School football program faces an uncertain future after firing its head coach, Ed Hodgkiss, and forfeiting last week's game against Mater Dei. The dismissal follows a Southern Section ruling that declared five transfer students ineligible for two years due to the submission of false information. The school has not yet named a replacement coach, and an investigation by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles is ongoing. If the school cancels the remainder of its season, players may be eligible for hardship waivers to transfer and play for other schools immediately.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record, with their total outlay during the summer transfer window surpassing £3 billion for the first time. The final figure was pushed past the milestone by several major deadline-day deals, including Alexander Isak's £125 million British record move from Newcastle to Liverpool. This summer's spending significantly eclipses the £1.96 billion spent last year and is more than the combined total of all clubs in the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A. This financial dominance highlights the widening gap between the Premier League and other top European leagues.</p>

Known as a "supermarket of illegal wildlife," Mong La openly sells products from endangered species to buyers, many from China, for use in traditional medicine and luxury goods. Poachers in India, often from traditional hunting communities, are working with international syndicates to supply the market. This cross-border trade poses a severe threat to India's wild tiger population, which accounts for over 70% of the world's total.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has shattered its previous transfer spending habits, concluding the summer with an unprecedented £415 million outlay, the highest ever by a single club in one window. This strategic shift, under new manager Arne Slot, was highlighted by the British record £125 million signing of striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle. The club's aggressive spending was fueled by a combination of factors, including strong commercial growth, player sales, and a desire to capitalize on their recent Premier League title win. This marks a significant departure from the more conservative financial approach seen under former manager Jurgen Klopp.</p>

The film, directed by Benny Safdie, explores Kerr's career, his struggles with substance abuse, and his personal relationships.

The company stated the dismissal was a "necessary decision" to uphold its strong values and governance, as the relationship represented a conflict of interest.

          <p>A recent study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This new minimum age, determined using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and helps resolve decades of conflicting estimates. The findings strengthen the theory that the fossil belongs to Homo heidelbergensis, a species considered a common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. This suggests that distinct archaic human populations coexisted with emerging Neanderthals in southeastern Europe, adding complexity to our understanding of human evolution.</p>
