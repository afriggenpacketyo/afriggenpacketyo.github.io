          <p>According to Defense Minister Israel Katz, Israel launched a preemptive strike against Iran, prompting a state of emergency declaration and expectations of retaliatory missile and drone attacks. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv following the announcement, while the U.S. stated it had no involvement but was advised of the action for self-defense. President Trump affirmed commitment to diplomatic resolution on Iran's nuclear issue, while Iranian President Pezeshkian vowed to continue uranium enrichment and rebuild any destroyed facilities. The strikes occurred amidst planned nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran, escalating tensions in the Middle East. Optimism remains low amidst the escalating conflict.</p>

Another former girlfriend refiled a civil lawsuit against Combs, alleging coercion and assault, adding to the multiple lawsuits he faces. The defense focused on a January 2024 incident involving Jane and an unnamed rapper in Las Vegas, as prosecutors suggested they could rest their case next week.

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has started, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's popularity remaining low. With no party holding a majority in the assembly, focus is on whether the LDP can retain its seats, amid approval ratings sometimes dipping below the "danger level." Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, especially unaffiliated ones. Major issues at stake include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals, child-rearing, and regional concerns, with around 300 candidates running in the election.

          <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings of potential disruptions and increased risks. The order aims to centralize efforts currently divided among multiple agencies under the Interior Department, with a proposed budget for a new Federal Wildland Fire Service. The move follows devastating wildfires, including those in Los Angeles, and cites the need for quicker responses, but it omits any mention of climate change. Critics, including former officials, warn that the restructuring could be costly and increase the likelihood of catastrophic fires, particularly during peak fire season. The decision has sparked debate over its potential impact on firefighting effectiveness.</p>

The driver hit a pole while attempting to remove the cicada, resulting in no injuries. Police joked that "the suspect fled the scene," referring to the cicada. The cicada invasion, occurring every 17 years, has disrupted the Cincinnati area, with peak activity expected to decline in early July.

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles over the objections of California Governor Gavin Newsom has sparked controversy. Trump claims the move was necessary to restore order and protect ICE officers, while Newsom accuses Trump of exploiting protests for political gain. The deployment has raised fears of politicizing the military, with Major General Randy Manner calling it an unjustifiable escalation. The Trump administration maintains it took over California's National Guard to restore order, and protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers as they conducted sweeps for undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office reveals that President Trump's megabill would disproportionately benefit wealthy households while reducing resources for the poorest. The lowest-earning 10% of households would see a 3.9% income cut, while the top 10% would gain approximately $12,000 per year. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defends the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles amid objections from Democrats. Preparations are underway in Washington for a massive military parade to mark the Army's 250th birthday. The CBO's findings highlight concerns about the bill's impact on income inequality.</p>
