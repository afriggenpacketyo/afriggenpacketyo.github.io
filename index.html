          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on funding cuts and stricter visa policies in the United States to recruit top-tier scientific and engineering talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering highly competitive salaries to attract PhD candidates who might have otherwise stayed in the U.S., fueling the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector. This brain drain helps Chinese firms advance their use of artificial intelligence and compete globally in a domestic market now worth over $11 trillion. The trend highlights a significant shift in the global competition for financial and technological expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is holding a historic mass recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The outcome could potentially shift the balance of power in the parliament, giving President Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a majority. The recall effort was initiated by civic groups following accusations that KMT lawmakers, who advocate for closer ties with China, were obstructing the government's agenda and pushing controversial reforms. The KMT has condemned the recall as a power grab, while Taiwan's government has warned of Chinese interference in the politically charged vote.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that a grenade is missing following a deadly explosion at a Los Angeles training facility that killed three sheriff's deputies. The deputies had recovered two grenades from a Santa Monica garage, believing them to be inert, but one detonated the next morning. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is now leading a wide-area search for the second device, which investigators believe was also brought to the facility. The Sheriff's Department has revised its policies, vowing to treat all future explosive devices as live to prevent another such tragedy.</p>

          <p>Two Democratic congressmen, Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia, have formally requested that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a complete copy of a 'birthday book' allegedly compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell. The book reportedly contains messages from numerous powerful individuals, including a crude poem attributed to Donald Trump, which he denies writing. The lawmakers argue the book's contents are essential for congressional oversight regarding the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein investigation. This move intensifies the political pressure surrounding the Epstein files and the powerful figures connected to the deceased sex offender.</p>

          <p>While visiting Scotland, President Donald Trump addressed the ongoing controversy regarding his association with Jeffrey Epstein, dismissing it as something the media is making into a 'very big thing' when it is not. He denied being briefed on his name appearing in Epstein-related files and stated it was not the time to discuss a potential pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, despite acknowledging he has been asked about it. Trump's comments come as his administration faces increasing scrutiny and public pressure for transparency concerning the full extent of the Epstein case and its associated high-profile connections.</p>

Dowdeswell, who has spent over £30,000 in legal fees, argues there has been no evidence of confusion in her 15 years of business.

          <p>A BBC investigation has found that Russia is recruiting 18-year-olds as contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine, despite official promises to the contrary. At least 245 soldiers of that age have been killed since rules were changed in April 2023, allowing recent school-leavers to sign up directly without prior military service. The report highlights how patriotic propaganda, lavish financial incentives, and new military-focused school curricula are encouraging young men from poorer regions to enlist. This strategy allows Russia to sustain its war effort without a national mobilization, but at a tragic cost to its youngest soldiers.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has experienced a significant increase in certain insect populations, such as ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following its warmest and sunniest spring on record. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species. While beneficial for some insects and pollinators like bees, experts express concern that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year. This year's abundance contrasts sharply with the long-term trend of declining flying insect populations in the UK.</p>

Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion to dismiss the case. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the ruling, stating that it affirms the legality of the city's ordinance and enhances public safety by allowing local police to focus on community needs rather than federal immigration agendas.</p>

          <p>An asteroid named 2024 YR4, once considered a risk to Earth, may instead be on a collision course with the moon in 2032. While an Earth impact has been ruled out, a lunar strike from the 200-foot-wide 'city killer' asteroid presents new concerns for planetary defense. The impact could create a crater a kilometer wide and send a massive cloud of lunar debris toward Earth, potentially damaging the vital satellite infrastructure we rely on for communications and navigation. This scenario is prompting astronomers to expand their focus beyond Earth-bound threats to include protecting assets on and around the moon.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the upcoming week is pivotal for the market's direction, driven by several key events. Investors are anticipating the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, the latest nonfarm payrolls report, and quarterly earnings from tech giants including Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Cramer suggests the Fed will likely express caution about tariff-driven inflation, while major tech stocks are positioned for strong reports based on recent market movements. The confluence of these economic indicators and corporate results is expected to significantly influence market sentiment for the rest of the summer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his first interview since being fired from MasterChef, Gregg Wallace has apologized to anyone he hurt but denied being a 'groper, a sex pest or a flasher.'

Wallace attributed some of his comments to his background and a recent autism diagnosis, a claim that drew backlash from disability charities. He also defended his former co-host John Torode, who was also fired over a racism allegation, stating that Torode is not a racist.</p>

          <p>As the UN warns of a deepening starvation crisis in Gaza, nutrition experts have raised concerns about the aid boxes distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). An analysis shows the boxes, which contain mostly dried goods like pasta and lentils, are deficient in essential vitamins and minerals such as iron, calcium, and vitamin C. While providing calories, a prolonged diet of these items could lead to 'hidden hunger' and diseases like anemia. The aid also requires clean water and fuel for cooking, both of which are critically scarce in the besieged territory.</p>
