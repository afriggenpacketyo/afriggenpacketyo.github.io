          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered at 49.7 in June, marking the third consecutive month of contraction as it remained below the 50-point threshold.

          <p>New research suggests that passengers are more likely to experience motion sickness in electric vehicles compared to conventional combustion engine cars. Scientists attribute this to the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the low-frequency movements produced by regenerative braking systems. As the adoption of electric vehicles continues to grow rapidly worldwide, this issue of passenger comfort and its potential health effects is gaining increased attention from automotive engineers.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced he will not seek another term in 2026, a decision that came hours after President Trump threatened to back a primary challenger against him. The threat was a direct response to Tillis's refusal to support the president's major spending and tax bill, with the senator citing its "devastating" Medicaid cuts. In his statement, Tillis lamented that bipartisanship and independent thinking have become an "endangered species" in Washington.</p>

          <p>The cause of death for a 13-year-old Sun Valley boy, who was allegedly murdered by his youth soccer coach, has been identified as acute alcohol poisoning, according to the family's attorney. The boy, Oscar Omar Hernandez, was found dead in a ditch in April after he had gone to visit his coach, Mario Edgardo Garcia Aquino. Garcia Aquino has since been charged with murder with special circumstances, and this new finding raises additional questions about the events that led to the teenager's death.</p>

Key issues to be examined include the initial lack of protective equipment, blanket "do not resuscitate" orders, and prolonged visiting bans that prevented families from seeing their dying relatives.</p>
