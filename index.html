        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study from the University of Turku indicates that maternal grandmothers play a significant role in buffering the negative effects of adverse childhood experiences on their grandchildren. Researchers found that support from maternal grandmothers, such as childcare or financial assistance, helped mitigate the impact of trauma. This "buffering" effect was not observed with other grandparents, aligning with the grandmother hypothesis, which suggests that grandmothers increase their daughter's fertility by helping care for children. The study emphasizes the importance of a strong support system for children facing hardship.</p>

          <p>Australia's universal healthcare system is facing a crisis due to inadequate government funding, worker shortages, and rising costs for patients. Many Australians are delaying or going without necessary care, leading to health becoming a key election issue. While both major parties promise additional funding, experts argue that sweeping changes to the system's funding model are needed. The core of the crisis lies in GP services, where increasing numbers of doctors are charging gap fees due to insufficient Medicare rebates.</p>
