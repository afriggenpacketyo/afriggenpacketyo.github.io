          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Walmart will absorb some of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, a claim reportedly confirmed in a phone call with Walmart's CEO. This assurance comes after Walmart indicated it would need to raise prices due to the tariffs, prompting an angry response from President Trump. Bessent suggested that Walmart's initial statement was a worst-case scenario presented to avoid potential lawsuits. Trump's tariff strategy, which initially caused market turmoil, has since been partially walked back with reduced tariffs on China. (not investment advice)</p>
