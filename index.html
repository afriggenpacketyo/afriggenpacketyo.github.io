          <p>The UK government is managing two international crises: the Israel-Iran conflict and a plane crash in India.  The government's response to the Israel-Iran conflict involves diplomatic efforts without explicit endorsement of either side.  Preparations for a potential Israeli strike on Iran began months ago.  The G7 summit will address the Middle East situation, while the UK also grapples with the aftermath of the plane crash in India.</p>

          <p>Israel's attack on Iranian nuclear facilities sparked debate over Iran's proximity to producing a nuclear bomb.  Israel claims Iran was months away, citing intelligence on weapon component progress.  However, experts question the evidence and note that Iran's enrichment levels, while high, don't definitively indicate weaponization efforts.  The IAEA's concerns about Iran's non-compliance with inspections remain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement policies, including workplace raids and troop deployments to quell protests, are creating political risks.  While some polls show support for his policies, others reveal significant disapproval, particularly regarding his response to protests.  The approach is unifying Democrats in opposition, but the party still needs to develop a compelling immigration policy to gain broader public trust.  Some Republicans also express concern about the impact on workers.</p>
