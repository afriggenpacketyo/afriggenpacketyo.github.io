          <p>Torrential rain in Ruidoso, New Mexico, caused flash flooding that resulted in at least three fatalities, including a four-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, and a man. The Rio Ruidoso river surged to a record 20 feet, leading to over 50 swift water rescues and a house being swept away. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham issued an emergency declaration to expedite federal aid to the area. The region, previously devastated by wildfires, was particularly vulnerable due to unstable, flood-prone soil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilders have committed to paying £100 million towards affordable housing, a move that will allow them to avoid a formal ruling from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on potential competition law breaches. The CMA had been investigating whether these firms shared commercially sensitive information, such as pricing. In addition to the payment, the companies have agreed to cease such information sharing, except in limited circumstances. This resolution aims to bring hundreds of affordable homes to the market more quickly than a prolonged investigation.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron urged the UK Parliament to recognize Palestinian statehood as the sole path to peace, during his state visit to Britain. Concurrently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a second meeting with US President Donald Trump, focusing on efforts to free hostages in Gaza and eliminating Hamas' capabilities. Trump expressed optimism for a ceasefire deal soon, with Qatar hosting indirect talks between Israel and Hamas. These diplomatic efforts highlight the ongoing push for de-escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Sir Brian Leveson, a former senior judge, has recommended fundamental reforms to the UK's criminal courts, including judge-only trials for certain cases like fraud and bribery. These proposals aim to alleviate a backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in Crown Courts, which causes years of waiting for justice. The recommendations also suggest more out-of-court resolutions and a new Crown Court division with magistrates and a judge for less serious offenses. While some barristers express concern over the dilution of jury rights, supporters argue these changes are crucial to prevent a 'total system collapse' and deliver swifter justice.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has issued a stark warning about a 'pivotal moment' for the UK's financial services sector, citing the departure of 213 firms from the London Stock Exchange since 2016. CBI Chair Rupert Soames attributes this exodus to companies listing elsewhere, private acquisitions, and investors shunning UK shares. He advocates for lighter regulation, improved marketing, and incentives for domestic investment, including potentially cutting allowances for cash ISAs to encourage stock market participation. The CBI emphasizes that this trend threatens the financial industry's significant contribution to UK tax revenues.</p>

          <p>TV presenter Gregg Wallace has been cautioned by Baroness Helena Kennedy, chair of a creative industries watchdog, not to dismiss the sexual assault claims against him. This warning follows 50 additional people contacting BBC News with allegations, which Wallace denies. An independent inquiry into misconduct claims led to his dismissal as MasterChef presenter. The majority of new claims involve inappropriate sexual comments, while 11 women accuse him of inappropriate sexual behavior, including groping and touching. Baroness Kennedy also criticized industry managers for failing to address earlier concerns.</p>

          <p>A Pew Research Center report showed Donald Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in 2024, his highest ever, with significant gains among men and women. However, this article argues that Trump's recent aggressive immigration raids, particularly in Los Angeles, are alienating Latino voters. By targeting long-term residents and non-criminals, the author suggests Trump risks reversing his electoral progress. This approach is seen as reminiscent of past Republican missteps in California, potentially radicalizing a new generation of Latino activists and undermining his support base.</p>

Despite their positive impact on passenger numbers and fares, concerns from the Department for Transport and rail unions suggest these operators might be curtailed.

          <p>Texas hydrologists recognized the conditions that could lead to catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River, noting that historical events had warned of such risks. The article explains that the region, known as 'Flash Flood Alley,' reacts quickly to rainfall due to its steep slopes and narrow riverbeds, leaving little time for warnings. Despite a flash flood watch issued hours before the disaster, challenges in warning delivery, especially overnight, meant messages were not always received. Experts emphasize that the physical danger of rising floodwaters is often underestimated, and increased population density in high-risk areas exacerbates evacuation difficulties.</p>

          <p>Super Micro, a key supplier of AI servers packed with Nvidia chips, plans to significantly increase its investment in Europe, including ramping up manufacturing facilities. CEO Charles Liang cited rapidly growing demand in Europe for AI infrastructure as the primary driver for this expansion. Despite previous concerns about its accounting and financial reporting, the company's stock has recovered, and Liang dismissed fears of weakening demand, emphasizing the 'tremendous' room for continued growth. This strategic move aligns with the broader push to boost computing capacity across Europe to meet the escalating needs of AI development.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered an 'unbelievable' performance in his fifth MLB start, striking out 12 Dodgers batters over six innings and extending Los Angeles' losing streak to five games. Despite the Dodgers' strategy to stress the inexperienced right-hander, Misiorowski showcased exceptional command and velocity, frequently hitting triple digits with his fastball. Shohei Ohtani hit a leadoff home run, but the Dodgers failed to capitalize on subsequent scoring opportunities. Clayton Kershaw delivered a solid outing for the Dodgers, but the team's shorthanded lineup struggled against Misiorowski's formidable pitching.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's latest 'tariff letters' target close US allies Japan and South Korea, threatening to impose additional duties on their exports. These new tariffs, including a 25% levy on auto and steel exports, are expected to further hurt both export-dependent economies, which are already grappling with slowed growth and potential recession. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba seeks an agreement to remove auto tariffs, while the Bank of Korea has nearly halved its GDP growth estimates for 2025 due to tariff impacts. The article suggests these are pressure tactics, though markets remain cautiously optimistic about potential negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a display of unity against US President Donald Trump's criticism, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their trade flows. Trump recently claimed that the BRICS bloc was established to harm the US dollar and threatened a 10% tariff on any nation within the group. The BRICS group, which has expanded beyond its original four members, aims to unite emerging market economies and reform Western-dominated international institutions. Despite Trump's hardening stance and accusations of 'anti-American policies,' the bloc has not officially responded, but its members are reinforcing their economic ties. (not investment advice)</p>
