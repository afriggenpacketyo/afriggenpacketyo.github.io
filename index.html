          <p>A coalition of twelve states, largely led by Democrats, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging the legality of tariffs imposed by the president. The states argue that only Congress possesses the constitutional authority to legislate tariffs, and the administration's actions are arbitrary and unlawful. This lawsuit follows a similar action taken by California, further escalating the legal challenges against the administration's trade policies. The states seek to block the enforcement of the tariffs, citing economic harm.</p>
