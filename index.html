            <p>President Trump's new tariffs, exceeding a base rate of 10%, took effect, impacting imports from numerous countries. China faces a net total tariff of 104% on its exports to the U.S., escalating trade war tensions. The Chinese Commerce Ministry condemned the move as a mistake and vowed to retaliate. Other countries, including Lesotho and Cambodia, also face substantial tariff rates, creating uncertainty for businesses and global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is accelerating the construction of the California-Mexico border wall by bypassing environmental regulations. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem waived environmental laws to speed up the construction of about 2.5 miles of new border barrier. The waiver covers projects near Jacumba Hot Springs that were funded through U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s fiscal year 2020 and 2021 budgets. The goal is to complete about 1,400 miles of uninterrupted border barrier.</p>
