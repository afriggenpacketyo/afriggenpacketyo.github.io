The rise in demand is attributed to an increase in available housing inventory, enticing potential buyers despite economic uncertainty.

However, applications to refinance a home loan fell slightly, though they remained higher than the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to set the stage for further agreements linking minerals and geopolitics. The deal aims to deepen economic ties and position Ukraine as a supplier of strategically important minerals to the U.S. Experts suggest that Washington's rivalry with Beijing, the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, has put critical minerals at the center of the U.S. national security agenda. While some analysts are skeptical about a wave of bilateral agreements, others believe resource nationalism is on the rise.</p>

Warnock contends that providing healthcare coverage without these requirements encourages employment by ensuring people receive the care they need to stay healthy.

His actions, such as benefiting from foreign diplomats staying at his hotels, demonstrate a pattern of prioritizing his interests over constitutional principles.

          <p>Co-op anticipates that its shelves will return to normal stock levels this weekend after resolving issues stemming from a cyberattack. The hack, claimed by DragonForce, led to payment problems, widespread shortages, and compromised customer data. The company is gradually bringing its systems back online, working with suppliers to restock shelves and assuring customers that all payment systems are operational. Experts caution that the reputational impact and costs of recovery could affect the Co-op for some time to come.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to extend the qualifying period for migrants seeking permanent settlement from five to ten years, even for those already in the country. This move, subject to a public consultation, is part of a broader effort to reduce legal migration. While some Labour MPs have raised concerns about the impact on current residents, the government argues that settlement should be earned through contribution to the UK's economy and society. The Migration Observatory notes that this change would make the UK more restrictive compared to other high-income countries.</p>

          <p>Now that President Trump is back in office, his family is profiting from his brand, with at least $2 billion flowing to Trump companies in the last month alone. Ventures include real estate deals in Qatar, Serbia, and the UAE, the $TRUMP cryptocurrency, and a new private club in Washington with a $500,000 membership fee. Qatar is planning to give a $400 million Boeing 747 aircraft to the president so he can use it as a temporary Air Force One. The ethical concerns are obvious, as Trump is both the commander in chief and a business partner of foreign governments.</p>
