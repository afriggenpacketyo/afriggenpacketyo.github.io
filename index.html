          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 14:54:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House announced that the United States and China have reached a trade deal after two days of negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that 'substantial progress' had been made, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested that the agreement would help resolve the national emergency caused by the massive US trade deficit. While details remain scarce, President Trump praised the talks as a 'total reset' in relations, signaling a potential de-escalation of the trade war. The deal is expected to address the trade imbalance and improve market access for American businesses in China.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy cautioned that more U.S. airports could face disruptions similar to those experienced at Newark Liberty International Airport. Newark has struggled with technological issues and staffing shortages recently, leading to major delays and cancellations. Duffy announced he would meet with airline leaders to develop a plan for scaling back flights at Newark and is seeking investments to modernize the country’s air traffic control system. He emphasized the need for Congress to address the 'antiquated systems' across major airports to prevent future widespread issues and maintain air safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program, part of his 2026 budget, raises concerns among parents of students with disabilities. The budget suggests limiting federal oversight and providing states with greater flexibility in allocating funds under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Critics fear this could lead to reduced enforcement of minimum standards and unequal access to inclusive education for students with disabilities. An example is given in Oklahoma, where a school district was segregating a student with Down syndrome in a classroom, and this article discusses that federal oversight is needed to ensure states meet their responsibilities to students with disabilities.</p>

          <p>Democratic Congress members allege that Trump administration homeland security officials instigated the confrontation at a New Jersey immigration jail that resulted in the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. The representatives, who were visiting Delaney Hall to inspect the facility, claim immigration officials had opportunities to de-escalate the situation before ordering Baraka's arrest for trespassing. Officials have accused the Congress members of staging a political stunt and threatened their arrest, while the controversy unfolds amid legal challenges to ICE detention in New Jersey and a lawsuit filed by Newark against the facility's operator, Geo Group.</p>

          <p>A crash involving a tour bus and an S.U.V. in Los Angeles County early on Sunday morning killed at least one person and left 32 other people injured, the authorities said. The crash happened around 5 a.m. on the 60 Freeway in Hacienda Heights, which is about 20 miles southeast of the city of Los Angeles. The male driver of the Nissan, who was the only occupant of the vehicle, was declared dead on arrival, said Officer Zachary Salazar of the California Highway Patrol. Police do not believe alcohol or drugs were a factor in the crash.</p>

          <p>Wealthy Gulf states have promised President Trump significant investments in the US, but falling oil prices present a challenge to these commitments. Lower oil prices impact Middle Eastern nations dependent on oil for national income, potentially affecting their ability to finance projects like Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030. Experts suggest that while some Gulf states like the UAE and Qatar will still earn surpluses, Saudi Arabia may face pressure on spending.

The treasury secretary did not elaborate on what had been agreed to, but said details would be announced on Monday and that Trump had been updated.

King Charles III was busy last week marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany and preparing to fly to Canada to open its Parliament later this month. But his public schedule was eclipsed yet again by a highly publicized eruption from his estranged younger son, Prince Harry. The king’s younger brother, Prince Andrew, is still in internal exile, following the scandal over his ties to the disgraced sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.

The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim and on Sunday again stressed it did not intend to give up the programme.

Assuming Trump accepts the plane as planned, the jumbo jet would first be transferred to the US air force so the military branch could configure the aircraft to meet the specifications required for presidential travel. Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland said: “Trump must seek Congress’ consent to take this $300m from Qatar.
