          <p>Syria's Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have declared that disarmament is a "red line" following recent sectarian violence in the country. This declaration comes as political negotiations over their future autonomy are at a critical juncture, with a key meeting postponed and significant disagreements remaining. Tensions are further heightened by Turkey, which opposes Kurdish autonomy and has reportedly offered security support to Damascus, raising concerns about a potential broader conflict that could draw in other regional actors.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has addressed the future of striker Alexander Isak, who is reportedly considering a move amid interest from Liverpool. Howe stated that while the club would love for Isak to stay, any potential transfer "has to be right for Newcastle." The Swedish international, who has a contract until 2028, did not travel with the squad for a pre-season trip due to a thigh injury, fueling further speculation about his potential departure.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Iowa experienced a life-threatening medical emergency after being bitten by a spider while at his summer job. The bite led to a severe infection, requiring emergency surgery and causing his kidneys to fail, which left him bedridden in a pediatric ICU for two weeks. The previously healthy teenager was put on dialysis and at times was unable to speak, but his condition has since improved and he is now recovering at home.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight made a dramatic dive of 300 feet in 36 seconds to avoid another aircraft shortly after taking off from Burbank, California. The sudden maneuver injured two cabin crew members and sent some unbelted passengers flying into the ceiling. The plane, a Boeing 737, was reportedly in the same vicinity as a fighter jet but was able to land safely at its destination. The incident is now under investigation by the FAA amid growing concerns over aviation safety.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, was questioned by the U.S. Justice Department for a day and a half. Her lawyer confirmed she answered questions about numerous individuals but was not offered any deal for her cooperation. The questioning has renewed focus on Donald Trump's past association with Epstein, although Trump has denied any wrongdoing and stated he has not considered the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell.</p>

          <p>A shooting inside a University of New Mexico dormitory has left a 14-year-old dead and a 19-year-old injured. The incident occurred during a new student orientation period when, for reasons still under investigation, an 18-year-old suspect allegedly opened fire on others in a dorm room. The campus was temporarily locked down, and New Mexico State Police have since taken the suspect into custody, with charges now pending in the case.</p>
