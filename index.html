        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Key political figures, including the UK prime minister, convened in Kyiv to discuss the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. They collectively demanded that Russia agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, effective from the following Monday. These leaders threatened to impose significant sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if their demands were unmet. The BBC article states that the Kremlin responded with accusations of 'contradictory' and 'confrontational' remarks from European leaders, complicating the path toward de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is under pressure from President Trump to cut interest rates, despite economic data not indicating significant price spikes or slowdowns. The CNBC article suggests that Powell's caution is due to the volatile policy mix, particularly Trump's tariffs, which threaten both growth and inflation. Some economists believe Powell is in a no-win situation and may be labeled 'Too Late' regardless of his actions, as the Fed has historically been slow to react to economic shifts.</p>
