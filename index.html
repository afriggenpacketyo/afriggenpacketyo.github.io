            <h2>Survey Indicates Tariffs Will Not Spur US Manufacturing Resurgence</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-14 13:02:49 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A recent CNBC Supply Chain Survey reveals that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. Companies surveyed believe that reshoring would double costs, with 61% finding it more cost-effective to relocate to lower-tariff countries. The survey also highlights concerns over consumer demand, raw material prices, and the administration's inconsistent strategy. Furthermore, automation is expected to dominate any potential return of manufacturing to the U.S., reducing reliance on human workers, and most respondents anticipate job cuts in the near future due to tariff impacts.

The comments come after the implementation of 25% automotive tariffs on imported vehicles, with domestic manufacturers announcing temporary deals and foreign manufacturers responding in various ways, such as ceasing U.S. shipments.

            <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller anticipates that President Trump's tariffs will have a "transitory" impact on inflation, a term previously used during the 2021 inflation spike. Waller outlined two scenarios: larger tariffs causing a 4%-5% inflation spike that eventually subsides, and smaller tariffs resulting in a 3% increase. Regardless, he expects the Fed to cut interest rates, with the timing dependent on the tariff size. Waller used a football analogy to defend his "transitory" inflation view, emphasizing the need for flexibility in policymaking due to the economic uncertainties created by the tariffs.

The council claims the offer on the table was a fair one, while suggesting "every employee affected by the removal of the WRCO role could take an equivalent graded role in the council, LGV Driver training or voluntary redundancy packages."

The announcement comes after President Trump exempted chips and other tech devices from tariffs, but indicated that new tariffs on imported semiconductors would be announced soon.

            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the conditions in Gaza hospitals as "beyond description" following Israeli attacks. A major facility, al-Ahli hospital, was put out of service by an Israeli air strike, destroying its laboratory and damaging its emergency room. The Israeli military claimed it targeted a "command-and-control centre" used by Hamas. The Church of England, which runs the hospital, has called on Israel to provide evidence to support its claim, while the WHO has reiterated that hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump and his top trade officials added to the confusion over his administration's tariff plans, including newly announced exemptions for reciprocal tariffs on electronic products such as phones, computers and semiconductors. Trump and his aides suggested the exemptions — which erased added tariffs of 145% on many Chinese electronics devices and components — would be partially or completely reversed in coming weeks. A separate 20% tariff on all Chinese goods is still in effect. The situation adds more uncertainty about Trump's tariff policy, which has changed repeatedly since he took office.</p>

            <p>Campaigners with Canada’s Liberal party had some very American-esque politicking over the weekend, when Liberal operatives were found to have planted “stop the steal” buttons at a conservative conference to link the Conservative party to Donald Trump. The operation was exposed when a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) politics reporter overheard staffers boasting about their actions at an Ottawa pub, where they were drinking with other Liberal war room colleagues on Friday night. The Liberal party confirmed the incident on Sunday evening, saying some campaigners had “regrettably got carried away” with buttons “poking fun” at reported Conservative infighting.</p>
