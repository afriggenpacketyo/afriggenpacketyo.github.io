          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, declared at his party's conference that they have a moral obligation to defeat Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party. He positioned the Lib Dems as an alternative to both Labour and the Conservatives, offering "radical change" aligned with British values, in contrast to what he described as Farage's desire for a UK resembling "Trump's America." Davey acknowledged his party's challenge in the polls but emphasized the need to expose Farage and address voter concerns on issues like immigration and the cost of living.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, remains a crucial tool for retirees to manage healthcare costs not covered by Original Medicare. In 2025, monthly premiums for these plans can vary widely, from as low as $32 for high-deductible options to over $550 for comprehensive coverage, with average costs for popular plans typically falling between $90 and $300. The article notes that costs are influenced by location, age, gender, and the specific plan chosen, advising consumers to enroll when first eligible and compare insurers to find the most affordable rates.

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, has rested his defense case after just a few hours in a Florida federal court. Representing himself, Routh called only three witnesses, including a former Marine sniper who testified about the rifle found at the scene. Routh chose not to testify in his own defense against the five counts he faces for the planned attack on Trump at his West Palm Beach golf club in September 2024. Closing arguments are scheduled to begin next.</p>

Mamdani stated his withdrawal is a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over press freedom, a sentiment echoed by an ACLU letter signed by numerous Hollywood artists.</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has surpassed Modelo Especial to become the best-selling beer in the United States, according to recent sales data. This shift marks a significant comeback for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot to Modelo two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline is attributed to challenges faced by its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reduced spending from its core Hispanic consumer base, which has been impacted by current immigration policies.</p>

Gold tends to perform well during periods of low interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, and central bank purchases have further supported demand. For individual investors, experts generally recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than owning physical bullion, due to lower costs and higher liquidity.

          <p>Multiple UK charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and Julia's House, have dropped Sarah Ferguson as a patron. The decisions follow the publication of a 2011 email in which the Duchess of York referred to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "steadfast, generous and supreme friend." A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent to assuage Epstein after he threatened to sue her for defamation, and that she regrets her association with him.</p>

          <p>A new deal has been proposed to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, placing the app's American operations under a new joint venture controlled by U.S. investors.

The agreement is designed as a compromise to satisfy legal requirements in both the U.S. and China, aiming to secure the app for its 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Google is back in federal court for a second major antitrust trial brought by the Department of Justice, this time focusing on its digital advertising technology. The trial follows a judge's prior ruling that parts of Google's ad-tech business constitute an illegal monopoly that harms online publishers. The current proceedings will determine the "remedy," with the DOJ advocating for Google to be forced to sell off parts of its ad business to restore competition, a measure the company argues is disruptive and unnecessary.</p>

Researchers emphasize that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with strong genetic roots, involving hundreds of gene variants rather than a single cause. The rise in diagnoses is largely attributed to broader diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and better screening methods, not exposure to a single medication. The claim that vaccines cause autism has also been repeatedly and thoroughly debunked by extensive research.</p>
