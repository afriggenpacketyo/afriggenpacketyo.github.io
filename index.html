          <p>President Trump announced the 2025 Kennedy Center Honorees, which include George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, and the band KISS, and confirmed he will host the awards ceremony. The announcement comes after months of increased White House influence over the cultural institution, including the replacement of board members and leadership. Trump stated his administration has reversed the center's decline and is working to restore its glamour and quality, while also mentioning plans to renovate the venue and address crime in Washington, D.C.

          <p>In a thrilling conclusion to a match in The Hundred cricket tournament, Graham Clark hit a six on the very last ball to secure a narrow three-wicket win for the Northern Superchargers over the Southern Brave. Needing five runs for victory, Clark struck the decisive blow against bowler Tymal Mills, turning a tense finale into a moment of celebration. The outcome was uncertain until the final moments, especially after a strong preceding set of balls from Jofra Archer had put the Southern Brave in a favorable position. Clark's clutch performance was the deciding factor in the dramatic game.</p>

          <p>Tom Dundon, the owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, has reached a tentative agreement to acquire the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers from the estate of late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. While the financial terms were not disclosed, recent valuations placed the team's worth at $3.65 billion. Dundon, a businessman with a growing portfolio of sports properties including professional pickleball leagues, would take over from Allen's sister, Jody Allen, who has managed the team since 2018. The sale is pending approval from the NBA, following a previous rejected offer from Nike co-founder Phil Knight in 2022.</p>

          <p>Two new studies published in JAMA suggest a potential link between popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, and an increased risk of serious eye conditions for individuals with type 2 diabetes. One study found a modest association with a rare condition causing sudden vision loss, while another noted a small increase in diabetic retinopathy. Researchers recommend regular eye screenings for diabetic patients using these medications. Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic, stated that its own data does not suggest a causal relationship between its drugs and these rare eye conditions.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is standing by its economic analysis which concluded that consumers will ultimately bear about two-thirds of the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs, despite direct criticism from President Trump. An economist from the firm publicly defended the research, stating that if recent tariffs follow past patterns, they will contribute to inflation later in the year. The forecast prompted a social media post from the president suggesting the bank's CEO should hire a new economist. The firm's analysis is consistent with findings from other economists on the impact of import duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mother, father, and their child were tragically killed in East Ridge, Tennessee, when a large tree, destabilized by saturated ground, fell onto their car during a period of intense rainfall and flooding. The region has been inundated with over six inches of rain, leading to widespread flash floods and prompting dozens of water rescues for people trapped in homes and vehicles. A local state of emergency was declared in Hamilton County as authorities warned of more rain. The severe weather has also led to a search for a man who went missing in the floodwaters.</p>

A significant challenge is the high failure rate at the Federal Aviation Administration's sole training facility, where approximately 35% of trainees do not complete the intensive course. In response, the FAA is implementing mentoring programs, streamlining its application process, and installing modern tower simulators to improve training outcomes.

In a 2-1 decision, the D.C. Circuit court ruled that the nonprofit organizations who sued the administration did not have the legal standing to bring the case under the Impoundment Control Act. This procedural ruling sidesteps the core constitutional question of whether the executive branch can withhold funds appropriated by Congress.

          <p>Advocacy group The Senior Citizens League has released a new forecast predicting that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries received this year. The official COLA is determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall using inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has been moderate in 2025, some economists worry that a modest COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Russia, stating there would be 'severe consequences' if President Vladimir Putin does not agree to end the war in Ukraine during their upcoming summit in Alaska. Trump did not specify the nature of these consequences but made the comments after a virtual conference with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, stating that Putin is 'bluffing' about peace and that continued pressure is needed. The summit is being closely watched by allies who are coordinating on security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis, using maps of the frontlines, examines the territorial complexities at the heart of the upcoming Trump-Putin summit on Ukraine. Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and significant portions of four other regions. The article explores potential ceasefire scenarios, such as Russia demanding full control of the Donbas, which would require Ukraine to cede heavily fortified cities. This sober analysis highlights the vast and painful concessions Kyiv might face in any territorial swap, a possibility that has caused alarm in Ukraine and Europe.</p>

The thinktank's 'TdA Activity Monitor' contained multiple entries of nonexistent crimes, seemingly to bolster the narrative that the Venezuelan government is using the gang to destabilize the U.S. This occurs as the Trump administration has designated TdA a terrorist organization and intensified pressure on Venezuela, despite U.S. intelligence agencies expressing doubt about the gang's connection to the state.</p>

          <p>Data from analytics firm Similarweb indicates that traffic to the most popular pornography websites in the United Kingdom has fallen significantly since new age verification rules were enforced on July 25. Under the Online Safety Act, sites must implement advanced checks to prevent minors from accessing explicit material. Pornhub, the UK's top adult site, saw its daily visitor numbers drop by 47% in the two weeks following the change. While compliant sites have seen a decrease, the data also suggests a corresponding increase in traffic to smaller, less-regulated sites.</p>

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has warned that any decisions made without Ukraine's participation will not lead to peace. Analysts believe Russia's fundamental demands for Ukraine's surrender have not changed and that any agreement reached in Alaska will be difficult to implement without European and Ukrainian consent. The prevailing view is that while talks are happening, a meaningful breakthrough that satisfies Ukraine's sovereignty is unlikely.</p>
