          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition in parliament, reflecting a broader trend of far-right gains in Europe. This marks a significant shift in Portuguese politics, where traditional center-right and center-left parties have historically dominated. Chega's rise, securing 60 of 230 seats, is attributed to its hardline stance on immigration and the failure of traditional parties to form stable governments. The party's success mirrors similar gains by far-right groups in France, Italy, and Germany, signaling a potential reshaping of the European political landscape.</p>

After enduring broken bones, concussions, and multiple operations, Marquez left Honda, his team of 11 years, to join Gresini Racing. Now leading the championship standings and racing for the factory Ducati team, Marquez has silenced doubts about his ability to compete at the highest level. His resurgence marks a remarkable turnaround, positioning him to potentially equal Valentino Rossi's record with a ninth world title.</p>

          <p>German defense company Renk is seeking skilled workers from the struggling automotive industry to meet growing demand driven by rising geopolitical tensions and increased military spending.

This cross-industry collaboration allows Renk to capitalize on the automotive sector's expertise in areas like continuous improvement and efficiency.

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs. This decision, which the Trump administration is appealing, asserts that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce. The ruling has caused market volatility and uncertainty, but also raised questions about the limits of executive power in trade matters. (not investment advice)</p>

It highlights the story of Edan Alexander, an American Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas, and notes that an estimated 23,380 American citizens currently serve in Israeli ranks. The article discusses the social apparatus through which young Americans are radicalized, including Zionist summer camps, and contrasts this with the scrutiny Muslim communities face. The author calls for greater attention to the radicalization of young Zionist men and women, particularly in light of the ongoing conflict in Palestine.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand before the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of additional tariffs, Toyota has stated it will not pass on the cost to consumers, though analysts anticipate pressure to do so long-term. The automaker projects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government is considering sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, in response to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This reflects a hardening of Britain's stance toward Israel's conduct in the war, although the recent shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington has caused some hesitation. The UK is likely to assess whether Israel will allow a measurable increase in aid to Gaza before making a decision.

          <p>The tragic story of Joshlin Smith, a South African girl allegedly sold by her mother, has evoked tears and heartbreak during a court hearing. Joshlin's mother, Racquel Smith, was convicted of kidnapping and trafficking her daughter, and victim impact statements revealed the pain and bewilderment of those who knew Joshlin. Witnesses testified that Smith may have sold her daughter to a traditional healer for her eyes and skin. The case has drawn comparisons to the Madeleine McCann case, highlighting the ongoing crisis of child trafficking in South Africa.</p>

          <p>Despite legal guarantees and pressure from international bodies, racial segregation persists in schools in Slovakia, where over 60% of Roma children attend schools where they are in the majority. Roma children are often separated into "Roma schools" or "Roma classes" with lower academic expectations and higher dropout rates. The Slovak government initially denied discriminatory treatment but has since acknowledged the issue and introduced reforms, including a legal definition of segregation. However, critics argue that these measures often reinforce segregation, calling for diverse classrooms and early support to end this systemic issue.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's approach to conflict, using the situation with Harvard University as an example. Trump believes that if he attacks someone or something, it is their fault, not his. He seeks to make an example of those who push back against him, aiming to crush opponents and send a message that dissent will not be tolerated. This zero-sum approach is consistent with Trump's worldview, where he cannot win without someone else losing. The administration's aggressive pressure campaign against Harvard reflects this pattern.</p>

The dispute stems from claims by Sony that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals and that budget cuts within CBS have hindered the shows' support.</p>

The decision could affect many of the approximately 280,000 Chinese students in the U.S. and is likely to strain the bilateral relationship.
