        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, paid leave is only available for pregnancy loss after the 24-week mark. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people essential time to grieve without needing to use sick leave. Campaigners and politicians have praised the move as a significant step forward in recognizing early-stage pregnancy loss as a true bereavement, helping to address a long-held societal taboo.</p>

          <p>Tesla's share price experienced a significant downturn amid investor anxiety that CEO Elon Musk's new political venture, the "America party," could harm the company's brand and distract him from his duties. The pre-market drop of over 7% threatened to erase approximately $70 billion from Tesla's valuation. Analysts suggest that Musk's increasing involvement in politics, especially following a contentious relationship with Donald Trump, is creating exhaustion among shareholders who prefer he focus on the electric car business during a critical period. This move has intensified fears about potential political blowback against Musk's companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Scottish paramedic, Stephen Doohan, has been sentenced to over 10 years in prison for secretly giving a pregnant woman an abortion drug, which caused the death of their unborn child. Doohan, who was married at the time, administered the drug by injecting the woman at his home after learning she was pregnant with his baby. He pleaded guilty to assault, sexual assault, and causing an abortion, with the judge noting he had subjected his victim to a lifetime of pain and loss. The case involved Doohan initially denying his actions before admitting he was "scared."</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has completed the deportation of eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a nation none of them are from and which the State Department warns against visiting. The men, originally from countries including Cuba, Mexico, and Vietnam, were the subject of a prolonged legal battle that ended when federal judges, citing Supreme Court orders, allowed the deportation to proceed. The Trump administration hailed the action as a victory for national security, while human rights advocates condemned it as a punitive and unconstitutional act that could expose the men to danger.</p>

          <p>Health experts suggest that exercising in the morning can be particularly effective for weight loss, but only if it is balanced with adequate sleep. Research indicates that individuals who work out between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. tend to have a lower BMI and smaller waist size. However, wellness professionals emphasize that sacrificing sleep for an early workout can be counterproductive, as rest is crucial for muscle recovery and overall progress. They advise that getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep is essential for the body to repair and for a fitness routine to be truly successful.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles' Skid Row, a new care campus is embracing harm reduction principles to tackle the intertwined crises of homelessness and addiction, a stark contrast to the tougher, more punitive approaches gaining favor elsewhere. The facility provides not only addiction treatment and housing services but also clean syringes, drug testing strips, and naloxone for those not ready to quit using drugs. Proponents argue this evidence-based approach saves lives, prevents the spread of disease, and builds trust that can eventually lead individuals toward recovery. This initiative places Los Angeles at odds with a national trend toward forced treatment and criminalization.</p>

          <p>Amid growing claims from social media influencers and public figures that seed oils are harmful, nutrition scientists are clarifying the existing evidence. Critics argue that oils like canola and soybean are inflammatory due to their omega-6 fatty acid content and refining processes, but many researchers disagree. They point to numerous studies showing that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats from seed oils improves health outcomes, such as lowering bad cholesterol. Experts largely agree that the main issue is not the oils themselves but their prevalence in ultra-processed foods, recommending a focus on a balanced diet rich in whole foods instead.</p>

The announcement came as the bloc of developing nations, including China, Russia, and India, held a summit and issued a statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures. Trump did not specify which policies he considered "anti-American," but the move escalates global trade tensions and appears to be a direct response to the BRICS group's push against a U.S.-led world order. This threat adds another layer of uncertainty to the administration's ongoing tariff strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The owners of a pet lion have been arrested in Lahore, Pakistan, after the animal escaped from a farmhouse, jumped a wall, and attacked a woman and her two young children. The victims sustained injuries but are reported to be in stable condition. Security footage captured the moment the lion pounced on the woman before being chased away by its owner. Police later tracked down and arrested three people who had gone into hiding with the lion, which has since been transferred to wildlife authorities. The incident highlights the dangerous and controversial practice of keeping wild cats as status symbols in Pakistan.</p>

          <p>In an unexpected move, Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Transport Minister Roman Starovoit after just over a year in the position. The decree gave no reason for the firing, but it comes as Russia's transport sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of aviation parts and financial strain on its national railway due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Andrei Nikitin, a former regional governor, has been appointed as the acting minister. Sources suggest Starovoit's dismissal may be linked to corruption scandals in the Kursk region, which he previously governed, rather than specific transport-related issues.</p>

Palestinian sources reported that the Israeli delegation lacked the authority to reach a final agreement, while Israel maintains that Hamas is requesting unacceptable changes to the proposed deal. The talks occurred as Israel began the controversial process of issuing military conscription notices to thousands of previously exempt ultra-Orthodox Jewish men, a move that could destabilize Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition government.

          <p>The flavor and composition of chocolate vary significantly across the globe, shaped by regional tastes and regulations. In the United States, chocolate is often characterized by a higher sugar content and the use of butyric acid, giving it a distinct tangy flavor and long shelf life. In contrast, European chocolate, particularly from Switzerland and Belgium, is known for its creamy texture and high cocoa content, governed by stricter production rules. Meanwhile, emerging markets in India and Africa are developing their own unique chocolate cultures, with Indian cocoa noted for its fruity profile and Japan famous for unconventional flavors like wasabi.</p>

While the deal provides a significant short-term boost for Comac's production and European market ambitions, experts caution that previous U.S. restrictions have likely strengthened Beijing's resolve to accelerate the development of its own indigenous engine technology.
