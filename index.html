In his announcement, Trump emphasized his trust in Gor to represent his agenda in a crucial region. The nomination is now pending confirmation by the U.S. Senate, during which Gor will continue his current duties.</p>

          <p>Widely shared photos on social media show deer with alarming, bulbous warts, which wildlife experts identify as cutaneous fibromas. These skin tumors are caused by a papillomavirus that is common in deer populations and is typically spread through insect bites or direct contact. While the growths may look severe, they are usually harmless and do not affect the animal's overall health unless their size or location interferes with its ability to see, eat, or move. The meat of an affected deer is considered safe to eat.</p>

Over 40 other passengers were transported to regional hospitals to be treated for a range of injuries, from broken bones to head trauma, in what one medical officer described as a mass trauma event.</p>

          <p>Following the FBI raid on his former national security adviser's home, President Trump stated he was unaware of the planned search and learned about it from news reports. He used the opportunity to publicly criticize John Bolton, calling him a "lowlife" and questioning his patriotism. Vice President J.D. Vance defended the administration, denying that the raid was politically motivated and asserting that the law is driving the determination. Trump indicated he expected to be briefed on the matter by the Justice Department later.</p>

Democrats have fiercely opposed the map, with one state senator planning to filibuster the final vote, and swift legal challenges are anticipated on the grounds that it illegally diminishes the influence of minority voters.</p>

This trend is visible in voting patterns, where parties like the Greens poll better with young women, while right-leaning parties like Reform UK draw more support from young men. Researchers suggest factors such as differing views on feminism, higher rates of university education among women, and the influence of social media algorithms are contributing to this political polarization.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is close to finalizing a series of new media rights deals that will redistribute its games across multiple platforms. Under the proposed terms, NBC would acquire Sunday night games, Netflix would get the Home Run Derby, and ESPN would secure a new package including local team rights and the league's out-of-market streaming service. This move diversifies MLB's broadcast partners beyond traditional television, creating new relationships with major streaming players and reflecting a shift in the sports media landscape.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is moving to strip thousands of its employees of their collective bargaining rights, following a broader Trump administration effort to weaken federal unions. The action affects staff at key public health agencies, including the CDC and FDA. A union representing the employees has called the move illegal and argues that it undermines the stability of a workforce that is already reeling from recent mass layoffs and a shooting attack at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters.</p>
