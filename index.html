          <p>As the deadline approaches for potential tariff increases between the EU and the US, the EU is actively seeking to intensify trade negotiations, drawing lessons from recent deals struck between the US and China and the UK. Despite pressure from the Trump administration, which views Europe as 'nastier' than China in trade practices, the EU aims to avoid escalating tensions while remaining open to negotiation. The EU is carefully balancing the need for unity among its 27 member states with the economic pressures that could result from increased tariffs, considering countermeasures on US goods if necessary, while recognizing the US as a key market for EU services exports.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg reflects on the Democratic Party's delayed acknowledgement of Joe Biden's declining health and the implications for the party's future. She argues that the party's 'original sin' was a tendency toward groupthink and risk aversion, which led to a disastrous misstep in paving the way for Donald Trump's return. While some blame Biden's inner circle for shielding him, Goldberg suggests that many Democrats were lying to themselves, trapped in a Washington bubble that prevented them from recognizing the extent of Biden's infirmity. The article emphasizes the need for honesty and courage within the party to address these failures and chart a new course.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations are actively seeking discussions with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to navigate potential tariffs, as the deadline for a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs approaches. Many countries, initially planning to send lower-level officials, are now dispatching ministers to push for meetings with Greer, underscoring the urgency surrounding the looming July 9 deadline.

          <p>Jay Shah's appointment as chairman of the International Cricket Council has amplified India's influence in global cricket, sparking concerns about the sport's governance and equity. India's financial strength, political connections, and media control through the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the Indian Premier League, which generates a significant portion of the ICC's revenue, enable it to shape tournament schedules and media rights. The intertwining of Indian politics and cricket governance, exemplified by the exclusion of Pakistani players and IPL scheduling influenced by political events, raises questions about the ICC's neutrality and the game's diversity, particularly affecting smaller cricketing nations.</p>

While approval ratings are generally lower in the current era, concerns persist regarding Trump's economic performance, particularly on trade and inflation.

          <p>President Trump's criticism of 'activist' judges is not new, as past presidents have also accused courts of overreach. The term 'judicial activism,' coined in 1947, describes judges who base rulings on personal policy views rather than legal interpretation. Criticism has come from both sides of the political spectrum, with presidents like Roosevelt and Nixon challenging court decisions. Trump's approach marks a highly politicized phase, where judicial rulings are frequently contested, prompting responses from Chief Justice Roberts defending judicial independence and highlighting the ongoing debate over the role of the courts.</p>

Experts recommend overcoming impostor syndrome by recognizing there's no right or wrong way to be queer. Narrowing down interests, whether it's shared racial identity, hobbies, or values, can help find the right fit. Attending events with a friend or creating a new space if existing ones don't resonate can also be beneficial. Trusting the process and seeking connections online or through literature are additional ways to build community, as queer and trans people have always been present and will continue to be.</p>

Judge Rodriguez used historical context to argue that the term 'invasion' refers to military force, not migration.

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, driven by investors seeking safe havens amidst President Trump's tariff policies. Overseas investors bought 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of assets, the largest monthly inflow since 1996, as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield spiked while Japan's 10-year yield fell. With the U.S. softening its trade stance and striking deals, confidence in U.S. assets is getting restored, raising questions about the sustainability of the inflows into Japanese assets, which are generally considered a haven in times of economic uncertainty.</p>
