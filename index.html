          <p>Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, revealed plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, creating over 12,000 jobs and expanding its research and manufacturing capabilities. The investment, prompted by concerns about potential tariffs on pharma goods, will focus on R&D sites in Massachusetts for AI research and cardiovascular treatments, as well as bolstering manufacturing facilities across multiple states. This move follows similar investments by Novartis and AstraZeneca, indicating a broader trend among pharmaceutical companies to strengthen their U.S. presence amidst trade policy uncertainties. The investment is expected to increase U.S. medicine exports upon completion.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a sharp decline after President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates. Trump's remarks exacerbated market turmoil already fueled by tariff concerns and fears of an economic slowdown. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all saw significant losses, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022, as investors sought safe-haven assets like gold, which hit a record high. This situation underscores the tension between the executive branch and the traditionally independent Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>China's CATL, the world's largest EV battery supplier, announced its second-generation Shenxing battery, claiming it can add 520 km (323 miles) of driving range with just five minutes of charging. This announcement challenges BYD's recent claim of adding 400 km of range in the same amount of time, positioning CATL ahead of Western competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in charging speed. If proven feasible on a larger scale, this technology could significantly alleviate consumer concerns about EV range and charging convenience, accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Chinese-funded e-commerce sites Temu and Shein are planning to raise prices for U.S. customers due to increased operating costs resulting from President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The companies cited changes in global trade rules and tariffs as the reason for the price adjustments, set to take effect on April 25. Trump's decision to eliminate the 'de minimis' exemption for goods under $800 from China and Hong Kong, subjecting them to a 145% import tax, has significantly impacted the business models of these platforms, which have gained popularity by offering extremely low-priced products.</p>

This proposal comes after previous ceasefire attempts failed, with both sides blaming each other. Hamas has signaled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed upon Palestinian entity, showing "unprecedented flexibility," though Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar fell below 140 yen on Tuesday, marking the first time it has done so since September 2024, following President Donald Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. The dollar's decline also reflects speculation that the U.S. administration will urge Japan to address the yen's weakness during upcoming finance chief meetings. Trump's remarks have raised concerns about the central bank's independence, leading to selling pressure on the U.S. currency.</p>
