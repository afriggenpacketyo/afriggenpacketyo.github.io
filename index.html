          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has significantly reduced its economic growth forecast, citing the impact of trade policies, particularly U.S. tariffs, on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The central bank now expects Japan's economy to grow by only 0.5% in the current fiscal year, a sharp decrease from the previous forecast of 1.1%. This revision reflects growing concerns about the global economic slowdown caused by trade tensions. The BOJ also decided to maintain its current interest rates, highlighting the challenges in reverting to conventional monetary policies amid tariff-induced economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, announced that Chinese online retailers are reducing their advertising spending on Facebook and Instagram due to President Trump's trade policies. This reduction is likely in response to the impending end of the de minimis trade exemptions for Chinese imports, which benefited retailers like Temu and Shein. While some of the advertising spend has been redirected to other markets, overall spending from these advertisers is lower than previous levels. Meta anticipates second-quarter revenue to be in line with expectations, but acknowledges potential headwinds to its advertising business, echoing similar warnings from Google and Snap.</p>

          <p>A Maryland judge has denied the Trump administration's request for another extension to provide information on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis accused the administration of a "bad faith refusal" to answer questions and ordered them to respond to all outstanding discovery requests. Senator Chris Van Hollen has also criticized the administration and called for Abrego Garcia's return, emphasizing the importance of due process. The Trump administration maintains that Abrego Garcia is an El Salvador citizen and is accused of gang membership, which his lawyers deny.</p>

This agreement, reached after months of negotiations, aims to give President Trump a personal stake in Ukraine's fate and address his concerns about U.S. financial support. The deal does not include explicit guarantees of future U.S. security assistance. It is intended to signal to Russia the Trump administration's commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine, while also preventing those who supported the Russian war effort from benefiting from Ukraine's reconstruction.</p>
