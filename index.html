          <h2>Singapore Inflation Remains Low Amid Upcoming Election</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at four-year lows in March, with the consumer price index increasing by 0.9% year-on-year, primarily driven by rising food and private transport costs. The monetary authority had already eased policy for the second time in April due to the possibility of zero growth this year after a lower-than-expected GDP expansion in the first quarter. This inflation reading arrives as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living pressures as a significant concern due to global conflicts and supply chain disruptions. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, reflecting declines in manufacturing and some service sectors.</p>

          <p>London will host a new round of talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in the three-year war between Ukraine and Russia, involving diplomats from the UK, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the US. These talks occur amidst speculation that Russia might be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in exchange for significant concessions, including US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea. Ukrainian President Zelensky has stated that no such proposals have been shared with him and he rejects recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Despite Putin's claim of an Easter weekend ceasefire, British military intelligence found no evidence of a reduction in attacks.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire in New Jersey has expanded to 8,500 acres, causing over 3,000 evacuations and threatening more than 1,300 structures, while also closing a portion of the Garden State Highway. The fire started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area of Ocean County, with only 10% containment. No injuries have been reported, but several businesses have burned, and over 26,000 customers are experiencing power outages. The fire comes as New Jersey is under an official drought warning, exacerbating the situation, with winds expected to decrease later in the week.</p>

          <p>Six major policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry have united to lobby the Trump administration against the implementation of 25% tariffs on auto parts, scheduled to take effect by May 3.

They anticipate a drop in vehicle sales, higher prices, and increased costs across the industry, and support domestic manufacturing but note that global supply chains cannot be rerouted quickly.</p>

The FDA intends to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes. The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives. This initiative follows concerns about potential health risks associated with synthetic dyes, including links to ADHD, obesity, and cancer, though scientific evidence remains debated.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is facing challenges due to the US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to concerns about price competition. Higher tariffs are expected to impact exports to the US, potentially causing a reduction in capital expenditure by producers and a slower expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS). The sector is also struggling with overproduction and a price war, which has resulted in a significant drop in export prices. With exports to its biggest market in the US likely to be hit by higher tariffs, the nation’s producers are projected to trim their capital expenditure by 10 to 20 per cent this year.</p>
