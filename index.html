          <p>Hurricane Priscilla, now a Category 2 storm, is weakening as it moves parallel to Mexico's Pacific coast. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for parts of Baja California Sur. While the storm is expected to stay offshore, it is generating large swells that could cause life-threatening surf, rip currents, and some coastal flooding in southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula. The storm currently has sustained winds of 100 mph and is located about 190 miles from the southern tip of Baja California.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have intercepted a nine-boat flotilla carrying activists and what organizers claim was over $110,000 in aid for Gaza's hospitals. The Israeli Foreign Ministry described the effort as futile and confirmed the passengers were safe and would be deported. This incident follows the recent seizure of another flotilla that included climate activist Greta Thunberg. Flotilla organizers dispute Israel's claims about the lack of aid on the previous boats and assert that Israel has no legal authority to detain international volunteers in international waters.</p>

          <p>A driver, Anthony Tregonning, who seriously injured a road worker during a high-speed police chase, has been sentenced to over three years in prison. After striking Ieuan Parry, who later had a leg amputated, Tregonning fled the scene and falsely reported his modified Mitsubishi Evo as stolen, attempting to blame his ex-partner. However, Ring doorbell footage captured him leaving in the car just before the incident, unraveling his cover-up. Tregonning admitted to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice.</p>

          <p>A recent report from career site Indeed indicates that generative AI could "radically transform" about 26% of jobs, particularly affecting white-collar roles in technology and finance that rely on cognitive reasoning. While some companies have already announced AI-related workforce reductions, economists note that widespread disruption has not yet occurred and many effects remain speculative. The debate continues whether AI will primarily automate jobs, making workers obsolete, or augment them, increasing productivity. For now, most industries are adopting a hybrid model where human oversight remains essential.</p>

          <p>A new trend among Gen Z, known as "locking in," involves periods of intense focus on personal goals, often related to health, finance, or self-improvement. Originating from sports and gaming culture, the trend has become a social media phenomenon, seen as a reaction against the constant distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties facing the generation. While some critics view it as a performative act of productivity, others see it as a coping mechanism for navigating a world with diminished economic security and the psychological effects of the pandemic.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament has approved a proposal to prohibit the use of terms like "burger" and "sausage" for plant-based food products, a move championed by some center-right members to prevent consumer confusion and protect culinary traditions. The decision has faced significant opposition from Green Party members, consumer protection groups, and major supermarkets, who argue that consumers are not misled by labels like "veggie burger." Critics label the move as lobbying for the meat industry that could stifle innovation in the growing plant-based market, with the final decision now resting with EU heads of state.</p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have been deployed to an Army Reserve Training Center in a Chicago suburb, a move authorized by President Trump and confirmed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the deployment, calling it an inappropriate use of military troops against American communities and vowing to resist what he terms a "power grab." Chicago's mayor also criticized the action, accusing the Trump administration of intentionally fomenting chaos in the city.

          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating former FBI Director James Comey for making false statements to Congress have reportedly concluded that their central witness could be "problematic" for their case. According to sources, law professor Daniel Richman, whom prosecutors allege Comey authorized to leak information, told investigators that Comey never instructed him to do so and in fact advised against engaging with the media. This testimony is detailed in a memo that recommended against charging Comey, though a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney proceeded with the indictment anyway. The revelations suggest the prosecution faces significant hurdles ahead of Comey's arraignment.</p>

          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, has stated that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat. This designation became a necessary legal threshold following a precedent set in another spying case earlier this year. Despite months of requests, prosecutors could not obtain witness statements from the government that met this standard, leading to the charges being dropped. The situation has drawn criticism and sparked debate over the UK government's official stance on China.</p>

However, within the shrinking pool of applicants, there is a growing trend towards using adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). The share of ARM applications increased as borrowers seek lower initial interest rates, with the average 5/1 ARM rate being nearly a full percentage point below that of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. This shift indicates that homebuyers and refinancers are willing to take on more long-term risk to achieve immediate savings in a high-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article from NPR's Planet Money team explains the crucial role that preorders play in the publishing industry while promoting their own new book. Preorders are a key metric for booksellers when deciding on promotion, such as prominent store placement and website visibility, as they signal strong potential customer interest. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which significantly increases a book's chance of debuting on a bestseller list and creating a snowball effect of further sales. This insight reveals how early consumer support can be instrumental in determining a new book's market trajectory and ultimate success.</p>

          <p>Mexican prosecutors have opened an investigation into a group of soldiers involved in the fatal shooting of six civilians on a highway in the northern state of Tamaulipas. The defense ministry stated that the soldiers opened fire after a pickup truck attempted to ram one of their vehicles, which they perceived as a threat. The state is known for frequent and violent clashes involving drug cartels. This incident adds to a history of accusations of extrajudicial killings by security forces in the region, including a case last year where four soldiers were convicted for killing five civilians.</p>

          <p>Wharton professor and AI expert Ethan Mollick advised human resources leaders at a CNBC summit to be wary of predictions about AI's impact on the job market, bluntly stating that "no one knows anything." He emphasized that even top AI research labs are uncertain about the technology's ultimate use cases and effects on employment. Mollick suggested that instead of relying on predictions, leaders should encourage widespread, hands-on experimentation with AI tools like ChatGPT to discover their practical applications organically. He warned that simply automating tasks without imagination would be a mistake, and urged leaders to use the technology themselves to understand its potential.</p>

          <p>An attack by Myanmar's military has killed at least 24 people and wounded 47 others at a gathering in the central Sagaing region. According to a spokesperson for the government-in-exile, an army-operated motorized paraglider dropped two bombs on a crowd of about 100 people who were protesting military conscription. The Sagaing region is a major battleground in the ongoing civil war, with large areas controlled by anti-junta resistance forces. This attack is part of what Amnesty International calls a "disturbing trend" of the military using paramotors for airstrikes amid a bloody campaign to regain control.</p>

These are molecular constructions with large, porous structures that allow gases and other chemicals to flow through them. The Nobel committee highlighted the enormous potential of MOFs for a wide range of applications, including harvesting water from desert air, capturing carbon dioxide, and storing toxic gases. The laureates' research, which began in the late 1980s, has opened up new possibilities for creating custom-made materials with novel functions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law, Assembly Bill 628, that will mandate landlords to include a working refrigerator and stove in their rental properties. Authored by Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, the bill reclassifies these appliances from "amenities" to necessities required for a unit to be considered habitable. The law, which applies to new leases starting January 1, 2026, aims to ease the financial burden on tenants, who often face significant upfront costs when moving. This change brings these essential appliances in line with other required standards like heating and running water.</p>

This plan calls for using professional hunters on the ground, a change from a previous, highly controversial proposal to shoot the deer from helicopters. Despite the change in method, the plan is again facing opposition from community members and L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who call it inhumane and question the deer's impact on fire risk.
