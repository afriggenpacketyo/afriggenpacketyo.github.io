          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has lifted export controls on chip-design software for China, a move communicated to major firms like Siemens, Synopsys, and Cadence. These companies, which dominate the electronic design automation market, are now resuming sales and support to Chinese customers. This reversal follows a tightening of restrictions in May and is seen as a sign of a potential trade truce between the two nations, occurring after China signaled progress in resuming some technology exchanges.

          <p>This opinion article argues that PBS and NPR exhibit a strong left-wing bias, particularly in their coverage of Donald Trump. The author cites a PBS NewsHour segment on a CBS News lawsuit as recent evidence and contends that this perceived partisanship validates Republican efforts to eliminate their federal funding. The piece suggests that these outlets have failed to provide unbiased news and have instead become a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party. The author concludes that taxpayers should no longer be required to fund what they describe as fake news.</p>

          <p>Authorities on the Greek island of Crete have ordered the evacuation of thousands of people, including about 5,000 tourists, due to large, uncontrolled wildfires. The fires, which began near Ierapetra, are being fueled by gale-force winds, making containment extremely difficult for the hundreds of firefighters deployed. Residents from four villages have been evacuated, and many tourists have been moved to temporary shelters like a local sports venue. This event highlights the high risk of wildfires that Greece faces during its hot, dry summers, with numerous blazes already tackled across the country this year.</p>

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries conducted a marathon speech on the House floor, speaking for over seven hours to delay the final vote on President Trump's major tax and spending bill. Using a procedural tactic known as a "magic minute," Jeffries vehemently criticized the legislation, labeling it an "immoral document" and an "assault on the healthcare of the American people." He argued the bill's deep cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP would harm children, seniors, and everyday Americans, while primarily benefiting the wealthy. His speech aimed to highlight Democratic opposition and draw national attention to the bill's controversial provisions.</p>

          <p>As families prepare for the 2025-26 academic year, a key decision is whether to use federal or private student loans. Federal undergraduate loan rates are fixed at 6.39%, available to all borrowers regardless of credit history and offering protections like income-driven repayment plans. In contrast, private lenders are advertising variable rates as low as 3.2%, which could offer substantial savings for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer. However, private loan rates can be higher for those with weaker credit and lack federal protections, making a careful comparison of options essential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some conservative House Republicans who initially opposed President Trump's major spending bill ultimately voted to advance it after receiving personal assurances from the president. Lawmakers like Rep. Ralph Norman stated that Trump promised future changes, potentially through executive action, to address their concerns, particularly regarding wind and solar tax credits they wanted to eliminate. Despite no changes being made to the legislative text, these promises were enough to secure their support. This highlights the president's direct influence in whipping votes and ensuring the passage of his key domestic policy agenda.</p>

          <p>According to newly released FDA records, top officials appointed by the Trump administration overrode the agency's career scientists to limit the approval of COVID-19 vaccines from Novavax and Moderna. Dr. Vinay Prasad, who replaced the former head of the vaccine regulation center, argued in a memo that the risk-benefit calculation for the shots had changed, justifying a narrower approval for at-risk populations only. This decision went against the initial conclusions of the FDA's scientific review team, which had recommended broader approval.

          <p>In a court hearing for Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, the lead prosecutor revealed key evidence. Investigators used a Q-tip from his parents' trash to obtain a familial DNA match to a sample found on a knife sheath at the crime scene. The summary also detailed how Kohberger's cell phone pinged near the victims' home multiple times before the attack and how he meticulously cleaned his car and apartment afterward. While these details explain how the case was solved, the motive for the killings remains unknown.</p>

          <p>The Isle of Wight rock band Wet Leg is releasing their sophomore album, "Moisturizer," marking a significant evolution in their sound and image since their Grammy-winning debut. In an interview, frontwoman Rhian Teasdale discusses moving past the bohemian style of their early days, embracing a more authentic self-expression. She describes the new album as more sonically expressive and raw, heavily influenced by her experience of falling in love. The album, which the band says was made to be played live, retains their signature tongue-in-cheek humor while exploring more emotionally vulnerable themes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed continued resilience by adding 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and slightly improving on May's figures. The unemployment rate also ticked down to 4.1%. Job gains were concentrated in state government and healthcare, while the federal government continued to shed positions. This strength comes despite ongoing economic uncertainty from the Trump administration's trade policies and tariffs. The White House has downplayed the economic impact of the tariffs, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has cited them as a key reason for not lowering interest rates.

The bill also expands benefits for investors in qualified small businesses and makes the higher estate tax exemption permanent.

          <p>A Maryland man has been charged with a felony after allegedly trying to bring a "ghost gun" into the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill. The firearm, which lacked a serial number and is untraceable, was detected by security when the man's bag went through an X-ray machine. The suspect told police he had forgotten the gun was in his bag. This incident is the latest in a series of more than 20 arrests for unlawful firearms possession on Capitol grounds this year, highlighting ongoing security challenges at the complex.</p>

          <h2>Retailers Express Relief and Concern Over New 20% Tariff Rate on Vietnamese Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 11:53:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. retail industry has reacted with mixed feelings to the announcement that tariffs on Vietnamese imports will be set at 20%. While this is a significant relief compared to the originally proposed 46% rate, executives remain concerned that the new duty, double the current 10%, will still negatively impact businesses and consumers. Vietnam has become a crucial manufacturing hub for apparel and footwear companies seeking to reduce reliance on China. Many companies now plan to raise prices to offset the increased costs, which could dampen consumer spending in the long run. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Retail Thefts in Germany Reach Record Levels in 2024, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 11:52:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) indicates that shoplifting reached a record high in 2024, with estimated losses of nearly â‚¬5 billion. The study suggests that theft by customers, employees, and delivery workers accounts for the vast majority of these losses. Retailers report a rise in organized shoplifting, where groups coordinate to steal high-value items like cosmetics and electronics. Criminologists note that many of these are "poverty crimes" committed by people with no money, though the EHI study suggests opportunistic theft by non-poor individuals is also a significant factor.</p>
