          <p>A Lending Tree study reveals nearly 6 million U.S. full-time workers earned over $100,000 in 2023 without a four-year college degree, challenging traditional career paths. Occupations like software development, sales engineering, and elevator repair were among 20 fields where at least 40% of non-graduates achieved six-figure salaries. This trend reflects a growing skepticism about the value and cost of higher education, with some companies loosening degree requirements. The article highlights that starting one's own business also offers a significant avenue for high earnings without a college diploma.</p>

          <p>Dino Guglielmelli, a wealthy supplement company founder, was convicted of attempted murder after trying to hire a hitman to kill his estranged model wife, Monica Olsen, during their contentious divorce. The plot unraveled when his associate, Rick Fuhrmann, instead reported the scheme to authorities and secretly recorded Guglielmelli. Guglielmelli, who initially faced charges of domestic violence against Olsen, eventually accepted a plea deal for nine years in prison, despite Olsen's desire for a trial.

The standoff, with a Wednesday 5 p.m. ET deadline, puts highly anticipated college football and NFL games at risk for YouTube TV's 9.4 million subscribers. Fox is demanding significantly higher fees, which YouTube deems excessive compared to other partners. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has urged Google to resolve the dispute, highlighting the impact on millions of viewers relying on the platform for news and sports.</p>

          <p>The FDA has authorized updated COVID-19 vaccines but with significant restrictions, approving them for seniors and younger individuals with specific health conditions, while rescinding emergency use authorization for healthy children under five. This decision means Pfizer's shot is no longer authorized for that age group, drawing criticism from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which called it "deeply troubling." The AAP continues to recommend vaccination for children over six months, diverging from the CDC's advice under Health Secretary Robert F.

The 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, fired a rifle, shotgun, and pistol through church windows before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara described the attack as a "deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping." The community is grappling with immense grief, with local leaders emphasizing the need for action beyond thoughts and prayers.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey announced his boycott of Donald Trump's state banquet in the UK, citing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Davey stated that Trump's significant influence over Israel and Gulf states means he has the power to end the starvation and secure hostage releases. While acknowledging the honor of a royal invitation, Davey aims to send a message to Trump and Labour leader Keir Starmer to act on the crisis. The decision has drawn criticism from Conservatives, who view it as disrespectful to the King and an act of "pathetic gesture politics."</p>

          <p>Bratton Dean Wilkinson, 36, was arrested in Dallas for allegedly making bomb threats against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. Wilkinson reportedly approached security officers, displaying a "detonator" on his wrist and claiming to have a bomb in his backpack. The incident prompted a shelter-in-place order for the ICE Dallas Field Office before police issued an all-clear less than an hour later. This event follows a series of increased assaults and threats against ICE officials, which the agency attributes to a 1,000% rise since the beginning of the Trump administration.</p>

Trump publicly stated his intention to fire Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, and expressed confidence in soon having a majority of his nominees on the Fed board. This action has sparked concerns among investors about potential Fed interference, with some warning of a "potential riot in the bond market" if the central bank's independence in fighting inflation is compromised.

          <p>President Trump's allegations of owner-occupancy mortgage fraud against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook highlight a complex legal issue that experts say is difficult to prove. Cook's attorney asserts Trump lacks authority to remove her, and she plans to file a lawsuit. Owner-occupancy fraud, where a borrower falsely claims a property as a primary residence for lower interest rates or tax benefits, requires establishing specific intent to deceive, not just a mistake. While such fraud exists, legal experts note it's often considered "small ball" in court and challenging to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

          <p>An article warns that President Trump's militarization of the Washington D.C. police, deploying combat-equipped soldiers, represents an alarming step towards a "prerogative state." The author argues that Trump's "crime fighting" justification is a ruse, aimed at presenting himself as a law-and-order protector to his base and intimidating opponents. Concerns are raised about the potential for further deployments in cities like Chicago, which could exploit exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act. The article suggests such actions, even if thinly legal, could normalize authoritarian tactics and create the very emergencies they claim to address, potentially influencing future elections.</p>

          <p>Despite market speculation about a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, credit card interest rates are unlikely to fall significantly or quickly. Most credit card APRs are tied to the prime rate, but issuers tend to adjust rates slower and less generously during Fed cuts than during hikes. Record-high credit card debt and rising delinquencies also make lenders cautious, as they factor in increased risk and sticky inflation. Consumers are advised to proactively seek lower rates through negotiation, balance transfers, debt management plans, or personal loans rather than waiting for Fed action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel faced significant public backlash and a nearly $100 million stock value dip after unveiling a new logo that removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" character. Branding experts criticized the redesign for abandoning the company's "brand story" and folksy image, which resonated with its core customer base. Following the outcry, and a public urging from President Trump, Cracker Barrel announced it would scrap the new design and retain its original "Old Timer" logo. The incident highlights the perils of rebranding for legacy companies without understanding customers' emotional investment.</p>

          <p>Sting's former Police bandmates, guitarist Andy Summers and drummer Stewart Copeland, have filed a lawsuit claiming unpaid songwriting royalties for their hit song "Every Breath You Take." They allege they never received songwriting credit or payment for their contributions to the 1983 single. This legal action follows Sting's estimated $300 million sale of his entire songwriting catalog to Universal in 2022. Despite a history of musical and personal acrimony, The Police had reunited for a successful tour in 2007, making this new dispute a fresh chapter in their complex relationship.</p>

          <p>Far-right activist Tommy Robinson will not face charges related to an alleged assault at St Pancras railway station in London, as the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was insufficient evidence. British Transport Police had arrested Robinson on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after an incident in July where a man sustained "serious but non-life-threatening injuries." Robinson claimed self-defense, and the alleged victim declined to provide a statement, leading to the decision not to prosecute.

          <p>Recent studies indicating that unrestricted cash transfers to low-income individuals did not produce lasting improvements in mental health or financial well-being have reignited the debate over universal basic income (UBI). This challenges earlier optimism, leading to increased polarization, with some states banning guaranteed income programs. Critics on the right argue against such aid, while those on the left emphasize that cash transfers are meant to provide basic security and cut poverty, not be a cure-all.
