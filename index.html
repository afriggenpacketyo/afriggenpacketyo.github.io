Crash victims' family members have criticized the agreement, calling for more accountability and a trial for Boeing executives.

The dispute stems from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), seeking information about DOGE's operations and personnel. The temporary stay allows the Supreme Court time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief.
