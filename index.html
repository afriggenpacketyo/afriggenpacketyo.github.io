          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is moving closer to nuclear conflict due to the dismantling of key arms-control agreements like the INF treaty. It highlights Russia's recent formal abandonment of the treaty and aggressive rhetoric, alongside the US-led buildup of nuclear-capable systems in Europe, creating a dangerous standoff. The author laments the lack of public opposition compared to the cold war era and warns that nuclear weapons are increasingly viewed as offensive tools rather than deterrents. The piece calls for urgent action to halt this trend toward potential global catastrophe.</p>

          <p>A BBC reporter provides a first-person account of going undercover to expose a violent migrant-smuggling operation in northern France. Posing as a Syrian refugee, he navigated the dangerous environment of smugglers' camps near Dunkirk, using a hidden camera and a carefully constructed cover story. The article details the constant risks, the psychological toll of maintaining his false identity, and the intricate methods used to gather information, culminating in a meeting with a senior gang member. This investigation led to an arrest in the UK, highlighting the direct impact of such journalism.</p>

          <p>Female refugees in Germany encounter a "threefold disadvantage" in the job market, facing hurdles as women, immigrants, and refugees, which results in significantly lower employment rates compared to their male counterparts. Key obstacles include a lack of childcare, difficulties with the recognition of foreign qualifications, and language barriers, with standard integration courses often being inadequate.

          <p>Key European allies, including the UK, France, and Germany, have issued a joint statement demanding that any peace negotiations between the US and Russia must involve Ukraine. The statement came in response to President Trump's announcement of a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which raised concerns that a deal might be struck without Kyiv's input. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reinforced this stance, calling any agreement made without his country's participation a "dead decision" and rejecting the idea of territorial swaps as a basis for peace.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell demonstrated a return to his Cy Young-winning form with an impressive performance against the Toronto Blue Jays. In just his second start after a four-month injury recovery, the left-hander struck out ten batters over five scoreless innings, contributing to the Dodgers' 9-1 victory. The win was also supported by home runs from Max Muncy and Shohei Ohtani, who hit his 40th of the season. Snell's strong return bolsters an already formidable Dodgers starting rotation as the team heads toward the postseason.</p>

          <p>A new six-part documentary, "Zuo Zongtang Recovers Xinjiang," has been released by a Chinese provincial broadcaster to promote Beijing's historical narrative regarding the region. The series focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang, aiming to counter Western perspectives and bolster a unified Chinese national identity. This media push aligns with President Xi Jinping's long-term goal of "forging a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation." The documentary portrays the historical separatist leader Yaqub Beg as a jihadist, a view contrasting with his hero status among some modern Islamic fundamentalist groups.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford completed an extensive workout, throwing over 60 passes as he recovers from a back issue that has kept him out of practice. Coach Sean McVay described the session as a "good step in the right direction," noting that Stafford threw without limitations and felt good afterward. While the 37-year-old quarterback is expected to progress back into practice, he will initially be limited to individual drills. A planned joint practice with the Chargers, where Stafford was not scheduled to participate, has been canceled due to injuries on the Chargers' side.</p>

This change, driven by new creative directors at major brands like Gucci and Burberry, is an attempt to reignite consumer interest amid slowing sales and soft demand. Analysts suggest that after several years of minimalist aesthetics, the industry needs novelty to compel shoppers who have become weary of significant price hikes without corresponding product innovation.

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, once booming after the 2008 recession, is now facing a significant slowdown due to a combination of economic pressures. Factors contributing to the bust include shifting consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations who are drinking less, and post-pandemic inflation pushing drinkers to cheaper options. The situation is exacerbated by global trade disputes, with retaliatory tariffs and import halts from key markets like the EU and Canada. This has led to an oversupply of bourbon, falling prices, and bankruptcies for some distilleries. (not investment advice)</p>
