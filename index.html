          <p>A 59-year-old British woman, Yvonne Ford, has died from rabies after being scratched by a puppy during a holiday in Morocco. Despite the seemingly minor nature of the scratch in February, she developed severe symptoms weeks later, including headaches and loss of motor skills, ultimately leading to her death. Health officials have stated that the risk to the wider public is low, and close contacts of the deceased are being assessed and offered vaccinations. The incident serves as a reminder of the seriousness of animal bites and the importance of vaccination, especially when traveling to regions where rabies is prevalent.</p>

          <p>President Trump's consideration of joining Israel in potential strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities has reportedly exposed a deep split within his circle. Some, like Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, have expressed skepticism about Iran's nuclear ambitions, while others advocate for a more hawkish approach. This internal conflict mirrors broader divisions within the Republican party, pitting isolationist factions against those favoring interventionist policies. The situation has led to heated debates, including a public disagreement between Tucker Carlson and Senator Ted Cruz, highlighting the complex political landscape surrounding the potential US involvement in the Middle East. Optimism is tempered by the potential for further escalation and the internal divisions it has exposed.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has upheld a Tennessee law prohibiting gender transition care for minors, a decision expected to have national implications. The court, in a 6-3 vote, ruled that the law does not constitute discrimination, arguing that there is ongoing debate among medical experts regarding the risks and benefits of such treatments. The dissenting justices, however, argued that the ban leads to medical discrimination based on sex, abandoning transgender children and their families to political whims. This ruling marks the first time the court has addressed transgender healthcare, sparking concerns about the future of transgender rights and access to care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil market analysts are struggling to predict how the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran will affect oil prices. The uncertainty stems from the potential for direct US involvement and major supply disruptions, including the possibility of Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz. John Evans, an analyst at PVM, noted a "blanket of unease" in the oil markets due to the unpredictable nature of the situation. The conflict's rapid escalation and the potential for further disruptions make it difficult to forecast the future of oil prices with any certainty.</p>

While some upcoming celebrations may be smaller due to changes in corporate sponsorships, communities across the country continue to honor Juneteenth with parades, parties, and cultural events.

          <p>The possibility of the US striking Iran's nuclear facilities is being considered, but experts emphasize the significant challenges involved. Iran's Fordo plant, built deep underground and reinforced with concrete, is a particularly difficult target, requiring specialized bunker-buster weapons. Destroying the facility would likely require multiple bombing rounds and potentially ground deployment, raising the risk of a wider conflict. Such a strike could trigger retaliatory actions from Iran, potentially drawing the US deeper into a regional conflict and escalating tensions further.</p>

          <p>Purchasing a $500,000 annuity at age 65 can provide a substantial monthly income during retirement, with payments varying based on gender and annuity type. A 65-year-old male could receive around $3,269 per month, while a female could receive approximately $3,151 per month for life. Joint life annuities, covering two people, typically offer smaller payouts. Factors influencing annuity income include interest rates, annuity type, and payout features, making it essential to shop around for the best rates and consider individual retirement goals.

          <p>Oil prices fell more than 1% after President Trump indicated that Iran was interested in negotiating over its nuclear program following recent Israeli airstrikes. Trump stated that the Iranians had reached out and suggested sending a delegation to the White House for discussions. This shift in tone from previous threats contributed to the decline in crude oil futures. However, Trump also confirmed he was considering a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, adding uncertainty to the market.</p>
