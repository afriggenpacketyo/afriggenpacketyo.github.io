          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery to remove 80 to 100 high-powered magnets he had swallowed, leading to the loss of part of his bowel. The magnets, reportedly purchased from the online retailer Temu, clamped together inside his intestines, causing tissue death. This incident highlights the dangers of such magnets, which are often sold as toys but are banned in New Zealand, though the ban is difficult to enforce due to online sales. The U.S. has also implemented safety standards to limit the power of these products.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index ETFs, like Vanguard's VOO, may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification. The index's heavy concentration in the technology sector, now over 35%, has pushed defensive sectors to an all-time low weight, prompting investors to seek alternatives. Consequently, there is a renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index outperforming the S&P 500 in recent months. This trend indicates a potential broadening of the market beyond the "Magnificent 7" tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and major political donor to Donald Trump, has been identified as the anonymous individual who gave $130 million to the government to help pay U.S. troops during a federal shutdown. The donation, which President Trump had previously mentioned without naming the donor, has raised legal questions regarding a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act. Mellon has a history of significant political contributions, including over $165 million to support Republican candidates and $53 million for a Texas border wall fund. The Pentagon confirmed acceptance of the gift under its general authority.</p>

          <p>At an upcoming summit, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is grappling with the escalating rivalry between the United States and China, which pressures member states to choose sides on security, trade, and technology. Tensions are particularly high over China's expansive claims in the South China Sea and trade disputes, forcing nations into a difficult balancing act. While some smaller countries align more closely with China, larger nations like the Philippines and Indonesia attempt to maintain cooperative relationships with both superpowers. Many regional leaders are reportedly dismayed by U.S. tariff policies, viewing the country as a less reliable partner.</p>

The EU is exploring short-term solutions with China but is also prepared to use its "toolbox" to respond if necessary.

This event, organized by Ríos to Rivers, brought together international river advocates to witness the restoration.

          <p>California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure to redraw congressional districts in favor of Democrats, is being marketed to voters primarily as a way to counteract Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas. Proponents, including Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Barack Obama, are framing a "yes" vote as a direct rebuke of Donald Trump and his political influence. This strategy appears to be effective, with recent polls showing the measure passing by a significant margin, largely driven by voters' opposition to Trump. Critics call the proposition a partisan power grab, but their message has struggled to gain traction against the simple, visceral appeal of opposing the former president.</p>

          <p>A new study found that nearly one in five urinary tract infections (UTIs) among a group of patients in Southern California were caused by E. coli strains linked to contaminated meat from local grocery stores. Researchers used genomic analysis to trace the bacteria, finding that turkey and chicken were the most common sources, followed by pork and beef. The findings suggest that food safety issues are a significant contributor to UTIs, a common and sometimes life-threatening infection. The study also noted a higher risk in lower-income areas, potentially due to differences in product quality or retail handling.</p>

          <p>Early voting has commenced for two closely watched off-year elections: the New York City mayor's race and the New Jersey governor's race. In New York, voters are choosing between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Andrew Cuomo. The New Jersey contest features Republican Jack Ciattarelli against Democrat Mikie Sherrill. These elections are seen as potential bellwethers for the Democratic party, testing the appeal of progressive versus moderate candidates. Issues of affordability and internal party divisions have been central to both campaigns.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has emphasized President Xi Jinping's direct and personal involvement in drafting the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan. According to reports from Xinhua and People's Daily, Xi personally headed the drafting team and played a "decisive role" in shaping the strategic document. The framework was reportedly based on extensive investigations conducted during Xi's national tours throughout the year. This messaging underscores Xi's centralized authority and personal stamp on China's long-term economic and social development policies, which were deliberated at the Communist Party's fourth plenum.</p>

          <p>In a new interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris has strongly suggested she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028. When asked if she could be the next president, she replied "possibly," and stated that her career in public service is not over. Harris dismissed current polls that show her with low favorability, noting she has defied polls throughout her political career. She also used the interview to criticize former President Donald Trump, calling him a "tyrant" who has weaponized the justice system and is intolerant of criticism.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or using technology to optimize sleep, has created a multi-billion dollar industry for gadgets like the $3,000 Eight Sleep mattress cover. However, the reliance on such technology has drawbacks, as demonstrated when an Amazon Web Services outage caused the smart beds to malfunction, trapping some users in sitting positions or at extreme temperatures. While some sleep tech can be beneficial for those with medical disorders, the general trend introduces more potential points of failure into a natural process. This raises questions about whether a high-tech approach to rest is truly better than simply letting our bodies do what they are designed to do.</p>

          <p>In their inaugural MLS season, San Diego FC has achieved historic success, setting records for wins and points by an expansion team and securing the Western Conference's top seed. The club's success is attributed to a philosophy that blends star players like Hirving "Chucky" Lozano with a strong collective team spirit and a deep commitment to community. Central to their strategy is the Right to Dream academy, the first of its kind in MLS, which provides long-term scholarships and holistic development for young players from the San Diego-Tijuana region. This focus on homegrown talent and cross-border identity is seen as the heartbeat of the club's long-term vision.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford to the Caribbean as part of a significant military buildup in the region. The Pentagon states the mission is to combat drug trafficking, but Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the U.S. of "fabricating a war." This deployment follows a U.S. military campaign that has destroyed several vessels allegedly carrying narcotics and comes amid statements from President Trump suggesting potential strikes on land. The increased U.S. military presence, which includes stealth fighters and bombers, has escalated fears in Caracas of an attempt to overthrow the Maduro government.</p>

With federal employees expected to miss their first full paychecks, many are facing severe financial strain. Criss described the situation as "pressure on top of pressure" in a safety-sensitive job where the margin for error is zero.
