          <p>Tensions are escalating at the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea as a resupply deadline for a grounded Philippine naval vessel approaches. The Philippines has reported Chinese coastguard ships intercepting its vessels, while a Chinese tugboat was sighted near the BRP Sierra Madre, a deliberately beached ship serving as a Philippine military outpost. A Philippine Navy spokesman stated it would take more than a tugboat to remove the ship. This recent flare-up follows a period of relative calm, signaling a return to heightened friction in the contested waters.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his ace potential by pitching five dominant innings in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 5-1 win against the Cincinnati Reds. Returning from his second Tommy John surgery, Ohtani adopted a more varied pitching strategy, relying heavily on his curveball and splitter to keep hitters off-balance. He allowed only one run, struck out nine batters, and earned his first pitching win of the season. This performance demonstrates his capability to handle a full starter's workload, a crucial development for the Dodgers' postseason rotation plans.</p>

          <p>To commemorate the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's murder, his family and supporters have recreated the train journey he took from Chicago to Mississippi in 1955. The ride was organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center and included Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., Till's cousin and the last living eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago, was brutally lynched in Mississippi, and his mother's decision to hold an open-casket funeral became a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. The event aims to remember the past and reflect on the progress made since the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A shooter opened fire on a Catholic church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, killing an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old and injuring 17 other people, including 14 children. The suspect, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, fired a rifle through the church windows before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Law enforcement sources noted that Westman's mother was a former employee of the church and school. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to monitor rising housing prices in Seoul and growing household debt. While keeping rates steady, the central bank upgraded its GDP and inflation forecasts for 2025, anticipating a modest recovery in domestic demand. Officials noted that while household loan growth has slowed, expectations for higher home prices remain a significant concern. The decision reflects a cautious approach as the bank balances economic growth with financial stability risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of Southern California has offered a multi-year extension to Notre Dame in an effort to continue their century-old football rivalry, which was at risk of ending. USC's athletic director, Jennifer Cohen, confirmed the new offer, which addresses Notre Dame's preference for a long-term commitment. Key negotiation points include the game's scheduling, as USC seeks to move the matchup to earlier in the season to better manage its demanding Big Ten travel schedule.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams denied a request from the Trump administration and Florida officials to stay her order, which also blocked new detainees from being sent there.

          <p>In response to a sharp increase in threats against members of Congress, a new pilot program has been launched to enhance lawmaker security. The program provides a temporary increase of up to $20,000 for security upgrades at their homes and an additional $5,000 per month for hiring personal security. This initiative follows a recent wave of politically motivated violence, including an assassination attempt on President Trump and shootings targeting Minnesota lawmakers. U.S. Capitol Police reported nearly 9,500 threats and concerning statements against Congress in 2024 alone.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two employees of a Southern California surgery center on felony charges of assaulting and interfering with federal officers. The staffers, Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Nadine Davila, are accused of obstructing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as they attempted to detain landscapers who had fled into the medical facility. According to court documents, the employees allegedly grabbed an officer and wedged themselves between the agent and one of the men being arrested, demanding the agents leave the property.</p>

          <p>Matt DeBoer, the principal of Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, praised his staff as "heroes" for their actions during a mass shooting that killed two students. In a press conference, DeBoer described how teachers immediately protected children, with older students shielding younger ones, actions he said prevented an even worse outcome. He called the event a "nightmare" but vowed that the school community would recover and rebuild. DeBoer also made an emotional plea for action to prevent future tragedies, urging people to "pray, but don't stop with your words."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The resale value of the Tesla Cybertruck has dropped significantly, with the average price for a used model falling nearly 30% over the past year to just over $84,000. This decline is part of a broader trend affecting all used Tesla vehicles, which have seen an average 14% price drop. Experts suggest factors such as CEO Elon Musk's public image and a general downturn in new Tesla sales are contributing to the depreciation. The trend is notable given the initial hype for the vehicle, which was once teased with a starting price under $40,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, with a forecast for continued strong sales growth driven by AI infrastructure demand. Despite the positive overall results, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue of $41.1 billion fell slightly short of analyst expectations. Overall revenue grew 56% year-over-year to $46.74 billion, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of over 50% growth. The report confirms Nvidia's central role in the ongoing global AI buildout, though it was the slowest growth period in that stretch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts warn that California is facing a growing threat from intense dust storms, known as haboobs, similar to the one that recently hit Phoenix. Factors like climate change-induced drying, water overuse, and wildfires are creating conditions ripe for these massive storms in Southern California and the Central Valley. These events pose serious health risks, as the dust can carry toxic materials like fungal spores, pesticides, and heavy metals, which can cause respiratory and cardiac problems. Researchers estimate that over 5 million Californians are already directly affected by dust storms.</p>
