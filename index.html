        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, finding parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. The study, led by Professor Li Lei, reorganized the understanding of yeast metabolism into four distinct phases that overlap and transition sequentially, triggered by specific molecular mechanisms. This mirrors the traditional Chinese medicine concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke. The team's model reflects a unique metabolic state for each phase, aligning with the "four symbols" theory that seeks balance between passive and active forces to maintain health and harmony.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted airstrikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, claiming it as a "spectacular military success." Trump stated the objective was to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and deter the nuclear threat. He warned of further attacks if Iran does not pursue peace, while also claiming the enrichment facilities had been "totally obliterated." The strikes followed a period of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with the U.S. reaching out diplomatically to convey that these strikes were the extent of their planned action and regime change was not the goal.</p>

The election features a rare overlap with the upper house election, and major parties are using social media and street speeches to attract voters, especially those unaffiliated.

The author notes the gamble Trump has taken, given the unqualified appointees on his national security team. The analysis suggests that the Iranian program may be delayed but not completely destroyed, and the region will likely become more unstable, though a full-blown war is less probable.</p>

          <p>It was just on Thursday that President Donald Trump said he would decide "within the next two weeks" on whether to order a U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities -- ostensibly to give diplomacy a chance, at least temporarily. “Based on the fact that there’s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” Trump said in a statement read to reporters by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. On Friday, asked by a reporter to explain his thinking, he responded it was to give time for the Iranians to "come to their senses."</p>

          <p>The United States struck three nuclear sites in Iran, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, according to President Donald Trump. B-2 stealth bombers dropped Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on Iranian targets, and Tomahawk cruise missiles were also used. Trump described the operation as a "tremendous success" and warned Iran to "make peace." The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization condemned the strikes as a violation of international law. The action has drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, with concerns raised about the lack of congressional authorization.</p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's rejection of his own intelligence chief, Tulsi Gabbard, suggesting that Trump is disavowing the intelligence community for political reasons. Gabbard testified that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, contradicting Trump's stance as he contemplates an attack against Iran. Reed stated that Trump's rejection of Gabbard's assessment may be prompted by his desire to justify military action. Reed added that if Gabbard made a false statement in her testimony, there would be an obligation to correct the record immediately.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband Bob in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, conducted with Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed issues with the original investigation, including untested blood spots and foreign male DNA on key items. The prosecution admitted that the DNA evidence was different in quality and quantity than presented at trial. Though her conviction was overturned, the DA's office initially decided to retry her, but then ultimately dismissed the charges, granting her freedom after a long legal battle.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that American warplanes bombed three nuclear sites in Iran, escalating the conflict between Iran and Israel. The targets included Fordo, a uranium enrichment plant hidden in a mountainside. The US says the air strikes were all it intended to do, and that "regime change efforts" were "not planned". It is unclear what damage the US attack has had on the nuclear facilities, or whether there are any injuries or casualties. The deputy political director of Iran's state broadcaster, Hassan Abedini, said Iran had evacuated these three nuclear sites a "while ago".</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran's nuclear sites contradicts his previous promises of being a peacemaker and avoiding new wars. Despite vowing to "prevent World War Three" and end "chaos in the Middle East," Trump authorized a direct military strike on Iran. The action marks a sharp break from his campaign pledges and puts the United States in direct conflict with Tehran. While Trump has long opposed Iran reaching nuclear capability, his recent decision undermines his earlier emphasis on peaceful resolutions.</p>
