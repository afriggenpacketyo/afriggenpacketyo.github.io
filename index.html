          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's leading cloud provider, caused widespread disruptions for major websites, apps, and even Amazon's own internal operations. The issue, which originated in AWS's US-East-1 region, was attributed to a DNS problem with its DynamoDB service, affecting companies like Disney+, Reddit, and United Airlines. While AWS reported signs of recovery, intermittent issues persisted, highlighting the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers for its core infrastructure.</p>

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned that the ongoing government shutdown could lead to more significant air travel disruptions as essential federal employees, like air traffic controllers, continue to work without pay. With some controllers already taking on side jobs to make ends meet, there are growing concerns that increased sick calls could lead to staffing shortages and flight delays. The secretary also noted the risk of experienced federal workers leaving for the private sector if the funding lapse continues.</p>

          <p>A Chapel Hill fire chief's dog, Colton, inadvertently started a fire at his owner's home after finding and chewing on a lithium-ion battery. The fire department released a video of the incident, explaining that the dog's chewing broke the battery's protective features, causing it to ignite. Fortunately, the dog was unharmed aside from minor smoke exposure, and the fire damage was contained to a rug, prompting the department to issue a public reminder about the safe storage of such batteries.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Mark Kelly expressed that the ongoing government shutdown could be resolved this week if Republican lawmakers would engage in negotiations over expiring health insurance tax credits. Democrats have insisted on extending these subsidies to prevent a spike in premiums for many Americans, making it a condition for reopening the government. Meanwhile, Republicans, like Senator Katie Britt, have urged Democrats to pass a funding bill first, with promises to discuss the healthcare issue afterward, leaving the two sides at a stalemate.</p>

It explains that higher interest rates generally result in more generous payouts for fixed annuities, as insurance companies can earn more on the invested premiums. However, it also cautions against trying to perfectly time the market, suggesting that the best time to buy is when rates are reasonably attractive and the security of a guaranteed income stream fits an individual's retirement strategy.

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple's stock is experiencing a resurgence as strong demand for the new iPhone 17 lineup proves initial skepticism wrong. He argues that concerns over tariffs and a lack of new features were misguided, with recent data showing the new models are outselling their predecessors. With Wall Street analysts upgrading the stock and raising price targets, Cramer suggests that the "misperception" around the company is clearing, creating a buying opportunity for investors who have been patient.

          <p>The Louvre Museum remains closed as police investigate a brazen daytime robbery where thieves stole eight priceless 19th-century jewels from the Galerie d'Apollon. The gang used a vehicle-mounted lift to access a first-floor window, smashed display cases, and escaped on scooters in a raid that lasted only minutes. While Empress Eugénie's crown was dropped and recovered, other significant items, including tiaras and necklaces, were taken, prompting a massive investigation into what officials call the work of an experienced criminal organization.</p>

The strategies include presenting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority to make them feel secure, and over-communicating to satisfy their need for oversight.
