          <p>Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has publicly criticized his club, accusing them of breaking a promise to allow him to leave this summer. In a social media statement, Wissa claims he had a written agreement that he could depart for a 'reasonable offer' but says Brentford has now significantly increased his asking price from £40m to approximately £65m. The DR Congo international has expressed his strong desire to join Newcastle United, who have had two offers rejected, and has not been training with the first team. Wissa is urging the club's owners to honor their word before the transfer window closes, stating that being forced to stay would 'tarnish' his time at the club.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people have participated in 'March for Australia' anti-immigration rallies in major cities, drawing condemnation from the government for alleged links to the far-right. The protests, which saw some clashes with counter-demonstrators, were attended by several opposition politicians and known neo-Nazi figures. The organizers cite concerns over eroding national unity, mass migration's impact on communities, and strains on infrastructure and housing. In response, government ministers have denounced the rallies, stating that racism and divisive far-right activism have no place in modern Australia and undermine the country's social cohesion.</p>

          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pledged to foster a relationship of partnership rather than rivalry. This meeting marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years and signals a thaw in relations following years of tension, including a deadly border dispute in 2020. Both leaders emphasized a long-term strategic perspective, with Modi noting an 'atmosphere of peace and stability' and announcing the future resumption of direct flights. The summit, also attended by Russia's Vladimir Putin, is seen as a forum for member states to address shared interests amid ongoing trade disputes with the United States.</p>

          <p>An infant has died from whooping cough in the UK, marking the first fatal case this year, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The baby's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy, a measure the UKHSA describes as key to protecting newborns in their first weeks of life. This death highlights growing concerns about declining vaccination rates, with recent data showing that no main childhood vaccine in England reached the 95% uptake target required for herd immunity. Health officials are urging pregnant women and parents to ensure vaccinations are up to date to prevent further tragedies from this severe bacterial infection.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has labeled ongoing protests over social and economic inequality as bordering on 'treason and terrorism.' The statement comes amid escalating unrest in major cities, intensified by the death of a protester and the killing of three others after a council building was set on fire. In response to the demonstrations, which have included looting, the president announced that parliament would revoke some financial allowances for its members.

          <p>Observers and political scientists are expressing growing alarm that authoritarian political tactics are becoming increasingly normalized in the United States under the Trump administration. This article points to recent events such as fawning praise from cabinet members, calls to arrest political opponents, and the use of federal law enforcement for immigration raids as evidence of a systematic consolidation of power. Some experts argue the U.S. is now a 'competitive authoritarian system,' following a familiar pattern seen in other nations where democratic norms are eroded. Activists who have fled autocratic regimes report recognizing similar patterns, particularly the creation of a constant threat of political persecution.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order to prohibit city police from collaborating with any National Guard troops or federal agents deployed by President Donald Trump. The order specifies that Chicago police will not assist with patrols, arrests, or immigration enforcement conducted by federal forces, asserting that such a deployment would undermine local sovereignty and civil liberties. This action escalates an ongoing feud between the Democratic city and state leaders and the Trump administration over the potential use of federal power to address crime in the city. The White House dismissed the move as a 'publicity stunt,' while the mayor is considering legal action to block any deployment.</p>

          <p>A recent poll highlights significant economic pessimism among Americans under 40, with many Gen Z and millennial individuals feeling that financial barriers are hindering their progress. Having come of age during periods of financial uncertainty, these generations report difficulty finding jobs and affording housing, with the median age of first-time homebuyers rising to 38. This widespread concern about affordability is shaping their life decisions, such as delaying homeownership, and potentially influencing their political views and voting patterns.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the cancellation of $679 million in federal funding designated for 12 port projects aimed at supporting the U.S. offshore wind industry. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy characterized the projects as 'wasteful,' stating the funds would be redirected to other 'critical port upgrades.' This move is the latest in President Trump's campaign against wind power, which he has long criticized as expensive and harmful to wildlife. The decision has been condemned by critics as an attempt to destroy a clean energy sector, kill jobs, and potentially drive up electricity prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers suggests that China could leverage the underwater topography of the Paracel Islands to create a 'submarine kill zone.' The research highlights how rugged seamounts create 'acoustic shadow zones' where sonar is ineffective, providing ideal hiding spots for intelligent sea mines. According to the study, deploying these advanced underwater weapons in sonar dead zones could effectively challenge U.S. undersea warfare dominance in the contested South China Sea. The researchers state that identifying these optimal locations on the sea floor is crucial for enhancing the concealment of deployed assets and ensuring maritime security.</p>

          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, driven by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, is causing significant supply shortages and price hikes. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled over the last decade, with tencha, the tea used for matcha, seeing its price jump 170% this year. The strain is felt by Japan's aging farming communities, prompting the government to consider subsidies to boost production. Retailers in Japan are now rationing supplies and reporting that prices for the green powder have doubled, while major distributors like Ito En are struggling to secure enough raw material and milling capacity to meet the intense demand.

Before co-founding Scale AI, which was acquired by Meta in a $25 billion deal, Guo's ventures began on the elementary school playground, where she would trade and sell Pokémon cards and colored pencils. Her hustles evolved to selling virtual items in the online game Neopets and later creating and selling bots for video games.

          <p>New figures from England's Department for Education suggest that school attendance during the first week of term is a strong predictor of future absenteeism. According to the data, 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 went on to become 'persistently absent,' meaning they missed at least 10% of the school year. This contrasts sharply with the 14% of pupils who had full attendance in the first week and later became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged schools and parents to 'double down' on efforts to ensure children are present from the start of the new term to combat absence levels that remain higher than before the pandemic.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the UK's Reform party is importing Donald Trump's anti-press tactics, citing the recent decision by Nottinghamshire’s Reform-led council to ban reporters from the Nottingham Post and affiliated outlets.

The author suggests this is part of a broader strategy by hard-right politicians who feel they can bypass traditional media and benefit from turning journalists into a foil. While press-bashing may not have immediate electoral consequences, the piece questions whether a party that cannot face local scrutiny is prepared for the responsibilities of government.</p>

          <p>Multiple protests are scheduled across the Los Angeles area for Labor Day as part of a nationwide 'Workers over Billionaires' demonstration. Organizers are calling on working people to protest what they describe as efforts by billionaires to cut healthcare, scapegoat immigrants, and divide the workforce for profit. The demonstrations reflect a challenging environment for unions, which are contending with issues like immigration raids and a weakened National Labor Relations Board under the Trump administration. The article provides a list of protest locations and times, including events in Culver City, Torrance, Wilmington, and Long Beach.</p>

          <p>Recent high tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Indian goods are creating a new incentive for India and China to repair their strained relationship. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the SCO summit is seen as a potential turning point. The economic fallout from their 2020 border clash, which halted flights and investments, has been damaging for both sides. Experts suggest that while deep-seated mistrust remains, there is a strong case for economic cooperation, particularly in manufacturing and gaining market access, as both powers seek to diversify from their dependence on the United States.</p>

          <p>Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime has advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after a stunning comeback victory over world No. 3 Alexander Zverev. After dropping the first set, the 25th seed rallied to win the nearly four-hour match 4-6, 7-6 (7), 6-4, 6-4, securing his first Grand Slam victory over a top-five opponent. The result marks a significant return to form for Auger-Aliassime, who has struggled with injuries and inconsistent results in recent seasons. For Zverev, the title contender's loss represents his earliest exit from the US Open since 2018, continuing a difficult summer hard-court season.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six winning numbers in Saturday night's drawing.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 6-1 to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a game marked by uncharacteristic mistakes and a lack of offensive support for pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Glasnow pitched a no-hitter into the sixth inning and a shutout into the seventh, but the team's defense and baserunning faltered, leading to the defeat. Manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration, stating 'We beat ourselves' and pointing to a 'lack of focus' that led to multiple errors and runners being thrown out on the bases. The loss narrows the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to just one game over the San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>Tron founder Justin Sun has stated his ambition for his blockchain network to become the equivalent of the Swift system for the virtual asset sector, predicting it will surpass the traditional financial messaging service in transaction volume within five years. Sun highlighted that Tron already facilitates transactions in seconds compared to Swift's days-long process and is expected to handle $8 trillion this year. He expressed confidence that Tron's volume could eventually grow to be 100 times larger than Swift's, capitalizing on the growing influence of stablecoins. Sun also praised Hong Kong's recent progress in establishing a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters have marched in cities across Mexico, demanding government action and justice for the more than 130,000 people who have been reported as missing. The demonstrations highlight what the UN has called 'a human tragedy of enormous proportions,' with most disappearances occurring since the 'war on drugs' began in 2007. Family members, known as 'buscadores,' often risk their own lives to search for mass graves, as both organized crime groups and security forces are blamed for the crisis. The widespread protests underscore the national scale of the problem and the public's frustration with the authorities' failure to find their loved ones.</p>

          <p>This article provides a summary of the case involving Alix Tichelman, a model and makeup artist who was charged with manslaughter in the 2013 heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. The two met on Hayes' yacht, where security footage captured Tichelman injecting him with the drug. After Hayes lost consciousness, Tichelman was seen gathering her belongings, stepping over his body, and drinking a glass of wine before leaving without calling for help. The investigation into Hayes' death also brought renewed scrutiny to the death of Tichelman's former boyfriend, Dean Riopelle, who had died from an overdose just two months prior.</p>
