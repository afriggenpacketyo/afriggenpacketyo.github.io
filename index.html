          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Vance Boelter on six counts, including murder, for the fatal shooting of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the non-fatal shooting of State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson stated that the indictment is the first step in potentially seeking the death penalty, a decision that will be made by the Attorney General in the coming months. The suspect also allegedly wrote a letter to the FBI making bizarre claims about being a secret operative. The case is being treated as an act of political violence and extremism.</p>

          <p>British counter-terrorism police have issued a warning about the growing threat of hostile states, such as Russia, Iran, and China, recruiting vulnerable individuals in the UK, including teenagers. These states are increasingly using proxies for sabotage and violence, with investigations into such activities now comprising about 20% of the counter-terror workload. Authorities urge parents and teachers to be vigilant for signs of manipulation, as children may be lured online with money without understanding the severe implications. This warning follows a five-fold increase in police work on hostile state activity since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 Afghans. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing the situation in Afghanistan has improved, but advocacy groups sued, citing the ongoing humanitarian crisis. The one-week stay allows both sides to file briefs, providing a brief reprieve for Afghan families who faced deportation. The White House criticized the ruling as judicial overreach, while immigrant advocates emphasized the need for permanent solutions.</p>

          <p>Endrina Bracho, an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, has entered a blind plea, admitting guilt to first-degree involuntary manslaughter in a wrong-way crash that killed 12-year-old Travis Wolfe. The crash occurred in December 2023 when Bracho, who did not have a driver's license, was driving at high speed on the wrong side of the road. Following the plea, prosecutors dropped several lesser charges and recommended a 10-year concurrent sentence. The case has drawn political attention, with Senator Josh Hawley introducing "Travis’s Law" to mandate the detention of undocumented immigrants who commit serious traffic offenses.</p>

          <p>Intense sectarian fighting has erupted again in southern Syria between local Sunni Bedouin tribes and armed Druze factions, resulting in over 160 deaths. The violence prompted Syria's new government, led by a former rebel faction, to deploy forces, which were then targeted by Israeli airstrikes. Israel, which has its own Druze community, stated it was acting to prevent harm to the Druze in Syria and to demilitarize the border region. The conflict highlights the new government's struggle to maintain stability and protect minority groups amid accusations of atrocities by its own forces.</p>

This initiative is part of a broader strategy to encourage the movement of savings from cash ISAs into UK investments. The move aims to boost the economy without resorting to unpopular tax hikes amid current economic contractions. (not investment advice)</p>

Some Senate Republicans have resisted certain cuts, leading to a modification that preserves funding for the PEPFAR global AIDS program.

Baldwin's letter expresses serious concerns about privacy breaches, food security, and the potential for unelected insiders to disrupt the livelihoods of American farmers.

The film's failure comes after a tumultuous production that involved a change in director and significant script rewrites, which may have diluted its original vision. This poor performance, following the massive success of "Inside Out 2," suggests that the Pixar brand alone is no longer a guarantee of box-office success for original stories.

          <p>A major data breach by a UK official, which exposed the details of thousands of Afghans seeking to escape the Taliban, has prompted serious security and moral questions. The leak, which occurred over three years ago, led to a secret and unprecedented operation to evacuate some of those affected to the UK, a fact concealed by a super-injunction until recently. The incident, resulting from an individual's mistake rather than a sophisticated cyberattack, has endangered those still in Afghanistan and undermined trust in UK promises of data security. Critics are now questioning whether the government's secrecy was solely to protect lives or also to avoid political accountability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is actively encouraging Texas Republicans to redraw the state's congressional maps during an upcoming special legislative session to create more GOP-favorable districts. The move is part of a strategy to help Republicans maintain their House majority in the next midterm elections, with Trump suggesting five new winnable seats could be created. This push for a mid-decade redistricting is unusual and could prompt Democrat-controlled states to retaliate, though many use independent commissions. Critics, including Texas Democrats, have condemned the plan as a desperate power grab that distracts from urgent issues like recent flood recovery efforts.</p>

Generally, older buyers receive higher payouts due to shorter life expectancies, but financial advisors often recommend the 60-70 age range as a balanced window. For deferred annuities, buying earlier in one's 50s allows more time for tax-deferred growth. Key factors to consider include immediate versus future income needs, personal health, risk tolerance, and the potential benefits of "laddering" annuities by purchasing them at different times.

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has vacated a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of 15 million Americans. The rule, issued in January, was challenged by credit industry trade groups who argued the agency overstepped its authority. The judge agreed, finding the rule violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Consumer advocates had praised the original rule, arguing that medical debt is not a reliable predictor of creditworthiness and often results from complex billing and insurance disputes. The CFPB's ability to appeal is uncertain given recent leadership changes at the agency.</p>
