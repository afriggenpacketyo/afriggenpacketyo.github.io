          <p>Shares in the gaming platform Roblox surged after the company reported second-quarter net bookings of $1.44 billion, significantly beating analyst expectations. This growth was driven by a 41% year-over-year increase in daily active users, reaching 111.8 million. While the company posted a net loss, it raised its booking guidance for the next quarter, signaling confidence in its continued expansion and creator ecosystem. The platform also recently introduced new age verification tools to improve safety for its younger user base. (not investment advice)</p>

He threatened to use "every tool in our arsenal" if they fail to comply, pushing for them to match the lowest prices offered in other developed nations. The move revives his "most favored nation" policy and calls for eliminating middlemen to sell directly to consumers. The announcement caused shares of several major drugmakers to fall significantly.

          <p>On the opening day of the fifth Test, England's bowling attack showed moments of both brilliance and erraticness, particularly from bowler Josh Tongue, as they restricted India to 204-6. Despite challenging, bowler-friendly conditions, England's inconsistency prevented them from fully capitalizing on their advantage. The day was further complicated by an injury to Chris Woakes, adding pressure to an already depleted bowling lineup. Neither side was able to seize complete control, leaving the match finely balanced.</p>

          <p>Residents of Paris's historic Montmartre neighborhood are expressing frustration over a massive surge in tourism following the Olympic Games, comparing the area to a theme park. Locals report that the influx of visitors is driving out essential businesses like butchers and cheese shops, replacing them with tourist-focused vendors. The overtourism has also congested streets and driven up housing prices. A local association has proposed measures to mitigate the strain, such as limiting tour group sizes and raising the tourist tax.</p>

          <p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency that distributes over $12 billion annually to community health programs, has been severely hobbled by staffing purges under the Trump administration. Since February, the agency has lost about a quarter of its workforce, jeopardizing its ability to manage grants for primary care, HIV/AIDS treatment, and rural hospitals.

          <p>This article cautions homeowners considering home equity loans or HELOCs to avoid costly mistakes in the current economic climate. Key pitfalls include opting for a variable-rate HELOC when predictable payments are needed, as rates could rise.

The advice stresses careful planning and comparing the full Annual Percentage Rate (APR) across different lender offers to understand the true cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hollywood Hills home of Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was the target of an attempted burglary while he was away with the team. According to police, a man jumped a gate and broke a glass door, but fled after being confronted by on-site security. Nothing was taken, and no one was harmed. The incident is the latest in a string of break-ins targeting the homes of professional athletes and celebrities in Southern California, often by organized groups that track their schedules.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Yacht Buyers Explore Strategies to Circumvent New US Tariffs on European Boats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 14:50:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American buyers of luxury yachts are reportedly planning to use legal loopholes to avoid the proposed 15% U.S. tariff on European-made goods. The most common strategy involves "foreign flagging," where a buyer registers their multimillion-dollar vessel in a country like the Cayman Islands or Malta. This allows the yacht to enter U.S. waters as a visiting vessel, thereby bypassing the import tariff. While this is a viable option for large superyachts, smaller boats will likely still be subject to the new tax.</p>

          <p>Interest will begin accruing again on August 1 for approximately 8 million student loan borrowers enrolled in the SAVE repayment plan. These borrowers had been placed in zero-interest forbearance after courts halted the Biden-era program. The resumption of interest could increase monthly costs by an average of $300 for a typical borrower, according to one analysis. The Department of Education framed the decision as a step toward "fiscal responsibility," but it will create a new financial burden for millions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the "95% rule," a critical consumer protection feature of federally insured reverse mortgages. This rule stipulates that if heirs wish to keep the property after the borrower's death, they only need to pay the lesser of the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value. This prevents a situation where heirs would have to pay more than the home is worth, especially if the loan balance has grown significantly over time, providing them with a more manageable option to retain the family home.

This upward trend in inflation helps validate the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold its key interest rate steady, as it remains above the central bank's 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

While cleared of the main charges, the commission found that Paqueta had failed to fully cooperate with the investigation, and a sanction for that breach is still pending.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a 90-day extension for reaching a new trade deal with Mexico, keeping the current tariff agreement in place for the interim period. The decision, made after a call with Mexico's president, was attributed to the "complexities" of the cross-border trade relationship. This move provides temporary relief and more time for negotiations, coming just a day before a deadline that would have triggered higher punitive tariffs on goods from dozens of other countries that have not yet secured trade deals with the U.S.</p>
