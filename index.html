          <p>Following two days of high-level discussions in London, the United States and China have agreed on a framework to implement the Geneva trade consensus. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and China's international trade representative Li Chenggang both confirmed the agreement, which aims to stabilize the strained relationship between the two countries after accusations of Geneva trade agreement violations. The framework will now be presented to President Trump and President Xi for approval, signaling that some disagreements still require internal discussion, reflecting a mutual commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue, though concrete agreements remain uncertain. Optimism remains cautious as both nations seek to de-escalate trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in the Los Angeles area to support National Guard troops responding to protests over federal immigration enforcement, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to file a federal lawsuit to block their deployment. The Marines will integrate with the existing 2,100 National Guard members to protect federal personnel and property, having received training in de-escalation and crowd control. Attorney General Rob Bonta requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the use of federal troops for law enforcement, arguing their presence is causing irreparable damage, but the request was not immediately granted. The Trump administration argues the deployment is necessary to protect federal agents from violence amid criticism from local leaders who deem it counterproductive.</p>

          <p>An appellate court has granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that had blocked President Trump's tariffs, allowing them to remain in effect until at least the end of July. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for July 31, meaning the tariffs will stay in place unless further court action occurs. This ruling extends a legal battle over the tariffs, which were imposed on imports from various countries, including Canada, China, and Mexico, citing concerns over drugs and unauthorized immigration, with the administration justifying the tariffs using a 1977 law allowing the president to regulate imports during emergencies.</p>

          <p>The lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S., argues that his case is not just about immigration but about the erosion of due process rights. Chris Newman, representing Abrego Garcia's family, claims the Trump administration is using the case as a referendum on immigration, while he views it as a core constitutional issue. Abrego Garcia faces charges of human smuggling after being held in a supermax prison in El Salvador, despite a judge's prior ruling against his deportation. Newman accuses the administration of defying court orders and disparaging Abrego Garcia, while the administration maintains it has complied with court orders by returning him to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a curfew for downtown L.A. from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. in response to ongoing anti-ICE protests, citing the need to stop vandalism and looting.

The protests, sparked by recent immigration raids, have resulted in nearly 200 arrests and looting of 23 businesses, prompting President Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines, a move opposed by Governor Newsom. The mayor emphasized that the curfew is limited to a small area of the city and is a necessary measure to protect lives and property.</p>

          <p>A UN panel has urged the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, citing concerns that the agreement does not adequately guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, signed last month, returned sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius, but the UK retained the right to operate a military base on Diego Garcia. The UN experts argue that this arrangement hinders the Chagossians' right to return to their ancestral lands, from which they were expelled. The panel calls for the current deal to be suspended and a new agreement to be negotiated that respects the cultural rights of the Chagossian people.</p>

          <p>China’s J-20 stealth fighter has tripled its radar detection range due to advancements in silicon-carbide semiconductors led by scientist Xu Xiangang at Shandong University. This development has enabled Chinese radars to detect enemies swiftly, gaining a first-mover advantage. The silicon-carbide material enhances the range of Chinese radars, improves missile accuracy, and boosts the power of laser weapons, making it an indispensable asset in defense technology. Xu emphasized the importance of researchers addressing the country’s needs in developing this crucial technology.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration authorities have expanded raids into California's agricultural heartland, causing alarm among workers in farm fields and packinghouses from the Central Coast to the San Joaquin Valley. The raids have led to fear and disruption, with workers afraid to take their kids to school or go to the grocery store. Advocates estimate that at least half of the 255,700 farmworkers in California are undocumented. The expansion follows coordinated raids in urban areas of Los Angeles County, prompting protests and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines.</p>

The move has been criticized by medical groups, who claim it upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives and will erode public confidence.

Despite the crime rate being roughly the same for both groups, those with foreign appearances are disproportionately targeted.
