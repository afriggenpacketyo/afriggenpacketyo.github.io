          <p>A hot air balloon accident in Praia Grande, Brazil, resulted in at least eight fatalities, according to the governor of Santa Catarina. The balloon had 21 people on board, with 13 survivors, including the pilot. According to the pilot, a fire erupted inside the balloon's basket, prompting him to initiate a descent and instruct passengers to jump. Some passengers were unable to jump in time, and the balloon rose again due to the reduced weight before ultimately crashing, with survivors transported to nearby hospitals.</p>

          <p>Celebrities and influencers are expressing shock and concern after the owner of the gossip website Tattle Life, accused of facilitating stalking, harassment, and doxing, was revealed to be Sebastian Bond, a vegan influencer. Katie Price, a glamour model, described the platform as the "absolute worst for trolling," citing instances of private documents being posted and relentless abuse directed at her and her family. Other influencers, including Emily Clarkson and Carly Rowena, have also shared experiences of harassment and privacy violations on the site. Tattle Life defends its business model by stating that influencers who monetize their personal lives should be open to scrutiny, but many targeted individuals argue that the platform enables stalking and harassment.</p>

          <p>A yacht carrying approximately 400 people struck a dock in the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street in New York City, resulting in injuries to dozens of passengers.

          <p>Senator Alex Padilla criticized the Trump administration after Vice President JD Vance referred to him as “Jose” during a press conference in Los Angeles. Padilla, California’s first Latino senator, viewed the misnaming as intentional and reflective of the administration’s skewed priorities.

Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Lib Dems, emphasized the need for the UK to be better prepared given the threats posed by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. The plan aims to increase the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000. The Lib Dems also suggest distributing pamphlets to every British home to ensure war readiness and the scheme would be limited to 3,000 personnel, costing £60m from the defence budget.</p>

          <p>Japan has repatriated the remains of 10 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the country's first such repatriation. The remains, taken in the 19th and 20th centuries, were held by Japanese research institutions and handed over to Australian representatives in Tokyo. This action is part of a global movement to return the human remains of indigenous peoples taken abroad for research. The return of the remains allows for healing to begin for all generations, according to representatives of the Kaurna people.</p>
