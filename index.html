          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting an Instagram photo of seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," a phrase used by critics of President Trump. The post sparked outrage from the Trump administration, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleging it was a call for the assassination of the president. Comey later deleted the post, claiming he didn't realize the numbers were associated with violence and that he opposes violence of any kind. This article highlights the ongoing tension between Comey and the Trump administration, and the Secret Service is taking the rhetoric seriously.</p>

          <p>Romania is on the brink of a significant political shift as far-right candidate George Simion leads in the presidential elections. This article, a guest essay by Vladimir Bortun, attributes the rise of the far-right to decades of economic failure, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration, creating anti-establishment anger. Simion, a self-described Trumpist, could gain considerable power, including appointing a prime minister and directing foreign policy. The article emphasizes that both candidates in the runoff election share an allegiance to the business class, offering no fundamental change to the country’s economic framework, thus leaving ordinary people behind.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors sought safe havens amid trade tensions initiated by President Trump. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest monthly inflow since 1996. The article suggests that Trump's tariff policies altered global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy, leading them to diversify into markets like Japan.

          <p>A brain-dead woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, due to the state's abortion ban. The article details the case of Adriana Smith, who was declared brain-dead in February but remains on life support because state law prohibits abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Her family is upset that they cannot make decisions about her medical care, and doctors are concerned about the fetus's health, as it has fluid on the brain. This situation raises ethical and legal questions about fetal rights and the rights of families to make medical decisions for incapacitated loved ones.</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or become a “shock absorber” of tectonic upheavals in global trade imbalances. The article notes that the climbdown in superpower tensions has led to a mutual reduction in tariffs, but it does not meaningfully change a bleak outlook for Europe if it fails to quickly adapt to Washington’s efforts to reorder trade with China and the rest of the world. Experts suggest that without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe's ambition to become a 'third pole' risks remaining a slogan rather than a strategy.</p>

          <p>Car maker Nissan says it is open to sharing factories around the world with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as it shakes up its business. The article reports that Nissan could bring Dongfeng "into the Nissan production eco-system globally." This week, the struggling company said it would lay off 11,000 workers and shut seven factories but did not say where the cuts would be made. Nissan's own brands have struggled to make in-roads to China, which is the world's biggest car market, as stiff competition has led to falling prices.</p>

          <p>Lawyers increasingly seek out federal jurisdictions with sympathetic judges, a practice known as venue shopping, when taking divisive political issues to court. This article discusses a CBS News analysis of federal court data for cases seeking nationwide impact. Conservatives suing the Biden administration frequently tried to have their cases heard in tiny federal courts in Texas, while liberals challenging Trump's policies filed cases in larger venues, predominantly in the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now weighing in on the question of whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction.</p>
