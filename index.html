        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock market experienced a rebound following a positive update on nonfarm payrolls, which reported the addition of 139,000 jobs in May and an unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. While the job and wage gains exceeded expectations, they were partially offset by downward revisions to previous months' reports. The market reacted favorably, as investor sentiment had been on edge due to suboptimal labor market reports. The U.S. economy's reliance on private consumption makes low unemployment and rising wages crucial for sustained growth, suggesting that consumer buying power is rebounding even with rising prices.

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to lift a court order reinstating Education Department employees who were terminated as part of the administration's efforts to dismantle the agency. Officials argue that a U.S. District Judge lacked the authority to require the Education Department to rehire the workers, who were affected by mass layoffs intended to streamline the department and eliminate discretionary functions. A federal appeals court had previously refused to lift the judge's ruling, which highlighted the closure of civil rights enforcement offices and the elimination of the FAFSA supervision team due to the staff cuts. The administration maintains that these cuts are in line with their policy of delegating more responsibilities to the states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ange Postecoglou has been dismissed as Tottenham manager just 16 days after leading the team to victory in the Europa League final, marking their first major trophy in 17 years.

Postecoglou had expressed optimism about the team's future, but his tenure ended abruptly, two years to the day since he joined the club from Celtic on a four-year contract.

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules that would require UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023.

UBS shares initially jumped following the announcement, but the bank expressed strong disagreement with the "extreme" increase in capital requirements.

          <p>Used vehicle prices experienced a slight decrease in May after reaching a recent high in April, as consumers rushed to purchase vehicles amid concerns about potential price hikes due to tariffs. According to Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, wholesale prices decreased by 1.5% from April to May but remained 4% higher than the previous year. While tariffs do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices and demand influence the used car market. Demand has remained relatively strong, while inventory levels remain low due to consumers holding onto their vehicles longer and reduced production in recent years.</p>

Some staffers fear they could become targets of political retribution or that their association with DOGE could become a professional liability. Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon has called for investigations into Musk, potentially impacting DOGE. Despite the feud, Trump previously praised DOGE, while Musk downplayed the initiative's dependence on him. The article reports that some DOGE staffers are seeking employment elsewhere, though tech companies like Coinbase have expressed interest in hiring DOGE alumni.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that fecal transplants, while promising for restoring gut microbiomes, may introduce unintended health risks. Researchers found that "mismatches" between donor fecal matter and the recipient's gut environment could have negative consequences on immune and metabolic function. The study, conducted in mice, human tissue samples, and with a small volunteer group, indicates that microbes from one region of the gut can colonize the entire intestinal tract, altering genes and proteins. Experts suggest that greater care should be taken in designing fecal transplants to use specific, targeted microbes for the intestines, emphasizing the need for further research to assess potential negative health outcomes.</p>
