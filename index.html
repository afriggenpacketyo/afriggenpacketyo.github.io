          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers from various parties visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a site viewed by neighboring Asian countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The shrine honors war criminals alongside war dead, causing diplomatic friction with China and South Korea, who suffered under Japanese wartime aggression. Despite the controversy, the cross-party group regularly visits the shrine for major festivals and anniversaries, highlighting ongoing tensions related to historical interpretations and national identity in East Asia. This year's visit follows Prime Minister Ishiba's ritual offering to the shrine, although he did not attend in person.</p>

          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a sharp decline after President Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of being slow to lower interest rates. Trump's remarks exacerbated market turmoil already fueled by concerns over his tariff policies and potential economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all fell significantly, while gold prices reached a record high as investors sought safe-haven assets. This escalating conflict between the president and the Fed chair adds uncertainty to the economic outlook and financial markets.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge the freeze on over $2.2 billion in federal grants, triggered by Harvard's refusal to limit campus activism. The administration demanded reforms related to diversity, admissions policies, and student clubs, citing concerns about antisemitism. Harvard argues the funding freeze violates its First Amendment rights and impedes critical research, while the White House defends its actions as ending a "gravy train" for institutions failing to meet basic conditions for taxpayer funds. This legal battle underscores the escalating tensions between the Trump administration and universities over academic freedom and political influence.</p>

The family is advocating for the reclassification of ketamine to Class A and a comprehensive strategy involving education, police, and health services.

          <p>The weakening US dollar is causing central banks worldwide to carefully consider their next moves, caught between the benefits of currency devaluation and the risks of inflation and capital flight. While a weaker dollar eases the debt burden for emerging markets and allows room for interest rate cuts, it also complicates export competitiveness and could provoke retaliatory trade measures from the U.S. Many central banks are avoiding aggressive devaluation to prevent currency wars and maintain economic stability. The European Central Bank, for instance, has cautiously cut rates, while others, like Indonesia, are hesitant due to currency volatility.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods are significantly impacting dropshipping businesses, which rely on sourcing products from China. The cumulative tariff of 145% is putting pressure on profit margins and causing delays in shipments. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, is expected to further disrupt the industry. Some businesses are shifting focus to the European market and diversifying their supply chains to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
