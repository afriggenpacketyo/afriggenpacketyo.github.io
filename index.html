          <h2>Scientists Map Neural Pathways of Consciousness in Macaques</h2>

          <p>Chinese and French scientists have created a detailed map of the claustrum in crab-eating macaques, a brain region thought to be involved in consciousness. The map details connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain areas, potentially aiding understanding of cognitive functions like memory and abstract thinking. The team also identified differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, offering insights into the evolutionary origins of consciousness. This research contributes to ongoing efforts to understand how consciousness arises in the brain and why human awareness differs from that of other animals.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is reportedly experiencing significant internal turmoil, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth facing scrutiny for sharing sensitive war plans on the Signal app with individuals outside the government, including family members.

While President Trump has voiced support for Hegseth, questions are being raised about his suitability for the role, and potential replacements are being discussed. The situation has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle, with some calling for Hegseth's removal.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his administration cannot provide trials for everyone it wants to deport, claiming it would take 200 years. This comes amid increasing deportations of Venezuelan migrants, many without criminal records, under a wartime law. The US Supreme Court halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, requiring due process for detainees. Lawyers had argued the Trump administration was deporting migrants without judicial review.</p>

          <p>Canada's federal election is seeing a shift in focus, with top candidates emphasizing fossil fuels as climate change concerns take a backseat. Liberal leader Mark Carney is promoting Canada as a superpower in both conventional and green energy, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre wants to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the carbon tax. This shift reflects changing voter priorities, with concerns over rising prices and energy costs outweighing climate worries. The election is also heavily influenced by the threat posed by US President Donald Trump and his potential impact on Canada's economy.</p>

          <p>A legal challenge in Colorado is testing the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. Immigrants' rights groups argue that people facing deportation are not being given adequate notice to fight their deportation orders in court. The ACLU argues that 24 hours' notice is not reasonable for detainees who may not speak English or have access to legal counsel.
