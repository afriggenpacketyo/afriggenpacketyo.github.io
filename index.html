          <h2>Snap Shares Plunge After Company Cites Advertising Concerns and Withholds Guidance</h2>

          <p>Snap shares experienced a significant drop of over 15% after the social media company decided to withhold its second-quarter guidance, attributing the decision to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Snap's finance chief, Derek Andersen, noted that some advertisers are already feeling the impact of changes to the de minimis exemption, which currently allows shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free without tariffs. The company reported that ad revenues grew by 9% year-over-year, reaching $1.21 billion during the quarter, but expressed caution about future advertising demand due to broader economic conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP declining at an annual rate of 0.3%, according to the Commerce Department, largely due to increased imports as businesses tried to get ahead of new tariffs. While underlying economic growth remained solid, the chaotic start to President Trump’s second term and his shifting tariff plans have created uncertainty and roiled financial markets. Economists widely expect spending and investment to slow in the coming months as tariffs drive up prices and businesses remain cautious, potentially leading to a slower economy and stalled hiring.

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of breaking its promise to establish five local inquiries into grooming gangs, alleging that only one inquiry has been delivered despite pledges of £5 million in funding. During Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch suggested that Labour was obstructing inquiries to shield Labour-run councils from scandal, while Sir Keir Starmer defended Labour's record on delivering justice for victims of grooming gangs. The exchange occurred amid growing demands for transparency regarding which areas are conducting grooming gang inquiries, alongside a national evidence audit led by Baroness Louise Casey.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has attributed the recent contraction of the U.S. economy to his predecessor, Joe Biden, while defending his sweeping tariff policies. Trump claimed that the negative GDP and market declines were a result of Biden's policies, which is inaccurate according to the Commerce Department, which noted that the GDP figure reflects a wave of imports made by companies to get ahead of Trump's tariffs. Despite the negative economic data, Trump asserted that his promised "boom" will "take a while" and urged supporters to "be patient."</p>

These tactics include deception, vague promises, exploiting divisions within Western alliances, and using bazaar-style haggling, all intended to maximize gains with minimal concessions.</p>

          <p>The US is experiencing a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with fatalities down 26% in 2024, marking a substantial improvement after years of crisis. Experts attribute the downturn to factors such as the end of pandemic-related isolation, increased awareness of fentanyl risks, expanded access to addiction treatments, and the widespread availability of naloxone (Narcan). However, proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration threaten to reduce federal spending on opioid treatments, potentially reversing the progress made in curbing the opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>Javier Salazar, a 19-year-old from Maryland, was detained by ICE and faces deportation under the Trump administration's immigration policies, despite having no criminal record and a pending asylum case. Salazar, who came to the US as an unaccompanied minor in 2022, was labeled an alleged member of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang based on social media activity. His case highlights concerns about due process and the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants without proper legal recourse, raising questions about the fairness of the immigration system.</p>

          <p>The first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term have been marked by several notable trends, including tariffs causing market declines and rising prices, mass pardons for January 6 criminals, and increased reliance on executive actions. Emission forecasts from US oil and gas production have risen, and ICE arrests have ramped up, reaching the highest levels in seven years. Government websites have been scrubbed, and Trump's approval rating has flipped, reflecting the significant changes and policies implemented during this period.</p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on members of the European Parliament and their families, signaling a potential thaw in relations amid growing transatlantic strains caused by President Trump's policies. The move is seen as a charm offensive aimed at distancing Europe from Washington's orbit, with Beijing hoping to revive a bilateral investment pact that was frozen due to human rights concerns. The announcement was made by European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, who emphasized the importance of engagement and dialogue with China.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's tariff strategy is strengthening ties between China and other Global South nations, rather than driving a wedge between them. Facing duties of up to 245%, China and Brazil have increased high-level engagement since the tariff chaos began, with calls for opposing "the law of the jungle" together. Analysts suggest that the American president's trade war is likely to foster greater cooperation and impetus for joint efforts in the global governance system.</p>

Blair suggests that net zero has lost public support due to perceived costs and impracticalities, advocating for a focus on technological solutions like carbon capture. His position, coinciding with substantial donations from a Trump-affiliated tech billionaire, raises questions about corporate influence and challenges the traditional understanding of his role in progressive politics.</p>

          <p>The US economy experienced an unforeseen contraction of 0.3% in the first three months of President Donald Trump's term, according to preliminary data. This downturn, attributed to increased imports and decreased government spending, has raised concerns about a potential slowdown amid a global trade war. President Trump blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the economic downturn, while analysts attributed it to businesses stockpiling in anticipation of future tariffs.</p>
