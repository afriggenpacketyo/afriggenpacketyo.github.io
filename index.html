          <p>The U.S. Senate rejected both a House-passed Republican funding bill and a Democratic counter-proposal, bringing the federal government closer to a shutdown with the October 1 deadline looming. Bipartisan negotiations have stalled as leaders from both parties remain entrenched in their positions, trading blame for the legislative impasse. With Congress scheduled for a recess, the path forward to keep government services funded remains unclear, creating uncertainty for federal operations and employees.</p>

          <p>The NATO military alliance scrambled jets to intercept three Russian MiG-31 warplanes that violated the airspace of Estonia, a member nation. Estonian officials condemned the incursion as "unprecedentedly brazen" and have requested Article 4 consultations, a formal process for urgent discussions within the alliance.

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz sharply criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's threats against ABC's broadcast license over comments made by host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared Carr's remarks, which suggested the network could face repercussions, to tactics used by the mafia, calling the government intervention "dangerous as hell." Despite disagreeing with Kimmel's views, Cruz defended the principle of free speech, warning that allowing the government to silence media it dislikes would ultimately harm conservatives and undermine fundamental rights.</p>

          <p>Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, has publicly supported late-night host Jimmy Kimmel following the suspension of his show by ABC. In a social media post, Eisner condemned the "out-of-control intimidation" from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, whose threats preceded the network's decision. Eisner questioned the state of leadership and free speech, suggesting constitutional protections should not be contingent on political or financial self-interest, while also praising Kimmel's talent and humor.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing escalating grocery bills, with food prices experiencing their fastest monthly increase since 2022. According to industry analysts, three primary factors are contributing to this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods, the effects of climate change on agricultural production, and a significant shortage of farm labor in the United States. These pressures increase costs for food companies, which are then passed on to shoppers through higher prices or "shrinkflation."</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has led to a decrease in mortgage rates, providing financial relief for homebuyers and homeowners. For a $750,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the monthly payment is now approximately $450 lower than it was at the start of the year, translating to over $5,000 in annual savings. This shift enhances affordability for new buyers and creates compelling refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners, with the potential for further rate cuts later this year.

He believes that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will likely be a temporary, "one-time effect," which provides the central bank with room to ease monetary policy further. Kashkari's more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and his assessment that long-term inflation expectations remain under control. (not investment advice)</p>
