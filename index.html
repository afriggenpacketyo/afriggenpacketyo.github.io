            <p>Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman expressed relief and support for President Trump's temporary pause on reciprocal tariffs, praising Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Ackman initially warned of an "economic nuclear winter" due to the tariffs, but now believes the pause creates an opportunity for trade negotiations. He advises China to engage directly with President Trump, whom he considers a tough but fair negotiator. Ackman's comments reflect a shift in his perspective as he now sees potential benefits in Trump's approach to trade. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Social Security Administration is implementing new anti-fraud protections, including stricter identity verification, under the Trump administration's directive to curb waste and abuse. While all claim types can still be completed over the telephone, the agency's website outages and long wait times raise concerns about accessibility for vulnerable populations. Experts and advocates worry that the new policies may make accessing benefits more difficult, especially for seniors and people with disabilities.

            <p>President Trump partially reversed his plan to increase tariffs on countries worldwide, with the exception of China. The pause on tariffs led to a significant market rally, reversing previous losses. However, tariffs on Chinese imports will increase to 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the pause resulted from countries offering to negotiate, but some question whether the pause was due to market pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to halt lower court decisions that voided President Trump's firings of members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board.

Its release comes less than three months into a second Donald Trump administration that cited fentanyl trafficking as justification for tariffs it placed on China, Mexico and Canada.</p>
