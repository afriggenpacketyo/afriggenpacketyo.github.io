          <p>Zheng Yongnian advocates for China to establish its own robust artificial intelligence knowledge system, asserting the need to move beyond Western-centric social science theories. He highlights concerns about "intellectual colonialism" in the AI era, arguing that existing Western frameworks are insufficient to explain complex non-Western civilizations like Confucian society. By fully embracing its secular civilization, China can develop unique AI approaches and play a more fitting role in the evolving international order. This perspective underscores the critical importance of cultural and philosophical context in guiding technological advancement and shaping global influence in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Salt Lake City, Utah, arrested two men on suspicion of placing an incendiary device under a news media vehicle. The bomb, found near an occupied building, had been lit but failed to function as designed, prompting a swift response from police and fire department bomb squads. Subsequent investigations led the FBI to serve a search warrant at a Magna home, uncovering explosives, firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons. The suspects, aged 58 and 31, face potential charges related to weapons possession and threats of terrorism, though a motive remains undisclosed.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has criticized Lord Mandelson's past appointment as UK ambassador to the US, alleging systemic corruption. Mandelson was recently sacked after emails surfaced showing his supportive messages to Epstein during 2008 sex offense charges. Business Secretary Peter Kyle conceded that the appointment would have been unlikely had the full extent of Mandelson's relationship with Epstein been known at the time. Giuffre's family, still seeking accountability after her death, continues to demand thorough investigations into all individuals connected to Epstein.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 26.6% of car trade-ins towards new purchases are "underwater," meaning owners owe more than their vehicle's value, marking a four-year high. This trend, with an average negative equity of $6,754, forces consumers to either pay the balance in cash or roll it into a new loan, exacerbating debt. Experts advise maintaining current vehicles if possible, understanding credit scores, and seeking pre-approvals for new loans to secure better terms. Additionally, gap insurance is recommended for those with negative equity to protect against financial loss if a vehicle is totaled. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC reports a tragic surge in maternal and infant deaths in Afghanistan, directly linked to the closure of over 400 medical facilities after the Trump administration abruptly cut US aid. One harrowing account details Shahnaz, who died in childbirth with her baby after finding her local clinic shuttered, unable to afford further travel. The US justified aid withdrawal due to concerns about funds benefiting the Taliban, an allegation the Taliban denies. These closures, compounded by the Taliban's restrictions on women's education and healthcare training, have created a severe and escalating health crisis.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury's has officially terminated discussions with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise retailer, Argos. JD.com reportedly sought materially revised terms and commitments, which Sainsbury's determined were not in the best interest of its shareholders. Despite the cessation of talks, Sainsbury's reaffirmed its expectation to achieve a retail underlying operating profit of approximately £1 billion in the upcoming 2025-2026 financial year. The decision concludes a significant potential international acquisition for Argos.</p>

          <p>NFL running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his nearly $80 million earnings in a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds, including AI firm Anthropic and Elon Musk's Neuralink. Barkley, who funds his lifestyle from endorsement deals, adopted this strategy to build generational wealth, inspired by Peter Thiel's "Zero to One." His investments also include mobile payments app Strike, with marketing earnings converted to Bitcoin. This move reflects a calculated shift towards riskier startup investing after a career-threatening injury in 2020 prompted financial reflection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her bid for Labour's deputy leadership, strongly advocating for party unity to secure a second term and effectively counter Reform UK.

Phillipson, who is competing against former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell, warned against internal divisions, asserting that disunity would only benefit Nigel Farage. The contest, viewed by some as a referendum on the Prime Minister's leadership, aims to solidify the party's future direction.</p>

          <p>UCLA has terminated head football coach DeShaun Foster after a dismal 0-3 start to the season and only five victories in 15 games. The abrupt dismissal, made in consultation with the chancellor, aims to signal a new direction for the program, which faced widespread ridicule and was the only winless team in the Big Ten. Tim Skipper will serve as interim coach while a comprehensive national search for a permanent replacement commences. Foster's inexperience and the team's poor performance, including consistent penalties and lack of passion, led to his early departure.</p>

          <p>Romania, a NATO member, reported a Russian drone breached its airspace, marking the second such incursion into NATO territory following a similar incident in Poland. Romanian F-16 jets tracked the drone near the Ukrainian border during ongoing Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure along the Danube. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky explicitly labeled the incident an "obvious expansion of the war." This event significantly raises concerns about the security of NATO's eastern flank, prompting Poland to deploy preventative aviation and ground-based air defense systems in response to the escalating threat.</p>
