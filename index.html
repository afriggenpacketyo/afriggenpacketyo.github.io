The meeting, the sixth of the "Weimar+" group, included representatives from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the EU, led by British Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Lammy is expected to announce sanctions targeting those backing the Russian invasion, emphasizing the need for collective security in the face of Washington's policy shift under President Donald Trump.

          <p>Germany and Israel are marking the 60th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations, overshadowed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is visiting Berlin to commemorate the occasion with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, including a visit to the "Platform 17" Holocaust memorial. Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledges Germany's special responsibility for Israel's security, a principle described by Angela Merkel as "reason of state." Despite growing criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, German politicians reiterate Israel's right to defend itself following the 2023 Hamas attacks, though they also emphasize the need to adhere to international law and humanitarian obligations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports of Donald Trump's administration potentially accepting a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked ethical concerns, prompting a review of the rules surrounding presidential gifts. US presidents have a history of accepting gifts from foreign powers, ranging from Queen Victoria's Resolute Desk to animals. The US Constitution's emoluments clause prohibits government officeholders from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional approval. Gifts valued over $480 are considered gifts to the United States and must be logged and disposed of by the White House Gift Unit, often transferred to the National Archives or presidential libraries.</p>

          <p>The United States and China concluded trade talks in Geneva, with both sides reporting "substantial progress" but offering limited details. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer described the outcome as a "deal," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted an "important consensus" and the establishment of a "consultation mechanism." The negotiations aimed to ease tensions following President Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports, which prompted retaliatory duties from China, disrupting trade and impacting the global economy. Markets reacted positively to the news, but analysts cautioned against premature optimism, emphasizing the need for significant tariff reductions.</p>

Zelenskyy expressed hope for a ceasefire starting Monday and stated he would await Putin in Turkey on Thursday, following US President Donald Trump's urging for Ukraine to accept Russia's offer for direct talks. This comes after European leaders and Ukraine insisted on a 30-day truce before negotiations, a proposal Moscow effectively rejected. Macron expressed skepticism toward Moscow's intentions, emphasizing that an unconditional ceasefire should precede negotiations.</p>

Despite his detention, Philippine law allows candidates facing criminal charges to run for office unless convicted and having exhausted all appeals. The midterm elections are seen as crucial in determining the political future of Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who faces an impeachment trial in the Senate. The election results could signal the end of the Duterte family's dominance in Philippine politics if Sara is convicted, while other family members are also running for various positions.</p>

          <p>Many of Monday's UK newspapers focus on the government's new plans to control migration levels, including English language tests for accompanying adults and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad. The government aims to seize the narrative from Reform UK, with Sir Keir Starmer emphasizing that new immigrants must earn the "privilege, not right" to settle. The Daily Express reports that migrants must wait ten years to become British under the new "crackdown." Metro leads with Ukrainian President Zelensky agreeing to hold direct negotiations with Putin after pressure from the US president.</p>

          <p>The US and China have reported progress in trade talks held in Switzerland, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent describing the discussions as "productive and constructive," and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng calling them "in-depth" and "candid." The White House referred to it as a "trade deal" but provided no specific details, with a joint statement expected on Monday. These were the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with a 125% levy on some US goods, causing turmoil in financial markets.</p>

          <p>Despite facing international court charges of crimes against humanity, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte remains popular in the Philippines. Supporters have sent flowers and cards to his detention center in The Hague, and he is expected to win another term as mayor of Davao City in the upcoming midterm elections. His arrest has divided the Philippines, with some polls showing support for the international investigation, while many believe he is a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The Duterte family continues to thrive in Davao, with his children also running for office.</p>

          <p>Britain is increasing its defense spending, aiming to boost local jobs and prosperity beyond just nuclear submarines, with Barrow-in-Furness serving as a potential model. The government plans to increase military spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027 and 3 percent by the end of the decade, ensuring the money creates domestic jobs and generates local prosperity. Barrow will receive £200 million in government funding over the next decade, with BAE Systems teaming up with local and national governments to rejuvenate the town.

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled the world’s most advanced ocean simulation system, LICOMK++, with a resolution of 1km, defying US semiconductor export controls. This system, developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, breaks computational barriers to deliver precision in modelling global ocean dynamics and climate patterns. Dubbed an ocean “microscope”, it enables scientists to analyze intricate processes like eddies and heat transport, enhancing predictions for extreme weather events. This innovation underscores China’s push to overcome high-performance computing challenges and achieve self-reliance in critical technologies amid Western embargoes.</p>

The elections will decide over 18,000 jobs, with the Senate seats being crucial due to Duterte's upcoming impeachment trial. Marcos is fighting for his political and economic agenda, while the feuding duo, once allies, have had a long-brewing conflict that escalated with Duterte's impeachment for alleged high crimes and her father's arrest by the ICC.

Despite efforts by successive governments to reduce net migration, numbers have remained historically high. Brexit, while intended to provide greater control over immigration, has not led to a decrease in net migration figures. The latest data is expected to show a significant fall in 2024, but the overall trend of rising legal migration remains a challenge for policymakers.</p>

He stated that American products cannot compete with cheaper alternatives, leading to economic suffering in the US. Mahathir suggests items like Apple iPhones produced in China and India will become more expensive due to tariffs. ASEAN can weather the impact with intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States, according to Mahathir.</p>
