          <p>One California Plaza, a 42-story tower on Bunker Hill in Los Angeles, has been placed into receivership after its owners defaulted on a $300-million debt. The building's value has plummeted by 74% from its peak, now appraised at just $121.2 million, with its occupancy dropping to 62%. This event highlights the severe distress in the downtown L.A. commercial real estate market, which is grappling with the rise of remote work, elevated interest rates, and public safety concerns.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a recently retired command sergeant major reflects on the unsettling presence of armed National Guard soldiers on the streets and public transit of Washington D.C. He draws parallels to his experiences in war zones like Baghdad, arguing that deploying young, inexperienced soldiers in roles they are not trained for erodes the crucial trust between the military and the civilian population. The author warns that normalizing such patrols risks undermining the very democratic principles the military is meant to defend.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, attorney Abbe Lowell vehemently denied that his client, Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, ever committed mortgage fraud. The filing is part of a lawsuit to block President Trump from firing her, arguing that the allegations are a pretext for the president's true goal of pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates. Lowell emphasized that all relevant financial information was disclosed to the White House and Senate during her confirmation process, suggesting the claims are politically motivated.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that Republicans are committed to transparency regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, following a meeting with victims. However, this commitment is tested by internal party divisions, as Rep. Thomas Massie has filed a discharge petition to force a floor vote on compelling the Justice Department to release the files, a move that bypasses GOP leadership. Johnson opposes the petition, arguing it lacks sufficient protections for victims, while Massie believes he has the necessary support to proceed.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the headquarters for U.S. Space Command will be moved from its current location in Colorado to Huntsville, Alabama, reversing a decision made by the Biden administration. Trump explicitly linked the move to his disapproval of Colorado's mail-in voting system, which he called "corrupt," stating it played a "big factor" in the decision. The relocation to the Republican stronghold is expected to bring thousands of jobs and significant investment to Alabama.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee Program on October 1, which permitted Prime members to share their free two-day shipping benefits with one other person living outside their household. The company is now consolidating this feature into its Amazon Family program, which requires all members sharing benefits to have the same primary residential address. This change eliminates a popular loophole for sharing Prime perks and encourages individuals at different addresses to purchase their own memberships.</p>

This statement provides a clear, high-profile example of how AI is already beginning to replace certain jobs within the tech industry itself, fueling ongoing debates about workforce displacement.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin saw a slight price increase on Tuesday, moving counter to a general downturn in the stock market, which was reacting negatively to concerns about the legality of President Trump's global tariffs. While the cryptocurrency reclaimed the $110,000 level, its performance was outshined by gold, which surged to a new all-time high. This divergence suggests that while some investors see crypto as a hedge, traditional safe-haven assets like gold remain dominant during periods of economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The Trump family's significant holdings of 22.5 billion tokens are currently locked, meaning they cannot be sold yet, as the new digital asset experiences extreme early volatility.

          <p>To address a massive and growing backlog in immigration courts, the U.S. Justice Department has authorized about 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges. The move follows a recent change that lowered the qualifications for the temporary role, notably removing the requirement for prior experience in immigration law. This controversial measure aims to expedite the processing of millions of cases but has raised concerns about the legal expertise and preparedness of the appointed military personnel.</p>

          <p>Howard Webb, the chief refereeing officer for the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has publicly stated that the decision to disallow a goal for Fulham during their recent match against Chelsea was a "misjudgement."

Webb acknowledged the call was incorrect and did not meet the high threshold required for a VAR intervention to overturn an on-field decision.</p>
