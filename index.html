Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine reported that all three targeted sites, including Natanz and Isfahan, sustained severe damage. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed no increase in off-site radiation levels following the strikes and will hold an emergency meeting. Operation Midnight Hammer involved over 125 aircraft and employed advanced deception tactics, marking the first operational use of 30,000-pound GBU 57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators.

          <p>The U.S. launched "Operation Midnight Hammer," a top-secret precision attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, utilizing B-2 stealth bombers and Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs. The mission involved over 125 aircraft, including seven B-2 bombers launched from the U.S., which flew 18 hours with multiple midair refuelings to reach their targets. According to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been "obliterated" following the strikes on the Natanz and Fordow sites. The operation was designed to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, with the U.S. stating that the country was close to achieving that goal. The U.S. has stated that they are open to peace.</p>

Those holding valid U.S. visas can purchase property, but only for use as a primary residence, preventing the purchase of investment properties.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the U.S. is "at war with Iran's nuclear program," not with Iran itself, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Vance stated that the strikes had substantially set back Iran's nuclear program, potentially delaying their ability to develop a nuclear weapon by years. While he couldn't definitively confirm the complete destruction of Iran's nuclear facilities, he assured Americans that the program is significantly further away from its goals. Vance also addressed the possibility of Iranian retaliation, asserting that the U.S. would respond with overwhelming force, but emphasized that the Trump administration is not seeking regime change. The goal is to eliminate the Iranian nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Senator Tim Kaine criticized President Trump's strikes on Iran as an unconstitutional act of war, emphasizing that Congress needs to authorize military action against Iran. Kaine argued that the strikes were initiated without congressional consultation or notification, violating the War Powers Resolution. He dismissed the Vice President's description of the conflict as a "war against Iran's nuclear program" as misleading. Kaine expressed concern for the safety of U.S. troops in the Middle East and questioned the urgency of the strikes, especially given recent diplomatic talks and Israel's assessment that the Iranian nuclear program had been set back. Kaine is concerned about the safety of U.S. troops.</p>

          <p>The world's largest shipowners organization, Bimco, warns of increased threats to commercial shipping in the waters around the Arabian Peninsula following the U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. They expect that U.S. warships and merchant ships affiliated with Israel or the U.S. would be the preferred targets for the Iranians. Maersk has temporarily suspended port calls to Haifa, Israel's largest container port. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, could face wider disruption through attacks on merchant ships or the laying of sea mines. Freight rates from Shanghai to Jebel Ali have already surged, reflecting the heightened risk. Commercial shipping is at risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran faces three strategic options: retaliate immediately, retaliate later, or not retaliate at all. Retaliating immediately carries significant risks, including potential escalation and further US attacks. Potential targets include US bases in the Middle East, US Navy warships, and commercial shipping. Retaliating later involves waiting for tensions to subside before launching a surprise attack. Not retaliating could spare Iran from further attacks but may weaken the regime's image. The survival of the Islamic Republic regime will be paramount in their decision-making process. The Iranian government may retaliate.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's decision to bomb nuclear sites in Iran without congressional authorization weakens American democracy. The author contrasts this with the 2002 vote authorizing the Iraq War, which allowed for public debate, accountability, and civic engagement. By bypassing Congress, Trump deprived Americans of representation and the ability to hold their representatives accountable. The trend of denying the public democratic channels to oppose war is dangerous and can lead to radicalization. Citizens are left with no recourse.</p>
