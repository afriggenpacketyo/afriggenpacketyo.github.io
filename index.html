          <h2>Researchers Explore Using Sharks as Next-Generation Hurricane Forecasters</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative effort to improve hurricane forecasting, researchers are fitting sharks with sensors to collect critical ocean data. The project, led by the University of Delaware in collaboration with NOAA, aims to turn sharks into mobile ocean sensors, gathering information on water temperature and conductivity that is difficult to obtain otherwise. As record sea surface temperatures fuel stronger hurricanes, this data could provide vital insights into a storm's potential intensity and path. While still in early stages, the plan is to eventually tag dozens of sharks annually to feed data into hurricane computer models.</p>

          <p>A shooting inside a University of New Mexico dormitory during new student orientation resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and injury to a 19-year-old. Authorities report that four people were playing video games when an 18-year-old suspect began shooting, and he has since been taken into custody. The incident prompted a campus lockdown and has been described by a state representative as a traumatic event that impacted the community's sense of safety. The university has made counseling services available to students and staff in the wake of the violence.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched in Tunisia's capital to protest what they call President Kais Saied's increasingly authoritarian regime, chanting for its downfall. The protest marked the fourth anniversary of Saied's 2021 power grab, when he dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree. Critics and human rights groups state that Saied has since dismantled democratic institutions, jailed political opponents, and used vague legal charges to crush dissent. Protesters rallied under the banner "The Republic is a large prison," demanding the release of jailed opposition leaders, journalists, and activists, and a restoration of democracy.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing over 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through the Trump administration's deferred resignation program. This buyout initiative, aimed at reducing the size and cost of the federal workforce, would shrink NASA's civil servant personnel from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. The departures come as the agency faces a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and a recent leadership crisis. NASA maintains that safety remains a top priority as it works to become a more streamlined organization.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that one of two military-grade hand grenades recovered from a Santa Monica complex is missing following a blast that killed three Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has determined that only one of the devices detonated at the training academy where they were taken to be rendered safe. An extensive search for the second grenade has been unsuccessful, and the ATF is now leading the investigation into its whereabouts. The Sheriff’s Department is also conducting an independent review of its explosive disposal policies.</p>

While committing to get aid in, Starmer has maintained that recognizing statehood must be part of a broader plan for a two-state solution.

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a historic mass recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The referendum could potentially shift the balance of power, giving President Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) control of parliament, which it lost in the 2024 elections. The recall effort was initiated by civic groups after KMT lawmakers, accused of being beholden to China, obstructed the president's agenda and pushed controversial parliamentary reforms.

The California Public Utilities Commission stated that any service offered to the public, including a planned "friends and family" service, must use non-autonomous vehicles with a human driver in control at all times. This restriction means Tesla's service in California will function more like a traditional car service under its existing permit, rather than a true robotaxi.

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff blaming Hamas for showing a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire" and recalling the American negotiating team. The talks are deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and Israel's insistence on Hamas's disarmament. This diplomatic breakdown occurs as the United Nations issues dire warnings about the humanitarian situation, stating that children are starving to death due to the blockade. Aid agencies report that severe malnutrition is spreading rapidly, with thousands of children in urgent need of treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The direct involvement of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell has been described as highly unorthodox and concerning by multiple former federal prosecutors. They argue that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge to assess credibility, not high-ranking political appointees. Critics suggest the move appears to be a political effort to address public pressure rather than a standard investigative procedure. The situation is further complicated by the recent firing of the lead prosecutor in the Maxwell case, raising questions about the interview's integrity and purpose.</p>

          <p>An article explores the science behind common health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and taking 10,000 steps a day. Health experts weigh in, suggesting there is often more nuance and flexibility than the strict numbers imply. For instance, a kidney specialist argues that thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most people, while a nutritionist sees value in a target. While the seven-to-nine-hour sleep recommendation is considered crucial, experts advise adapting exercise goals to fit one's lifestyle, emphasizing consistency over achieving a perfect score on every metric.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, with researchers focusing on the unique ways elite athletics affect the female body, moving away from treating athletes as "mini-men." Studies are examining breast biomechanics and how proper sports bras can improve performance by up to a mile in a marathon. Other research explores the nuanced impact of the menstrual cycle on performance and the higher risk of certain injuries, like ACL tears, in female athletes. This new focus on female-specific physiology is helping to improve performance, reduce injuries, and keep more women and girls engaged in sports.</p>

In an interview, Wallace attributed some comments to his background and recent autism diagnosis but denied the more serious claims. He also defended his former co-host John Torode, who was also axed over a racism allegation, stating Torode is not a racist despite their not getting along personally.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the food boxes being distributed in Gaza by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised concerns among nutritional experts. While the boxes, containing items like pasta, lentils, and flour, provide calories, experts told the BBC they lack crucial vitamins and minerals. One professor described the contents as providing a "full stomach but an empty diet," which could lead to deficiency diseases like anemia and scurvy over time. This comes as the UN warns of a deepening starvation crisis, with a lack of clean water and fuel making it difficult for Gazans to cook the provided dried goods.</p>

          <p>In a modern twist on civic duty, the U.S. Treasury Department is now allowing Americans to make donations to help pay down the national debt using the mobile payment app Venmo. The "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program has long accepted contributions, but the addition of Venmo, alongside PayPal and traditional methods, targets a younger, more tech-savvy demographic. As of this writing, the national debt stands at over $36 trillion, having grown every year since 2001. Since 1996, voluntary public donations have totaled around $67.3 million, a small fraction of the government's annual spending.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after 'Big Brother' debuted, a new analysis explores the complex and often underestimated impact of reality television on society. While often criticized as superficial or harmful, some psychologists and social experts argue the genre has had positive effects. By casting diverse, ordinary people and showcasing raw emotions and difficult situations, reality TV can foster social understanding and destigmatize issues related to health, disability, and relationships. It has prompted national conversations on topics from racism to gaslighting, potentially helping viewers build empathy and gain insights into perspectives outside their own experiences.</p>

In response, Newsom is threatening to fight fire with fire by exploring ways to redraw California's own districts to favor Democrats, a departure from the state's independent commission process.

The situation is exacerbated by poor harvests in key growing regions like Kyoto, which have been hit by record-breaking heatwaves, and a shortage of young farmers. This has led to retailers limiting purchases and prices rising, with further increases expected due to new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods.</p>
