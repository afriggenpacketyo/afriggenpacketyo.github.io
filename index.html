          <p>Law enforcement in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, has identified 20-year-old Wess Roley as the suspect in a deadly ambush that killed two firefighters and critically injured a third. Authorities believe Roley intentionally started the Nettleton Gulch Fire to lure the first responders into a sniper position. The suspect was found deceased at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The motive remains under investigation, though his family expressed shock, stating he had previously aspired to be a firefighter himself.</p>

The public rebuke comes just weeks after the Trump Organization licensed its name for a new wireless service, Trump Mobile, which operates over all major carrier networks, including AT&T. Trump's comments caused a temporary dip in AT&T's stock price. This incident is another example of the president's commercial interests overlapping with his official capacity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially lifting most U.S. sanctions against Syria, a move aimed at supporting the country's path toward peace and stability under its new interim government. This action follows a promise made to Syria's new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, and is intended to give the new leadership an opportunity to rebuild. While the broader sanctions architecture is being dismantled, targeted restrictions against former leader Bashar Al Assad and his collaborators will remain. Administration officials emphasized this is not nation-building but an opportunity for Syria to reintegrate.</p>

The attacks have caused widespread damage and casualties, representing a major escalation in Russia's air campaign.

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, savers are weighing the benefits of different financial products, particularly short-term certificates of deposit (CDs) and money market accounts. An analysis of a $10,000 deposit shows that short-term CDs with 3-month and 6-month terms currently offer slightly higher returns than a typical high-yield money market account. However, for a 9-month term, the money market account could yield more. The key difference is that CD rates are fixed, providing a guaranteed return, while money market rates are variable and may decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the American Clean Power Association, these measures could amount to a $7 billion tax hike and jeopardize 300 gigawatts of planned projects.

          <p>With home equity levels at a new high, homeowners have a significant financial resource available, and a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is presented as a timely option. A key advantage is that HELOCs have variable interest rates, which could become more favorable for borrowers as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates later this year. Unlike lump-sum loans, a HELOC allows borrowers to draw funds as needed and only pay interest on the amount used, offering flexibility. The approval process can also be quicker than for unsecured loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, claiming its sanctuary city ordinance illegally obstructs federal immigration enforcement. The suit argues that the city's policy of not using local resources for federal immigration enforcement has contributed to "lawlessness" and undermines federal law. This legal action is the latest in a series against jurisdictions with similar policies and follows weeks of protests in Los Angeles over the administration's aggressive deportation efforts. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated such policies will not be tolerated under President Trump.</p>

          <p>An expert on the effects of extreme temperatures has suggested that FIFA should consider a 9 a.m. kick-off for the 2026 World Cup final if a heatwave occurs. The warning comes after players at the Club World Cup in the U.S. faced brutal conditions, with a recent heatwave in New York pushing temperatures to a record 39Â°C. The MetLife Stadium, host of the final, has no roof, raising concerns for the health of players, officials, and spectators. Global players' union Fifpro is also calling for more flexible scheduling to mitigate heat-related health risks.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Wimbledon tournament has replaced its iconic line judges with an electronic line-calling system, drawing mixed reactions on its opening day. While players like Cameron Norrie acknowledge the system's black-and-white accuracy, they also miss the tradition and spectacle that human judges provided. Some players, including Frances Tiafoe, feel the change removes the crowd-engaging drama of challenging a close call. Others have noted practical issues, such as the automated voice calls being too quiet to hear over the crowd noise on the outside courts.</p>

Furthermore, the policy could harm the economies of allied nations that depend on these funds, such as Mexico, potentially eroding diplomatic goodwill and creating greater instability that fuels migration.

One approach is to negotiate a settlement, offering to pay a lump sum that is less than the full amount owed in exchange for having the rest forgiven. For those with multiple debts, a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can consolidate payments and lower interest rates. Other potential solutions include using a debt consolidation loan, inquiring about hardship programs, or, in severe cases, considering bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Florida, particularly St. Johns County, are bracing for a very wet July 4th holiday week as a weather disturbance is expected to stall off the southeastern U.S. coast. The National Hurricane Center gives the system a 20% chance of developing into a tropical or subtropical storm. Regardless of formal development, the stalled frontal boundary is forecast to bring waves of heavy downpours and high humidity throughout the weekend. Officials are warning of potential localized flooding, especially in low-lying areas, and an increased risk of rip currents along the coast.</p>
