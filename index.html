          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing asylum applications from individuals who entered the U.S. between 2019 and 2022. The dismissals are based on the applicants not receiving a mandatory "credible fear" interview at the border, a step that was often skipped due to a shortage of asylum officers. This policy forces people who have been living and working legally in the country for years to restart the complex asylum process, stripping them of their current status and work permits. Immigration lawyers express concern that this retroactive action creates immense uncertainty and could lead to their clients being detained and deported.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is anticipating its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 30C for several consecutive days. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for most of England as a high-pressure system draws warm air from the south. The peak temperature is expected to reach 34C in the south Midlands on Tuesday, marking a significant shift from the recent stormy weather. While England and Wales will experience the most sunshine, scattered thunderstorms are possible, and pollen levels are expected to be high.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands of visitors arriving via new ferry connections. Turkish tourists are drawn by the island's relaxed atmosphere and relative affordability compared to Turkish holiday destinations, providing a welcome boost to local businesses like restaurants and taverns. This rise in personal interaction and economic exchange is fostering goodwill between the two peoples, even as political tensions between Athens and Ankara persist over issues like maritime borders. The trend highlights how grassroots connections can thrive despite high-level diplomatic disputes.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages held in Gaza, have been protesting against the government's plan to expand its military operations. Demonstrators fear that escalating the conflict will further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages and are urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritize a deal for their release. The plan, which includes taking security control over the Gaza Strip, has also faced opposition from military leaders and drawn condemnation from several allied nations. The protests reflect a significant portion of the Israeli public's desire for a diplomatic solution to end the war and secure the hostages' return.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a new set of genome editing tools that make it significantly easier and more efficient to edit large fragments of DNA. This breakthrough, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), allows for precise manipulation of DNA segments ranging from thousands to millions of base pairs, particularly in plants. The technology is expected to accelerate advancements in crop improvement by allowing for more complex genetic modifications. It could also have significant applications in treating genetic diseases and advancing the field of synthetic biology by aiding the development of artificial chromosomes.</p>

          <p>Young people in Shanghai are driving a surge in the city's nighttime economy through their strong interest in live theater and performances. Instead of traditional nightlife, many Gen Z residents are spending their evenings and a significant portion of their income on attending shows and collecting related merchandise. The Shanghai government is actively supporting this trend with its "Night Economy 2.0" initiative, which aims to streamline approvals for nighttime events and enrich cultural offerings. This focus on boosting the night economy is part of a broader strategy to stimulate domestic consumption amid economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Key European allies, including the UK, France, and Germany, have jointly stated that any peace negotiations between the US and Russia must directly involve Ukraine. The statement comes ahead of a potential summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, where there are concerns that a deal could be made without Kyiv's input. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected any agreements made without his country's participation, particularly those involving territorial concessions. European leaders emphasized that Ukraine's sovereignty must be respected and that a diplomatic solution is critical for the security of the entire continent.</p>

According to the Palestinian Football Association, al-Obeid was shot and killed by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza.

While hardware and training data are advancing, Wang states that the "AI for embodied intelligence" is the main component that is currently lacking.

Initially, the only other person present, Matthew Ecker, claimed Pennig had taken his gun and died by suicide after locking herself in the bathroom. However, detectives discovered a metal ring from the door's lock underneath Pennig's body. This finding indicated that the door had been forced open before she was shot and fell, contradicting Ecker's story.
