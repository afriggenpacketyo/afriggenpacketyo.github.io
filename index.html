          <p>Air traffic controllers issued urgent and repeated commands to a Spirit Airlines flight to alter its course after it flew too close to Air Force One over Long Island. While preliminary data suggests the planes maintained the FAA's minimum required separation, controllers were clearly concerned by the proximity, with one audibly telling the Spirit pilots to "pay attention." The incident prompted an FAA investigation, which concluded that legal separation was maintained throughout, though the event highlighted the strict security protocols surrounding presidential travel.</p>

However, the event was also met with public demonstrations against Trump's policies and was shadowed by controversy, including an incident where an image of the president with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein was projected onto Windsor Castle.</p>

          <p>In response to the ongoing war in Gaza, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, has formally proposed sanctions against Israel, including trade restrictions and measures targeting far-right Israeli government ministers. The proposal comes as Israel continues its major ground offensive in Gaza City, which has led to a high number of civilian casualties and a worsening humanitarian crisis. This move signals increasing international pressure on Israel, though its approval by all 27 EU member states remains uncertain.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Legal Scholars Argue Rescuing Suffering Farm Animals Should Not Be a Crime</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece, authored by two law professors, argues that activists who rescue suffering animals from factory farms should be legally permitted to use the "necessity defense" against trespassing charges. They contend that preventing the significant harm of animal cruelty should justify the lesser offense, similar to legal protections for breaking into a hot car to save a pet. The authors criticize recent California court decisions that have denied this defense, suggesting a societal bias that wrongly devalues the suffering of agricultural animals.</p>

          <p>The play "Eureka Day," currently running at the Pasadena Playhouse, offers a satirical look at the culture of a progressive private school in Berkeley that is thrown into chaos by a mumps outbreak and a subsequent debate over vaccine mandates. Though written before the COVID-19 pandemic, the comedy's themes have become exceptionally topical, skewering the clash between individual parental choice and collective public health. The review praises the play's humor, especially a scene depicting a chaotic online parent forum, for effectively capturing the current anti-science moment.</p>

Wharton contends that the plate is simply a statement of her first name, which originates from an ancient Egyptian goddess, and she is fighting the decision as a matter of principle to reclaim the name's peaceful meaning.</p>
