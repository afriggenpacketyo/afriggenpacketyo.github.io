          <p>AMD reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, with CEO Lisa Su noting the company navigated regulations on AI chip exports effectively. Revenue reached $7.44 billion, surpassing estimates, though the company anticipates a $700 million revenue hit in the current quarter due to export controls, totaling $1.5 billion through the third quarter. AMD's data center segment, driven by Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, saw a 57% annual increase, while client and gaming revenue rose 28%, boosted by strong demand for Zen 5 chips, however gaming sales declined 30%. Despite macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds, AMD remains optimistic about its leadership product portfolio, particularly in AI training and inference applications.</p>

          <p>Following a militant attack that killed over two dozen civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir, India conducted strikes on what it described as nine terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

          <p>Super Micro Computer provided disappointing guidance, attributing it to economic uncertainty and tariff impacts, following preliminary results that already fell short of expectations. The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 40 to 50 cents on $5.6 billion to $6.4 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, lower than analyst estimates. CEO Charles Liang noted a customer delay in AI platform commitments due to the transition between GPU generations. The company is not providing fiscal 2026 guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty, after revenue grew 19% year over year, but net income declined from the previous year.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing concerns over Martin's defense of January 6 rioters. Tillis's opposition creates a potential tie in the Senate Judiciary Committee, hindering Martin's confirmation. Martin, who has served as interim U.S. attorney, faces controversy over his past support for the 'Stop the Steal' movement and inflammatory comments regarding the Capitol attack. The White House continues to support Martin, but the delay in a committee vote raises doubts about his confirmation before his interim term expires on May 20.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced plans to reduce the number of senior admirals and generals by 20% and transform the Army to focus on homeland defense and deter China. However, details on these efforts remain scarce, with the memo lacking a specific timeline for the officer reductions. The Army restructuring plan aims to field long-range missiles and drones, while also scrapping outdated equipment.

The trend harkens back to the original Caesar salad, which also featured whole romaine hearts, and reflects a desire to create the perfect bite.</p>

The show manages to eliminate almost any sense of aspirational identification from its portrait of leafy Connecticut hyperaffluence. The piece suggests that post-1960s cultural trends have stripped away elements of fun and aesthetic distinction that used to attach to upper-class lifestyles. The show provides a reassurance to meritocratic strivers by portraying its rich world as a place where unhappiness is only magnified and financial security is still an illusion.</p>
