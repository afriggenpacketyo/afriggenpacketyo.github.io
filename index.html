          <p>A federal judge in Boston has found the Trump administration in violation of a court order barring deportations to countries not their own without adequate notice. The ruling came after eight migrants were deported to Djibouti, despite lawyers' claims they were told they were being sent to South Sudan. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, expressed concern that the deported men had been given insufficient time to object, potentially resulting in criminal contempt penalties for those involved. The article also notes that the flight carrying the deportees had landed in Djibouti, where U.S. military personnel were standing by.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has stated that the Trump administration ‚Äúunquestionably‚Äù violated a court order by attempting to deport migrants to South Sudan without allowing them to contest their removal. The administration placed eight migrant detainees with criminal records on a deportation flight, but the final destination remains undisclosed. The judge, Brian Murphy, criticized the administration's actions and noted that the detainees were given less than 24 hours' notice before being deported. The Justice Department argued that the judge's orders were not specific enough, leading to a misunderstanding.</p>

          <p>Republican-led tax legislation is poised to reignite international tax and trade wars, potentially straining relationships with key allies. The legislation aims to penalize foreign companies from countries enforcing the global minimum tax agreed upon in 2021, increasing their tax rates in the U.S. This move has raised concerns among finance ministers from the Group of 7 nations and could lead to retaliatory measures against American companies.

This comparison underscores the hypocrisy in Trump's condemnation of South Africa while employing similar tactics domestically.

The test, for individuals 55 and older with cognitive symptoms, offers a quicker and more accurate assessment compared to current methods like PET scans and spinal taps. Experts believe the blood test will improve diagnostic accuracy, enable earlier diagnoses, and increase access to testing, especially in underserved communities. This could lead to more patients receiving timely treatment with amyloid-reducing drugs.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has appointed Freddy Lim, the founder and lead singer of the heavy metal band Chthonic, as its envoy to Finland, a country known as a heavy metal capital. Lim, a former legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan, is recognized for his human rights work and international experience. Chthonic's music incorporates Taiwanese lore and advocates for Taiwan's recognition on the international stage. While the appointment has garnered enthusiasm from metal fans, some legislators have raised questions about Lim's suitability for the role.</p>

Companies and congressmen with clean-energy projects benefiting from its subsidies in their districts suggested surgical precision would prevail. But relentless pressure to abolish the IRA from the president, who is a fan of drilling, baby, drilling and denounced the law as the ‚ÄúGreen New Scam,‚Äù pointed instead to brute force. The president reinforced this by dropping in on a private party caucus on May 20th to strong-arm waverers and threaten dissenters with a MAGA primary challenge.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $33 million in federal funds for earthquake retrofits in California, prompting Senator Adam Schiff to urge a reconsideration. The funds were intended to strengthen vulnerable apartment buildings, known as soft-story buildings, which are prone to collapse during earthquakes. The California Residential Mitigation Program was counting on these funds to offer grants to apartment owners in cities with mandatory retrofit laws. Schiff argues that eliminating this funding endangers those who can least afford it and increases the risk of displacement and loss of life.</p>
