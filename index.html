            <p>President Trump, at 78, is in excellent cognitive and physical health according to his White House doctor, Captain Sean Barbabella. The annual physical, conducted at Walter Reed hospital, included blood tests, a cardiac examination, and ultrasounds. Trump scored a perfect 30 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Dr. Barbabella also noted minor sun damage and benign skin lesions, while crediting Trump's active lifestyle, including frequent golf victories, for his good health. The examination also noted scarring on his right ear from the assassination attempt last July.</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry is urging the U.S. to completely abolish reciprocal tariffs, calling recent U.S. tariff exemptions a "small step." The ministry stated that China is evaluating the impact of the tariff exemptions on some tech products. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated there are currently no plans for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to speak. The recent exemptions are being presented in China as evidence that Trump is backing down and that Chinese supply chains are not easily replaceable. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the reciprocal tariff exemptions for some electronics may be short-lived, suggesting separate tariffs for these products are "coming soon" as part of national security measures to encourage domestic production. He clarified that while these products are exempt from reciprocal tariffs, they will likely be included in semiconductor tariffs within a month or two. Lutnick emphasized the U.S. "can't be beholden and rely upon foreign countries for fundamental things that we need." This adds further uncertainty to Trump's tariff policy, which has been subject to frequent changes.</p>

The governor maintained she stayed in the room to advocate for Michigan despite disagreeing with the statements and actions taken. Whitmer's presence and reaction have drawn criticism, especially as she is considered a potential 2028 White House contender.</p>

            <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is urging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate President Trump for potential insider trading and market manipulation related to his tariff announcements. Warren and other Senate Democrats are concerned that Trump's tariff policies, including pauses and changes, may have enriched administration insiders at the expense of the public. She highlighted suspicious trading activity just before announcements that caused market fluctuations. The White House has dismissed these calls as "partisan games."</p>

            <p>An Israeli airstrike has partially destroyed al Ahli Arab Hospital, the last fully functional hospital in Gaza City. Witnesses reported that the intensive care and surgery departments were hit, leading to the evacuation of patients and staff.

One child died as a result of "the rushed evacuation process", according to a statement from the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem.

            <p>Amidst stock market and bond market panic, the bond ladder strategy offers investors exposure to treasury bonds without worrying about short-term price swings. This involves investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity, providing regular income. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) brings this approach to an ETF, investing in treasuries from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds, distributing roughly 11% monthly through 2035. Investors need to understand that the net asset value of these is going to come down and that's going to be a shocker. (not investment advice)</p>
