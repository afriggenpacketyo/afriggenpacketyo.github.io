            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant downturn, erasing gains from the previous day, as President Trump's trade war continues to cast a shadow over the economy. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite all fell sharply following China's announcement of countermeasures and the White House clarifying increased tariffs on Chinese imports. Despite positive inflation data, market volatility persists due to ongoing trade tensions and uncertainty surrounding future economic policies. Analysts emphasize the need for comprehensive tariff deals to stabilize the market, highlighting the potential for further economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>New data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) indicates that sanctuary jurisdictions have declined thousands of detainer requests, leading to the release of numerous criminal aliens, including those convicted of homicide. California accounts for over half of the declined detainer requests, raising concerns about public safety and the enforcement of immigration laws. President Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, intensifying the debate over local cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The data highlights the ongoing tension between sanctuary policies and federal immigration enforcement efforts.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Boston has extended a temporary order blocking deportations to third countries, expressing concerns about the safety of migrants being sent to countries other than their own. The judge questioned the policy's lack of due process, suggesting that migrants lack a meaningful way to raise safety concerns before deportation. The DOJ argued that delaying removals could backlog the courts, while advocates for noncitizens emphasized the inadequacy of current protections. The judge plans to issue a decision on a preliminary injunction, potentially stalling the Trump administration's deportation approach.</p>

The operation, called Operation Machinize, was launched in response to growing intelligence reports indicating that these shops are used to disguise proceeds from criminal operations. The raids resulted in arrests, the seizure of cash and illicit goods, and the identification of potential victims of modern slavery. Authorities are now analyzing the evidence to trace the networks behind these shops and disrupt the flow of criminal cash.</p>

            <p>Tesla shares experienced a sharp decline after a record rally, reflecting the volatility surrounding President Trump's tariff policies. The stock dropped significantly as the White House clarified that China's tariff rate stood at 145%. Analysts at UBS, Goldman Sachs, and Mizuho cut their price targets on Tesla, citing the margin impacts of Trump's auto tariffs. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, a Trump advisor, has faced scrutiny for his White House role. The company's sales have declined in Europe, and the uncertainty surrounding tariffs has troubled its margin outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The House adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders convinced conservative holdouts to back it. The resolution passed with a narrow margin, as some Republicans joined Democrats in opposition. Conservatives initially resisted the plan due to concerns about deeper spending cuts, but ultimately flipped their votes after assurances from leaders regarding savings. The budget plan allows Congress to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold and advance Trump's agenda with a simple majority. Democrats have criticized the proposed cuts, arguing they will negatively impact entitlement programs.</p>
