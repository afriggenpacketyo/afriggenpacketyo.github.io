          <p>China has accused the United States of conducting "long-term, highly covert, and state-level cyberespionage" attacks against its national time center in Xian. This critical facility, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is responsible for generating and distributing China’s standard time, providing highly precise timing services essential for the country’s communications, finance, power, transport, mapping, and defense sectors. The accusation underscores escalating cyber tensions between the two global powers, with Beijing emphasizing the sophisticated nature of these alleged intrusions. The US embassy in China has not yet responded to these significant claims.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of "murder" after a US strike on a suspected drug-carrying submarine resulted in two deaths. President Trump defended the action, claiming the vessel was loaded with fentanyl and other narcotics, and referred to the survivors as "terrorists" being returned for prosecution. However, Petro countered that the Colombian boat was adrift due to engine failure and had its distress signal active, demanding explanations from the US government. This incident marks the sixth US strike in the Caribbean in recent weeks, with 27 reported fatalities from prior attacks, intensifying international scrutiny over US anti-drug operations and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The US Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago has issued an unusual security warning, advising Americans to avoid government facilities due to heightened alert. This comes as tensions escalate between the United States and Venezuela following recent deadly US strikes on suspected drug traffickers in Caribbean waters. Local authorities in Trinidad and Tobago confirmed the alert is based on threats against American citizens, potentially linked to the regional instability, prompting increased security measures. The situation is particularly sensitive as two local fishermen from Trinidad are believed to have been killed in a recent US strike.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool Football Club is experiencing a noticeable decline in performance this season, attributed significantly to the departure of star right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid. Despite substantial summer signings, the team has lost three consecutive matches, struggling particularly with short build-up play and effective long passes. Alexander-Arnold's unique on-ball quality, including his two-footed passing and ability to bypass high presses, is deeply missed, forcing tactical compromises like playing midfielder Florian Wirtz deeper. Opponents like Manchester United are expected to exploit these new frailties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Large global companies are increasingly blaming artificial intelligence for recent job cuts, but critics argue this narrative serves as a convenient "scapegoat." Fabian Stephany, an Oxford Internet Institute professor, suggests AI provides a "good excuse" for layoffs stemming from pandemic overhiring or broader economic slowdowns, allowing firms to appear innovative while concealing other motives. While some companies like Salesforce claim AI reduces the need for certain roles, studies from Yale University and the New York Fed indicate AI has not yet caused widespread job losses, with many firms using it for retraining and hiring.</p>

          <p>A royal biographer, Andrew Lownie, has dismissed Prince Andrew's agreement to stop using his royal titles as mere "window dressing," arguing that Buckingham Palace has failed to address the scandal's true magnitude. Lownie criticizes King Charles for not fully stripping Andrew of his titles, forcing him from Royal Lodge, or compelling full cooperation with authorities regarding Jeffrey Epstein. He asserts that the Palace's actions are a "fudge" driven by government pressure, designed for public relations rather than genuine accountability or an apology to victims.</p>

          <p>It is common for sexual desire to wane in long-term relationships after the initial passionate phase, a phenomenon attributed to shifting hormone levels, with bonding hormones like oxytocin dampening sex drive.

          <p>The US State Department has issued a stark warning, citing "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an "imminent" attack on Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Such an attack would constitute a "direct and grave" violation of the ceasefire agreement, jeopardizing significant progress made through mediation efforts. Washington has informed other guarantors of the peace agreement, including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, demanding Hamas uphold its terms and warning of protective measures if the attack proceeds. This development raises serious concerns about the fragility of the ongoing ceasefire and the safety of Gaza's population.</p>

          <p>AMIES Technology, a new Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer, is emerging as a key player in China's efforts to reduce its reliance on Dutch giant ASML for chipmaking machines. Spun off from state-owned SMEE, AMIES showcased its latest products, aiming for faster commercialization of equipment amidst stringent US export controls that restrict China's access to advanced DUV and EUV systems. While SMEE has made progress in back-end processes, China still significantly lags global leaders in front-end wafer fabrication. This initiative underscores China's ambition to overcome bottlenecks in its semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>China's major airlines are increasingly offering free Wi-Fi on domestic flights as a strategic move to regain business travelers who have increasingly opted for high-speed trains. China Eastern Airlines recently launched a free "basic" Wi-Fi service across its widebody fleet on 37 domestic routes, following similar offerings from competitors like Air China and China Southern Airlines. This initiative aims to enable "work from the air," improving the passenger experience and making air travel more competitive against the convenience and connectivity of high-speed rail.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen asserted his dominance at the United States Grand Prix sprint, cruising to a comfortable victory while McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris crashed out together on the first corner. This incident significantly complicates the Formula 1 championship fight, with Verstappen gaining crucial points and securing pole position for the grand prix. McLaren's team principal acknowledged the need for more prudence from their drivers, as Verstappen's relentless performance continues to erode their season-long advantage, setting the stage for a potentially "brutal" title climax.</p>

          <p>Hamas has handed over the remains of two additional possible hostages to Israel, bringing the total recovered to 12, though 16 remain unaccounted for. This exchange occurs amidst the ongoing Gaza peace plan, which stipulates the release of all living and deceased hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners. Tensions flared as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced the critical Rafah border crossing would remain closed until further notice, linking its opening to Hamas's full compliance. The US State Department also warned of a potential imminent Hamas attack on Palestinian civilians, further complicating the fragile ceasefire.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos for fraud, leading to his immediate release. Trump cited "horrible mistreatment" and solitary confinement as reasons for his decision. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, will no longer be required to pay restitution to his victims. His attorney expressed gratitude, while Congressman Nick LaLota criticized the commutation, arguing Santos deserved a longer sentence for his crimes. Santos later stated he is "back as a new man" and plans to focus on prison reform.</p>
