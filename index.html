            <p>Morgan Stanley reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed estimates, driven by a significant 45% surge in equity trading revenue amid increased global volatility. The company's earnings rose 26% to $4.32 billion, or $2.60 per share, while revenue increased 17% to a record $17.74 billion. The strong equity trading results were attributed to robust client activity, particularly in Asia and with hedge funds, due to a more volatile trading environment. Despite the positive results, the article notes concerns about the outlook for mergers and IPO listings amid ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>In response to escalating US-China trade tensions, China has amended its 'place of origin' rules for integrated circuits (ICs), potentially benefiting local semiconductor foundries. The new definition designates the location of wafer fabrication as the origin of chips, regardless of packaging, which could incentivize chip developers to use domestic foundries like SMIC. This change may disadvantage US semiconductor companies by potentially closing the Chinese market to chips from American fabs. The move is seen as a countermeasure to Trump's tariffs, with analysts suggesting it could lead to increased outsourcing from the US.</p>

            <p>The Guardian is seeking information from businesses in the UK and elsewhere about how changing US tariffs are impacting them. The article notes that China has raised tariffs on US imports to 125%, while most other countries, including the UK, have maintained a 10% tariff on goods. The article aims to gather insights on how businesses are being affected by the tariffs, how they are dealing with the uncertainty, and what their main concerns are.</p>

            <h2>Trump's War on Universities Could Target Accreditors, Raising Concerns</h2>

            <p>Advocates for academic freedom are concerned that the Trump administration's efforts to reshape higher education will extend to an overhaul of the accreditation system. Trump has previously stated his intention to use accreditation as a 'secret weapon' against colleges he views as too progressive. Concerns include giving states the authority to approve institutions for federal aid, prohibiting accreditors from requiring diversity policies, and creating new accreditors aligned with the administration. Such changes could undermine the independence and quality assurance of higher education institutions.</p>

            <p>A legal case in Atlanta concerning the 'Cop City' project could potentially expose the activities of police foundations nationwide. The case centers on whether records from the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) are subject to Georgia's open records law. The private foundations, existing in major US cities, have been used to fund surveillance technologies without public scrutiny. The case has implications for transparency and oversight of police funding and operations.</p>

A potential MLB lockout looms if the league puts forth a salary cap proposal during collective bargaining negotiations in late 2026. MLB is also navigating a dramatically changing media landscape, the result could be major changes to league finances — and renewed interest from investors.

            <p>The article compares the Trump administration’s accidental texting of war plans to the Zimmermann telegram, a historically significant diplomatic blunder during World War I. Arthur Zimmermann, the German foreign minister, offered Mexico territories in the U.S. in exchange for siding with Germany, but the message was intercepted and decoded by the British, ultimately pushing the U.S. into the war. The author argues that the Zimmermann telegram represents a colossally stupid and historically consequential mismanagement of classified war plans.</p>

            <p>The most severe animal welfare problem in today’s meat industry is largely invisible to the naked eye and is the genetic manipulation of the animals. Over the last 80 years, the poultry industry has significantly altered chickens’ genetics, breeding them to grow as big as possible in as little time as possible, all in an effort to quickly and efficiently pump out more and more chicken. This rapid growth takes an enormous toll on the chickens’ bodies, with many in pain due to lameness, or difficulty walking. The most severe animal welfare problem in today’s meat industry is largely invisible to the naked eye.</p>

The discovery expands the known range of Denisovans, who interacted with Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. Analysis of the jawbone's proteins revealed similarities to Denisovan fossils found in Siberia. Scientists believe that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.</p>
