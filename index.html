          <p>At a conference in Shanghai, prominent AI experts like Geoffrey Hinton urged for collaboration between the United States and China to manage the potential dangers of advanced artificial intelligence. Hinton warned that AI could become an uncontrollable threat if nations fail to work together, drawing a parallel to the US-Soviet cooperation on nuclear non-proliferation during the Cold War. He emphasized that despite divergent national interests on many issues, preventing an AI takeover is a critical common ground that requires international cooperation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with events at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of two new commemorative stamps. Founded in 1775, the agency is marking its semiquincentennial with a focus on its historical significance in unifying the nation. The celebration occurs as the USPS faces political discussions about its future, including potential privatization, though the new postmaster general has stated his opposition to such measures. The event aims to honor the enduring values of the Postal Service while looking toward its future.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth argues that current political movements, such as Project 2025, are attempting to undermine civil society by attacking the legitimacy of colleges and universities. He claims these efforts aim to enforce ideological conformity by controlling funding, accreditation, and curriculum, thereby threatening academic freedom. Roth also reflects on the internal failings of higher education, including ideological narrowness among faculty and a focus on exclusivity, while discussing the fundamental purpose of college in the modern world.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a global action plan for artificial intelligence at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, proposing an international cooperation organization to guide development and regulation. This move comes just days after the U.S. announced its own AI framework, signaling an intensification of the tech race between the two nations. Chinese Premier Li Qiang highlighted the country's "AI plus" strategy to integrate the technology across industries and offered to assist other nations, particularly in the Global South, creating a clear divergence from the U.S.-led approach.</p>

          <p>The UK government is working with Jordan on plans to airdrop humanitarian aid into Gaza, after Israel agreed to allow such deliveries amid a worsening humanitarian crisis. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the UK would "pull every lever" to get support to Palestinians. The move comes as Starmer faces increasing pressure from over a third of MPs, including many from his own party, to officially recognize a Palestinian state as a step toward a two-state solution.</p>

Thailand's armed forces are significantly larger and possess superior weaponry, including a modern air force and a greater number of tanks and artillery pieces. In contrast, Cambodia's military relies heavily on Chinese support and older equipment, though analysts note that the terrain along the disputed border may favor Cambodian forces.</p>
