          <p>Guy Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs car bombing outside a fertility center, appeared to have posted videos of homemade explosives and messages indicating his plans on social media. Law enforcement is reviewing these accounts, which date back at least six years and show an interest in experimenting with explosives and radioactive materials. One video was shared on a message board dedicated to suicide, and the user detailed plans for death. The fertility clinic was unharmed in the blast. </p>

          <p>Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, citing political gridlock and potential deficit-increasing fiscal plans, has intensified the debate over a Republican tax and spending cut package. Fiscally conservative Republicans are using the downgrade as ammunition to demand deeper cuts to federal programs, including Medicaid and food assistance, before supporting the bill. The Republican plan would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Speaker Mike Johnson aims to bring the bill to a vote by Friday, but faces challenges from both fiscal hawks and moderate Republicans.</p>

          <p>Following a weekend of deadly tornadoes that killed at least 29 people across the Midwest and South, the central U.S. is bracing for another round of severe storms.

Flood watches are in effect for parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The article also touches on staffing cuts to the National Weather Service during the Trump administration and how this might affect future warnings during disasters. </p>

          <p>Scientists are in a global race to discover why our Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan building advanced detectors to study neutrinos and their antimatter counterparts. The US-led Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota and the Japanese-led Hyper-K experiment aim to understand why matter won over antimatter after the Big Bang. Both experiments involve international collaborations and hope to find slight differences in how neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change as they travel, potentially revealing why matter exists. Discoveries in store will be transformative to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself.</p>

          <p>As mental health referrals surge and waitlists grow, AI chatbots are increasingly used for therapy, offering 24/7 support and coping strategies. However, concerns exist regarding biases, lack of safeguarding, and data security. Some users find chatbots invaluable, particularly those with autism or limited access to human therapists. Experts emphasize that while chatbots can be a helpful stopgap, they cannot fully replace human therapists due to the lack of emotional intelligence and potential for providing harmful advice. The government has pledged to recruit 8,500 more mental health staff to cut waiting lists.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer has prompted discussion among experts about the detection and screening of the disease. Experts note that it is not uncommon for prostate cancer to be diagnosed in later stages, even in older patients, and recommend against PSA-based screening for men age 70 and older. It is possible that Biden did not undergo regular PSA screening or that the cancer developed rapidly between tests. Symptoms of advanced prostate cancer may not always be present, leading to delayed diagnosis.</p>

Trump suggested the conditions of a peace deal could only be negotiated between Russia and Ukraine – and maybe with the help of the Pope. Trump also hinted at reduced sanctions on Russia as an incentive for a peace agreement, while Ukraine's President Zelenskyy expressed concern about the US distancing itself from the talks.</p>

          <p>The federal government is offering real estate investors the chance to buy a historic courthouse and office building in downtown Los Angeles. The landmark U.S. Courthouse, built in the 1930s, is slated for "accelerated disposition" by the General Services Administration (GSA) as part of a plan to sell off underutilized federal properties. The sale comes during a downturn in commercial property sales downtown, and the building could be converted into apartments. Local real estate executive Dan Rosenfeld expressed dismay at the government's decision to rush the sale.</p>

          <p>Former President Biden’s cancer diagnosis comes as a new book details efforts by aides to shield the effects of his aging from the public and the press during last year’s presidential campaign. The revelation that former President Biden has advanced prostate cancer generated more questions than answers on Monday, prompting debate among experts in the oncology community over the likely progression of his disease and resurfacing concerns in Washington over his decision last year to run for reelection. But it was not made clear whether Biden, 82, had been testing his prostate-specific antigens, known as PSA levels, during his presidency — and if so whether those results had indicated an elevated risk of cancer while he was still in office or during his campaign for reelection.</p>

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer -- after skin cancer -- diagnosed in American men, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the nation's leading cancer advocacy organization. Early prostate cancer generally does not cause symptoms but, when symptoms do occur, they include problems with urination or blood in the urine or semen, according to ACS. ACS recommends men speak with their health care provider about the decision to screen and to have those discussions at age 40 or 45 for those at high risk and at age 50 for those at average risk.</p>

Judge Stephen V. Wilson and Assistant U.S. Atty. Rob Keenan sparred for more than two hours over the federal government’s highly unusual legal maneuver to offer L.A. County sheriff’s Deputy Trevor Kirk a misdemeanor plea deal just two months after he was convicted of a felony in the excessive force case. The agreement caused turmoil in the U.S. attorney’s office, with assistant U.S. attorneys Eli A. Alcaraz, Brian R. Faerstein, Michael J.

Jeff Cavaliere, C.S.C.S., of Athlean-X shared several pushup variations that go far beyond just building muscle. These moves also improve shoulder mobility, core stability, and overall flexibility—especially in areas that tend to get ignored in traditional workouts. Performing hand-release pushups allow you to hone in on standard pushup form. Rather than rushing through half reps, this ensures you're lowering your chest all the way to the floor.</p>

Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts last year, mortgage rates have remained near their 25-year peak because they tend to track the 10-year Treasury bond, which is sensitive to economic conditions. Elevated mortgage rates are likely to persist, while aspiring homebuyers also face a shortage of affordable properties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is telling some of the nation’s largest companies that they should eat the cost of his tariffs, as a growing number of businesses signal that they must raise prices to blunt the impact of a persistent global trade war.
