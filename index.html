          <p>Several airlines rerouted flights in the Middle East after Iran launched a missile strike on a U.S. military base in Qatar, escalating regional tensions. Over 20 commercial aircraft bound for Doha diverted, while others heading to Dubai turned around; airspace over the UAE and Bahrain was temporarily closed. Air India halted all flights in and out of the region, as well as to and from the east coast of North America and Europe, until further notice, while British Airways canceled Doha flights through Wednesday to prioritize safety and provide customers with options. The incident follows recent safety concerns after a deadly crash involving an Air India Boeing 787 earlier this month.</p>

New Tottenham manager Thomas Frank also expressed interest in Mbeumo, while other Champions League clubs are also keen on the forward. Mbeumo's Premier League experience is viewed as a major positive, and he scored a career-best 20 goals for Brentford last season.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is demanding that the Trump administration justify the recent U.S. military strikes in Iran, citing a lack of evidence supporting the action under the War Powers Act or the Constitution. Jeffries claimed he had not seen evidence of an imminent threat to the U.S. and requested a briefing for the Gang of Eight. While some Democrats have backed Trump's move, others, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have called for his impeachment. Jeffries sidestepped questions about impeachment, emphasizing the need for the administration to present its case to Congress and allow for debate on the War Powers Resolution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump demanded that "everyone" keep oil prices down to avoid playing "into the hands of the enemy" amid escalating conflict in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. He also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling. The message follows U.S. bombing of Iran's key nuclear sites, raising concerns about potential disruptions to Middle East energy supplies. Crude oil prices closed about 7% lower on Monday after Iran fired missiles at a U.S. airbase in Qatar without causing casualties, signaling investors' hopes for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Super Micro Computer's shares fell about 10% after the server maker announced plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes maturing in 2030. The decline is attributed to the potential dilution of existing shareholders' stakes upon conversion to equity. The company plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion, and will repurchase $200 million of its stock from note issuers. Despite the recent slide, Super Micro shares are still up nearly 40% in 2025, driven by high demand for its AI-optimized infrastructure and a major contract with a Saudi Arabian data center.

          <p>Retired Gen. Robert Spalding shared details about Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. military's largest deployment of B-2 stealth bombers to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. The operation involved a decade of planning and complex deception tactics to keep Iran unaware of the incoming attack. Decoy bombers were sent to Guam to mislead potential tracking efforts. The B-2's design and stealth capabilities were crucial to the mission's success, as was the ability to conduct multiple midair refuelings during the extended flight time.</p>

Kennedy's efforts could significantly impact what food is served in schools and influence the food industry. He has previously expressed concerns about seed oils, ultra-processed snacks, and synthetic food dyes. The current guidelines are complex and lengthy, leading to confusion about what constitutes a healthy meal.
