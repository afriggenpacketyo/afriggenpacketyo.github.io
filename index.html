          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and its Law Review following allegations that the journal selected articles based on authors' race rather than merit, potentially violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The investigations by the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are prompted by reports suggesting editors prioritized minority authors, raising concerns about discriminatory practices. This action intensifies the ongoing feud between the administration and Harvard, which includes disputes over DEI programs and scrutiny of international students, and comes after the administration froze $2.2 billion in grants to the university over antisemitism concerns. This is a developing story.</p>

          <p>A massive power outage disrupted life across Spain and Portugal, impacting transportation, businesses, and communication networks, and also affecting Andorra and parts of France. Trains halted, traffic lights failed, and businesses closed, leaving commuters stranded and residents without power. Local communities rallied to provide assistance, offering food and water to those affected, while officials worked to restore electricity. The outage prompted an emergency meeting of Spain's national security council and a state of emergency declaration, with power gradually being restored throughout the evening, though full recovery is expected to take time.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers, led by Lin Nan, a former head scientist at ASML, has made progress in developing an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source platform. This achievement is significant as ASML, the sole manufacturer of EUV machines crucial for producing advanced chips, has been restricted from selling its most advanced models to China since 2019 due to US pressure. Lin returned to China in 2021 and established the research group responsible for this breakthrough, potentially reducing China's reliance on foreign technology for chip manufacturing.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is actively reshaping the global economic order through trade wars, treaty withdrawals, and questioning security commitments, dismantling existing governmental structures in the process. These changes are profound, yet their long-term impact remains uncertain given potential shifts in Congress and the constitutional limits on Trump's term. The article questions whether a future administration could undo these policies, drawing a parallel to the Catholic Church's capacity to reverse its own decisions over centuries.</p>

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the consideration to widen the levy. The proposal also includes reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before taxation from 5g to 4g per 100ml. The government estimates most pre-packed milk-based drinks will be affected unless their sugar content is reduced, arguing that the health benefits of these drinks do not outweigh the harms of excess sugar.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggests that a college degree may not always be worth the cost, with as many as 25% of graduates seeing little return on their investment. Factors such as high out-of-pocket expenses, living on campus, extending the time to graduation, and choosing a major with lower earning potential can significantly reduce the value of a college degree. STEM majors generally yield the highest returns, while fields like fine arts and education tend to have the lowest. (not investment advice)</p>
