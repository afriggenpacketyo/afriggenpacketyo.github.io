Saudi Arabia needs oil prices above $90 a barrel to balance its budget, but Goldman Sachs forecasts prices around $62, potentially leading to a $70-$75 billion deficit.

            <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are seeking release from prison, citing new evidence and changing societal views on abuse. Their lawyers argue that they should have been charged with manslaughter due to the alleged abuse they endured. The brothers' defense team has uncovered a letter written by Erik before the murders, alluding to abuse by their father. A resentencing hearing is scheduled, but the new LA District Attorney opposes their release, citing their lack of full responsibility for the crimes.</p>

            <p>A new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare. The report highlights that there were 260,000 maternal deaths in 2023, with the vast majority occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. The WHO warns that the global target for reducing maternal deaths will be missed, and recent cuts to international aid by the US and the UK risk reversing progress. The report emphasizes the need for increased investment and political commitment to prevent these deaths.</p>

            <p>A group of MPs in the UK is calling for a levy on streaming services' subscription revenue to support British high-end TV production. The Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee suggests that streaming companies pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to finance dramas with specific interest to British audiences. The report noted how "vital" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's "identity, national conversations and talent pipeline", which they say is now "under threat". Streaming services are arguing against the levy.</p>

With tariffs reaching unprecedented levels, the focus is shifting to building strong and adaptable industrial systems. Economists suggest that China should implement stronger government stimulus measures to boost domestic demand and navigate the turbulent economic landscape. The outcome of this competition will determine the long-term dominance of each nation.</p>

            <p>Despite a long-standing reputation for overworking his starters, data does not definitively show that Tom Thibodeau's players are more prone to injury than others. While some players have expressed concerns about heavy minutes, a detailed analysis of injury data reveals no clear or consistent pattern linking Thibodeau's coaching style to increased injury risk. However, the data shows a broader trend of rising injuries across the NBA, regardless of coaching style or playing time, suggesting other factors may be at play.</p>

Dalio believes that the temporary pullback on tariffs is a step in the right direction and that a negotiated agreement would be better than sweeping tariffs. He also suggests that China should appreciate the RMB against the dollar and ease fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate demand. Dalio emphasizes the need for major changes to address debt, trade, and capital imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

This initiative is part of a broader effort to boost police ranks by 13,000 by 2029 and put prevention back at the heart of policing. However, police forces are facing financial challenges, and critics question the feasibility of the plan.</p>
