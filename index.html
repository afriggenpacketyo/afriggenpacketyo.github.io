          <p>In a significant featherweight bout at UFC 319, Britain's Lerone Murphy defeated Aaron Pico with a spectacular first-round knockout via a spinning back elbow. Murphy, who accepted the fight on just three weeks' notice, extended his undefeated professional record to 17 wins. This decisive victory, which earned him a performance-of-the-night bonus, has positioned him as a strong contender for a title shot against champion Alexander Volkanovski. The event's main card also featured Khamzat Chimaev winning the middleweight title in a historically dominant performance.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has compelled Air Canada and its striking flight attendants to cease their work stoppage and enter into binding arbitration, impacting over 100,000 travelers. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu cited economic risks, including U.S. tariffs, as the reason for the swift intervention, which occurred less than 12 hours after the strike began. The flight attendants' union, CUPE, criticized the move as a violation of their right to strike, accusing the government of siding with the airline. The dispute centers on pay and compensation for unpaid work, with both sides remaining far apart in negotiations.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf successfully obtained a DNA sample from Bryan Patrick Miller, a suspect in the 1990s "canal murders," during an undercover sting at a Chili's restaurant. Posing as a security consultant offering a job, the detective arranged a meeting where Miller drank from a water glass, which was then secured for forensic analysis. The DNA from the glass provided a direct match to evidence found at the crime scenes of victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. This critical breakthrough led to the arrest of Miller, who was known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a novel trade policy by allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell specific AI chips to China in exchange for sharing 15% of their revenue with the U.S. government. This move, a reversal of a previous export ban, has sparked concerns among trade experts who warn it sets a dangerous precedent of making national security-based export controls appear transactional and potentially for sale. The legality of what the White House calls a "revenue-sharing" agreement, which critics argue is an export tax, is still being examined by the Commerce Department. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An exhibition featuring the works of 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin is being held at the National Museum of China, with a focus on emphasizing the artist's "Russianness." The collection, provided by Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, includes 48 oil paintings and 44 sketches from various periods of his life. This presentation of Repin as a distinctly Russian artist occurs amid cultural heritage claims from Ukraine, where he is known as Illia Riepin. Ukraine's Ministry of Culture and Strategic Communications has previously asserted that Repin's works are part of its national cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Sonny Baker, a 22-year-old fast bowler for Hampshire, has received his first call-up to the England cricket team after a series of impressive performances. Known for his inquisitive nature and dedication, Baker has overcome several stress fractures in his back, attributing his recovery in part to a daily regimen of drinking bone broth. He has actively sought advice from legendary bowlers like Brett Lee and Shaun Tait to refine his high-speed craft. Baker's recent success in The Hundred tournament, where he has bowled some of the fastest deliveries, has solidified his status as one of England's most exciting prospects.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer discharged their firearm at a vehicle during a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino, California. According to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, the incident occurred after the vehicle's occupant refused to exit and allegedly drove at the officers, injuring two. However, video shared by an immigrant justice group appears to show agents breaking the car's windows before shots are fired. The San Bernardino Police Department responded but cited the California Values Act, which prohibits local law enforcement from assisting with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has returned to social media after a three-week silence following the mixed reception of her American Eagle "Good Jeans" ad campaign. The campaign, which played on the words "genes" and "jeans," was criticized by some for having racial undertones, while others defended it as a rejection of "woke" advertising. Sweeney posted photos from a night out with friends but did not directly address the controversy. American Eagle previously issued a statement clarifying the campaign was solely about their denim products, while reputation experts suggest the publicity could ultimately benefit the actress's career.</p>

          <p>A long-standing traffic engineering guideline known as the "85% rule" is facing increased scrutiny as road fatalities rise. This principle suggests setting speed limits based on the speed at which 85% of drivers travel, effectively letting the fastest drivers determine the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians. In response, some states and cities, with encouragement from the Federal Highway Administration, are moving toward a more context-sensitive approach that considers road usage, pedestrian activity, and crash history.</p>

The technique produces what is described as "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used for highlighting cells. This process creates a highly transparent, solid state at low temperatures that is suitable for long-term storage.

          <p>A proposed Chinese aircraft design for a hypersonic drone carrier revives a concept once explored by NASA, featuring a single, centrally mounted "scissor wing" that rotates during flight. This innovative design aims to optimize performance across different speed ranges, from subsonic to hypersonic. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as the aircraft accelerates to Mach 5, it pivots to become parallel with the fuselage. This transforms the entire vehicle into a "waverider" configuration, which is highly efficient for hypersonic flight by using its own shockwaves to generate lift.</p>

          <p>A small private plane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego's Sorrento Valley on Saturday afternoon. The pilot was forced to land on the highway due to apparent mechanical issues shortly after taking off from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. The California Highway Patrol responded to the scene, closing several lanes of traffic to manage the situation. Fortunately, no injuries were reported to the plane's occupants or to any motorists on the ground. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched peacefully to the White House to protest President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency" and his deployment of National Guard units in Washington, D.C. Protesters argued that the president is exaggerating crime rates as a pretext for a federal takeover of the city's local governance and police force. The demonstration followed a successful legal challenge by the D.C. Attorney General that blocked the White House from appointing its own "emergency police commissioner." Participants expressed concern over what they see as an unchecked and unconstitutional assertion of federal power over the city.</p>
