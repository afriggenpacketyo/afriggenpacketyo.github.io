          <h2>Trump Plans Federal Reserve Visit Amid Criticism of Chair Jerome Powell</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:47:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, intensifying his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. The visit comes as the White House criticizes the central bank for significant cost overruns on a renovation project, which has escalated to $2.5 billion. Trump has repeatedly condemned Powell for not lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy and has even suggested that the costly rebuilding could be grounds for his dismissal. This move challenges the traditional independence of the Fed, raising concerns among economists and investors about potential market volatility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has publicly stated he does not intend to harm Elon Musk's companies by revoking their substantial government subsidies, despite their ongoing public disagreements. In a social media post, Trump expressed a desire for all U.S. businesses, including Musk's, to thrive. This statement follows a period of tension where Trump had threatened to cut government contracts with companies like SpaceX and xAI. The dispute arose from Musk's opposition to a key spending bill and has created uncertainty for Musk's ventures, which rely heavily on federal contracts and regulatory credits for revenue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, has expressed deep regret over the breakdown in negotiations with resident doctors, leading to an imminent five-day strike over pay. In a letter, Streeting accused the British Medical Association (BMA) of not engaging in good faith, while the BMA maintains the walkouts are a necessary last resort after real-term wages have fallen significantly since 2008. The government offered a 5.4% pay rise but rejected requests for student loan write-offs. The strike is expected to cause major disruptions, with NHS England concerned about the impact on both emergency and non-urgent patient care.</p>

          <p>England has taken a commanding position in the fourth Test against India, driven by a powerful performance from both its batters and bowlers. Captain Ben Stokes secured his first five-wicket haul in eight years, helping to dismiss India for 358 despite a courageous half-century from an injured Rishabh Pant. In response, England's openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett launched a blistering attack, scoring 84 and 94 respectively in a 166-run partnership. England finished the day at 225-2, significantly reducing India's lead and strengthening their chances of winning the series.</p>

          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's sweeping tariffs have not yet triggered runaway inflation, but economists warn that this is likely a temporary reprieve. The delayed rollout of tariffs against major trading partners and businesses stockpiling inventory have so far buffered consumers from significant price hikes. However, analysts predict that as these temporary measures run their course, companies will face increasing pressure to pass costs on to consumers later this year. The full impact of the tariffs is expected to become more apparent by the end of summer, with durable goods like electronics and apparel likely to see price increases first.

The primary advantage of the CD is its fixed rate, which locks in the return and protects against potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

          <p>Southwest Airlines shares fell significantly after the carrier reduced its full-year profit expectations, citing ongoing economic uncertainty and a recent stabilization in travel demand. The airline now forecasts 2025 pre-tax earnings between $600 million and $800 million, a sharp decrease from its earlier projection of $1.7 billion. For the second quarter, Southwest reported adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share on $7.24 billion in revenue, missing analyst estimates. The company is currently overhauling its business model, including moving away from its open-seating policy to adapt to changing market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erik and Karin Vonk have turned a retirement hobby into Richland Rum, one of Georgia's most acclaimed craft distilleries. Located on a 70-acre estate, they are among a small percentage of global producers who make rum directly from fresh sugarcane juice rather than molasses, a practice they believe elevates their product. Their success is part of a broader "rum renaissance" in the U.S., aided by 2017 changes in Georgia law that allowed distilleries to sell directly to consumers. The distillery, which ages its rum for up to a decade, has become a major tourist attraction.</p>

His tenure has been marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power to block conservative priorities. His departure creates a major opening in a key battleground state, with numerous potential candidates from both parties expected to enter the race.</p>

          <p>For individuals carrying $40,000 in credit card debt, the path to becoming debt-free can be long and costly, especially with average interest rates near 22%.

More aggressive repayment strategies, such as fixed monthly payments of $1,500, can significantly shorten the timeline to just over three years. For such large balances, options like debt settlement, debt consolidation loans, or structured debt management programs may offer more realistic and faster paths out of debt than traditional payment methods.
