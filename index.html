          <p>In Wilmington, Los Angeles, fifteen construction workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a collapsed tunnel for approximately one hour. The incident occurred within the seven-mile-long Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major infrastructure project designed to upgrade the city's aging wastewater management system. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed all of its Urban Search and Rescue teams to the scene, managing a complex rescue operation miles from the tunnel's single access point. The workers were part of a crew on the $630.5 million Clearwater Project, which is expected to be completed by 2027.</p>

          <h2>Former Conservative Party Chairman Sir Jake Berry Defects to Reform UK</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 00:42:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant political development, former Conservative Party chairman Sir Jake Berry has defected to Reform UK, following other recent high-profile ex-Tory members. Sir Jake, who was knighted by Boris Johnson, issued a sharp critique of the last two decades of government, a move Reform UK welcomed as a strong condemnation of his former party. The defection highlights Reform's growing momentum and is causing a strategic shift within the Labour government, which is now reportedly focusing more attention on countering Nigel Farage's party than the Conservatives. This trend suggests a notable realignment in the UK's political landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland has reintroduced spot checks at its borders with Germany and Lithuania, mirroring Germany's own measures and further straining the Schengen Agreement's principle of free movement. The move is a response to Germany's tougher migration policies and has created significant disruptions for residents and commuters in border cities like Slubice and Frankfurt an der Oder. The situation is exacerbated by the appearance of self-proclaimed "citizen patrols" advocating against immigration, highlighting deep-seated political and social tensions over migration policy within the European Union. Local leaders express concern over the long-term impact on cross-border relations and economies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, set to take effect on August 1, citing a national security assessment that highlights the metal's critical role in defense and technology sectors. The move caused copper prices to surge and has raised concerns about increased costs for consumers and various industries, as the U.S. imports nearly half of its copper supply, primarily from Chile. Experts noted this could inflate prices for goods ranging from electronics to EVs, while the administration argues it will revitalize the domestic copper industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA reveals that life expectancy in California has only partially recovered from its sharp decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, remaining nearly a year below 2019 levels. While the virus is no longer the primary cause, the state's recovery is being hampered by rising deaths from drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The research also highlights persistent and stark disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians, as well as those in low-income areas, experiencing a significantly slower and less complete rebound in life expectancy.</p>

          <p>A former Kerr County official has alleged that potentially life-saving emergency alerts were delayed during the deadly Texas floods because dispatchers were required to wait for supervisor approval to activate the CodeRED system. This claim is supported by radio traffic recordings from that morning, which captured a firefighter's request for an alert being put on standby. The revelation raises serious questions about the county's emergency response protocols and whether a faster warning could have mitigated the catastrophic loss of life.</p>
