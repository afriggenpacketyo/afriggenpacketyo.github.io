          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has sacked manager Ange Postecoglou just 16 days after the team's Europa League final victory. Despite securing the club's first major trophy in 17 years with a 1-0 win over Manchester United, Postecoglou's departure comes after a disappointing Premier League season where Tottenham finished 17th. Postecoglou had previously expressed optimism for the upcoming season, but his tenure ended abruptly two years to the day after he joined from Celtic. Thomas Frank, the Brentford boss, is among the leading candidates to replace Postecoglou.</p>

          <p>This article assesses the earning potential of an 18-month certificate of deposit (CD) in early June 2025, considering the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut campaign. Despite the slight decrease in interest rates, the article illustrates how savers can still earn a substantial return, providing calculations for various deposit amounts at different interest rates. The benefits of an 18-month CD include extended protection against market uncertainty due to its fixed interest rate and the fact that alternatives like high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that may decline. An 18-month CD could be a beneficial place to keep some money, offering both growth potential and financial protection. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of the horror film "Dangerous Animals" finds it to be a disappointingly straightforward movie that lacks the inventiveness of director Sean Byrne's previous work. The film stars Hassie Harrison as a surfer who is kidnapped by a boat captain and forced to fight for her life against sharks. While Harrison's performance is praised, the movie is criticized for its predictable plot twists and underdeveloped villain. Despite some moments of tension and gore, the film ultimately fails to transcend genre clichÃ©s and offers little in the way of thematic depth.</p>

The GHF's lack of experience and the sidelining of established aid agencies have contributed to the failure.

The song, written for Warren's wife, has been streamed 107 million times in the UK and has broken the record for the most consecutive weeks at number one by a US artist. Despite its success, changing media habits mean "Ordinary" hasn't become a ubiquitous phenomenon in the way that previous long-running number ones have. The song has also become a popular wedding song, with Warren's label releasing a Wedding Version.</p>
