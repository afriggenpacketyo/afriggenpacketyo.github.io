            <p>Jackson Jobe, a promising pitching prospect for the Detroit Tigers and son of professional golfer Brandt Jobe, celebrated his first major league win against the Minnesota Twins, pitching six innings and allowing only two hits. Jobe emphasized his improved curveball control as a key factor in his success, a skill he had been actively working on. The win occurred during Masters weekend, adding a sentimental touch as Jobe reminisced about caddying for his father at the Par 3 Contest in 2006. The Tigers are currently leading the American League Central division with a 9-5 record.</p>

            <p>Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse was denied entry to Hong Kong, leading her to believe it was an attempt to silence her critical views on China's human rights record. Hobhouse, a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), was detained and deported despite having a valid reason to visit her son and grandson. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has pledged to address the issue with authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing, while Lib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey has called for the Chinese ambassador to be summoned. This incident follows a similar denial of entry to two Labour MPs to Israel, raising concerns about the diplomatic understanding between countries.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are calling on US President Donald Trump to "completely cancel" his so-callled reciprocal tariffs, as a trade war between the world's two biggest economies grinds on. This week, Trump announced a 90-day pause for a host of global tariffs he had planned, but increased levies on Chinese imports to 145%. China's commerce ministry said that Beijing was "evaluating the impact" of the move.</p>

            <p>While some technology products received a tariff reprieve, many American businesses face "irreversible" damage from the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned freight from China as businesses halt container exports. Small businesses, in particular, are struggling to sustain the high tariff costs, leading to lost sales and product shortages. A restructuring of liner services to North America is expected, potentially causing congestion and freight rate spikes (not investment advice).</p>
