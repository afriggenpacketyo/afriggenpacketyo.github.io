          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urged fellow Democrats to be more assertive in opposing President Trump, whom he characterized as a bully. Speaking at a Democratic Party state convention in South Carolina, Walz suggested Democrats should "bully the s--t" out of Trump, criticizing him as a "wannabe dictator" and an "existential threat." He also praised Democrats for their courage in fighting in a largely Republican state and acknowledged the challenging years ahead. Walz, who is considering a third term as governor and a potential 2028 presidential run, tested his message in an early-voting state. The governor wants his party to have fun and be joyful, and push back on the greed that he believes is present in the current political landscape. </p>

          <p>Two separate bridge collapses in Russian regions bordering Ukraine resulted in at least seven deaths and numerous injuries. A road bridge in Bryansk collapsed, causing several trucks to fall onto a passenger train, while another bridge collapsed in the Zheleznogorsk district, derailing a locomotive train. Moscow Railway alleged that the Bryansk bridge collapse was due to "illegal interference," but no definitive cause has been established for either incident. Emergency services are working at both scenes to investigate the collapses and provide assistance. It is unclear if the two collapses are related and Ukraine is yet to comment.</p>

          <h2>Trump's China Policies Increase Risk of Conflict Over Taiwan, Analysis Suggests</h2>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's policies toward China, characterized by aggression and perceived weakness, increase the risk of conflict over Taiwan. Trump's trade tactics and discriminatory measures against China's economy may provoke Xi Jinping to take action. The analysis argues that Trump's perceived reluctance to defend key interests, as seen in Ukraine, emboldens China to challenge the U.S. over Taiwan. The author suggests that Trump's policies are driven by self-interest and fear, rather than principles, treaties, or laws, making Taiwan a vulnerable target.</p>

          <p>Hamas is seeking changes to the U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza, focusing on guarantees, timing of hostage release, aid delivery, and Israeli forces' withdrawal. A Hamas official stated that the proposal aims for a permanent ceasefire and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal. The U.S. envoy, Steve Witkoff, called Hamas's response "totally unacceptable," describing a 60-day ceasefire deal that would free half the living hostages. Meanwhile, Palestinians in Gaza face dire conditions due to the ongoing conflict and blockade, with increasing reports of hunger and aid disruptions.</p>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Despite potentially impacting medal prospects, head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the restriction due to rising injuries among younger children. World Skate instituted the limit, which would have excluded some of Japan's previous Olympic medalists. While the decision has been met with support from some corners, others are wary of the potential impact on young athletes' aspirations.</p>

          <p>Japan is implementing amendments to its Penal Code to prioritize rehabilitation efforts in prisons, marking the first changes to punishment forms in over a century. Imprisonment will no longer be divided into categories of with and without labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory. This allows more time for rehabilitative guidance and education to reduce recidivism. The new system includes tailored programs based on age, characteristics, and other factors, such as curricula for elderly inmates and addiction recovery programs.</p>

A third candidate, popular among young men for his anti-feminist stance, symbolizes a new fight for many young South Korean women.
