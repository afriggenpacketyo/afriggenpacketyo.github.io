          <p>Senator Bill Cassidy's vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary is criticized given Kennedy's subsequent actions undermining vaccine policy.  Cassidy had initially expressed reservations but ultimately voted for confirmation, claiming to have secured concessions from Kennedy.  Kennedy's actions, including disbanding the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, contradict those assurances. Cassidy's failure to hold Kennedy accountable is heavily criticized.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aviation expert Captain Steve Scheibner suggests a potential co-pilot error as a cause of the Air India Flight 171 crash.  Scheibner hypothesizes that the co-pilot may have mistakenly raised the flaps instead of retracting the landing gear.  This theory is based on video analysis showing the landing gear remaining down and the lack of visible wing bend during takeoff.  The official investigation is ongoing, examining various potential causes.</p>
