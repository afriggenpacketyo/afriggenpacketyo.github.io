          <p>Thirty mayors from the Los Angeles area convened to condemn the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics, characterizing them as a "national experiment" to seize power from local authorities. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass highlighted the $134 million cost of deploying the Marines and National Guard, suggesting the funds could be better used by cities. Paramount Mayor Peggy Lemons described the fear experienced by residents, while Huntington Park Mayor Arturo Flores, a Marine Corps veteran, criticized the militarization of immigration enforcement as undermining democratic values. The mayors collectively denounced the fear-based tactics targeting immigrant communities and eroding public trust, labeling the administration's actions as political theater rooted in fear.</p>

          <p>Following two days of violent disorder in Northern Ireland, particularly in Ballymena, police have deployed additional officers to affected areas. The unrest, which injured 32 officers and led to six arrests, began after a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson condemned the violence as "racist thuggery" targeting ethnic minorities and police. Police Scotland is sending officers to assist, and the PSNI has requested 80 officers from Great Britain; police are reviewing footage of the incidents to pursue prosecutions, as the violence threatens to undermine the criminal investigation and cause further distress to the victim and her family.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of engaging in a criminal sex act but acquitted on another count in his New York retrial, while the jury remained deadlocked on a sexual assault charge.

Weinstein's defense argued the encounters were consensual, while prosecutors claimed he abused his power in Hollywood. Following the verdict, accusers expressed relief and hope for increased awareness of sexual violence, emphasizing the difficulty of testifying and the importance of seeking justice; the jury will resume deliberations on the remaining count.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, with the primary complaint being frustration over maintenance costs and hidden fees. The typical homeowner spends over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage expenses, which can be even higher in states like Hawaii and California. Experts recommend conducting thorough home inspections to identify potential defects and budgeting for ongoing maintenance to avoid surprise costs. Rushing into a home purchase without considering these factors can lead to financial strain and regret, as unexpected costs can force homeowners to forego necessary upgrades or repairs, or even cause them to fall into debt.</p>

Several fintech companies, including eToro and Circle, have recently debuted successfully, signaling a potential reopening of the fintech IPO market. The success of Chime's IPO could influence other companies like Klarna and Gemini, who are also considering going public, though Chime's business model, primarily generating revenue through interchange fees, faces competition from incumbents like Square, PayPal, and SoFi (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The State Department is ordering the departure of nonessential staff from the U.S. embassy in Baghdad due to heightened security risks in the region. This decision is part of President Trump's commitment to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad, and is based on the latest analysis of the situation. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the Middle East. The embassy already has a limited number of nonessential employees, so the order is not expected to impact many individuals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's budget deficit hit $316 billion in May, with the year-to-date total reaching $1.36 trillion, a 14% increase from the previous year. Surging financing costs, with interest on the $36.2 trillion debt exceeding $92 billion, are a major contributor to the fiscal issues. Despite a rise in tax revenue and tariff collections, expenditures continue to outpace receipts, with the deficit running at more than 6% of gross domestic product.

          <p>Miriam Haley, a victim of Harvey Weinstein, decided to testify again in his retrial after his previous conviction was overturned, motivated by a desire to stand up for herself and the truth. Haley testified about Weinstein sexually assaulting her in 2006, and the jury found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting her. Haley spent four days on the stand and faced a combative cross-examination from Weinstein's attorney, recounting intimate details of the assault. Despite the exhausting and invasive nature of testifying, Haley said she felt it was important to show up and continue to speak out against Weinstein's abuse.</p>

The bill includes extending Trump's tax cuts, which are set to expire, and making cuts to Medicaid and insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.
