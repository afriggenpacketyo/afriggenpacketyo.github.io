            <p>Cody Balmer, the suspect in the arson at Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's mansion, was arraigned on Monday, exhibiting bizarre behavior such as sticking his tongue out at reporters. Balmer, who identified himself as a former welder with no current employment, savings, or income, also claimed past mental health medication led to behavioral changes. Authorities stated that Balmer is receiving treatment at a hospital for an unrelated medical event. He faces charges including attempted murder, aggravated arson, burglary, and terrorism following the fire that occurred while Shapiro and his family were asleep in the residence.

            <p>The fire at Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence, allegedly started by Cody Balmer, has been labeled a "domestic terrorism incident" by Harrisburg Fire Chief Brian Enterline. Balmer, who reportedly posted about Democrats on social media, was denied bail and faces charges including attempted murder and terrorism. Investigators are exploring whether Shapiro's Jewish faith was a motivating factor, along with the possibility of mental health issues. Fortunately, the fire was contained due to a closed door, preventing it from spreading to the living quarters where Shapiro and his family were sleeping.</p>

            <p>The UK government has intervened to ensure the continued operation of British Steel's blast furnaces in Scunthorpe by securing a supply of raw materials. Coking coal and iron ore from the US will be delivered to the site, and a separate shipment from Australia has been resolved after a legal dispute. This intervention prevents the furnaces from being shut down, which would eliminate the UK's ability to produce virgin steel, essential for major construction projects. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized the government's decisive action to save British Steel, which employs 2,700 people.</p>

            <p>Major American tech firms, dubbed the “Silicon Six,” including Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft, are accused of avoiding nearly $278 billion in US corporate income taxes over the past decade. The Fair Tax Foundation reports they paid an average of 18.8% in combined taxes, significantly lower than the US average of 29.7%. The report alleges these companies have "hardwired" tax avoidance into their business models through aggressive practices and lobbying efforts. The analysis highlights the discrepancy between revenue and actual tax payments, raising questions about the fairness of the tax system. (not investment advice)</p>

Bessent's experience in the bond market allowed him to gain the president's ear, leading to the decision to pause tariffs for most countries while raising levies on China. This approach involved presenting a better way forward to achieve Trump's objectives, while considering the market's reaction.</p>

            <p>China's economy traditionally starts strong in the first quarter with an "open door red" (kai men hong) but often faces a "summer blue" period with declining growth in the second quarter. This pattern has occurred in previous years, including 2019 and 2010. Economists anticipate a strong first-quarter GDP growth of 5.16% for this year. The challenge remains to sustain this momentum through the second quarter and avoid the typical slowdown.</p>

            <p>Families of victims of the Manchester Arena bombing have expressed "absolute disbelief" that Hashem Abedi was able to attack prison officers in HMP Frankland. Abedi, who was jailed for life for murdering 22 people, attacked three officers with improvised blades and hot cooking oil. The families argue Abedi should not have access to anything he can weaponize and urge the government to ensure he cannot hurt anyone else. The Ministry of Justice has launched a full, independent review into the incident.</p>

            <p>Starbucks is changing its dress code for baristas as part of CEO Brian Niccol's efforts to revitalize the company's image. The new uniform guidelines require baristas to wear solid black shirts and khaki, black, or blue denim bottoms. The goal is to make the company's "iconic green apron" stand out more and create a sense of familiarity for customers. This change is part of Starbucks' "Back to Starbucks" mission, which aims to improve customer service and create inviting cafes.</p>

The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space.</p>

            <p>A group of small businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, seeking to block new tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that Trump has illegally usurped Congress' power to levy tariffs by claiming trade deficits constitute an emergency. The Liberty Justice Center, representing the businesses, argues that trade deficits do not pose an unusual and extraordinary threat. The suit aims to declare Trump's power grab illegal and reaffirm the principle of no taxation without representation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's administration is on a collision course with the Supreme Court over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Despite a unanimous Supreme Court order to facilitate his return, the White House is effectively defying the ruling. The administration is using the ambiguity of the order to avoid taking action. This situation tests the Supreme Court's power to check the executive branch and uphold the Constitution.</p>
