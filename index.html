          <p>Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to announce a new Labour policy guaranteeing paid work placements for young people unemployed or out of education for 18 months. Those who decline the offer without reasonable cause could face benefit sanctions. This initiative aims to abolish long-term youth unemployment, building on a previous "youth guarantee" for 18-21 year olds. The scheme, to be detailed in November's Budget, will involve private companies covering some wages and be funded from existing budgets.</p>

Shane Lowry clinched the decisive point with a birdie putt on the 18th hole, ensuring Europe's retention of the cup. Captain Luke Donald achieved consecutive Ryder Cup victories, a feat not seen since 1987, despite a strong American comeback attempt on Sunday on U.S. soil.

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has taken a significant lead in parliamentary elections with nearly 90% of votes counted. This election is crucial for the country's EU aspirations, which Sandu warned faced "massive Russian interference." Despite claims of victory by a pro-Russian opposition leader and reports of bomb scares, the PAS is poised to win, though potentially falling short of an outright majority. The vote highlights Moldova's struggle with geopolitical influences, economic challenges, and corruption.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral reelection race, citing constant media speculation and a Campaign Finance Board decision. This development leaves a three-way contest between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams faced a tumultuous year, including a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration. Despite his withdrawal, Adams' name will still appear on the November ballot.</p>

He emphasizes that true literary pressure stems from within his own existence and the art form itself. Lianke believes any human experience is valid for literature, highlighting its magic in diverse interpretations and inviting varied understandings. He dismisses external expectations, asserting literature's capacity for offering multiple angles for lively discussion and individual perception.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels concluded their second consecutive last-place season, marking the first time in 50 years. Owner Arte Moreno and President John Carpino were unavailable for comment on plans to address the team's persistent struggles, which include a high strikeout rate and the American League's highest earned-run average. Despite exploring a sale three years ago, Moreno is expected to retain ownership, potentially awaiting collective bargaining negotiations for a salary cap. The article highlights the team's ongoing issues with player development, depth, and a perceived mid-market approach despite being in a major market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump warned of widespread layoffs for federal workers if a government shutdown is not averted this week, stating that "we are going to cut a lot of the people that ... we're able to cut on a permanent basis." The White House has instructed federal agencies to prepare for mass firings, a departure from the typical furloughs during previous shutdowns. This threat underscores the administration's resolve to reduce government programs and salaries, should Congress fail to reach a spending agreement by Tuesday's midnight deadline.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents were observed patrolling downtown Chicago on Sunday, with Border Patrol boats on the Chicago River, drawing attention and some public outcry. Chief Patrol Agent Gregory Bovino reportedly led the patrols, which local officials, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, criticized as an "intimidation" tactic. Pritzker stated that such militarization of cities is unacceptable and instills fear, despite local police reporting a decrease in crime. The incident highlights ongoing tensions between federal immigration enforcement and local authorities regarding immigration policy.</p>

          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," Robert Costa reported that a government shutdown appears likely due to a stalemate between President Trump and Democrats over healthcare subsidies versus immigration. Costa stated that Trump's inner circle indicates the president welcomes a shutdown, believing he can use executive power to eliminate perceived waste and fraud. Furthermore, Costa revealed discussions within the Trump administration about potential prosecutions of political opponents, including Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, raising alarms about authoritarian governance.</p>

In a CBS News interview, Trump expressed confidence that the American public would side with him if funding expires, allowing him to cut government programs. He insisted any healthcare negotiations must address immigration and border security, rejecting Democratic characterizations of their positions. This sets the stage for a tense meeting with congressional leaders ahead of the October 1st deadline, with both sides maintaining firm stances.</p>

While the first half showed a more aggressive Rangers, the performance was ultimately described as disjointed, raising questions about tactical changes and substitutions. This win, Martin's first in the Scottish Premiership, offers a temporary reprieve, but pundits suggest it merely "papers over the cracks."

This major bombardment follows Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's plea for international support at the UN General Assembly.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major Category 4 storm, and developing Tropical Storm Imelda, may interact in the western Atlantic through a rare meteorological phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This "intense dance" can cause two storms to merge or spin around a common center, with the outcome depending on their relative strengths. While an unlikely scenario given Imelda's weaker status, forecasters are monitoring the potential interaction. Both storms are independently forecast to bring significant impacts, with Humberto threatening rip currents and Imelda expected to dump heavy rain across the Bahamas and southeastern U.S.</p>
