          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's share declined. This shift is largely attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors and command higher prices. While tariffs and a wider range of price points also contribute to Samsung's gains, analysts anticipate Apple will respond with its own foldable device and a new slimmer iPhone model to reclaim its competitive edge.

          <p>Erin has intensified to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, reaching Category 4 strength with winds up to 130 mph. While tropical storm watches are active for several Leeward Islands, the hurricane is expected to pass north of Puerto Rico and remain offshore from the U.S. mainland. However, its power will generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the East Coast from August 20 to 27, posing a significant risk to coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks.</p>

          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps for building emotional endurance, which is the capacity to manage stress without being overcome by negative feelings. She advises using a visual aid to remind yourself that learning and growth occur in the often-frustrating space between not knowing and knowing. Kennedy also emphasizes the importance of engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal dialogues and starting with small, manageable experiments to build tolerance for discomfort, which gradually strengthens overall resilience.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has endorsed Republican efforts to redraw the state's congressional district maps mid-decade, a move that could significantly favor the GOP in the 2026 midterm elections. Following a favorable state supreme court ruling that approved the dilution of Black voters' influence in northern Florida, DeSantis and legislative allies are now targeting districts in the south. Democrats have condemned the plan as a partisan power grab aimed at silencing voters and rigging elections, while DeSantis argues it is an appropriate measure to ensure fair representation.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level recorded since tracking began in 1939. This decline is mirrored by a sharp drop in underage drinking and a growing public awareness of the health risks associated with even moderate alcohol consumption. While reduced drinking correlates with positive public health outcomes, such as fewer alcohol-related deaths and illnesses, some concern exists that this trend may be linked to a broader decline in social interaction among Americans.</p>

Simultaneously, retaliatory tariffs have caused U.S. soybean exports to China to plummet to a 20-year low, depressing crop prices while operating costs continue to rise, squeezing farmers' financial stability despite their general political support for the president.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Face Offensive Challenges Following Max Muncy's Injury</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing significant offensive challenges after placing third baseman Max Muncy on the injured list with a strained oblique muscle. His absence disrupts the lineup's balance, particularly as a left-handed power hitter who consistently gets on base. The team's run production noticeably declined during his previous injury, and with his return uncertain, the Dodgers will need other key players like Teoscar Hernández to step up and provide consistent offensive output as they navigate a tight pennant race against the San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons manufacturer is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by a fiber-optic cable, making them immune to Russian electronic warfare jamming. The company aims to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant increase that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike high-value targets far behind the front lines. While longer cables present technical challenges, this innovation reflects the evolving nature of the battlefield, where long-range, precision-strike capabilities are becoming increasingly crucial.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its military support for Burkina Faso, supplying the nation with advanced weaponry as part of a broader effort to fill the security vacuum left by departing Western powers like the U.S. and France. Since re-establishing diplomatic ties in 2018, Beijing has become a key arms provider for the Burkinabe junta, which is battling jihadist insurgencies. This growing partnership positions China for greater influence in the strategically important Sahel region, reflecting a significant geopolitical shift as local governments turn away from traditional Western allies.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic drop in violent crime, with homicide rates falling to levels not seen in half a century. This turnaround is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy implemented by Mayor Brandon Scott that focuses on identifying and intervening with the small number of individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of violence. The approach combines targeted social services, such as housing and job training, with the threat of focused law enforcement, representing a significant shift away from the zero-tolerance policing of the past.</p>

          <p>A recent survey found that Americans believe the ideal age to begin saving for retirement is 27, with a target retirement age of 58. However, certified financial planners recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. While a three-decade saving window is considered viable, starting in one's early 20s can significantly increase the final nest egg. Data shows younger generations like Gen Z and millennials are already heeding this advice, beginning their savings earlier than their Gen X and baby boomer counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>
