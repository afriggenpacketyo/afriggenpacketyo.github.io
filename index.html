          <p>The Trump administration is employing a strategy of "legalistic noncompliance" to flout court orders while maintaining a facade of adherence to the law. This involves using specious legal arguments to justify actions that contradict judicial rulings, such as in the Alien Enemies Act litigation. By presenting their defiance in legal terms, the administration aims to lower public awareness of noncompliance and wear down the courts. The author warns that this approach could lead to outright noncompliance or "legalized noncompliance," where courts issue rulings that allow the administration to appear compliant without actually fulfilling the court's demands.</p>
