          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings, driven by strong performance in its YouTube and Cloud segments. Despite the positive results, the company announced it will increase its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion, primarily to fund its expanding artificial intelligence strategy. This increased spending reflects the growing demand for its Cloud products and the company's commitment to investing in top AI talent and technology to maintain its competitive edge.

          <p>A gunman in Lorain, Ohio, opened fire on two police officers as they ate lunch in their patrol cars, injuring both in what authorities described as an ambush. A third officer who responded to the scene was also shot and injured. Officers returned fire, killing the 28-year-old suspect, who was reportedly armed with a high-powered rifle and an arsenal of other weapons. The motive for the attack is currently unknown, and the Elyria Police Department is leading the investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has blocked the release of grand jury transcripts related to the 2006 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, denying a request from the Trump administration. The judge ruled that the government's argument for public interest did not meet the high legal standard required to overcome grand jury secrecy rules. This decision is separate from pending requests in New York and comes amid renewed focus on Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been subpoenaed to testify before Congress.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has approved a subpoena to compel the Department of Justice to release its files on the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The motion passed with bipartisan support, defying some Republican leadership, and now awaits the signature of Chairman James Comer. The move coincides with a separate subpoena issued to convicted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, seeking her deposition from the federal prison where she is incarcerated. These actions represent a concerted push for greater transparency and accountability in the high-profile case.</p>

          <h2>The Word 'OK' Traced Back to a 19th-Century Joke and a US Presidential Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:27:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The globally understood word "OK" originated as a linguistic joke in 1839, appearing in a Boston newspaper as a playful abbreviation for "oll korrect" (all correct). Its popularity soared during the 1840 reelection campaign of President Martin Van Buren, whose nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently matched the initials. The simple, versatile term spread globally, aided by technology like the telegraph and its use by American soldiers abroad, becoming one of the most recognized words on the planet.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that his administration is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences. Currently, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to this tax. Proponents argue the change would help homeowners, particularly seniors, and address housing shortages, though experts note the proposal could be costly and it remains unclear if it has broad support in Congress to become law.

This move formalizes the culture war focus on AI, framing safety guardrails and content moderation as a form of censorship against conservative views.</p>

The story's elements—a wealthy financier, elite connections, shocking sex crime accusations, and a mysterious jail death—provide material for various narratives, from MAGA theories about Democrats to #Resistance hopes of exposing Trump. The article argues that Trump's own past ties to Epstein and his administration's clumsy handling of the files have only fueled more intense speculation and public interest from all sides.</p>
