          <p>Air Canada is set to begin canceling flights in anticipation of a potential strike after its flight attendants' union issued a 72-hour notice. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), representing 10,000 attendants, and the airline are at an impasse over contract negotiations concerning wages and unpaid work. Air Canada has stated the union's demands are exorbitant, while the union claims the company's offer is below inflation and market value. The potential strike threatens to disrupt travel for approximately 130,000 daily customers during the peak summer season, with a complete cessation of flying expected to start Saturday.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that U.S. homeowners have reached record levels of home equity, with nearly 48 million mortgage holders possessing tappable funds. The average homeowner holds around $213,000 in accessible value, contributing to a total of $11.6 trillion in usable equity nationwide. The article explains how homeowners can calculate their available equity by subtracting their mortgage balance from their home's current market value, noting that lenders typically allow borrowing up to 80% of this amount. While options like home equity loans and HELOCs are available, homeowners are cautioned against overborrowing as the home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At 91 years old, legendary Los Angeles jazz musician Bobby Bradford is starting over after his Altadena home of 50 years was destroyed in the Eaton wildfire. Having lost decades of memories, Bradford finds solace and purpose in his music, which he describes as all he has left. He is set to perform a suite of compositions inspired by his hero, Jackie Robinson, drawing parallels between Robinson's perseverance and his own current adversity. Despite the profound loss and challenges with insurance, Bradford continues to create and perform, embodying the resilient and improvisational spirit of jazz itself.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has issued a stern warning to President Trump, advising him not to attempt a federal takeover of the city's law enforcement as was done in Washington, D.C. Krasner, who is backed by George Soros, criticized Trump as a "convicted criminal" and accused him of opposing public safety for political power. He asserted that Philadelphia, as the "cradle of democracy," would legally resist any such move, framing it as a defense against a fascist agenda. The DA also countered claims of rampant crime, stating that homicides are at a 50-year low.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman advises that succeeding in the age of artificial intelligence will depend less on technical knowledge and more on soft skills, particularly critical thinking. He emphasizes that as AI tools handle more administrative tasks, the ability for humans to think creatively, adapt to new technologies, and make nuanced judgments will become paramount. Garman told his own teenage child that developing critical thinking is the most important aspect of a college education, regardless of the major. He also highlighted adaptability and effective communication as essential skills where humans will continue to hold an advantage over AI.</p>

          <p>A 32-year-old Syrian national living at The Bell Hotel in Epping, a site used by the Home Office to house asylum seekers, has been charged with sexual assault and multiple counts of common assault.

          <p>Despite President Trump's criticism of Goldman Sachs, a consensus is forming among Wall Street economists that U.S. consumers will face higher inflation due to tariffs. Economists from firms like JPMorgan Chase and UBS agree that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, companies will increasingly pass on the higher costs of duties to customers. While runaway inflation isn't expected, monthly gains could push the Federal Reserve's preferred core inflation measure into the low- to mid-3% range. This potential rise in inflation is not anticipated to stop the Fed from cutting interest rates, as a weakening labor market remains a primary concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, is experiencing record-breaking flooding after an outburst from the Suicide Basin, an area dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier, released massive amounts of water. The Mendenhall River crested at 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and inundating parts of the city, prompting some residents to evacuate. This annual event, exacerbated by climate change, occurs when meltwater pressure breaks through the glacial ice dam. In response to recurring damage, authorities have installed temporary barriers this year to protect hundreds of homes, while a long-term solution is still under study.</p>

While the port operated without delays, logistics experts note that this early peak season has been less robust than normal, with a notable pullback in the retail sector.

          <p>This article critiques President Trump's nomination of E. J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) after firing his predecessor for producing "bad numbers." The author argues that Antoni, a loyalist with thin credentials, was chosen for his ideology rather than his expertise, drawing parallels to authoritarian regimes that manipulate statistics for political gain. This move is seen as a threat to the integrity of crucial economic data, which could undermine investor confidence and damage the U.S. economy by replacing reliable information with "Potemkin statistics."</p>

          <p>President Trump responded dismissively to a report that Russia was at least partially responsible for a hack of the U.S. federal court's electronic document system. When asked about the breach, Trump said, "Are you surprised?" and added, "They hack in, that's what they do." The New York Times reported that the hack compromised sealed records, with some searches targeting cases involving individuals with Russian and Eastern European surnames. The president suggested he "could" bring up the issue during his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a stark warning to Russia, threatening "severe consequences" if President Vladimir Putin does not agree to end the war in Ukraine during their upcoming meeting in Alaska. The threat was made following a virtual conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. During the call, Zelenskyy reportedly advised Trump that Putin is "bluffing" about wanting peace and that more pressure is needed. Trump stated that his initial meeting with Putin is to assess the situation, with a potential second meeting involving Zelenskyy if progress is made.</p>

          <p>A new study of a khipu, the knotted-cord record-keeping system of the Inca Empire, suggests the practice may have been more widespread than previously believed. Researchers analyzed a primary cord made entirely of human hair and determined from its chemical composition that its creator had a diet of a commoner, not a ruling elite. This discovery challenges the long-held assumption that khipu production was exclusively the domain of high-status individuals. The finding provides evidence for continuity between ancient Incan khipus and more modern versions made by lower-status people, potentially rewriting the understanding of Incan literacy.</p>

The administration's cancellation of mRNA vaccine research grants, ousting of key health officials, and criticism of pandemic-era policies are framed as a "COVID-revenge campaign." This strategy uses the politicization of COVID shots to cast doubt on the entire vaccine ecosystem and the expert bodies that support it.

The suit provides a counter-narrative to Presley's own lawsuit, which claimed elder abuse, asserting that Kruse and her associate are the real victims who invested millions to revitalize Presley's brand.

          <p>This article outlines the potential earnings for a $75,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) in the current economic climate, where rates remain attractive. With fixed rates, savers can precisely calculate their returns, which are substantial for a large deposit, ranging from nearly $800 on a 3-month CD to over $16,000 on a 5-year CD. The article notes that since CD rates are locked in, they offer protection against potential future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. This makes CDs a compelling option for savers who are comfortable parting with their money for a set term in exchange for guaranteed returns. (not investment advice)</p>

In a memo, Walmart's chief people officer stated the expansion was a direct response to employee feedback and is one of the company's most requested benefits.

          <p>A new study warns that global wild reindeer populations could decline by nearly 60% by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curtailed, with North American caribou facing the most severe risk of an 80% drop.

The decline of reindeer, which are crucial for maintaining tundra plant diversity and serve as a vital cultural and food source for Indigenous communities, could have cascading negative effects on Arctic ecosystems and carbon storage.</p>
