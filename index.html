          <p>Rupert Murdoch has agreed to provide President Trump with regular updates on his health to delay being deposed in a $10 billion defamation lawsuit. The suit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump claims is false. This unusual arrangement, approved by a Miami federal court, postpones the 94-year-old media mogul's testimony until a judge rules on a motion to dismiss the case. The agreement highlights a complex legal battle between two powerful and formerly close figures.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that U.S. credit card balances have climbed to $1.21 trillion, equaling the all-time high set last year. The data also indicates a rise in delinquency rates, particularly among subprime borrowers, suggesting growing financial strain for some households. Researchers note that while many consumers are managing their debt, others may have overextended themselves amid high inflation and borrowing costs. This trend highlights a widening gap in financial stability across the American consumer landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of the Interior, under Secretary Doug Burgum, is implementing a new policy that could restrict large-scale wind and solar energy projects on federal lands. Citing President Trump's concerns about environmental impacts, including bird deaths, the department will use a "capacity density" formula to evaluate projects. This new metric prioritizes energy output and reliability relative to the physical footprint of an installation. The move signals a significant shift in federal energy policy, favoring more compact energy sources over renewables.</p>

The stock's decline adds to a recent downturn, with shares now down over 30% from a record high reached in July. The drop occurred amid a broader market dip and follows a period of strong performance earlier in the year, fueled by legislative progress on crypto regulation. Despite recent volatility, some analysts remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic explores the surprising quietness of extremist groups like the Proud Boys during the second Trump administration. Despite pardons for January 6 convicts, the group's public activity has decreased, which some experts attribute to internal fractures and the government itself enacting their hardline agenda, particularly on immigration. With agencies like ICE pursuing aggressive mass-deportation campaigns, the role for such militant groups to protest or act has diminished. The analysis suggests their ideals are being mainstreamed through official policy rather than street-level activism.</p>

The practice was initiated by Elon Musk during his brief tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency as a tool to assess productivity and potentially reduce the workforce. OPM Director Scott Kupor stated that managers have other, more effective tools to track team progress. The directive had faced resistance from several agencies since its introduction in February.</p>

          <p>A political and legal battle is unfolding in Texas over a Republican-led effort to redraw the state's congressional map mid-decade, a move that could net the GOP up to five House seats. President Trump has endorsed the plan, stating Republicans are "entitled" to the seats, which is crucial given the party's slim majority in the U.S. House. In protest, Texas Democrats have fled the state to deny a voting quorum, prompting the governor to order their arrest.

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs economist, the impact of generative AI on the labor market is already becoming evident, starting with a hiring pullback in the technology sector. The analysis indicates that unemployment rates for tech workers aged 20-30 have risen notably this year, as many junior-level tasks are the easiest to automate. While widespread job displacement has not yet occurred, companies are reportedly slowing the hiring of new employees as they integrate AI. This trend signals the beginning of a significant, long-term shift in employment dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

It points to instances where critics, including Jewish Senator Bernie Sanders, were accused of this for condemning civilian deaths in Gaza.

          <p>Nvidia has publicly rejected accusations from China that its AI chips contain a "kill switch" or other hidden backdoors that could allow for remote deactivation. The statement from Nvidia's Chief Security Officer came after China's cybersecurity regulator raised concerns about such vulnerabilities in chips designed for the Chinese market. The company argued that such features would be a fundamental security flaw, violating cybersecurity principles and harming U.S. national security. This incident highlights the growing geopolitical tensions surrounding advanced semiconductor technology and its control.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and a number of former attorneys general and FBI directors as part of its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case. The bipartisan effort seeks depositions and documents related to the federal government's handling of the Epstein investigation over the years. This move follows a recent Justice Department memo that concluded there was no "client list," a finding that angered many lawmakers. The subpoenas signal a significant escalation in Congress's effort to uncover more information about the deceased sex offender.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice under the Trump administration has published a new list of 35 jurisdictions it deems to have "sanctuary" policies that obstruct federal immigration enforcement. The list includes the state of California and the city of Los Angeles, but notably omits Los Angeles County, which was on a previous list. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the DOJ will continue to litigate against such jurisdictions to eradicate policies it considers harmful. This action represents the latest move in the administration's ongoing campaign to pressure local and state governments to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>Following several recent emergency airplane evacuations, Senator Tammy Duckworth is demanding answers from the FAA on the adequacy of its safety standards. In a letter to the FAA administrator, Duckworth raised concerns that the current 90-second evacuation standard is unrealistic, citing videos showing passengers retrieving luggage, which slows the process. She is seeking data from recent incidents and an update on Congressionally mandated realistic evacuation testing, which is overdue. The senator, a double amputee, has previously stated she does not believe the current standards reflect the reality of flying for all passengers.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have collectively agreed to purchase over $1 billion in U.S. weapons to be sent to Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the nations for the commitment, which will provide crucial military aid, including components for Patriot air defense systems. The move marks a significant step in European support for Ukraine's defense, facilitated by a shift in U.S. policy.</p>
