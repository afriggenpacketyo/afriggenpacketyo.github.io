          <p>Vance Luther Boelter, accused of assassinating Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, faces six federal charges, including stalking, murder, and firearms offenses. The acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota described the details of the crime as "chilling," noting Boelter allegedly went to the homes of four lawmakers with the intent to kill them. One lawmaker was not home, and another, state Sen. Ann Rest, was alerted by authorities, who believe their quick action saved her life. Boelter reportedly planned the attacks, researching victims and conducting surveillance on their homes. Optimism for the situation remains low given the tragedy of the event.</p>

          <p>California state Sens. Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin are introducing legislation to ban law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings during interactions with the public. The "No Secret Police Act" aims to ensure transparency and accountability, requiring officers to wear identifying information. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers wearing medical masks during natural disasters, with clear riot gear permitted. The proposal follows protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration policies and seeks to prevent law enforcement from behaving like "secret police."</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada amidst trade tensions and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. He stated that Iran would "like to talk" but needs to make a deal, confirming he has seen messages indicating a wish to de-escalate. Trump also mentioned he'd consider allowing China to join the group and addressed Vladimir Putin's ouster in 2014. The summit includes meetings with G7 leaders and discussions on tariffs, with Trump asserting he is a "tariff person." The overall tone suggests ongoing diplomatic and economic complexities.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee is navigating delicate compromises on Medicaid and taxes within President Trump's "big, beautiful bill." Chaired by Sen. Mike Crapo, the committee's legislation seeks to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, cut "Green New Deal" spending, and target waste and fraud in spending programs. The Senate aims to leave its imprint on the package, despite House Speaker Mike Johnson's plea for minimal changes, especially regarding SALT and Medicaid. The committee is balancing divisions over Medicaid provider payments and an increase to the SALT cap, a contentious issue for lawmakers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his plan to conduct mass deportations in major U.S. cities, particularly those run by Democrats. Speaking at the G7 summit, Trump stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, accusing these "sanctuary cities" of harboring illegal immigrants. He claimed Democrats use illegal immigration to influence elections and grow the welfare state, despite noncitizens being unable to vote in federal or state elections. The announcement follows protests against the administration's immigration crackdown, though Trump has recently shifted his stance on undocumented workers in farming and hospitality.</p>

          <p>Google issued an apology and incident report for a major outage that caused downtime for over 70 Google Cloud services, impacting third-party services like Cloudflare, OpenAI, and Shopify, as well as Google's own services. The outage was caused by flawed updates to the company's "quota policy checks" feature, which were not adequately tested before implementation. Google is changing its architecture to prevent similar crashes and will audit systems and improve communications. The company deeply apologized for the disruption caused to customers and their users.</p>

          <p>The NAACP will not invite President Trump to its national convention, marking the first time in 116 years that the organization has excluded a sitting president. NAACP President Derrick Johnson accused Trump of working against the group's mission to advance civil rights. The decision was weighty, considering the organization's history of inviting presidents with whom it had policy disagreements. The NAACP has filed multiple lawsuits against Trump in recent months, including one challenging the Department of Education's actions against diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.</p>

          <p>Over two dozen U.S. Air Force KC-135R and KC-46A tankers were tracked heading east over the Atlantic, prompting speculation about their mission amid the Israel-Iran conflict. Potential explanations include providing aerial refueling support to Israel, preparing for direct U.S. involvement in the conflict, countering Iranian attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz, or establishing an air bridge for increased asset deployment to the Middle East. The movements coincide with a U.S. carrier strike group heading into the Indian Ocean, suggesting a broader military buildup in the region.

The Home Secretary apologized to victims and announced a national inquiry into grooming gangs. Recommendations include ensuring adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child face the most serious charge of sexual assault and making ethnicity data collection mandatory.</p>
