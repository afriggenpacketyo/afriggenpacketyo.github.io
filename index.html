          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai announced a "T-Dome" missile shield plan during a Double Tenth Day address, proposing a multilayered air defense network to protect critical infrastructure and population centers from potential attacks by Beijing. This initiative, which Lai suggested would incorporate advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, was notably absent from the defense ministry's latest report and next year's budget, surprising the defense establishment. The ambitious proposal aims to bolster Taiwan's defenses, drawing parallels to systems like Israel's Iron Dome, but its rapid development and funding details are yet to be clarified. The article questions whether this vision will materialize or remain an aspirational concept.</p>

While the cause of his death was not disclosed, bandmates expressed profound shock and grief, requesting privacy for his family during this difficult time.

          <p>New damaging reports have emerged about Prince Andrew, alleging he sought personal information about Virginia Giuffre through a police protection officer in 2011, intensifying calls for King Charles to strip him of his "prince" title. This comes after Andrew agreed to relinquish other titles and honors due to his links with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Prince William is reportedly "not satisfied" and advocates a more ruthless approach, including a ban from his future coronation. The article highlights the ongoing pressure on the Royal Family and the upcoming posthumous memoir by Ms. Giuffre, which is expected to reignite scrutiny over Andrew's alleged involvement in Epstein's sexual assault network.</p>

          <p>USC's College Football Playoff hopes are now hanging by a thread after a 34-24 rain-soaked loss to Notre Dame, potentially marking a bitter end to their century-long rivalry. The Trojans were plagued by costly turnovers, including two interceptions from quarterback Jayden Maiava and a critical fumble on a trick play, which shifted the game's momentum. Despite a 59-yard touchdown, Notre Dame's powerful rushing attack, accumulating over 300 yards, and a 100-yard kickoff return, proved insurmountable. The article emphasizes USC's defensive struggles and missed opportunities in the red zone, leaving them to ponder a season-altering defeat.</p>

          <p>The periodic closure of a 17-mile stretch of Interstate 5 for a military live-fire exercise at Camp Pendleton sparked significant anger and gridlock in local communities like San Clemente. City Councilmember Mark Enmeier criticized the lack of coordination with local officials, stating the closure came "completely out of the blue" and caused needless financial strain. Local businesses reported slower-than-usual activity, expressing sarcasm over the "great use of funding." Governor Gavin Newsom also condemned the White House for failing to coordinate and share safety information, reinforcing the perception of a "show of force" potentially timed with widespread protests.</p>

          <p>A deepening mystery surrounds the death of 15-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez, whose severely decomposed body was found in the front trunk of pop star D4vd's Tesla. The singer, whose legal name is David Anthony Burke, has yet to publicly comment but is cooperating with authorities, who have not named a suspect or determined the cause of death. The discovery led to the cancellation of D4vd's world tour and suspension of album promotion. Online sleuths have noted connections, including matching tattoos and alleged past dating, while legal experts question the LAPD's slow release of information, given the high-profile nature and available technology.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, co-founder of Betfred, has warned that all 1,287 of the company's UK shops, employing 7,500 people, could close if Chancellor Rachel Reeves increases gambling taxes.

This echoes similar warnings from other gambling brands, including William Hill, which also faces potential closures. The article highlights the industry's resistance to proposed tax hikes, which some think tanks suggest could raise significant revenue to reduce child poverty, but which firms argue would decimate the High Street presence.
