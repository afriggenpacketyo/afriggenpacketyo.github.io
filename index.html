          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 23:35:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines experienced their largest intra-day drop since August 2024 after the company announced a 59% plunge in first-quarter net profit. The decline was attributed to lower interest income and significant losses from its associate, Air India, in which SIA holds a 25.1% stake. Analysts noted that Air India's losses were deeper than expected, partly due to reputational damage following a recent incident, creating a near-term drag on SIA's financials. Despite strong travel demand, some investment firms have downgraded the stock, citing weaker cargo performance and high operating costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryne Sandberg, the Hall of Fame second baseman and Chicago Cubs icon, has died at the age of 65 after a battle with prostate cancer. Remembered for his integrity and competitive spirit, Sandberg was a 10-time All-Star, nine-time Gold Glove winner, and the 1984 National League MVP. His career was highlighted by the famous "Sandberg Game" in 1984, which propelled the Cubs to their first postseason appearance in decades. After his playing career, he managed in the minor leagues and for the Philadelphia Phillies before serving as a beloved ambassador for the Cubs, who unveiled his statue at Wrigley Field last year.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to challenge a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally while they await deportation hearings. This reverses a long-standing practice of allowing release on bond for those not considered a flight or safety risk. Advocacy groups argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing catastrophic harm by separating families and detaining individuals with deep community ties for extended periods. The administration defends the change as a measure to close security loopholes and keep communities safe.</p>

          <p>Japan's government bond market is experiencing significant pressure this week due to a combination of domestic political turmoil and global financial uncertainty. Following an election loss, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces calls to resign, potentially leading to more dovish fiscal policies that concern investors. Concurrently, a recent trade deal with the U.S. has increased expectations that the Bank of Japan may soon resume interest rate hikes, possibly as early as October. This potential policy shift, along with uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve, creates a volatile environment for Japan's fragile bond market. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts at Société Générale called the deal "asymmetric," suggesting the EU accepted unfavorable terms to avoid a trade war escalation.

Both were top deputies to Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater, who leads the division responsible for investigating anticompetitive behavior and challenging monopolies. The dismissals, reportedly for insubordination, come amid tension over the handling of major investigations into companies like T-Mobile and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The division has been central to the Trump administration's efforts to enforce antitrust laws against major corporations, including lawsuits against Apple and Google.</p>

          <p>Offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver request to play for USC in his final season of eligibility. Wingfield is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive, especially given disruptions from the pandemic and a season-ending injury he suffered. Having transferred to USC with the expectation of playing, he claims the denial robs him of a significant NIL opportunity and a chance to enhance his professional prospects. The lawsuit seeks an injunction that would allow him to play for the Trojans this fall.</p>

He argues that Wall Street is currently focused on upcoming Big Tech earnings reports, the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates, and forthcoming employment data. Cramer believes investors have developed "tariff ennui," as trade negotiations have become a prolonged process with predictable patterns. He contends that until the market weathers this week's key economic events, trade policy news will likely have a muted impact on stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

The case challenges the constitutionality of sweeps where agents allegedly use race, location, or language as a pretext for detaining individuals without reasonable suspicion. The Justice Department argues the injunction is a "wholesale judicial usurpation" of federal authority, while the ACLU contends the tactics are an unconstitutional policy of indiscriminate arrests. The 9th Circuit's ruling will likely determine the scope of ICE's street-level enforcement powers and could set up another Supreme Court showdown.</p>

The case, which dates back to 2012, is highly politicized and represents a significant moment for Colombia's judiciary.

Using his recent comments on starvation in Gaza as an example, the article argues that Trump's reliance on media visuals makes him susceptible to manipulation but also attunes him to public sentiment. This narrow information stream, often from a single network, interacts dangerously with his distrust of experts. Critics worry this approach is particularly vulnerable in an age of deepfakes and misinformation, where a leader's belief that you "can't fake" what's on TV is a significant liability.</p>
