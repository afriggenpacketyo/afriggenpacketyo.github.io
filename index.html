          <p>A missile launched from Yemen by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia struck central Israel near Tel Aviv's international airport, resulting in a temporary suspension of flights. The Israeli military reported efforts to intercept the missile and identified an impact near Terminal 3, prompting an ongoing review of the incident. Emergency services treated two people injured by the blast and a third injured while seeking shelter, while social media captured images of smoke rising near the terminal. The Houthi militia resumed missile launches after Israel ended a ceasefire in Gaza, with the Israeli military intercepting most but occasionally experiencing falling fragments. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>China and Japan have traded accusations after a Japanese plane was spotted flying over a disputed island in the East China Sea. The Chinese coastguard said a routine patrol had spotted a Japanese civilian plane flying “illegally” over the airspace of an unnamed island in the Diaoyu chain, known as the Senkakus in Japan, on Saturday morning. Wu Jianghao, the Chinese ambassador to Japan, also lodged a stern protest over the “illegal intrusion”, saying the move severely violated China’s sovereignty. Meanwhile Tokyo lodged its own protest with Beijing, saying four Chinese coastguard ships had been spotted in its “territorial waters” around the islands. Optimism score: 50</p>
