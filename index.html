          <p>Novo Nordisk is partnering with telehealth providers Hims & Hers Health, Ro, and Life MD to offer its weight loss drug Wegovy directly to consumers. This move aims to increase accessibility now that Wegovy is more readily available in the U.S. and compounding pharmacies face restrictions on producing cheaper versions. The partnerships will enable patients to access Wegovy and Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare, directly through telehealth platforms. Patients without insurance can purchase Wegovy for $499 per month through NovoCare, though telehealth companies may charge additional fees for their services.</p>

          <p>Home equity loans and HELOCs offer homeowners access to funds using their home equity as collateral, often at competitive interest rates. As of April 29, 2025, national average rates for home equity loans hover around 8.36%, while HELOC rates average 7.94%, but these rates fluctuate with federal fund rate adjustments. Borrowers can secure better rates by comparing quotes from multiple lenders, choosing shorter loan terms, and improving their credit scores. Despite rate fluctuations, home equity loans and HELOCs remain attractive financing options compared to credit cards and personal loans due to their typically lower interest rates.

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled that Malta's 'golden passport' scheme, which grants citizenship to foreign investors, violates EU law. The court stated that offering citizenship in exchange for investments essentially turns naturalization into a commercial transaction, raising concerns about white-collar crime and sanctions evasion. Malta has been ordered to end the program immediately, though the government defends it, citing €1.4 billion in revenue since 2015. Transparency advocates have praised the ruling, arguing that it prevents the commodification of EU citizenship and reckless golden passport programs.</p>

          <p>Shipments from China to the U.S. have sharply declined due to escalating trade tensions and increased tariffs, leading U.S. retailers to warn of potential product shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese goods have risen to as high as 145%, causing a significant drop in cargo flow through ports like Los Angeles. Retailers, including Walmart and Target, have cautioned that consumers may face empty shelves and higher prices due to tariff surcharges.

          <p>Volvo Cars announced plans to cut costs by 18 billion Swedish krona ($1.87 billion) and withdrew its financial guidance due to a sharp decline in operating profit for the first quarter. The company cited a drop in wholesales, adverse currency effects, and broader automotive industry turbulence as reasons for the downturn. The cost-cutting plan includes reductions in investments and potential redundancies at its operations worldwide. Volvo Cars also noted tariff pressure on the automotive sector as a contributing factor to the withdrawn financial guidance.</p>

          <p>Economists are raising concerns about President Trump's economic policies, noting that his trade, immigration, and spending initiatives have failed to stimulate growth and may reignite inflation. Surveys suggest the U.S. is headed for a sluggish pace of growth, with tariffs creating an "existential crisis" for businesses. Consumers are skeptical about Trump's ability to tackle inflation, and major retailers warn of potential supply chain disruptions and empty shelves. While the administration touts its efforts to cut federal spending and attract investment, critics argue that the tariffs will drive up prices and harm economic growth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to ease tariffs on automakers to prevent them from being doubly impacted by tariffs on car parts, steel, and aluminum. Automakers will be reimbursed for double tariffs already paid, although the 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain. Industry leaders from Stellantis and Ford have expressed support for the move, which aims to strengthen the American auto industry and stimulate exports. General Motors, however, is reassessing its 2025 financial outlook due to the potential impact of the tariffs.</p>

The move is aimed at giving automakers time to move their supply chains for parts back to the U.S.</p>

Carney, a former central banker, struck a combative tone towards the United States during his acceptance speech, vowing to push back against Trump's policies. The election was largely shaped by Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st state and the tariffs he imposed on Canadian goods.
