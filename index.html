The program will facilitate earlier engagement between drugmakers and the FDA, accelerating approvals for new facilities.

          <p>Reverse mortgages offer older homeowners a way to convert home equity into cash, potentially freeing up cash flow and eliminating monthly mortgage payments, which can be beneficial for retirees on fixed incomes facing inflation. However, experts warn of high upfront fees and ongoing costs that can quickly deplete equity. These loans also carry risks in declining housing markets, as sustained home value is crucial for continued access to funds.

          <p>Beijing's Director General of Asian Affairs, Liu Jinsong, summoned Japan's chief minister in Beijing, Akira Yokochi, to convey "grave concern" regarding issues including history, Taiwan, and the safety of Chinese citizens in Japan. This diplomatic move precedes World War II commemorations, a long-standing source of tension between the two nations. The summons also follows a rare visit by Taiwan's foreign minister to Japan, which Beijing had criticized as sending a "seriously wrong signal" and supporting "anti-China separatist activities."</p>

          <p>New York City's final "migrant hotel," The Row in Times Square, is set to cease operations as an emergency shelter, winding down over the next eight months. Mayor Eric Adams stated that the city has successfully helped over 200,000 migrants transition from the shelter system, closing 64 emergency sites. This move follows a reduction in migrant arrivals due to the Trump administration's border policies. While the city has provided travel tickets for many, the future housing for the remaining 3,400 individuals at The Row remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The average two-year mortgage rate in the UK has dropped below 5% to 4.99%, a "symbolic turning point" since Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022. This decline, driven by lenders competing more aggressively and recent Bank of England rate cuts, offers some relief to homebuyers. However, rates remain significantly higher than pre-mini-budget levels. While affordability is gradually improving with easing rates and rising wages, the Bank of England's forecast for higher inflation this year suggests that the base rate may hold steady, limiting further substantial drops.

The average age of a first-time homebuyer has risen to 38.

Homebuyers should instead focus on strengthening their financial position, boosting credit scores, saving for larger down payments, and shopping around for lenders, as rate cuts don't guarantee lower overall payments due to potential price increases.

          <p>New guidance for UK police forces suggests they should consider disclosing a suspect's ethnicity and nationality in high-profile or sensitive investigations, particularly after a charge. This update aims to address inconsistencies and defuse social tensions fueled by misinformation, as seen in recent incidents. While police can provide sex and age upon arrest, the decision to reveal more details rests with individual forces, balancing public interest with legal issues like fair trial rights. Concerns exist that such disclosures could inadvertently fuel racism or influence future trials.</p>

          <p>Officials in Mason, Tennessee, have approved agreements to convert a former prison into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center, to be operated by private company CoreCivic. Despite strong objections from residents and activists, local leaders cited job creation and economic development for the rural town as reasons for the decision. The move aligns with the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda and follows President Trump's reversal of an order to stop renewing contracts with private detention facilities. CoreCivic faces criticism for reported mistreatment conditions at its facilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microplastics are increasingly found within plant cells, raising concerns about their impact on photosynthesis, the fundamental process for food chains and oxygen production. Research suggests microplastics can reduce photosynthesis by up to 12%, potentially leading to significant drops in seafood and staple crop yields, threatening food security for millions. These particles enter plants through soil, often from agricultural films and fertilizers. Experts emphasize the urgent need for more data on global contamination and stricter regulation on plastic production to mitigate this growing environmental and food security threat.</p>

          <p>California is challenging President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, arguing it violated the Posse Comitatus Act and caused "anxiety and fear." The state asserts the military provided armed security, controlled civilian movement, and detained individuals, exceeding their authority. The Justice Department, however, maintains the deployment was legal, aimed at protecting federal property and personnel, and that the president has discretion under Title 10. This legal battle highlights ongoing debate over the federal government's use of military forces in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Tensions from a border conflict with Cambodia are strengthening the Thai military's influence, leading to concerns about a potential coup. The military has historically dominated Thai politics, with minimal civilian oversight, and recent clashes have allowed generals greater autonomy. The conflict also contributed to the suspension of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and the unraveling of the ruling coalition. Public trust in the military for national security is high, and despite a fragile ceasefire, analysts suggest a return of former junta leader Prayut Chan-ocha is becoming more plausible.</p>

          <p>New Delhi is facing a contentious issue regarding its estimated 800,000 to 1 million stray dogs, following a Supreme Court order to relocate them to shelters due to rising dog bites and rabies cases. Animal rights activists strongly oppose the directive, arguing it is impractical, inhumane, and contradicts established animal birth control (ABC) rules for sterilization and vaccination. They highlight the lack of adequate shelter capacity and the potential for increased public health risks if vaccinated dogs are removed. Advocates propose sustained sterilization, vaccination, and improved waste management as more effective solutions.</p>
