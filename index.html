        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a significant new rule to limit the length of time international students can remain in the U.S. for their studies, capping it at four years. This move aims to prevent "visa abuse" and enhance the Department of Homeland Security's ability to vet and oversee these individuals, replacing the current "duration of status" policy. DHS contends that some foreign students exploit the system, becoming "forever students" and posing potential safety risks while costing taxpayers. Critics, including the Association of International Educators, argue that this measure will act as a deterrent, negatively impacting U.S. colleges financially and harming American innovation and global competitiveness. The proposal also introduces new time limits for foreign journalists.</p>

          <p>A horrific shooting at a Catholic school within Annunciation Church in Minneapolis has left two children, aged eight and ten, dead and seventeen people injured, including fourteen other children and three elderly parishioners. The assailant, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, reportedly dressed in all black, fired numerous shots through the building's windows before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI is investigating this tragedy as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, noting the discovery of a manifesto the suspect intended to publish. This senseless attack has profoundly traumatized the local community, with city officials emphasizing the urgent need for concrete measures to address gun violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent news of Taylor Swift's engagement has ignited a fervent emotional response from her global fanbase, serving as a prominent example of parasocial relationships. This phenomenon describes the development of one-sided friendly or romantic feelings towards public figures, fueled by the extensive access fans now have to celebrities' private lives via social media. Psychologists explain that this illusion of intimacy can satisfy a human need for connection and foster a sense of community among fans, especially as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, experts like Harvard's Arthur C. Brooks caution that these relationships, while enjoyable, lack the reciprocal "nutritional content" of real-life friendships and cannot fulfill deeper social needs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK, exempt from customs duties due to a £135 threshold, more than doubled last year to £3 billion, driven largely by e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. This surge has prompted the UK government to review the tax exemption rules, as British businesses argue they are being unfairly undercut and consumers face potentially faulty goods. While some analysts warn that removing the exemption could disproportionately affect lower-income consumers and small importers, retailers are pressing for swift action to protect High Street businesses and ensure product safety standards. The Treasury's review is ongoing, with other nations like the US and EU already adjusting similar policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stark warning, asserting that Donald Trump is gravely serious about pursuing a third term as president, despite constitutional limits. Newsom, a potential presidential contender, highlighted Trump's disregard for democratic norms and cited a private Oval Office meeting where Trump allegedly discussed serving beyond two terms, referencing Franklin D. Roosevelt. The governor also pointed to Trump's lavish White House ballroom plans as evidence of his intent to remain in power. Newsom urged Democrats and Americans to "wake up" and take Trump's statements seriously, advocating for a more combative political stance to counter what he perceives as threats to the country's foundational rules.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has issued a firm warning against any external interference in its relationship with South Korea, stressing that the bilateral ties are founded on mutual interests and are not directed at a third party. This diplomatic statement comes in response to South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's recent comments, where he indicated Seoul's need to rebalance its relationship with Beijing amidst escalating U.S.-China competition. President Lee articulated that South Korea could no longer sustain a strategy of relying on the U.S. for security while simultaneously fostering economic cooperation with China, suggesting a necessary alignment with America's fundamental policy positions. This highlights the growing geopolitical pressures on regional alliances.</p>

          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China's second-largest liquor distiller, has reported its slowest earnings growth in a decade, with first-half revenue up 4.2% and net profit increasing by 2.3%. This downturn reflects the significant impact of an intensified anti-corruption campaign, which has curtailed ostentatious consumption, alongside a broader economic slowdown affecting the luxury goods market. The article notes that other major baijiu makers, including Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor, have also experienced their slowest growth or even plunges in revenue and profit. This trend underscores how government policies and economic conditions are reshaping consumption patterns in China's traditional liquor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentinian authorities are actively searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago, after it resurfaced in a real estate advertisement. The painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, was part of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection before being divided by Nazi officials. Police raided a seaside villa in Argentina, a country known for sheltering Nazis post-WWII, but found only documents and weapons, not the artwork.

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has incurred a significant fine of nearly £31,500 ($42,500) for his unsportsmanlike conduct during a dramatic first-round exit from the Grand Slam tournament. The incident involved Medvedev's on-court meltdown, reportedly triggered by a photographer's presence, culminating in him smashing his racket against a chair. The United States Tennis Association imposed fines of $30,000 for unsportsmanlike behavior and an additional $12,500 for equipment abuse. Consequently, the Russian player will forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money, an outcome he acknowledged was likely, opting to remain silent on the matter to avoid further repercussions following the hefty financial score.</p>

This marks the third senior staff change in Starmer's Downing Street office within a year, following the departures of chief of staff Sue Gray and communications director Matthew Doyle. The BBC understands concerns existed about Pandit's effectiveness, although No 10 disputes this, stating the prime minister retains confidence in her. The principal private secretary is a highly influential civil service position, controlling information flow and shaping the prime minister's diary.

          <p>Reform UK is emerging as a significant electoral threat to the Scottish Conservatives, with leader Nigel Farage confidently predicting the Tories' decline in Scotland. This assessment follows Graham Simpson's defection, making him the third MSP to leave the Conservatives for Reform in four months. Opinion polls now consistently show Reform trailing the Tories, signaling a potential major electoral breakthrough in the upcoming Holyrood election. While Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay faces pressure to shift his party rightward, this risks alienating moderate voters and further fragmenting the party, as seen with other departing MSPs. The wider political landscape, including a recent Labour landslide at Westminster, suggests a challenging period for the Scottish Conservatives as Reform capitalizes on anti-establishment sentiment.</p>

          <p>Kyiv was hit by a "massive" Russian missile and drone attack, resulting in at least eight confirmed deaths, including a child, and dozens injured, with residential buildings damaged and a kindergarten ablaze. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as Russia's "clear response" to calls for a ceasefire, accusing Moscow of choosing "ballistics instead of the negotiating table." Zelenskyy expressed frustration that parts of the world "turn a blind eye" to the conflict and called for new, tough sanctions against Russia. Ukrainian officials are scheduled to meet with U.S. government representatives in New York to discuss security guarantees aimed at preventing future Russian aggression, emphasizing the need for global resolve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following public outcry, USC has offered Notre Dame a multi-year extension to continue their century-old football rivalry, expressing optimism for a deal soon. USC athletic director Jennifer Cohen stated the new offer better accommodates Notre Dame's preference for a long-term agreement, after initial reluctance due to College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, with USC seeking to move it earlier in the season to balance its schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to change. Both institutions acknowledge the rivalry's importance, with USC coach Lincoln Riley prioritizing his team's national championship aspirations but also valuing the tradition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe is experiencing its worst wildfire season on record, with one million hectares burned across the EU so far this year, equivalent to half the land area of Wales. Spain and Portugal have been particularly devastated, with over 684,000 hectares scorched, a figure four times the size of Greater London. Experts link the worsening fires directly to climate change, which creates hotter, drier conditions, and warn of future increases in severity. The fires also contribute to a vicious cycle by releasing record amounts of CO2, further exacerbating climate change. Rural depopulation and abandoned agricultural land also contribute to increased flammable vegetation, making fire management more challenging.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has begun transferring detainees from Florida's controversial state-run immigration detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," following a federal judge's order to dismantle parts of the facility. DHS criticized the ruling as an "activist judge's" attempt to hinder mass deportation efforts, but is complying by moving detainees to other sites. The facility, located in the Everglades, is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to expand immigration detention beds with state partnerships. Advocates have reported inhumane conditions, including lack of water and limited legal access, allegations denied by officials. The judge's order, which halted new construction and transfers, was issued after environmental activists argued the facility skirted federal laws.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been thrown into chaos following the ousting of its director, Susan Monarez, less than a month into her tenure, amidst a fierce dispute over vaccine policies.

The White House confirmed her termination after she refused to resign, stating she was not "aligned with the President's agenda." This contentious departure has triggered a wave of resignations from top CDC officials, who cited the "weaponizing of public health" and "dangerous politicization of science," raising alarms among public health experts about the agency's integrity and national preparedness.</p>

With the U.S. and Hong Kong developing regulatory frameworks, speculation about yuan-backed stablecoins for internationalization has grown.

The White House previously addressed these rumors in July 2025, confirming Trump has chronic venous insufficiency, a benign condition common in older individuals, but found no evidence of heart failure or renal impairment. Official medical memorandums from the Physician to the President concluded Trump remains in "excellent health," attributing hand bruising to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>
