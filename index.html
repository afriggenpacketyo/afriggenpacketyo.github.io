          <p>AI software company Palantir announced it surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, a milestone reached earlier than analysts had predicted. The company's revenue grew 48% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in its U.S. commercial and government sectors, leading to a significant rally in its stock price. Citing this strong performance and a substantial increase in contract value, Palantir has boosted its full-year revenue and income guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The contentious July jobs report, which showed weaker-than-expected payroll growth and significant downward revisions for previous months, is being interpreted by economists as confirmation of a sharp U.S. economic slowdown. Concerns are growing over the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and business investment, elevating the risks of a recession. This weak labor market data increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major political showdown is underway in Texas after Democratic state lawmakers fled to other states to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a new congressional map. In response, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to invoke a legal opinion to remove the absent Democrats from their elected offices. The controversial map, which is backed by President Trump, could create up to five new Republican-leaning districts, impacting the balance of power in the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>This legal analysis suggests the Supreme Court's conservative majority may be preparing to dismantle key protections against racial gerrymandering provided by the Voting Rights Act. In a new order for the Louisiana case, Louisiana v. Callais, the justices have asked for briefs on whether the Act's provisions are unconstitutional, signaling a potential reversal of decades of precedent. Such a move would remove one of the few remaining federal tools for challenging maps that dilute the voting power of racial minorities.</p>

          <p>The manhunt for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has stretched into its fourth day. Authorities believe Brown, who was a regular at the bar and knew the victims, is still armed and dangerous. The multi-agency search is focused on a rugged, mountainous area where Brown has past experience, and a reward of up to $10,000 is offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is set to execute inmate Byron Black without first deactivating his implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), following a contentious legal battle. Black's attorneys argued that the device could deliver painful shocks during the lethal injection process, but the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to have it turned off. The state maintains that Black would be rendered unconscious by the lethal drug and would not feel any potential shocks from the device.</p>

As of August 1, interest has resumed accruing on these loans, meaning balances will grow for those who do not make payments. Experts recommend that most of these borrowers actively switch to a different, available income-driven repayment plan, such as IBR, to avoid accumulating debt and to continue making progress toward eventual loan forgiveness.</p>
