          <p>India announced its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting what it called "terrorist infrastructure" following a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 people were killed. The Indian Ministry of Defence stated the actions were "focused, measured and non-escalatory," with no Pakistani military facilities targeted. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war, asserting Pakistan's right to respond. The strikes, labeled "Operation Sindoor," have heightened tensions between the two nations, leading to concerns about regional stability. The Defence Ministry said it will hold a detailed briefing on the strikes later in the day.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat reviews "Your Friends & Neighbors," a new Apple TV show starring Jon Hamm, which portrays the lives of wealthy residents in Connecticut. The show distinguishes itself by eliminating any sense of aspirational identification, portraying its characters as unhappy and financially insecure despite their wealth. Douthat contrasts this portrayal with shows like "Fleishman Is in Trouble," which explores the anxieties of the almost-upper-class, and suggests that "Your Friends & Neighbors" serves as a reassuring response to meritocratic status anxiety by revealing the misery of the mansion class. The article suggests that this show provides a balm for the resentments of people who assume that they'd definitely be happier with $10 million in the bank.</p>

          <p>India's missile strikes across the border into Pakistani-administered territory resulted in at least eight deaths and 35 injuries, according to the Pakistani Army. Pakistan asserts that India targeted civilians, including a mosque in Bahawalpur, while India claims it was striking infrastructure used by militants in response to a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attacks as an act of cowardice and asserted Pakistan's right to respond. The strikes have led to heightened tensions, with both countries expelling diplomats and suspending airspace usage. President Trump called the strikes "a shame" and expressed hope for a quick resolution.</p>

          <p>India carried out strikes on Pakistan in response to a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, escalating the conflict between the two nuclear powers. The strikes targeted sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, with India claiming to target militant infrastructure and Pakistan reporting civilian casualties. The conflict's roots trace back to the 1947 partition of British India, with both countries claiming the Kashmir region. Experts warn of the risk of escalation, but India's growing diplomatic and economic power may limit external pressure.

          <p>Senate Democrats are resisting a crypto regulation bill, the GENIUS Act, over concerns about President Trump's and his family's crypto ventures. The bill, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, gained bipartisan support initially but is now facing opposition due to a deal involving a Trump family-linked crypto firm. Democrats are pushing for legislation to ban elected officials and their families from owning or participating in stablecoin ventures to prevent conflicts of interest. Senator Elizabeth Warren argues the bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption and protecting consumers, the financial system, and national security. The Trump family's crypto holdings have significantly increased, raising ethical questions about the president's involvement in the industry.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta is opposing the Menendez brothers' request to remove the Los Angeles District Attorney's office from their resentencing case, arguing that the defense has failed to provide sufficient evidence of bias. The brothers' attorneys claim the DA's office has a conflict of interest and violated Marsy's Law against their family. Bonta's office maintains that the assigned prosecutors can exercise discretionary functions impartially. The LA DA's office has also rejected the recusal push, calling it a "drastic and desperate step." The Menendez brothers are seeking resentencing, arguing they were unfairly convicted for murdering their parents due to excluded evidence of alleged sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Asia's largest economies approved a new rapid financing mechanism that will use regional currencies, including the Chinese yuan, signaling a potential shift away from the US dollar. The decision aims to shield East and Southeast Asian countries from financial volatility caused by President Trump's global tariff war. The move may lead to a deeper, longer-term shift towards a regional monetary mechanism that is less reliant on the dollar, potentially giving China a larger role in the region's financial system.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has formally revoked some layoff notices, restoring positions at the CDC and FDA. The move follows criticism over cuts to programs like the World Trade Center Health Program, which serves 9/11 first responders and survivors. While some FDA food safety labs also received notices of reinstatement, not all workers promised restoration have received official confirmation. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that the programs were consolidated into a new agency, the Administration for a Healthy America, but the initial layoffs sparked outcry from lawmakers.</p>

          <p>An op-ed in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration has abandoned its initial justification of combating anti-Semitism in its ongoing assault on elite universities. The author contends that the administration's actions are now revealed as an effort to punish liberal institutions for being liberal. The article points to a recent letter from Education Secretary Linda McMahon to Harvard as evidence, noting the absence of any mention of anti-Semitism and the focus on other grievances. The author suggests that the administration is using the issue of anti-Semitism as a pretext to undermine universities that it views as ideological opponents.</p>

          <p>Super Micro released disappointing guidance, citing economic uncertainty and tariff impacts. The company's earnings per share and revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations for the latest quarter, and its forecast for the current quarter is also below estimates. CEO Charles Liang attributed the weaker performance to customers delaying commitments and waiting for new AI platforms. The company is not providing fiscal 2026 guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty, which is stemming from the announcement in early April of sweeping new tariffs on imported goods.</p>

Carney, who campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, maintained a firm stance against the idea of Canada becoming part of the U.S. The meeting covered a range of topics, including trade, foreign affairs, and Trump's usual tangents, but the president largely avoided contentious issues related to his previous remarks.</p>

The meeting exemplified how Trump has transformed Oval Office encounters into unpredictable events, often forcing foreign leaders to navigate between placating or confronting the American president.
