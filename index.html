          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has asserted that the War Powers Act, a law from the Nixon era intended to limit presidential war-making authority, is unconstitutional, citing arguments from constitutional scholars. Johnson stated that President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear targets were within his Article II powers. The speaker added that a resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran is unlikely to pass the House. Johnson mentioned that Rep. Massie may not advance his resolution if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds, potentially rendering the issue moot, as Massie himself acknowledged that it "probably is."</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold 100,000 shares of Nvidia stock on Friday and Monday, totaling nearly $15 million at Tuesday's opening price, according to a filing with the SEC. This sale marks the first transaction in Huang's plan to sell up to 600,000 shares by the end of 2025, potentially worth $873 million. Despite this sale, Huang retains ownership of over 800 million Nvidia shares and remains ranked 12th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of approximately $126 billion. Nvidia's stock has seen substantial growth since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, driven by high demand for its GPUs in the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Many insurance underwriters are avoiding offering coverage to vessels linked to the U.S., Israel, or the U.K. in the Middle East due to the ongoing conflict in the region. Rates among insurers willing to provide coverage have risen significantly, ranging from 0.25% to 0.5% of ship value, particularly after recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The reduced notification period from 48 to 24 hours reflects the market's uncertainty and rapid changes.

          <p>According to a PwC consumer survey, back-to-school spending is expected to remain robust this year, with nearly three-quarters of shoppers planning to spend the same or more than in 2024. Despite economic uncertainties, families prioritize these purchases as necessities, such as specific books and required technology. Consumers are increasingly value-oriented, seeking discounts and reusing items from previous years to save money. Artificial intelligence is also playing a role, with one in five shoppers planning to use AI tools to find online deals, and Gen Z parents are more likely to shop exclusively in physical stores.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated his intention to proceed with planned welfare changes despite significant opposition from Labour MPs who are attempting to block cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits. The proposed changes aim to save Â£5 billion a year by 2030, but over 120 Labour MPs have signed an amendment opposing the bill, citing concerns about increased poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. Starmer argues that the current welfare system is unsustainable and traps people on benefits, requiring reform to ensure its future viability. The Conservatives have yet to confirm their voting intentions, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves is relying on the projected savings to meet the government's fiscal rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A columnist argues that President Trump's decision to attack Iran's nuclear facilities should not be viewed through the lens of the Iraq War, emphasizing that there are no plans for ground troops, occupation, or nation-building. The author supports the decision to bomb Iran, highlighting Iran's long history of committing acts of war against America and Israel through terrorist proxies. He points out that Israel's recent successes in weakening Hezbollah and eliminating much of Iran's air defense system have made the operation more feasible. While acknowledging that the situation could worsen, the columnist believes the scenario will not resemble the Iraq War.</p>

          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in the Hague shortly after announcing a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, though he noted violations of the agreement. He aims to secure a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense, a goal already agreed upon prior to his arrival. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump on his actions in Iran and the increased defense spending levels. The summit will address Russia's war on Ukraine, and it remains unclear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO.</p>

          <p>Cavin Yarbrough, one half of the R&B duo Yarbrough & Peoples, known for their hit "Don't Stop the Music," has died at age 72, according to his wife, Alisa Peoples. Yarbrough's musical journey began with childhood piano lessons, where he met Peoples, leading to a professional partnership and signing with Total Experience Records, with the support of Gap Band frontman Charlie Wilson. The duo achieved success throughout the 1980s with hits like "Don't Waste Your Time," "Heartbeats," "Guilty," and "I Wouldn't Lie." After leaving the label in 1987, Yarbrough and Peoples married, returned to Dallas, and became music directors at their church, continuing to inspire others through mentorship and community engagement.</p>
