          <p>Miami Hurricanes linebacker Adarius Hayes was injured in a two-car crash in Largo, Florida, that resulted in three fatalities, including two children. Hayes, who was driving a Dodge Durango, was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries after colliding with a Kia Soul. Police indicated that there were no signs of impairment and alcohol was not a factor in the crash. The investigation is ongoing to determine the cause, including whether speed was a contributing factor. Hayes, a highly-regarded recruit, played in 12 games last season, and the University of Miami has not yet commented on the incident.</p>

          <p>A BBC news team documenting the work of a Jewish activist protecting Palestinian shepherds in the Israeli-occupied West Bank had a tense encounter with Moshe Sharvit, a sanctioned Israeli settler. Sharvit, accused of using violence to displace Palestinian communities, confronted the BBC crew, accusing them of being dangerous to Israel. The article highlights the starkly different visions of Israel's future held by Sharvit, who believes the West Bank was given by God to the Jews, and Gil Alexander, the activist, who advocates for peaceful coexistence. Sharvit is the subject of a restraining order, and the article underscores the escalating violence by settlers against Palestinians since the Hamas attack and the challenges faced by those seeking peaceful solutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks in Turkey, diverging from the stance of European leaders who insist on a cease-fire first. Ukrainian President Zelensky initially responded cautiously, reiterating the need for a halt in fighting, but later indicated a willingness to personally attend negotiations in Turkey. European leaders had coordinated with Trump on potential sanctions against Russia if a cease-fire was not agreed upon. The Trump administration has sought to mediate the conflict, aligning with Russia on certain UN votes and maintaining diplomatic ties, while also leaving existing sanctions in place.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are both claiming victory after agreeing to a cease-fire mediated by the U.S., following a four-day military confrontation. President Trump praised both sides and offered to increase trade and work towards a resolution of the Kashmir dispute. While Pakistan acknowledged and praised the American role, India downplayed it, emphasizing direct negotiations with Pakistani officials. Supporters of Prime Minister Modi portrayed the truce as a result of India's military might, while Pakistani commentators highlighted their air force's operational superiority. Uncertainty remains regarding the durability of the cease-fire, despite a sense of relief among civilians in border towns.</p>

          <p>California faces a confluence of economic, political, social, and environmental challenges that threaten its long-standing resilience. The state is grappling with potential population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies, a budget shortfall in Los Angeles, and a growing homelessness crisis.

Despite these difficulties, some leaders remain optimistic about California's ability to overcome these hurdles, citing its history of rebounding from past crises.

The initiative has been criticized by aid groups, immigrant rights activists, and the South African government, who view it as politically motivated.

          <p>Rilo Kiley reunited for their third show in 17 years at the Just Like Heaven festival in Pasadena, performing an hour-long set that showcased the band's versatility and Jenny Lewis's storytelling skills. The band's performance highlighted their enduring appeal and influence on a new generation of musicians. The festival also featured other early-2000s indie rock veterans, including Vampire Weekend, who offered a medley of covers as a salute to indie. Lewis has said that part of what led her to reconvene Rilo Kiley was the huge success of a recent reunion tour by the Postal Service.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it would release Edan Alexander, the last living American citizen held captive in Gaza, before President Trump's upcoming visit to the region. The announcement did not specify when the release would occur or what Hamas would receive in exchange. Mr. Alexander, 21, was abducted during the October 7, 2023, attack. The U.S. official stated that the Trump administration hopes for Mr. Alexander to be released as soon as Monday. U.S. officials negotiated directly with Hamas leaders to secure Mr. Alexanderâ€™s release, breaking with the traditional American boycott of the group.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 aircraft from Qatar's royal family, sparking accusations of bribery and corruption. Qatar acknowledged discussions about a possible transfer of a plane for Trump's temporary use as Air Force One, but denied that it was a gift or that a final decision had been made. The transfer is expected to be announced during Trump's tour of the Middle East. Legal experts are questioning the ethics and legality of the gift, with some calling it bribery.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced "substantial progress" in U.S.-China trade talks after a weekend of meetings in Geneva, with additional details expected on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a "deal" had been reached addressing national security concerns, but it remains unclear whether tariffs will be reduced. China's Vice Premier He Lifeng described the talks as "candid, in-depth and constructive," with an agreement to establish a "consultation mechanism." The talks aim to ease tensions following Mr. Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports. Economists have warned that the trade dispute could slow global growth and fuel inflation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program raises concerns about the future of education for students with disabilities. The budget's emphasis on state flexibility could reduce federal oversight and undermine the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The author, Pepper Stetler, highlights the disparities in educational opportunities for students with disabilities across different states, using the example of Adaline, a student with Down syndrome in Oklahoma, who faced segregation and limited access to a diploma track. Stetler argues that without federal oversight, states may not adequately meet the needs of students with disabilities, potentially reversing progress made since the passage of IDEA.</p>
