          <h2>New Womb Lining Test Offers Hope for Women with Recurrent Miscarriage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 20:01:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have developed a test to identify women with abnormal womb linings, increasing their risk of miscarriage, potentially paving the way for new treatments. The study found that in some women with a history of miscarriage, the womb lining doesn't react correctly to support embryo implantation, leading to bleeding and early pregnancy loss. A new test measures signs of a healthy or defective reaction in the womb lining and is being piloted to help over 1,000 patients. Charlie Beattie, who had multiple miscarriages, participated in a trial, took sitagliptin, and successfully gave birth to a healthy baby after the test showed her womb was not hospitable.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland, challenging an order that blocks the immediate deportation of immigrants seeking a review of their detention. The administration argues that the order, signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III, violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president's authority to enforce immigration laws. The lawsuit escalates the conflict between the administration and the federal judiciary over immigration policies, with the Justice Department accusing judges of overreach. The administration has asked the Maryland judges to recuse themselves from the case and wants a judge from another state to hear it.</p>

          <p>Sabrina Carpenter released an alternative album cover for "Man’s Best Friend" after the original artwork sparked backlash for allegedly promoting sexist stereotypes. The initial cover featured Carpenter on all fours like a dog with a man pulling her hair, leading to accusations of setting women's rights back. The new black-and-white cover depicts Carpenter in an elegant gown leaning against a man in a suit, reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe. This isn't the first time Carpenter has faced criticism, as she previously received backlash for filming a music video in a Catholic church and for suggestive performances during her tour.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to limit the classified information shared with Congress regarding the recent U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. This decision follows a classified initial intelligence assessment indicating that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but set it back a few months. The administration plans to restrict information shared on CAPNET, the classified information sharing system used by both the House and Senate. The FBI is reportedly investigating the leak of the initial assessment, although the administration has not publicly alleged that CAPNET was the source.</p>

          <p>The CIA director stated that US strikes "severely damaged" Iran's nuclear facilities, setting them back years, contradicting a leaked Pentagon intelligence report that downplayed the impact of the raid. John Ratcliffe, the US spy agency's director, said key sites were destroyed, while President Trump maintained the raid had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities. Israel and Iran appeared to honor a fragile ceasefire negotiated by Trump after 12 days of war. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard supported Trump's assessment, stating that Iran would need years to rebuild the facilities. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi suggested Tehran may have moved highly enriched uranium elsewhere during the attack.</p>

          <p>California drivers are likely to see a jump in gas prices in July due to a state sales tax increase and stricter regulations on refineries to promote lower-carbon fuels. The combined increases could raise gas prices by nearly 70 cents per gallon, although experts are hesitant to provide an exact estimate. In addition to the tax increase, amendments to the state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard program are expected to add to the cost at the pump. The regulations aim to incentivize lower-carbon fuels and reduce fuel use by 2045, but the added cost of compliance will be passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth are pushing back against a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment that the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities caused limited damage. Trump claimed that news accounts of the report demeaned the B-2 pilots who carried out the bombing, stating that the pilots are "devastated" by the suggestion that the strikes were not a complete success. Hegseth argued that news reporters "don't care what the troops think" and downplayed the report's initial findings, while Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard asserted that "Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed". The president claimed he had received a call from Missouri, where the pilots are based, about the intelligence report and the news accounts about it, saying he had been told they were "devastated, because they were trying to minimize the attack."</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently on trial for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. Trump called Netanyahu a "warrior" and his corruption trial a "witch hunt," echoing language he has used in his own legal battles.

          <p>The creators of “South Park” have accused Skydance Media and its associates of meddling in Paramount Global’s business before the company's acquisition is complete. Park County, the business entity behind the show, alleges that Jeff Shell, a former NBCUniversal chief executive involved in Skydance's bidding team, interfered with negotiations for “South Park” streaming rights. The creators contend that Shell attempted to depress the show's value by contacting executives at Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery to lower their bids. Skydance denies the allegations, asserting its right to approve material contracts under the terms of the transaction agreement.</p>

          <p>After nearly two weeks in hiding during the war with Israel, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, will emerge to a significantly weakened nation and a diminished leadership. The war has left the country with extensive death and destruction, damaged military infrastructure, and murmurs of dissent at the top. Many Iranians will hold Khamenei responsible for setting Iran on a collision course with Israel and the US, leading to the country's ruin. While a regime change engineered by foreign powers may be resisted, Iranians fear further clampdowns and oppression by a wounded and humiliated regime.</p>
