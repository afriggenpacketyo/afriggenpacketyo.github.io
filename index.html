          <p>A 29-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly starting the fire that became the devastating Palisades Fire in Los Angeles, which killed a dozen people. Prosecutors claim Jonathan Rinderknecht maliciously ignited a smaller fire on New Year's Day that smoldered underground before high winds caused it to erupt into the massive blaze weeks later. The suspect, a former resident of the area, was identified using digital evidence, including his phone's geolocation data, and was apprehended in Florida.</p>

His arrest followed a brief standoff and was the result of a coordinated multi-agency operation. The escape, which occurred through a hole behind a toilet, was attributed by the sheriff to prison staffing shortages and significant design flaws in the facility, which was built in 2016.</p>

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting indicate a strong consensus among officials to lower interest rates, primarily due to concerns about a weakening labor market. The main point of discussion was not whether to cut, but by how much, with a narrow majority favoring two more quarter-point reductions by the end of 2025. The documents reflect a shift in the balance of risks, with most participants judging that downside risks to employment had increased more than upside risks to inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has publicly backed manager Ruben Amorim, stating the coach needs a three-year timeframe to prove his worth. Despite a poor start to the season and a 15th-place finish last year, Ratcliffe dismissed speculation that Amorim's job was at risk, criticizing knee-jerk reactions from the media. He emphasized that he controls major football decisions and that the club's leadership is focused on long-term, sustainable success built on profitability and stability.</p>

          <p>This article explains single-purpose reverse mortgages, a lesser-known financial tool for homeowners aged 62 and older. Unlike more common reverse mortgages, these loans are restricted to one specific, lender-approved expense, such as property taxes or essential home repairs. Typically offered by state or nonprofit agencies for lower-income seniors, they feature lower costs but have limited availability and strict usage rules. The loan balance becomes due only when the homeowner sells, moves out, or passes away.</p>
