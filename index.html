          <p>CBS News has ceased its over 60-year presence at the Pentagon, closing its workspace after declining to sign new press requirements. These mandates, which most major news organizations rejected, would require formal authorization to publish even unclassified information, raising First Amendment concerns. Longtime correspondents like David Martin emphasized the importance of in-person access for breaking stories and building trust with officials. The Pentagon defends the policy as an effort to curb leaks, but CBS News asserts it will continue reporting on military affairs despite losing physical access.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff issued an apology for his earlier comments supporting the potential deployment of federal troops to San Francisco, his company's base. His initial remarks, suggesting the National Guard could act as police, drew significant backlash from local officials and leaders, including California Governor Gavin Newsom. Prominent investor Ron Conway resigned from the Salesforce Foundation board, citing misaligned values. Benioff clarified that city and state leaders are primarily responsible for safety, emphasizing a need for partnership, after his comments were amplified by figures like Elon Musk and President Trump.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted its sixth known boat strike in the Caribbean Sea since last month, targeting a suspected drug-carrying semi-submersible. This marks the first incident with reported survivors, who were transported by Navy helicopter to a Navy ship. Previous strikes have resulted in at least 27 fatalities, with President Trump justifying these actions as part of a "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels. The administration's aggressive posture in the Caribbean, including the deployment of warships and B-52 bombers, aims to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the U.S. accuses of cartel ties.</p>

          <p>Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and a founding member of the iconic glam rock band Kiss, has died at the age of 74. His family and agent confirmed he passed away peacefully in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall. Known as "Space Ace," Frehley was instrumental in shaping Kiss's sound and theatrical image, contributing to classic albums like "Destroyer" and "Love Gun." His former bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, expressed devastation, acknowledging his irreplaceable role in the band's legacy. Frehley's influence extended to many 1980s hair metal bands, and he continued a successful solo career after leaving Kiss.</p>

          <p>Concerns over credit quality are unsettling bank investors after regional banks Zions and Western Alliance disclosed significant losses and alleged fraud related to loans made to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs). JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned of potential hidden risks, drawing comparisons to the 2023 banking crisis. The surge in NDFI lending, which reached $1.14 trillion, stems from post-2008 regulations that pushed riskier activities outside traditional banks, but banks remain a major funding source. Investors are now scrutinizing NDFI exposures, as these loans can lead to rapid, near-total wipeouts, despite regional banks benefiting from an improving interest rate environment.

A U.S. appeals court had previously upheld the block on deployment but allowed the Guard to remain under federal service.

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is pressing President Donald Trump to personally attend three crucial Indo-Pacific summits this fall. They warn that Trump's absence could grant China a strategic advantage, as Beijing actively expands its influence across the region. The lawmakers emphasized the Indo-Pacific's vital importance to America's security and prosperity, highlighting it as a central arena for strategic competition with China. Trump's recent diplomatic activities include brokering a ceasefire deal between Thailand and Cambodia, and he is expected to visit Malaysia.</p>

          <p>Seven well-preserved skeletons discovered in a water well in the ancient Roman city of Mursa, Croatia, have been identified as Roman soldiers from 1,700 years ago. Researchers determined the remains belonged to taller-than-average adult men, aged 18-50, who showed signs of early-life stress. Injuries on several skeletons, including blunt-force trauma and puncture wounds, suggest they died in battle or skirmishes, possibly related to a 260 C.E. conflict for the city. DNA analysis indicated the soldiers were not local, with origins spanning northern/Eastern Europe and the Byzantine Empire, providing insight into Roman military diversity and diet.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, federal student loan borrowers face delays in loan forgiveness approvals, though monthly payments remain due. While borrowers can still apply for new repayment plans and forgiveness programs, actual discharge decisions are on hold due to furloughed Education Department staff. This delay is significant as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 made student loan forgiveness federally tax-free only through the end of 2025. A lawsuit against the Trump administration regarding loan forgiveness delays is also paused during the shutdown, highlighting ongoing challenges for borrowers.</p>

When asked about Maduro easing tensions with the U.S., Trump stated Maduro "doesn't want to f*** around with the United States." The remark, made live on air, quickly ended the press conference and drew varied reactions, with some pro-Trump accounts commending his language while others criticized it as immature. This follows previous instances of Trump using strong language in public, reflecting a trend of more expletive-laden rhetoric in his recent campaigns.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive stance on Venezuela, including authorizing covert CIA operations and naval strikes against alleged drug boats, is drawing comparisons to past U.S. interventions in Latin America. Trump's focus on Venezuela stems from concerns over migration, drug cartels, and Maduro's regime, with a $50 million reward offered for Maduro's arrest. While some experts view this as a unique case driven by specific issues, others see it as a potential return to a checkered history of U.S. attempts at regime change in the region. The approach aims to quash cartels and secure a deal on Venezuelan migrants.</p>
