          <p>Four people face charges for a break-in at RAF Brize Norton in June, where they allegedly caused £7 million in damages to two military Voyager aircraft. The individuals, identified as Amy Gardiner-Gibson, Jony Cink, Daniel Jeronymides-Norie, and Lewie Chiaramello, were charged with conspiracy to enter a prohibited place and conspiracy to commit criminal damage. The charges stem from an incident on June 20 when the planes were sprayed with paint. They are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed in California accuses the Trump administration of a "systemic pattern" of unconstitutional immigration enforcement targeting individuals based on their skin color. The complaint, brought by groups including the ACLU, alleges that masked federal agents have been arresting people without probable cause and holding them in substandard, "dungeon-like" conditions. The Department of Homeland Security has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "disgusting and categorically FALSE." The lawsuit seeks to block these indiscriminate operations and highlights claims of inhumane detention facilities, which the administration disputes.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for. The incident, which occurred Tuesday evening, prompted mandatory evacuations and caused multiple grass fires spanning 80 acres. Two people were treated for injuries, but the status of the seven missing individuals, including an 18-year-old on his first day of work, remains unknown.

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant shift in the Latino electorate, with Donald Trump securing 48% of their vote in the 2024 presidential election, a major increase from 36% in 2020. Political experts suggest this is not an ideological shift to conservatism but rather a move towards populism driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic Party. Analysts like Mike Madrid and Paola Ramos point to the Democratic Party's perceived failure to address working-class economic mobility and its progressive stance on the border as key factors. The trend indicates that both parties have struggled to connect with the complex and evolving priorities of the Latino community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has invalidated a Trump administration order that sought to ban individuals from seeking asylum if they crossed the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss ruled that the president does not have the authority to create an alternative immigration system that bypasses laws enacted by Congress. The policy, issued on President Trump's first day in office, was challenged by immigrant rights groups like the ACLU, who argued it was an unprecedented "flat-out ban" on asylum that endangered vulnerable people. The judge's ruling affirms that the executive branch cannot unilaterally supplant existing federal immigration statutes.</p>

          <p>The Senate's version of a major legislative bill includes a 1% tax on international cash transfers, a measure aimed at generating revenue and discouraging illegal immigration. This remittance tax targets the common practice of immigrant workers sending money to their home countries. Proponents, like The Heritage Foundation's Lora Ries, argue that making it harder to send money home can disincentivize illegal immigration, though she believes the rate should be higher to be effective. However, critics warn it could backfire by destabilizing the economies of countries reliant on remittances, potentially spurring more migration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Southern Resident killer whale population in Washington's Puget Sound, now down to just 73 individuals, faces a severe threat from a decline in their primary food source, the Chinook salmon. Conservationists are concerned that a proposed Trump administration change to the Endangered Species Act could exacerbate the problem. The change would narrow the definition of "harm" to exclude habitat destruction, potentially opening up critical areas to industrial development like logging and mining. This could devastate salmon breeding grounds, further endangering the orcas and other species that rely on this delicate ecosystem.</p>

A jury found that David Walls-Kaufman, who had previously pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for his role in the riot, was liable for the assault.

          <p>A shooting at the Oglethorpe Mall in Savannah, Georgia, has left three people with non-life-threatening gunshot wounds. The victims include two young adults and one juvenile. According to Savannah Police Chief Lenny Gunther, the incident appears to have been a conflict between two groups of people who likely knew each other, rather than a random act of violence. The mall was evacuated following the shooting, and police have confirmed that there is no longer an active threat to the public. An investigation into the event is currently ongoing.</p>

          <p>A coalition of former federal health officials is sounding the alarm over proposed budget cuts that would slash the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's funding by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. They warn that such a drastic reduction would severely damage lifesaving programs for chronic disease, HIV, and injury prevention, ultimately costing American lives. Since state and local health departments rely heavily on federal dollars from the CDC, the cuts would also cripple public health infrastructure at the community level. The officials stressed that these cuts would leave the nation sicker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon now assesses that U.S. airstrikes last month on three of Iran's key nuclear facilities have delayed its nuclear program by approximately one to two years. This updated estimate is more significant than an initial Defense Intelligence Agency report which suggested a setback of only several months. The assessment is based on intelligence, including video from B-2 bombers, indicating the destruction of centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. The news comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the IAEA, the UN's nuclear watchdog, making future verification of its nuclear activities more difficult.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is conducting a comprehensive review of weapons shipments to all allies, not just Ukraine, due to growing concerns about depleting U.S. munition stockpiles. This confirmation follows a White House announcement that some weapons deliveries to Ukraine were being halted to prioritize American interests. The review was reportedly prompted by the high expenditure of munitions, including anti-air missiles used to defend Israel and Qatar from Iranian attacks. While the Pentagon assures its military readiness remains intact, Ukraine has warned that any delay in aid will only embolden Russia.</p>
