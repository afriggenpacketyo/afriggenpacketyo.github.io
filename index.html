          <p>Hawaii has been placed under a state of emergency by acting governor Sylvia Luke ahead of Hurricane Kiko's expected arrival. The hurricane, currently a major storm over 1,000 miles away, is forecast to weaken to a tropical storm but could still bring strong winds, heavy rain, and high surf to the islands early next week. The emergency proclamation activates the Hawaii National Guard and the Major Disaster Fund to mobilize resources, clear potential debris, and ensure a rapid response to any damage. Residents and visitors are urged to monitor official updates and maintain emergency supplies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a stern warning that Venezuelan military aircraft will be shot down if they pose a threat to U.S. naval vessels in the Caribbean. This statement follows reports of Venezuelan jets flying near a U.S. ship for the second time in two days, escalating tensions after a U.S. strike on an alleged drug boat killed 11 people. The Trump administration has intensified its anti-drug trafficking operations in the region, deploying additional naval assets and F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has denied U.S. allegations and called for dialogue to avoid military conflict.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has pledged "all-out efforts" to assist hundreds of its citizens arrested during a major U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Hyundai and LG electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia. The raid, the largest single-site operation in Department of Homeland Security history, detained approximately 475 workers, disrupting a significant industrial project. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has ordered a task force to address the situation, which could strain diplomatic and trade relations between the two allies. The companies involved have paused construction and are cooperating with the investigation into unlawful employment practices.</p>

          <p>Offensive graffiti targeting former Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has been removed from a wall outside her flat in Hove, with a local resident paying for the cleanup. The vandalism appeared after Rayner resigned from her government and Labour Party leadership roles following an official investigation into her admission of underpaying stamp duty on the property. A spokesperson for Rayner condemned the act as "unjustifiable harassment and intimidation," stating it was a matter for the police. Sussex Police are treating the incident as criminal damage and are conducting inquiries to gather information.</p>

          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, the New York National Guard's predominantly Black 369th Infantry Regiment, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their distinguished service in World War I. Decades after their bravery was largely ignored due to racial discrimination, the honor was celebrated in a ceremony where lawmakers acknowledged the soldiers fought for freedoms they were denied at home. The medal will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. The recognition comes amid a broader debate initiated by the Trump administration about how American history is remembered and presented in cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the alleged cover-up surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's network of abuse represents a profound crime against democracy by silencing victims and protecting powerful individuals. The author contends that high-ranking officials, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Attorney General Pam Bondi, are actively working to suppress documents that may implicate Donald Trump, constituting a massive obstruction of justice. The piece connects this specific case to a broader right-wing agenda aimed at rolling back rights for women and minorities. It concludes that the administration's actions are part of a larger assault on the principles of equality and justice under the law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent social media rumors and trending searches questioning President Trump's health highlight the current political climate of misinformation and intense public scrutiny. The speculation arose after the president had no public events for several days over the Labor Day weekend, fueling conspiracy theories despite White House assurances and his own social media posts. The article suggests this frenzy reveals an online culture where the president's constant media presence is expected, and any absence creates a vacuum filled by conjecture. The incident also drew comparisons to the different ways the health and age of Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, are covered by the media.</p>

          <p>During North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's first visit to China in over six years, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided a strong display of solidarity, signaling a shift in Beijing's approach. Notably, official statements from the high-stakes summit omitted any mention of the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," a previous staple of their diplomatic language. Analysts suggest that this calculated treatment, which included an exclusive banquet and a multilateral debut for Kim, strengthens Pyongyang's alignment with Beijing and Moscow. The reinforced ties and pledges of Chinese economic support are seen as boosting Kim's leverage in regional politics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying advanced military assets, including F-35 fighter jets, to the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking, marking a significant escalation in its use of force. This strategy was highlighted by a recent "kinetic strike" on a vessel in the Caribbean that killed 11 alleged members of a Venezuelan gang, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist group. The move follows the domestic deployment of federal forces to U.S. cities and reflects a policy of using military power for law enforcement purposes. Critics and experts question the effectiveness of this militarized approach, warning it could destabilize the region and has previously failed to curb the drug trade.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is causing a measurable shift in consumer grocery spending, creating a new challenge for the snack food industry. Recent research indicates that users of these drugs reduce overall grocery spending and are trading ultra-processed foods for healthier options, impacting sales of traditional tailgating fare like chips and hot dogs. Retailers are adapting by reformulating ready-made meals with higher protein and more vegetables to cater to this changing demand. While the high cost of these drugs currently limits a large-scale market shift, the trend suggests a future of more moderate indulgence and health-conscious consumption.</p>

This article details instances where eligible seniors were denied vaccination for not having a prescription, while others faced invasive questioning about their medical history.

However, Netanyahu and other cabinet members allegedly dismissed the idea as a sign of "defeat" for Israel, and the plan was shelved before ever reaching the negotiating team.

His comments came after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced the policy change, with Ladapo comparing vaccine requirements to slavery.

This practice persists despite laws against excessive honking, which are difficult to enforce.

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. At 19, he is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne and is widely expected to become emperor one day. The event has reignited scrutiny of Japan's male-only succession laws, as there are currently no other young male heirs to continue the imperial line after him. This shortage reflects Japan's broader demographic challenges of an aging and shrinking population, leading to ongoing debates about whether women, like the emperor's daughter Princess Aiko, should be allowed to reign.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, amid political controversy. Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has denounced the centennial, demanding a critical reassessment of the movement and echoing the Nazi-era rhetoric that labeled its work "degenerate art." Despite these attacks, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with a year of exhibitions and events focusing on the evolution of modern materials. The foundation's director expressed concern about the AfD's culture war but noted the campaign has also brought a wave of public support for the historic institution.</p>

          <p>This personal essay explores the deep connection between the city of Buffalo, New York, and its NFL team, the Bills, arguing that supporting the team is synonymous with understanding the city's identity. The author describes how becoming a fan revealed a community bonded by resilience in the face of economic hardship and sporting heartbreak, such as the team's four consecutive Super Bowl losses in the 1990s. The team's underdog spirit is presented as a metaphor for the city's own quiet revival. The article suggests that this shared experience of striving and near-misses fosters an unusually strong and positive sense of belonging among its supporters.</p>

          <h2>China's Campaign Against 'Involution' May Lack Impact of Previous Reforms, Analysis Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 04:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research from Oxford Economics, China's recent push against "involution"—a term for intense, low-quality price competition—is unlikely to match the scale of its 2015 supply-side reforms. While investors have grown hopeful following a key government meeting criticizing destructive price wars, the analysis suggests that expectations for a major campaign to cut industrial capacity are misplaced. The report argues that the current economic environment makes it much more difficult for Beijing to deliver the necessary combination of production cuts and significant consumer demand stimulus. This indicates that resolving China's supply-demand imbalances will be a more challenging and less direct process than in the past. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package would grant him up to 12% of Tesla's stock over a decade, contingent on the company achieving extremely aggressive growth targets, including reaching a market capitalization of at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. The move is seen by analysts as an effort to retain Musk and incentivize his focus on transforming Tesla into an AI and robotics leader, as the filing states he has previously threatened to leave. The proposal will require shareholder approval in November.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is projected to be around 2.7%, partly due to the inflationary effects of President Trump's tariff policies. Independent analysts forecast that the sweeping global tariffs have modestly pushed up consumer prices, which will likely result in a higher annual benefit increase for nearly 70 million beneficiaries. However, the article notes that this "Trump bump" may offer little real relief. The purchasing power of Social Security benefits has already declined significantly over the past two decades, and a projected 11.5% increase in Medicare Part B premiums is expected to consume most of the 2026 COLA for retirees.

          <p>Scotland secured a valuable point with a draw against Denmark in Copenhagen, marking a solid and understated start to their World Cup qualification campaign. The performance, built on hard work and defensive grit, has put one of their main group rivals on the back foot early in the short, six-game tournament. This result contrasts with Scotland's historically poor starts in World Cup qualifying, where early losses have often derailed their aspirations. Manager Steve Clarke's team, featuring standout performances from players like Grant Hanley and a returning Aaron Hickey, has given fans reason for cautious optimism as they head into their next matches.</p>

          <p>This article commemorates the 30th anniversary of one of football's most audacious moments: Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita's 'scorpion kick' save at Wembley Stadium in 1995. The move, where he cleared the ball by diving forward and kicking it with his heels over his back, cemented his legacy as a flamboyant and revolutionary player. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the 'sweeper-keeper' role, famous for dribbling far outside his penalty area and taking free kicks. His career was also marked by controversy, including a costly mistake at the 1990 World Cup and a prison sentence for his involvement in a cartel kidnapping.</p>

The judge ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's actions were "arbitrary and capricious" and exceeded her authority, as ending the protections would send people back to dangerously unstable conditions.
