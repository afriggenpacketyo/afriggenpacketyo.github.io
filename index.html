          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a personal meeting in Turkey to discuss a ceasefire, following a weekend of shifting proposals from both sides. Zelenskyy expressed hope for a ceasefire starting Monday and stated he would await Putin in Turkey on Thursday, while also acknowledging that it was a positive sign that Russia had begun to consider ending the war. This comes after President Trump urged Ukraine to accept Putin's peace talks proposal immediately to explore a potential deal, while European allies insisted on a 30-day truce as a prerequisite for negotiations. Meanwhile, Russia resumed drone attacks in Ukraine, accusing Ukraine of violating Moscow's self-declared ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Despite being detained in The Hague awaiting trial for crimes against humanity, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is a candidate in the country's midterm elections, running for mayor of his stronghold Davao city. The elections will determine if he and his family continue to hold political power, with his daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, facing an impeachment trial in the Senate. Other family members are also running for various positions, highlighting the Duterte family's continued influence in Philippine politics. Sara Duterte is considered a strong contender for the 2028 presidential race, but the midterm elections are crucial as they will set the pace for the future political landscape and determine which family or faction will dominate the elections in 2028.</p>

          <p>Bridgend council in Wales faced criticism for a PowerPoint presentation intended for schools that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex, including a slide stating, "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first." The council claims it was a draft version, never shown to children, and was dropped after feedback from professionals, however experts and politicians are questioning why such content was deemed appropriate in any form. The council said the slide was meant to stimulate debate before advising participants that non-fatal strangulation is illegal, but sources claim the presentation was offered to schools, raising concerns about the content being taught to children during sexual education lessons. The incident has sparked a debate about the appropriateness and accuracy of sex education materials in schools.</p>

          <p>Adrian Ramsay, the co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has launched a fresh leadership bid with fellow Green MP Ellie Chowns, hoping to be elected as co-leaders. This comes after Carla Denyer announced she would not be standing for re-election later this year, and they will be joining the party's deputy leader, Zack Polanski, in the leadership contest. Ramsay and Denyer were initially elected for a three-year term, but members voted not to choose new leaders in 2024 because of the general election. Chowns stated that she and Ramsay were "ready to lead our party into its most ambitious chapter yet", while Ramsay emphasized the need to build on their leadership and potentially hold the balance of power.</p>

          <p>In Serbia, a student-led movement is challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The movement, sparked by a tragedy in Novi Sad, has grown into the largest and most extensive protest in years, uniting diverse groups in Serbian society. Despite government attempts to quell the protests through resignations and financial incentives, demonstrators continue to demand accountability and change. The government's response has included attacks on educators and the academic community, mirroring tactics used by other would-be autocrats.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The decision is also intended to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. A senior Hamas official stated that the group is holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar, while the Israeli PM's office said it had only committed to a "safe corridor" for Alexander's release. This announcement comes amid growing frustration in the Trump administration with Netanyahu's position and pressure at home for the prime minister to end the war.</p>

The allegations, which span over a decade, involve both the SAS and the SBS, with claims that the killing of detainees became routine and that some troops displayed psychopathic traits. The Ministry of Defence stated its commitment to supporting the ongoing public inquiry into the alleged war crimes and urged veterans with relevant information to come forward.</p>

The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea. The South Korean authorities had arrested the thieves and confiscated the statue, but Buseoksa Temple filed a lawsuit claiming it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. In 2023, South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, leading to the statue's return.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have revealed significant cuts to Medicaid as part of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," aiming to save $880 billion to offset tax breaks. The legislation introduces new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which Democrats argue will cause millions to lose coverage, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating 8.6 million fewer people with healthcare over the decade. Republicans insist the changes target waste and abuse, while Democrats decry the cuts as a veiled attempt to repeal Obamacare. The bill also includes rollbacks of Biden-era green energy programs and faces uncertain political prospects, with some House Republicans opposing cuts to healthcare safety net programs.</p>

While analysts from both countries acknowledge the US mediation provided a necessary off-ramp, they emphasize the deep-seated distrust and complex dynamics that persist. Saudi Arabia and Iran also played key mediating roles due to their strong ties with both nations.

This move is seen as a response to challenges from Reform UK and aims to regain control of the narrative on immigration. The new rules also prioritize residency rights for migrants who pay taxes, work in the public sector, or volunteer, while ending automatic settlement and citizenship after five years. The proposals have faced criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with Conservatives calling them "laughable" and questioning their effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, causing widespread delays and cancellations. The latest outage involved a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, prompting a 45-minute ground stop. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to temporarily cut flights to address the airport's problems, including air traffic control staffing shortages. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer emphasized the need for the FAA to prioritize fixing the situation at Newark Liberty to prevent similar issues from arising elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The Philippines is holding midterm elections that have turned into a proxy battle between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte. The elections will decide over 18,000 jobs, including key Senate seats crucial for Duterte's impeachment trial. Once allies, Marcos and Duterte are now feuding, with Duterte's father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, arrested and facing charges at the International Criminal Court. Security has been tightened amid a history of election-related violence, with the national police and military deployed to protect polling stations and election officials.</p>

          <p>Immigration into the UK has seen a consistent upward trend over the past 30 years, becoming a significant social and political issue. Net migration has been positive since the mid-1990s, despite efforts to reduce it. Brexit aimed to provide the government with greater control over immigration, but net migration figures have remained high. Labour now aims to reverse this trend, seeking to buck the 25-year pattern of rising legal migration and address public concerns about immigration levels.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" targeting federal payments for abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans. The provision, aimed at making large groups who provide abortion services ineligible for federal Medicaid dollars, has raised concerns about its definition and potential impact. Some Republicans argue that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services, and warn that pushing the issue could jeopardize support for the bill. The bill's fate hinges on navigating this internal division within the House GOP.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has defended the prospect of being gifted an Air Force One replacement by the Qatari royal family, describing it as a "very transparent deal." The potential gift, a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, has drawn criticism, with some describing it as bribery and foreign influence. Trump has dismissed these concerns, stating that the Defense Department is receiving a "free of charge gift" to replace an aging Air Force One. Democrats have called for congressional consent to accept the gift, raising constitutional questions about accepting presents from foreign states.</p>

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad asserts that President Trump's unilateral tariffs will harm Americans more than the targeted countries, leading to an increase in the U.S. cost of living. He believes that American products cannot compete with cheaper products from the rest of the world, causing the American economy to suffer. Mahathir suggests that ASEAN can withstand the impact of the tariff hikes through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States. He also advocates for peace and dialogue rather than retaliation as a response to the U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, based in San Fernando, California, has voluntarily recalled several premade food products due to a listeria outbreak identified last year. The recall includes sandwiches and protein snacks sold in vending machines and other settings in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington, with "Use by" dates from April 22 through May 19. The recall was prompted by the discovery of a strain of listeria monocytogenes on a piece of equipment at a Fresh & Ready facility, which matched the strain causing illnesses in the 2024 outbreak. No illnesses have been linked to the recalled food, and the company is taking precautionary measures to ensure consumer safety.</p>
