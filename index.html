          <p>Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv for a rally ahead of an expected hostage release by Hamas, as part of a new ceasefire deal. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the crowd, praising Donald Trump for his role in brokering the agreement, though some attendees expressed anger toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The deal stipulates Hamas must release all 48 remaining hostages, with 20 believed to be alive, by Monday, while in Gaza, displaced Palestinians have begun returning to northern regions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has laid off more than 100 employees at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency (SAMHSA) as part of a government-wide reduction in force amid the ongoing shutdown. SAMHSA is a critical agency responsible for the 988 suicide prevention hotline and distributing billions in grants for mental health and addiction services. The layoffs, which sources say came without clear rationale, have caused shock and confusion within the agency, which has previously been targeted for budget cuts by the administration.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool star Steven Gerrard has turned down an offer to return for a second managerial stint at Scottish Premiership club Rangers, following the dismissal of Russell Martin. While discussions between Gerrard and the club reportedly went well, he withdrew from consideration, with the timing of the move cited as the primary reason. Gerrard, who led Rangers to a league title in 2021, had recently expressed a desire to return to management, but the club must now continue its search for a new head coach.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service is forecasting a significant and unusually early storm to bring widespread rain to Southern California early next week, with the heaviest rainfall expected on Tuesday. The system is predicted to drop between 0.5 and 1.5 inches of rain across Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with higher amounts in the mountains, providing beneficial moisture to the region. While the storm is not expected to cause major flooding, meteorologists caution that it will not be enough to end the ongoing wildfire season.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London in April 2024, has been retired to a country sanctuary. The horse suffered a broken bone and significant bleeding after being spooked by construction noise during a morning exercise. Due to the extent of his injuries, veterinary staff determined it was in the horse's best interest not to return to ceremonial duties.
