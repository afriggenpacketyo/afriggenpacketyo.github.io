          <p>A federal trial has concluded over the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, with the judge questioning the limits of presidential power. The lawsuit, filed by California's governor, challenges the deployment under the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement. Justice Department lawyers argued the deployment was for protecting federal property, while the state called it an "unlawful military crusade." The judge expressed concern about the potential for a "national police force" without clear limitations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 09:25:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, rose by 0.9% in July, significantly higher than the 0.2% gain experts had anticipated. This sharp increase, the largest since June 2022, suggests that inflationary pressures may still be a threat to the U.S. economy. A 1.1% jump in services prices was a primary driver of the increase, leading to concerns that businesses might soon pass these higher costs on to consumers. The data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has granted chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD licenses to export certain products to China in exchange for a 15% fee on those revenues. This move circumvents previous national security bans and raises constitutional questions, as the U.S. Constitution prohibits taxes on exports. Critics, including former officials, have likened the arrangement to "bribery or blackmail," warning it could set a dangerous precedent and undermine national security. The deal's legality is still being reviewed, but it highlights a transactional approach to foreign and trade policy.</p>

          <h2>National Park Service Urges Visitors to Stop Feeding Bears Amid Rise in Incidents</h2>

          <p>The National Park Service has issued a strong warning for visitors to refrain from feeding black bears, highlighting the practice as both illegal and dangerous. Officials at Great Smoky Mountains National Park reported a recent increase in intentional feeding incidents, which can lead to bears becoming conditioned to human food. This behavior makes them more aggressive and less fearful of people, often resulting in the animal's death for safety reasons. Violators face fines up to $5,000 and potential jail time.</p>

However, a subsequent report showing unexpectedly high wholesale inflation caused both digital assets and stock futures to fall.

It notes that while national average CD yields are modest, online banks often provide significantly higher rates due to lower overhead costs. Currently, short-term CDs, such as those with 6-month or 1-year terms, are offering the most competitive interest rates. The piece suggests strategies like laddering CDs to take advantage of the current inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite official assurances of preparedness, internal data reportedly shows over a quarter of firefighting roles were unfilled in mid-July, with some regions facing vacancy rates near 40%. The cuts, part of a broader policy to shrink the federal government, have also impacted support staff, leading to logistical issues for crews on the front lines.

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to ask Congress for "long-term" federal control over Washington D.C.'s metropolitan police department. He invoked a clause allowing a 30-day federal takeover, which he argues is necessary to combat what he calls an "out of control" crime problem in the city. The president also signaled he may try to extend the takeover without congressional approval by citing a national emergency. D.C. leaders have disputed the administration's characterization of crime levels in the capital, which data shows are at a 30-year low.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's D.C. Crime Crackdown Highlights a Gap Between Public Perception and Data</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's move to federalize the D.C. police force is based on a depiction of the city as overrun by crime, a claim that contradicts federal data showing a significant drop in violent crime. While D.C. experienced a crime spike in 2023, the trend has reversed, yet public perception of rising crime persists, both locally and nationally. Analysts suggest this gap is influenced by partisan divides and how personal experiences with crime shape feelings of safety, regardless of overall statistics. The situation illustrates how political rhetoric can leverage public perception, even when it is at odds with factual data.</p>

          <p>The Annals of Internal Medicine has refused a demand from U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to retract a major Danish study on vaccine safety. The study, which analyzed data from over 1.2 million children, found no link between aluminum ingredients in vaccines and an increased risk of various disorders. Kennedy, a long-time vaccine critic, called the research a "deceitful propaganda stunt," but the journal's editor-in-chief stated there is "no reason for retraction" and no evidence of scientific misconduct. The study's lead author also defended the research against Kennedy's criticisms.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has announced approval for the construction of a controversial settlement in the E1 area of the occupied West Bank. He declared that this move "finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state," as it would effectively divide the West Bank and prevent a contiguous Palestinian territory. The plan, which includes 3,500 new housing units, has been condemned by rights groups as "deadly" for a two-state solution. The announcement comes as several U.S. allies are planning to formally recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "America's AI Action Plan" aims to expand U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence, but experts warn that proposed budget cuts to federal science research could sabotage this goal. Researchers argue that the entire AI ecosystem, from self-driving cars to AI safety, was built upon federally funded research across multiple disciplines like neuroscience and computer science. They express concern that cutting this funding will damage the "talent pipeline" that trains scientists who then work for leading tech companies. The plan's directive to remove DEI and climate change considerations from AI guidelines also raises concerns about perpetuating bias.</p>

          <p>Survivors of clergy abuse in the New Orleans Catholic archdiocese have started a two-month voting period on a proposed bankruptcy settlement plan. The plan, which could pay out between $180 million and $235 million, requires approval from two-thirds of voting claimants to pass. A committee of survivors has endorsed the deal, arguing it provides prompt compensation and ensures public access to church documents, but a significant bloc of other survivors opposes it, calling it inadequate. The outcome will determine whether the archdiocese can exit its five-year bankruptcy or if claims will proceed individually in state courts.</p>
