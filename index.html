          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of signing Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi for £51 million. The paperwork for the transfer has been finalized, and all parties are awaiting the completion of Zubimendi's medical examination before making an official announcement. Arsenal has been pursuing Zubimendi for several months and is also looking to strengthen their attack by signing a new center-forward, with Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres among the potential targets. The club is also in discussions to extend the contracts of key players such as Bukayo Saka and William Saliba, along with other squad members and promising young talents. </p>

          <p>The government is reviewing environmental regulations for small housebuilders in England, potentially easing Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements for developments of up to nine homes. These rules currently mandate developers to compensate for any loss of wildlife habitats. The proposed changes aim to reduce costs for smaller firms and simplify the planning system, potentially allowing trained officers, instead of councillors, to approve minor projects. Ministers hope this will help achieve the government's goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2030, while conservation groups worry about the potential impact on nature conservation efforts. </p>

The IDF claims its troops fired warning shots into the air and did not target people.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against President Donald Trump's executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming the order unconstitutional. Judge Richard Leon issued a scathing opinion, emphasizing the importance of an independent judiciary and legal profession. The executive order criticized WilmerHale for hiring Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into potential coordination between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. The judge's decision highlights concerns about the use of presidential power to target law firms that have worked against the president's interests. </p>

          <p>Amid potential mass deportations and uncertain H-2A policies, US agriculture faces a labor crisis. Farmers rely heavily on both undocumented and guest workers, but changes in federal immigration policies are creating uncertainty for both farmers and workers. While some advocate for replacing guest workers with local labor and automation, farmers argue that citizens are unwilling to do the work and that automation is too expensive. The debate highlights the dependence of the US food system on immigrant labor and the potential consequences of stricter immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>The United States has experienced a significant decline in its shipbuilding industry, leaving it heavily reliant on foreign-built ships for both commercial and military purposes. This lack of maritime capacity poses national security risks, including shortages of support ships and civilian sailors needed for Navy support vessels. The decline can be attributed to the abandonment of a regulated competition system and the rise of unregulated cartels. Restoring a robust version of that system, combined with public investment, could revitalize the industry and ensure it operates in the public interest. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The socialist left often attributes the rise of right-wing populism to the betrayal of the working class by center-left parties, arguing that these parties' embrace of free trade and neoliberal policies led to economic hardship. However, this materialist explanation overlooks the independent causal force of ideas, values, and identities. A more accurate understanding of the far right focuses on its appeal to those unsettled by the global decline of traditional hierarchies and the rise of egalitarian values. By prioritizing a materialist theory of politics, the left often fails to grasp the ideological motivations driving support for the far right. </p>
