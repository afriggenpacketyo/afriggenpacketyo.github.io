          <p>Amid trade tensions with the US, the UK and India are deepening their partnership through a new Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The deal, which slashes tariffs on goods like textiles, cars, and whiskey, is expected to significantly boost bilateral trade and provide India with alternative markets. This strategic move aims to mitigate the economic impact of US tariffs, strengthen supply chains, and reinforce India's position as a global manufacturing hub, potentially serving as a model for a future EU-India trade pact.</p>

          <p>Costco has quietly grown its apparel business into a nearly $10 billion annual enterprise, surpassing sales of established retailers like Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. The company's success stems from offering popular brands alongside its private Kirkland Signature label and employing an "opportunistic" buying strategy that creates a "treasure hunt" shopping experience. This growth has not gone unnoticed, as evidenced by a recent lawsuit from Lululemon, signaling that major apparel brands now view the wholesale giant as a serious competitor in the fashion market.</p>

          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the most significant error young investors make is prioritizing downside protection over potential upside growth. He advises that due to their long time horizon, young people should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding cash or bonds, which can lose value to inflation. For beginners, Brown recommends using low-cost, broad-market index funds or ETFs to build a diversified portfolio, emphasizing that compounding over decades is a powerful tool for wealth creation.

          <p>New U.S. port fees targeting Chinese-built and operated ships, set to begin next week, are causing widespread confusion and concern within the ocean freight industry. Carriers are scrambling to understand how the rules will apply, particularly regarding vessels financed by Chinese leasing firms, which now represent a significant portion of the global ship finance market. The lack of clarity from the U.S. Trade Representative has prompted some shipowners to seek refinancing to avoid potential multi-million dollar fees, highlighting the significant financial risks and operational disruptions stemming from the new trade policy.</p>

          <p>During the Toronto Blue Jays' division series victory over the New York Yankees, a fan was reportedly captured on video throwing a can at the family of Blue Jays star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. The incident occurred as the Yankees were facing elimination, with the group, including individuals wearing Guerrero's jersey, seen reacting to someone in the rows behind them just before the object was thrown. The event highlights tensions between the player and the Yankees fan base; Guerrero has previously stated he would never play for the New York team for personal family reasons.</p>

Historical examples, such as the end of the Bracero program and mass deportations during the Great Depression, show that removing immigrant labor did not improve wages or employment for native-born workers and often had a negative impact. Conversely, studies indicate that immigration has historically spurred industrial growth and pushed native workers into higher-skilled, better-paying jobs. The author contends that restricting immigration will harm key industries and hinder overall American prosperity.</p>

          <p>As a new ceasefire takes effect, focus turns to the 48 Israeli and foreign hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, with only 20 of them presumed to be alive. The majority were abducted during the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, which initiated the two-year conflict. This article provides details on the identities and known conditions of many of the remaining hostages, including both civilians and soldiers. It compiles information from family members, previously released hostages, and videos released by Hamas, painting a grim picture of their captivity and the uncertainty surrounding their fate.</p>

          <p>Postal workers across Canada have initiated strike action, disrupting mail and parcel delivery for millions of residents. The strike is a protest against government-authorized reforms at Canada Post that include ending door-to-door delivery for many homes and closing some post offices. The union argues these changes will lead to major job losses and undermine the public postal service. This action comes as Canada Post faces significant financial losses due to declining letter mail volume and as negotiations over pay and benefits with the union remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that certain right-of-center commentators are deliberately using antisemitic conspiracy theories to create a rift within the MAGA coalition. The author argues that by targeting American Jews and the U.S.-Israel relationship, figures like Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson aim to alienate the movement's core base of evangelical Christians, who are overwhelmingly pro-Israel. This strategy is described as an attempt to supplant the existing MAGA movement with a new, "neo-pagan" and conspiratorial one. The author warns that such bigotry is not only a debasement of Jews but a threat to the political movement itself.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the memorable and bizarre period when Dutch football legend Edgar Davids served as player-manager for Barnet FC from 2012. Despite his storied career, Davids joined the struggling lower-league club, bringing a top-tier mentality that both inspired and clashed with the squad. His tenure was marked by on-field brilliance, a near-miraculous (but ultimately failed) fight against relegation, and eccentric behavior, including wearing the number 1 shirt and occasionally skipping away games. Though his time ended abruptly, Davids remains a fondly remembered figure who brought an unprecedented level of attention and intensity to the club.</p>

A 7-year-old child was killed in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as a "cynical and calculated" effort to cripple the country ahead of winter and issued a sharp rebuke to the international community.

          <p>American soybean farmers are in a precarious position as the ongoing trade war has led to a complete halt in purchases from China, their largest export market. With grain bins full from the recent harvest and prices uncertain, many family farms are facing a financial crisis, compounded by rising costs for fertilizer and seed. While the Trump administration has indicated a relief plan is forthcoming, its delay due to the government shutdown has left farmers in limbo. This situation highlights the significant vulnerability of the U.S. agricultural sector to geopolitical trade disputes.</p>

According to a new study, these investors tend to spend more of their wealth gains compared to those with stock or real estate assets, contributing an estimated $145 billion in additional U.S. consumption in 2024. While spending is often on everyday items like dining and entertainment rather than luxury goods, real estate is also a popular purchase, with crypto wealth gains showing a significant correlation with rising home prices.

China's Ministry of Transport stated the U.S. policy "seriously violates" international trade principles and damages maritime commerce between the two nations.

U.S. regulators argue that access to Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers an unfair competitive advantage with shorter, more fuel-efficient routes, as U.S. airlines are barred from the same airspace. Beijing contends that such a ban would harm people-to-people exchanges and urged Washington to consider the negative effects of its own policies on American companies.

Prosecutors had argued she beat him to death, but no murder weapon was ever found. A key detail in the case was that police were unable to search the couple's upstairs bedroom on the night of the incident because their protective pit bull, Willow, was inside and acting aggressively. The lead detective, now police chief, still speculates that the weapon could have been hidden in that room, though a juror stated the prosecution's case had too many holes.</p>
