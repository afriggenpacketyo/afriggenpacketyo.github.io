          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rebuffed President Trump's overtures to make Canada the 51st state during an Oval Office meeting, declaring that his country is "not for sale, ever." Trump, known for his real estate background, romanticized the idea of merging the two nations, but Carney emphasized the importance of their partnership while firmly rejecting any notion of Canada relinquishing its sovereignty. Despite Carney's clear stance, Trump remained persistent, stating, "Never say never," highlighting the ongoing tensions and differing perspectives on the U.S.-Canada relationship under his administration. The meeting underscored Carney's commitment to defending Canada's interests and maintaining its distinct identity. </p>

The announcement revealed jersey numbers for the Browns' rookie class and free agent acquisitions, though these are subject to change before the season begins. Sanders, one of five quarterbacks on the roster, joins a team with an uncertain quarterback situation due to Deshaun Watson's injury and the acquisition of Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco.

          <p>Israeli fighter jets bombed the main international airport in Yemen's capital, Sana, responding to a missile attack by the Houthi militia that struck near Israel's main airport. The strikes killed at least three people and injured over 30, according to Houthi-led government officials, and targeted runways, aircraft, and infrastructure, effectively disabling the airport. This action escalates the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed Houthis, who claim their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The strikes have disrupted vital connections for Yemenis, who rely on the airport for medical treatment and access to the outside world, worsening the country's humanitarian crisis. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit surged to a record $140.5 billion in March, driven by a spike in imports as businesses and consumers anticipated President Trump's new tariffs. Pharmaceutical products, particularly from Ireland, saw a significant increase, indicating concerns about future levies impacting the sector. Economists warn that these tariffs will likely increase operating costs for businesses and raise prices for consumers, despite the White House's claims that they will reduce trade deficits and boost American manufacturing. This surge in imports contributed to a decline in economic growth during the first quarter, but is expected to reverse in the second quarter, providing some relief to GDP. </p>

          <p>A U.S. intelligence memo has been declassified, revealing that the intelligence community does not believe Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro controls the Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang, contradicting claims made by President Trump. The memo states that while some members of the Maduro regime may tolerate or work with TDA, there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation or that Maduro is directing the gang's movements into the United States. This assessment undermines the Trump administration's justification for deporting alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, which has been invoked to deport individuals without due process. The memo also suggests that TDA is decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking. </p>

          <p>DoorDash reported record first-quarter revenue, driven by an 18% increase in total orders and strong demand for grocery delivery, despite growing economic unease among Americans. The company is expanding its reach through the acquisition of Britain's Deliveroo for $3.9 billion and SevenRooms, a hospitality management software company, for $1.2 billion. These deals will broaden DoorDash's presence in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and the hospitality sector, with the SevenRooms acquisition aimed at helping merchants grow in-store sales and customer relations. While revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, adjusted earnings per share exceeded forecasts, although DoorDash shares declined following the announcement. </p>

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley signaled similar concerns, indicating that he would only put forward nominees with sufficient support for confirmation.

          <p>A woman visiting Boston with her girlfriend claims she was asked to leave a hotel bathroom and subsequently escorted out of the Liberty Hotel during a Kentucky Derby party because a security guard mistook her for a man. The woman alleges that other patrons hurled insults at her, and that security personnel demanded identification to verify her gender before asking her and her partner to leave. The hotel, in response, stated that the couple was removed due to a physical altercation with security after being found sharing a bathroom stall, a claim the couple disputes. The incident has sparked controversy and renewed discussions about discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. </p>

          <p>The State Bar of California filed a lawsuit against Meazure Learning, the vendor responsible for administering the February bar exam, citing fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract due to widespread technical issues. The lawsuit alleges that Meazure Learning failed to deliver a functional remote and in-person exam, causing significant hardship for test takers, and then impeded the State Bar's investigation. This action follows a California Supreme Court ruling ordering the agency to revert to the traditional Multistate Bar Examination for multiple-choice questions for its July bar exam. The State Bar is seeking damages and an independent audit of Meazure Learning. </p>

          <p>A conservative columnist reflects on the challenges of criticizing Trumpism while acknowledging shared goals with Trumpworld, a position that often alienates both the left and the right. The author argues that while acknowledging issues like liberal media bias or problems within universities, the proposed solutions from the Trump administration often involve abuses of power that are equally problematic. This perspective is likely to annoy those who view American politics as a battle between heroes and villains, but it emphasizes the importance of nuanced analysis and avoiding extreme reactions. The article highlights the author's commitment to opposing abuses of power, even when they might serve his own "side."</p>

          <p>The CEO of Diamondback Energy, Travis Stice, warned shareholders that U.S. onshore oil production has likely peaked and will begin to decline due to plunging crude prices. Stice cited recession fears from President Trump's tariffs and increased OPEC+ supply as factors jeopardizing U.S. energy security. He noted that the company is cutting back on oil drilling and increasing natural gas production in response to the changing market conditions. Despite these concerns, U.S. crude oil prices rose following the expected decline in domestic production. </p>

          <p>Tesla's new vehicle registrations in Germany and Britain experienced significant drops in April, indicating a broader trend of declining European demand despite overall growth in the electric vehicle market. Experts attribute this decline to increased competition from European and Chinese automakers, as well as a backlash against Elon Musk's political views. While Tesla's Model Y deliveries have been delayed, the company is facing challenges in maintaining its dominance in the European market, with Chinese-made EVs gaining popularity. With Tesla reporting a substantial profit drop, CEO Elon Musk plans to shift his focus to company management. </p>

          <p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the world's largest humanitarian organization fighting hunger, is facing a projected 40% reduction in funding due to dwindling donations and cuts from the Trump administration.

The U.S. State Department cited concerns about funds benefiting terrorist groups and misalignment with "America First" priorities as reasons for the cuts.

Whether the offensive proceeds or is postponed, the analyst contends that the Israeli government's ultimate goal is the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and its reoccupation by Israel. </p>

The company has been diversifying its manufacturing base to reduce dependence on China, with plans to source less than 40% of its products from China by the end of the year.
