          <p>On the same day President Trump ordered strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a U.S. intelligence agency assessed that Iran could potentially produce a nuclear weapon within three to eight months, although there was no indication that Iran had decided to do so. The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction. The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is "racing towards a nuclear bomb." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, "President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world."</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, vying for New York City mayor, has gained prominence with a platform centered on free programs and services, earning endorsements from Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Mamdani plans to finance these initiatives, including rent freezes, free public transit, universal childcare, and a community safety department, by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers. He also aims to strengthen New York City's sanctuary city status and increase the minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030. According to Politico, the projected costs for these programs are substantial, with childcare estimated between $5 and $7 billion and the community safety department costing up to $450 million, raising questions about the feasibility of his financial strategy.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has decided not to testify in his ongoing sex trafficking trial, which is expected to conclude this week. Prosecutors have rested their case after presenting 34 witnesses over 28 days, attempting to convince the jury that Combs used his business empire to coerce women into sexual activity. The defense presented a brief case, arguing that evidence suggests the alleged victims consented to the sexual encounters. Closing statements are scheduled for Thursday, with jury deliberations potentially starting as early as Friday, while Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

Gudinas's attorneys argued that his lifelong mental illnesses should have exempted him from the death penalty, but the Florida Supreme Court disagreed.

The mission aims to conduct scientific research, technology demonstrations, and educational events while in orbit. This flight was initially delayed due to an oxygen leak and concerns about air leaks in a Russian compartment on the ISS, but it proceeded after the resolution of these issues, marking a significant step in commercial spaceflight and international collaboration.</p>

This decision expands the use of drones beyond dangerous situations and aims to provide officers with real-time information about potential threats. A pilot program is set to launch in four police divisions, with the department reporting back on its progress within six months.

          <p>Senate Republicans are proposing a bill that would require the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to sell its new electric vehicle (EV) mail delivery trucks and cancel the contract for the remaining vehicles. The bill aims to cut costs and shift USPS away from environmental initiatives, but it faces opposition due to potential violations of the Byrd Rule. Critics argue that revoking the EVs would be counterproductive, costing more to replace the vehicles and undoing investments in electrical infrastructure. Peter Pastre, the vice president of government relations and public policy for USPS, wrote a letter to the Senate in June that said the provision to sell the EVs would "make major and damaging changes to the U.S. Postal Service's vehicle fleet program, potentially impacting our ability to deliver to millions of Americans."</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly discovered dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which lived approximately 150 million years ago. Initially misclassified as a Nanosaurus, scientists now recognize it as a distinct animal that roamed alongside larger dinosaurs like the Stegosaurus. The Enigmacursor, about the size of a labrador, features unique leg bones and a small head, suggesting it was a fast runner. This discovery helps scientists understand the diversity of dinosaurs during the Late Jurassic period, filling gaps in knowledge about the evolution of larger dinosaur species.</p>

Investors had previously panicked over DeepSeek's AI model, which appeared as advanced as competitors but required less money and energy to function. Cramer suggests that the recovery of AI stocks demonstrates that fears about DeepSeek's dominance were short-lived and that the market's initial reaction was an overreaction.

          <p>The article discusses how voters and politicians now treat scandal as just another factor in a cost-benefit analysis, rather than a simple disqualifier. Andrew Cuomo's comeback illustrates this shift, benefiting from scandal fatigue and polarized politics. Voters may be more willing to support a flawed candidate if they believe that candidate is more electable or if they find the rival's worldview unacceptable. The author argues that scandals can still hurt a flawed politician, but voters may not hold their leaders to a higher moral standard.</p>

          <p>A former Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that senior DOJ officials, including Emil Bove, discussed defying federal court orders to advance the Trump administration's immigration priorities. Reuveni claims he was fired after questioning instructions to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court. The complaint details instances where Bove allegedly suggested disregarding court orders and continuing deportations regardless of rulings. Bove has been nominated to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, and his confirmation hearing is scheduled, prompting scrutiny over these allegations.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the Trump administration's postponement of a classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict, calling it "outrageous" and "evasive." The briefing, scheduled with officials from the Department of State, the Joint Chiefs, the CIA, and the DNI, was postponed to include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Schumer argued that senators deserve full transparency and real information, not just political talking points. The postponement occurred amid reports that an early intelligence assessment indicated the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear program did not completely destroy it.</p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people, citing a 2022 Assembly Bill that narrowed the legal definition of gang activity. The decision follows pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued that the injunctions were racially biased. These injunctions, some in effect since 2006, restricted suspected gang members from wearing certain clothes or associating with others in designated areas. The move reflects a broader trend in California away from gang injunctions, with other jurisdictions ceasing enforcement due to legal challenges and declining gang violence.</p>
