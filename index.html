        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK secured a narrow victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating the Labour Party by just six votes after a recount. Sarah Pochin, a former Conservative councillor, overturned a significant Labour majority in what is seen as a major electoral test for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This marks Reform UK's first ever victory in a parliamentary by-election, boosting the party's presence in Parliament to five MPs. The article notes that the Conservative vote collapsed, and Labour officials cited voter frustration with cuts to winter fuel payments and disability benefits as contributing factors to the outcome.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered into a $5.3 billion agreement with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for weight loss.

Petrelintide, with its potential for improved tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to existing GLP-1 drugs, is viewed as a promising asset.

This unprecedented accumulation of titles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage these responsibilities, especially given President Trump's unconventional approach to governance. The appointment was unexpected, even to State Department officials, and reflects the trust President Trump and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles have in Rubio.

Canada's relationships with China and India have also deteriorated, while opportunities for closer ties with Britain and Europe exist.

          <p>The UK's military involvement in Yemen, through RAF attacks on Houthi rebels, has intensified under the Labour government, aligning with a major US military operation. This action, aimed at countering Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, has drawn criticism due to reports of high civilian casualties. The UK's RAF Akrotiri base in Cyprus plays a crucial role in supporting US airstrikes. This support occurs amidst growing criticism of Israel's conduct in Gaza, potentially alienating Labour's traditional supporters who advocate for Palestinian rights.

The last comprehensive caste census was conducted by British colonial rulers in 1931, and successive Indian governments have resisted updating this data due to concerns about social unrest.</p>

The escalating trade war has resulted in high tariffs on both sides, impacting Chinese producers and global markets. The article highlights the challenges and complexities of reaching a trade deal, including concerns about President Trump's unpredictability and the need for China to be seen as standing up to U.S. pressure.</p>

          <p>China is assessing the situation after multiple overtures from the United States seeking trade talks, but insists that the Trump administration's tariffs stand in the way. The Commerce Ministry stated that for the U.S. to show sincerity, it must correct its erroneous actions and cancel its unilateral tariff increases. Chinese imports into the U.S. now face a crippling 145% tariff, and U.S. goods flowing into China are subject to tariffs of 125%. While Trump and administration officials believe China wants to talk, Chinese officials deny that talks are underway.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has closed a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, increasing prices for US customers of Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu. These companies relied on the "de minimis" exemption, allowing them to ship low-value items directly to the US without duties or import taxes. The Trump administration stated the move was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl. This decision aligns with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China, with some Chinese goods facing taxes as high as 145%.</p>

Huang stressed the importance of understanding competitive advantages in the AI race, noting that “50% of the world’s AI researchers are Chinese.” He compared today’s AI revolution to previous industrial transformations, arguing that the United States succeeded historically because it “applied steel, applied energy faster than any country,” rather than worrying about labor displacement.

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance has said the war in Ukraine is "not going to end any time soon", in an interview with Fox News. His comments came shortly after Washington signed a deal with Kyiv to share the profits of Ukraine's rare earth minerals in return for future US security assistance. Vance said the question facing the US administration now was how it could help Russia and Ukraine "find middle ground" to end the conflict that has been raging for more than three years. Trump suggested this week that Ukraine might be willing to cede Crimea - which Russia invaded in 2014 - in order to reach a truce settlement.</p>
