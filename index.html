          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed its component suppliers, including Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics, to halt production of its H20 artificial intelligence chip. This chip was specifically designed to comply with U.S. export regulations for the Chinese market. The move follows reports that the Chinese government raised national security concerns about the chips, fearing potential backdoors, and urged local tech companies like ByteDance and Alibaba to stop purchasing them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged the security questions from Beijing, stating the company is in discussions to resolve the issue and reaffirming that no such backdoors exist.</p>

          <p>Court documents from a legal dispute between Elon Musk and OpenAI show that Musk invited Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to participate in a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the AI company in early 2025. The proposal was made through Musk's own AI firm, xAI, as part of his effort to prevent OpenAI from transitioning into a for-profit entity. According to the filing, Zuckerberg and Meta did not sign the letter of intent or agree to provide financing for the takeover. This revelation is part of OpenAI's counterclaims, which allege Musk's bid was a sham intended to harm its business amid growing rivalry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing Florida from further expanding its "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center located in the Everglades. The ruling formalizes a temporary halt on construction, with the judge citing a failure by state officials to justify the facility's location or consider alternatives. Environmental advocates argued that the expansion violated environmental laws and threatened the sensitive ecosystem. In her decision, the judge ordered that fencing, lighting, and generators should be removed within 60 days as the number of detainees is expected to decrease through transfers.</p>

According to the LAPD, officers found the rapper, born Montero Lamar Hill, who allegedly became confrontational and charged at them during the encounter. Following a brief struggle, he was taken into custody on suspicion of misdemeanor obstruction of an officer. He was subsequently transported to a hospital for a suspected overdose before being booked into jail.

          <p>A tentative settlement has been reached between Elon Musk's social media company, X, and thousands of former employees who were laid off after his 2022 takeover. The class-action lawsuit sought $500 million in severance pay, alleging the company failed to honor its original commitment of up to six months' salary. Instead, many of the approximately 6,000 terminated workers received only one month of severance or nothing at all. While the specific terms of the agreement have not been disclosed, both parties have requested a postponement of a court hearing to finalize the details.</p>

          <p>A California parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, who, along with his brother Lyle, was convicted of murdering his parents in 1989. The board determined that Menendez, 54, continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, making him eligible for another hearing in three years. Commissioners cited his prison conduct, including illegal cellphone use and other rule violations, as the primary factor in their decision, rather than the severity of the original crime. Despite emotional testimony from relatives who have forgiven him, the board concluded that Menendez has not been a model prisoner.</p>

The family is now working with the International Game Fish Association to certify the catch, which would surpass the previous junior record of 59 pounds set in 2002.

          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, registered at 3.1% for July, slightly higher than the 3% forecast by economists but down from June's 3.3%.

A key factor in the slight cooling was the easing of rice price inflation, which fell to 90.7% after previously surging past 100%. Despite the moderation, some analysts believe the central bank is behind in its efforts to control inflation and manage purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zack Fox, known for his roles in "Abbott Elementary" and his music career, describes his perfect Sunday in Los Angeles, which balances relaxation, fitness, and socializing. His day begins with a calisthenics workout and a Filipino breakfast made by his wife, followed by walks with their dogs at Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. A significant portion of the afternoon is spent at Jalsah, a Yemeni cafe downtown, before enjoying a plant-based Thai dinner with friends in Thai Town. Fox often concludes his weekend by seeing a movie at a local theater or working on new music in a studio with friends.</p>

          <p>Bereaved families who have been campaigning for an inquiry into maternity care at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust expressed frustration after a meeting with Baroness Amos, the chair of a new national review. The families, who lost babies under the trust's care, stated they felt "ignored and dismissed," claiming the chair was unprepared and unaware of their specific case history. They are also angered by the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, which they believe compromises its independence. The families continue to insist that senior midwife Donna Ockenden should lead any investigation into the trust.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawyer for the online message board 4chan has stated the company will refuse to pay fines proposed by the UK's media regulator, Ofcom, under the new Online Safety Act. Ofcom is investigating the site's compliance with rules to protect users from illegal content and has provisionally suggested a £20,000 fine with additional daily penalties. The lawyer argues that as a U.S.-based company, 4chan is protected by the First Amendment and that Ofcom's actions constitute an "illegal campaign of harassment." This defiance highlights growing tensions between U.S. tech firms and international regulators over content moderation and free speech.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, instructing them to reduce sugar and salt levels and cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific backing. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the new standards, after which the government may consider alternative measures if sufficient changes are not made.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed puzzlement over the company's 4.5% stock drop following what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. Despite Walmart raising its full-year sales and earnings forecast, the stock fell, a reaction Simon found illogical given the retailer's growing sales and expanding margins. He suggested investors might have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by non-systemic issues like restructuring costs. Simon highlighted Walmart's ability to attract shoppers with low prices while successfully absorbing tariff impacts as a sign of its fundamental strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The development of hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is accelerating into a new global arms race. China and Russia are considered the current leaders in this technology, having invested heavily in their programs for years, while the U.S. and other Western nations are now playing catch-up. These weapons pose a significant strategic threat because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult to detect and intercept with existing defense systems. Nations like Iran and North Korea also claim to be developing their own hypersonic capabilities.</p>

His energetic performance helped his team salvage a draw in the first leg of the tie. The impactful cameo from the fan-favorite player has increased calls for him to be given a starting role by manager Jimmy Thelin, especially amid rumors of transfer interest from other clubs.</p>
