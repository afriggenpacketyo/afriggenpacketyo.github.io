          <p>Jordan's Interior Ministry has outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood, a prominent Islamist opposition group that has operated legally in the country for decades, citing links to a sabotage plot. The ministry has ordered the closure of the group's offices and the confiscation of its assets, extending the ban to anything published by the group. While banned in many Arab countries, the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm in Jordan, the Islamic Action Front, recently made gains in parliamentary elections, reflecting support for its Sunni Islamist ideology and goal of establishing a caliphate under sharia law. The movement claims to have renounced violence and now pursues its aims peacefully.</p>

          <p>BP shares experienced a jump after activist investor Elliott revealed a stake of over 5% in the company, which has been struggling and recently shifted back to oil investments. Elliott's involvement is expected to pressure BP to move away from its green strategy and focus on its core oil and gas businesses. BP had previously announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027, marking a departure from its earlier commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050. The shift in strategy has led to reduced support for BP's CEO and outgoing Chair during board re-election votes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that increased U.S. tariffs will contribute to a slight decrease in the country's fiscal deficit in 2025, despite a worsening outlook for U.S. growth and inflation due to an intensifying trade war. The IMF's Fiscal Monitor report projects the U.S. federal deficit to fall to 6.5% of GDP this year, contingent on higher tariff revenues. However, the report acknowledges uncertainty in the magnitude of the tariff revenue increase and the potential for tariffs to negatively impact imports and economic activity. If U.S. government debt continues to rise, the IMF believes it will push up longer-term interest rates.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich is facing increasing pressure to investigate its sponsorship deal with Rwanda, which has been accused of backing a rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite promising to address the issue months ago, the club has remained silent, drawing criticism from fans and human rights advocates. The German government has restricted its bilateral cooperation agreement with Rwanda, adding to the scrutiny. Other clubs with "Visit Rwanda" deals, such as Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, are also facing pressure, though PSG recently renewed its contract.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that the Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted college loan payments from millions of borrowers could negatively impact the economy. Starting May 5, approximately 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections, potentially leading to wage garnishments and reduced consumer spending. This policy could further strain the economy, which is already facing concerns about rising inflation and slowing growth. While the policy aims to reduce the national debt and clarify loan payment paths, its timing coincides with a precarious economic situation.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin is experiencing a price increase, rising for a third consecutive day and turning positive for the year, following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and rhetoric against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

This surge reflects a market capitalizing on a dip in an asset that is seen as a compelling option for portfolio diversification and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.
