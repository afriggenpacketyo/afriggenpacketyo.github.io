          <p>The US military conducted an airstrike targeting an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean, with officials reporting survivors for the first time in such operations. This detail marks a significant departure from previous, similar strikes where the US had claimed no survivors, adding a new dimension to ongoing military actions in the region. The incident occurs amidst heightened tensions with Venezuela and a broader US campaign against drug trafficking in the Caribbean. The presence of survivors could potentially offer new intelligence or legal complexities regarding these controversial interdiction efforts.</p>

          <p>Two men affiliated with the MS-13 street gang have been convicted for a coordinated, grisly attack on a couple in Lake Forest, California, in October 2018. The victims, Marco Morales and his girlfriend, were ambushed in their apartment's jacuzzi, leading to Morales being stabbed over 18 times with a machete and ultimately dying from a skull injury. Prosecutors stated Morales was not a gang member but had a dispute over a retrieved firearm, which angered one of the attackers. The perpetrators, who allegedly shouted their allegiance to MS-13 and laughed after the attack, were arrested shortly after, with evidence including blood traces and witness testimony, leading to convictions for first-degree murder and conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Des Moines Public School Board Chair Jackie Norris, a Democrat, has ended her bid for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat following backlash over her call for "radical empathy" toward former superintendent Ian Andre Roberts. Roberts, an illegal immigrant, resigned after his arrest by immigration authorities, revealing an extensive criminal history including theft, drug, and weapons charges, and multiple deportation orders. The school board admitted knowing Roberts did not graduate from Morgan State University as claimed, though it's unclear if they knew about his illegal status or full criminal record. Norris stated the "superintendent crisis" demanded her full attention, facing criticism for the district's hiring standards amidst ongoing investigations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, an unusual public admission for a US commander-in-chief. This decision follows recent US airstrikes on suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean, which have resulted in fatalities, and the unexpected retirement of Admiral Alvin Holsey, commander of US Southern Command, who reportedly expressed concerns about the mission's scope. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has publicly appealed for peace with the United States, urging against further escalation and "CIA-orchestrated coups d'état," while ordering military exercises. Trump justified these actions by citing drug flows and prison releases from Venezuela into the US, amidst concerns from human rights experts about "extrajudicial executions" from the strikes.</p>

          <p>Indiana University has ordered its student-run newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student (IDS), to cease printing new editions and fired its director of student media, Jim Rodenbush, who also served as the paper's adviser. Students and free expression groups, including PEN America and the Student Press Law Center, are criticizing these moves as unlawful censorship, alleging Rodenbush was terminated for resisting university directives to stop printing news content. The university, however, claims the shift is part of a 2024 action plan to move from print to digital media, address a longstanding structural deficit, and maintains that editorial control remains fully with IDS leadership, despite the widespread condemnation of its actions.</p>

The article argues Vance's deflection tactic, rather than repudiation, indicates the widespread nature of such illiberal ideas within the conservative coalition, which he aims to lead.

This perspective emerged as Wall Street saw declines in major indices, led by bank stocks, following disclosures of bad loans by Zions Bancorporation and fraud allegations by Western Alliance, building on concerns from auto industry bankruptcies.

Rinderknecht faces up to 45 years in prison for allegedly starting the Lachman fire on January 1, which later reignited into the destructive Palisades fire on January 7, killing 12 people and scorching thousands of acres. His lawyer argues there's no evidence directly linking the initial small blaze to the later massive wildfire, citing a week-long gap and numerous variables that could have led to the destructive event. Prosecutors allege Rinderknecht, an Uber driver, maliciously started the fire near Skull Rock, using witness statements, video surveillance, cellphone data, and fire dynamics analysis as evidence.</p>

While McLaren took no action during the race, the team's fundamental rule is to avoid crashing with teammates, which Norris admitted was breached.

The ultimate goal is to fuse light atoms, like hydrogen nuclei, at extremely high temperatures and confinement, to release vast amounts of clean electricity, mimicking the energy process of the sun. This ambitious pursuit highlights China's commitment to becoming a global leader in advanced, clean energy technology.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has condemned the decision to prevent Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending their Europa League match against Aston Villa due to safety concerns. The Safety Advisory Group, citing intelligence and past incidents of violence and hate crime between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, classified the match as high risk, leading to the ban. Opposition leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, echoed the criticism, calling the ban a "national disgrace" and a "serious mistake" that sends a shameful message about antisemitism and restricts Jewish fans. West Midlands Police expressed concerns about managing potential protests related to the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the Middle East, highlighting the complex security challenges.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted Cameron Arnold and Zachary Evetts on terrorism offenses, alleging they were part of a "North Texas Antifa cell" that attacked a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center on July 4. The indictment claims the group plotted to target law enforcement with gunfire and explosives, with one officer shot in the neck during the incident. The Department of Justice defines Antifa as a militant enterprise aiming to overthrow the US government. Defense attorneys argue anti-government beliefs are not crimes and downplay their clients' roles, while the charges follow President Trump's executive order labeling Antifa a "domestic terrorist organization."</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, a "founding mother" of NPR and a pioneering woman in radio, has died at the age of 87. Joining NPR at its inception, Stamberg became the first woman to host a national daily news program, "All Things Considered," and later "Weekend Edition." Colleagues remember her as a mentor, a "yenta," a compelling storyteller, and a tough, true-to-herself journalist who found joy in the creativity of culture, the spark of science, and even the humanity in politics. Her recorded voice continues to announce floors in NPR's headquarters elevators, a lasting tribute to her enduring legacy and significant contributions to public radio.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld its block on President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, though allowing them to remain under federal control. The 7th Circuit panel unanimously ruled that "the facts do not justify" Trump's actions under Title 10 federal law, which permits federalization during rebellion or inability to execute laws with regular forces. The court found "insufficient evidence" of a rebellion or that spirited, sustained, and occasionally violent protests hindered federal officers' ability to execute immigration laws, as federal facilities remained open. This decision reinforces the legal challenge against the administration's controversial use of federalized Guard troops in cities, despite the administration's claims of coordinated assaults.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced efforts to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), urging US employers to create new fertility benefit options and striking a deal with drug manufacturer EMD Serono to lower fertility drug costs. President Trump, who calls himself the "fertilization president," emphasized these moves would lead to "many more beautiful American children," addressing falling US birthrates. The initiative encourages employers to offer IVF coverage separately, similar to dental or vision, though it remains a recommendation without mandates or government subsidies. This comes after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling on embryos sparked nationwide debate, with the administration seeking to navigate the politically sensitive issue while framing the actions as "very pro-life."</p>

Carney emphasized Canada is considering the auto sector's dynamics in relation to ongoing negotiations with the United States, highlighting the delicate balance between economic interests and geopolitical alliances. Provincial leaders are divided, with some urging a deal for canola producers and others rejecting tariff removal to protect Canada's auto sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the cost of drugs for in vitro fertilization (IVF) will decrease "dramatically" due to price negotiations with biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono. He stated that the per-cycle cost of IVF drugs, particularly Gonal-f, is expected to fall by an estimated 73% for American consumers, addressing the issue of US drug prices being significantly higher than in other countries. The administration is also working to make it easier for companies to offer supplemental insurance coverage for fertility treatments. While a significant step, this initiative falls short of Trump's earlier pledge for full IVF coverage by insurance or the federal government, as other procedure costs remain.</p>

This occurred during a press conference alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and FBI Director Kash Patel, all Trump loyalists who previously served him personally. The article highlights concerns that these new appointees, despite promises of impartiality during their confirmations, are fulfilling Trump's personal vendettas, citing the recent indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James as examples.

F5 was alerted in August, with hackers reportedly present for at least 12 months using malware called Brickstorm, known for maintaining "long-term stealthy access" and remaining undetected.
