            <p>Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland, resulting in serious injuries. The officers were hospitalized with burns, scalds, and stab wounds after Abedi used hot cooking oil and homemade weapons. Abedi is serving a sentence for his involvement in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people. The incident has sparked concerns about prison security and the management of high-risk inmates, with calls for a review of freedoms given to prisoners in separation centers.</p>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing panic buying and paralysis among American consumers and businesses. The tariffs, including a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on Chinese goods, are expected to lead to higher prices and potential shortages. While some businesses are stockpiling goods, others are canceling shipments from China, contributing to market disruption. Analysts predict that the tariffs could significantly increase costs for households, potentially leading to a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, and other electronics, marking a significant policy shift. This decision comes after concerns from US tech companies about potential price increases on gadgets manufactured in China.

However, other tariffs still apply, and the exemptions could be short-lived, depending on future policy changes.</p>

            <p>President Trump is using executive orders to target specific law firms, leading to legal challenges and strategic maneuvering. The law firm Susman Godfrey, which represented Dominion Voting Systems, filed a lawsuit to block Trump's executive order against them, calling it unconstitutional retaliation. Trump's order seeks to restrict the firm's access to government buildings and contracts, allegedly as punishment for their work defending the integrity of the 2020 election. This action raises concerns about the use of executive power to target perceived political opponents.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on China, despite tech sector reprieves, are poised to inflict lasting harm on numerous American businesses.

Economists warn that the 145% tariff on Chinese imports could halt most trade between the US and China, leading to lost sales and product shortages.

            <p>The UK has experienced its warmest day of the year, reaching 24C in Northolt, London, following a dry and sunny start to April. Temperatures have been well above average, with Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales also recording high temperatures. Large parts of England and Wales are experiencing "very high" pollen levels, primarily due to Birch and Ash tree pollen. Hay fever sufferers can expect some relief by Wednesday as the weather becomes more unsettled.</p>

            <p>President Trump has authorized the military to take control of land at the US-Mexico border, expanding military involvement in immigration enforcement. The memorandum allows the armed forces to take a more direct role in securing the border and grants the Department of Defense jurisdiction over federal lands, including the Roosevelt Reservation. Military activities could include border-barrier construction and the detention of immigrants accused of trespassing. The move has been criticized as a workaround of the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced that it will exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from “reciprocal” tariffs. This decision is expected to help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that are not typically made in the U.S. The move will benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung, as well as chip makers like Nvidia. Items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors, and some chips will qualify for the exemption.</p>

            <p>NYPD divers are continuing the search for the remaining wreckage from Thursday's fatal helicopter crash in the Hudson River. Experts believe that recovering missing parts, such as the main rotor and transmission, is crucial to determining the cause of the crash. The helicopter was carrying a Siemens executive and his family on a sightseeing tour when it plunged into the river, killing all six people on board. A preliminary investigation suggests a rotor may have broken off before the crash.</p>

            <p>Travelers flying out of United States airports will need to show TSA agents their REAL ID-compliant driver's license, or another form of compliant identification to pass through security beginning on May 7.

If you show up without a REAL ID, expect delays. A valid passport is compliant identification, so if you're having trouble booking an appointment, you can still use that after May 7 to go through the TSA checkpoint.</p>

The funds had been withheld following a clash between President Trump and Maine Governor Janet Mills over transgender athletes.

The funding is used to feed schoolchildren in Maine.</p>

            <p>The RSPB's annual bird survey reveals a concerning decline in starling numbers, reaching the lowest levels since counting began in 1979. While blue tit sightings have increased, the overall trend indicates a decline in bird populations across the UK, primarily due to climate change, habitat loss, and bird flu. The RSPB suggests simple changes in gardens, such as leaving grass uncut and avoiding pesticides, to help improve survival rates. The article also touches on the importance of appreciating the beauty and friendship of birds.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump’s tariff strategy is being questioned, with some arguing it's based on an outdated vision of manufacturing. Despite Trump's claims, bringing manufacturing back to the US is proving difficult, as illustrated by TSMC's challenges in setting up a chip fabrication plant in Arizona. The skills and supply chains needed for modern manufacturing are complex and not easily replicated, even with government subsidies. This raises questions about the feasibility of Trump's goal to revitalize American manufacturing within a single electoral cycle.</p>

            <p>The barrage of retaliatory tariffs from China and the US could end quickly once talks start, given that both sides are open to dialogue. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump raised levies on Chinese goods to 104 per cent, before increasing them to 125 per cent the next day, later clarifying the cumulative figure at 145 per cent. Beijing countered with new levies on US goods of 125 per cent , on top of earlier-imposed tariffs, taking the cumulative total to nearly 148 per cent. Trump ended the week with a 90-day pause on fresh tariffs for most of the United States’ trading partners, leaving a baseline duty of 10 per cent in place for the period.</p>
