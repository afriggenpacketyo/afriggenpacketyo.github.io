          <p>Brazilian police arrested two suspects, reportedly Lady Gaga fans, who were allegedly plotting a bomb attack on her free concert at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which drew over two million fans. The suspects, part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were allegedly planning to use improvised explosives, but no explosives were found during the operation, dubbed 'Operation Fake Monsters'. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the threat until after the concert, which proceeded without incident, and had worked closely with law enforcement during the planning stages. The police operation involved search warrants in several cities, aiming to preempt any threat to the singer's performance.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his plans to step down, marking the end of an era for the renowned value investor. Buffett transformed a failing textile company into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate by acquiring successful businesses and insurers, utilizing their cash flow for further investments. Known for his disciplined approach and long-term perspective, Buffett amassed a personal fortune of $168 billion and influenced countless financiers, though he acknowledged the role of luck in his success. His successor, Gregory Abel, is viewed as a capable operator, though some investors worry that Berkshire may lose its unique stock-picking focus without Buffett at the helm.</p>

The Houthi military spokesman claimed responsibility, warning international airlines to avoid the airport, while Hamas praised the attack, which occurred amidst ongoing tensions and exchanges of fire.

SpaceX is seeking permits for up to 25 launches per year, leading to disruptions and environmental concerns voiced by residents and environmental groups.

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled cost estimates, raising questions about the state's ability to complete large-scale infrastructure projects. The project, intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is now scaled back to a 171-mile segment between Bakersfield and Merced, with completion projected for 2033. Eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser argues that land acquisition is not the primary cause of delays, but rather a complex mix of bureaucratic entanglements and changing plans. The rail line's diagonal path through the Central Valley has disrupted farming operations, leading to disputes over land value and access to resources.</p>

          <p>Damon Linker argues that President Trump's efforts to expand executive power go beyond traditional conservative legal theories and are influenced by a radical right-wing tradition favoring monarchical rule. He traces this influence to thinkers like Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and figures associated with the Claremont Institute, who advocate for a strong executive to overcome the perceived weaknesses of liberalism and the administrative state. Linker warns that this expansive view of executive power threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office.</p>
