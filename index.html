          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 14:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Turkey, the LGBTQ+ community is confronting intensified government repression, with Pride events being banned and participants facing arrest. The slogan for this year's Pride Month, "Insisting on life," highlights the community's resilience against a backdrop of demonization by political leaders and state institutions. Activists and journalists, such as Irfan Degirmenci, have been detained, and media outlets like Kaos GL have been blocked by court order. This crackdown is part of a broader, systematic effort to erase LGBTQ+ existence, which observers connect to the government's promotion of conservative family values.</p>

          <p>On the July 4th holiday, essential services like banks and U.S. post offices will be closed, and the stock market will not be operating. However, most major retail and grocery stores, including Walmart and various supermarket chains, plan to remain open for business, though some may operate on modified schedules. For instance, Trader Joe's will close early at 5 p.m., while Costco will be closed for the entire day. Many fast-food chains and restaurants are also expected to be open, but customers are advised to check local hours.</p>

          <h2>UN Report on Israel Faces Backlash Amid Accusations of Author Overreach and Bias</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A United Nations report by Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, titled "Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide," has drawn significant criticism for targeting Israel. Critics, including NGO Monitor, accuse Albanese of overstepping her mandate by explicitly endorsing a boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel, a power the UN Human Rights Council does not possess. The report has intensified concerns over Albanese's alleged anti-Israel bias, coming just after the U.S. called for her removal. The UN maintains that special rapporteurs are independent experts and their views do not necessarily reflect those of the organization.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has publicly refuted allegations of abuse from Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported from the U.S. who claims he was subjected to beatings and psychological torture in the country's CECOT supermax prison. Bukele posted photos and videos on social media, arguing Garcia appeared well and was not starved or tortured. Garcia's legal filings detail being forced to kneel overnight and being held in a constantly lit, overcrowded cell, which aligns with other reports from detainees under Bukele's widespread anti-gang crackdown. The allegations are part of a lawsuit against the Trump administration for the wrongful deportation.</p>

          <p>Members of the UK's House of Lords have forcefully condemned the government's inaction on resentencing prisoners held under the abolished Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) system. These open-ended sentences, scrapped in 2012 without retrospective effect, have left over 2,500 people incarcerated indefinitely, some for decades beyond their original minimum term for minor crimes. Peers described the situation as an "industrial-scale miscarriage of justice," with one lord comparing its severity to the Post Office and infected blood scandals. Despite the impassioned pleas and support from a UN special rapporteur, the government reiterated its focus on public protection over resentencing.</p>

          <p>High-profile left-wing MP Zarah Sultana has resigned from the Labour Party, announcing her intention to launch a new political party with former leader Jeremy Corbyn. However, Corbyn's response was more measured, stating that discussions for a "new kind of political party" are still ongoing, suggesting Sultana's announcement may have been premature. The potential new party is seen as an effort to capture voters to the left of Keir Starmer's Labour, with polls suggesting it could gain up to 10% of the vote. Such a move could significantly impact the Green Party and potentially disrupt Labour's standing in future elections.</p>

          <p>While competitive eating is a popular spectacle, health experts warn of its significant and potentially lasting physiological impacts. Gastroenterologists explain that a competitive eater's stomach can become massively distended, potentially leading to a permanent loss of contractility and impaired gastric emptying. A 2007 study documented how a speed eater's stomach expanded into a large, non-contracting sac. Beyond the stomach, the massive intake of calories, fat, and sodium poses risks of gastrointestinal distress, extreme bloating, and dangerous spikes in blood pressure, which could potentially trigger a heart attack or stroke.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire, which ignited in California's Los Padres National Forest, has rapidly expanded to over 52,500 acres, officially becoming the largest wildfire in the state so far this year. The blaze has triggered evacuation orders and warnings in parts of San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. With the fire currently at 10% containment, a major interagency response involving hundreds of personnel, air tankers, and helicopters is underway to protect lives and property.

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing sharp criticism from Jewish advocacy groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. The term, which originates from a villainous Jewish character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," is a long-standing trope associated with greed. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," while the Jewish Council for Public Affairs labeled it a quintessential antisemitic stereotype. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's offensive connotation and had only ever heard it used to describe a moneylender.</p>

The legislation extends the 2017 tax cuts, significantly boosts defense spending, and allocates $100 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, while also making steep cuts to Medicaid. The bill faced unified opposition from Democrats and some Republicans, who warned it would primarily benefit the wealthy and substantially increase the national debt.
