          <p>Ukraine has conducted airfield attacks within Russia, demonstrating its evolving drone capabilities and strategic adaptation throughout the conflict. While the full extent of the damage remains unknown, the operation highlights Kyiv's ability to strike strategic and symbolic blows against Russia. This operation showcases Ukraine's innovation in warfare, using drones to target key military assets deep within enemy territory. The attacks also serve as a morale boost for Ukraine and a demonstration of resolve in the face of ongoing conflict. Optimism is moderate given the ongoing nature of the conflict and the escalation of attacks.</p>

          <p>Online sports betting stocks experienced a downturn after Illinois lawmakers approved a budget that increased taxes on wagers. The new tax structure imposes a levy of 25 cents per wager on the first 20 million online sports bets and 50 cents thereafter. Analysts suggest this unexpected tax hike could prompt other states to follow suit, impacting the profitability of sports betting platforms. Companies like DraftKings, Flutter's FanDuel, MGM Resorts, and Penn Entertainment all saw their stock values decrease following the announcement (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has turned down a challenge to a ban on semiautomatic rifles, declining to hear a case from Maryland. This decision marks the courtâ€™s latest opportunity to apply its recently announced history-based test for assessing the constitutionality of gun control laws. The court's decision leaves the ban in place. The ruling will likely influence future cases concerning gun control legislation.</p>
