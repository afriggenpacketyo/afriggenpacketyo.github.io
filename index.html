While the UK economy showed stronger growth earlier in the year, the OECD cautions that "momentum is weakening" due to "deteriorating" business sentiment.

          <p>The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has experienced a significant drop in subscription sales, reportedly due to Donald Trump's involvement in the institution. Since Trump appointed himself as chairperson and reshaped the governing board, the center has faced controversy and boycotts from artists. Ticket sales have fallen by approximately 36% compared to the previous year. The article suggests that this decline may indicate a broader issue with the center's public standing under the new leadership.</p>
