            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an 'artificially high' economic start followed by a summer slowdown. Businesses are preemptively stockpiling inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases to avoid potential tariff increases. Sectors like the auto industry are particularly vulnerable due to reliance on imported parts from countries like China. Goolsbee remains optimistic about the longer-term economic outlook, noting steady employment and decreasing inflation despite short-term uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes a major reorganization of the U.S. State Department, potentially closing embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on issues like human rights and climate change. The order aims to consolidate regional bureaus and overhaul the process for selecting diplomats, prioritizing alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. The New York Times reported on the document, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied it, but the draft suggests a significant shift in diplomatic priorities if enacted, potentially streamlining operations and cutting costs while prioritizing an 'America First' approach.</p>

            <p>The felling of a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, London, by Toby Carvery has sparked widespread anger and debate. Residents expressed grief and disbelief, describing the tree as a 'friend' and a 'comfort,' especially during the pandemic lockdowns. Toby Carvery claimed the tree was felled due to health and safety concerns, but locals question this assessment and demand transparency. The incident highlights the emotional significance of trees in British culture, reminiscent of the Sycamore Gap tree felling, and raises broader concerns about development and preservation of green spaces in the area.</p>

            <p>Despite a 30-hour 'Easter truce' declared by Russian President Vladimir Putin, both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of breaching the ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed over 46 Russian assaults occurred since the truce began, while Russia's defense ministry reported repelling Ukrainian attacks and drone strikes. Zelensky dismissed Putin's truce declaration as a PR stunt, asserting that Russia is the sole source and reason for the ongoing war. The announcement of the truce came shortly after President Trump expressed reluctance to broker further peace talks between the two nations.</p>

He criticized President Bukele's attempts to portray Abrego Garcia as being in 'paradise,' stating the government staged photos with drinks to deceive the public. Van Hollen emphasized that the case is about protecting constitutional rights and ensuring due process for all Americans, regardless of the individual's background.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued a temporary stay on deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) following an appeal citing due process concerns. Solicitor General John Sauer argued the detainees lack standing for an injunction since the government paused deportations and is allowing legal processes to proceed. He requested the order be limited to AEA removals, not all Venezuelan alleged gang members. The court's intervention came amid debates over the scope of due process rights under the AEA and the Trump administration's use of the act to deport undocumented immigrants.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's preference for wealthy immigrants aligns with a broader trend of countries offering residency or citizenship in exchange for investment. While many find the commodification of national belonging distasteful, Trump sees potential in streamlining and expanding America's 'golden-visa' scheme to attract more capital. This approach reflects Trump's transactional worldview and focus on economic gain, contrasting with traditional immigration policies centered on family reunification or humanitarian concerns. The article suggests a potential policy shift towards prioritizing wealthy immigrants under a Trump administration.</p>

            <p>An Israeli probe into the killing of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza found 'professional failures,' resulting in the dismissal of a deputy commander. The investigation cited poor visibility and an 'operational misunderstanding' as contributing factors, but denied claims of execution. The report also alleged that six of the victims were Hamas members, a claim disputed by Palestinians and international human rights groups. Critics argue that the Israeli military rarely investigates such incidents thoroughly and that the findings lack transparency, raising concerns about accountability for civilian deaths in Gaza.</p>

The mayor of Mbandaka attributed the discrepancy to 'confusion' in initial reports. Police believe the fire was ignited by cooking activities on the overcrowded vessel.

            <p>Germany is seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens over alleged actions at pro-Palestinian protests, sparking concerns about freedom of movement and due process. The individuals, facing deportation orders, are accused of property damage and graffiti during a protest at Berlin's Free University. The Berlin Immigration Office cites Staatsräson, Germany's responsibility towards Israel, as justification. Lawyers are appealing the deportations, arguing that the protesters have not been formally charged or convicted of any crimes. The situation has drawn comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of pro-Palestinian student protesters in the U.S.</p>
