          <p>Secretary of War Pete Hegseth addressed military commanders, stating that those who oppose his plan to eliminate "woke" diversity measures and restore a "warrior ethos" should "do the honorable thing and resign." He declared the Defense Department "dead" in favor of the War Department, emphasizing the military's sole mission is to prepare for and win wars. Hegseth announced ten new directives, including returning combat standards to pre-2015 "male level" benchmarks and strictly enforcing grooming rules for all personnel. He criticized decades of "decay" driven by diversity programs and politicized leadership, asserting a shift away from "identity months" and "gender delusions" to refocus on combat readiness.</p>

          <p>South Africa's ambassador to France, Nkosinathi Emmanuel "Nathi" Mthethwa, was found dead outside a Paris hotel, with French authorities investigating the circumstances. His wife reported him missing after receiving a worrying text message, and a forced-open window was found in his 22nd-story room, leading investigators to suspect suicide. Mthethwa previously served as South Africa's Minister of Police, and his death comes weeks after a Judicial Commission of Inquiry began investigating alleged corruption and political interference in the country's criminal justice system. Mthethwa had recently been accused of interfering in a criminal intelligence investigation during his tenure.</p>

          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown beginning October 1 is not expected to interrupt monthly Social Security payments for 74 million Americans, as these benefits are funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration's customer services, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and Medicare card replacements, could be temporarily halted, impacting individuals needing administrative assistance. While nearly 90% of SSA employees are deemed essential and will continue working, about 6,200 workers face furlough. Furthermore, a delay in the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement is possible if the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index data release is affected by the federal closure, impacting how benefits keep pace with inflation.</p>

García-Hernández, a 32-year-old Mexican national and father of four, succumbed to his injuries after being removed from life support. He was one of three people shot, with another detainee, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, dying on the day of the attack. The gunman, Joshua Jahn, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and authorities believe the "targeted attack" was planned, with "anti-ICE" writings and notes outlining a "game plan" found at the scene.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an agreement with Pfizer to lower the cost of some prescription drugs for Medicaid recipients, aligning with his "most favored nation" policy. This deal is part of the administration's broader effort to link U.S. drug prices to cheaper international rates and avoid planned pharmaceutical tariffs for companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S. Additionally, the White House plans to launch "TrumpRX," a direct-to-consumer website for prescription drug purchases. While the exact savings for Medicaid recipients are not yet clear, this initiative is presented as a significant step to cut drug prices for everyday Americans, leveraging federal government power.

          <p>Canadian authorities have identified "The Woman in the Well" as Alice Spence, nearly two decades after her remains were discovered in Saskatoon, solving a decades-old cold case. Born in September 1881, Spence moved to Canada in 1913 and was last seen in a 1916 census. Her partially dismembered remains, found in a barrel in 2006, were identified using investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that connects DNA to relatives. Police now believe her death, under suspicious circumstances, occurred between 1916 and 1918. This marks the oldest investigation in Canada solved with genetic genealogy, offering a testament to persistent investigative innovation.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon Health & Science University have successfully created human eggs containing genes from adult skin cells, a significant advancement in in vitro gametogenesis (IVG). This breakthrough could eventually help infertile women or gay couples have genetically related children, but it also raises complex ethical, social, and legal questions. The team used a modified cloning technique to coax reconstituted eggs into developing, with some reaching the early embryo stage. While current embryos still exhibit genetic abnormalities, researchers are optimistic about refining the process, despite concerns about "designer babies" and unauthorized genetic material use.</p>

Former superintendents urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to close parks if funding ceases, citing vandalism, environmental destruction, and overwhelmed rescue services during past shutdowns. With autumn being a high fire-risk season, leaving parks open with minimal staff could be catastrophic.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris defended her unsuccessful 2024 presidential bid at her L.A. book event for "107 Days," attributing her loss to the unprecedented nature of the election rather than her own shortcomings. She criticized former President Biden's administration for not prioritizing "kitchen table issues" like affordable childcare and paid leave over infrastructure. Harris also lamented the capitulation of civic and corporate leaders to the Trump administration, expressing deep disappointment in powerful individuals who "are bending the knee at the foot of this tyrant." She further condemned President Trump's use of "juvenile" AI-generated videos, calling him "unbalanced, incompetent and unhinged."</p>

          <p>The Nottingham Post and Nottinghamshire Live have launched a legal challenge against Nottinghamshire County Council leader Mick Barton's decision to refuse to speak to their reporters. The Reform UK leader imposed the ban in August, reportedly after an article about local government reorganization, and also stopped sending press releases. While the ban was later lifted for BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service journalists, it remains in place for other Post reporters. The publisher's law firm, CMS LLP, argues the ban is without legal basis, irrational, and breaches local government regulations and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, concerning freedom of expression.</p>

The plan requires Hamas to disarm and be excluded from future power in Gaza, conditions many find difficult for the group to accept.
