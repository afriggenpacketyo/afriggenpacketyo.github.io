        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has implemented new export restrictions on rare earths and related technologies, aiming to bolster its leverage in upcoming trade negotiations with the United States. These controls, primarily targeting U.S. defense technology companies, are described by Beijing as necessary for national security. Analysts view this move as a sophisticated diplomatic lever, potentially setting a precedent for China's approach to other strategic commodities. The policy intensifies trade friction and underscores China's significant global dominance in rare earth processing.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and a strong forecast for the end of 2025, driven by rising airfares and sustained demand for premium travel. The article highlights the airline's adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share and revenue of $15.2 billion, both surpassing analyst expectations. CEO Ed Bastian noted an increase in cash sales since July and no signs of consumer pullback in luxury products. Delta's strategic culling of less profitable flights has also contributed to improved domestic unit revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

A club legend as a player, Wellens led the team to a World Club Challenge victory in 2023 but could not maintain the domestic dominance of previous coaches. The article notes his contract was not renewed after the team finished fifth and exited the Super League play-off semi-finals. Chairman Eamonn McManus described it as a difficult decision, acknowledging Wellens' role as a "supreme ambassador."</p>

          <p>PepsiCo announced stronger-than-expected third-quarter revenue, reaching $23.94 billion, even as sales volumes for snacks and beverages declined in North America. The article highlights that net income fell 11% to $2.6 billion, but adjusted earnings per share still beat forecasts. The company is responding to weakened demand, partly due to inflation, by focusing on value brands and removing artificial colors from products. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has also taken a stake, urging PepsiCo to streamline its portfolio and consider refranchising bottlers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's recent call for North Korea to permit reunions for families separated by the Korean War is unlikely to be heeded, according to analysts. The article highlights the deep distrust between the two Koreas, with Pyongyang showing increasing hostility, including demolishing a traditional meeting place. Experts believe North Korea, strengthened by alliances with China and Russia, lacks incentive to cooperate, fearing a surge in reunification sentiment that challenges its propaganda. Time is running out for the dwindling number of elderly separated family members.</p>

          <p>Research by the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests that Democratic candidates can regain Rust Belt voters by adopting a populist stance that critiques their own party's establishment. The article highlights a "Democratic penalty," where candidates with identical economic platforms fared worse when labeled Democrats. Voters expressed frustration with Democrats being "out of touch" and ineffective, rather than primarily focusing on "wokeness." The study indicates that strong anti-corporate rhetoric and concrete policies like capping drug prices and raising taxes on the wealthy resonate more effectively with working-class communities.</p>

          <p>China's extended "super golden week" holiday saw a decline in box-office revenues compared to the previous year, with cinemas raking in 1.83 billion yuan. The article notes this was the second-lowest total since 2017 for the period, despite increased screenings and lower ticket prices. However, the nationwide box office for the year has already surpassed the total for all of 2024, indicating an overall improvement in the annual picture. This holiday is traditionally the second most lucrative film season in China, after the Lunar New Year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores how political affiliation has become central to many Americans' identities, leading to the "coding" of everyday items and choices as left or right. It highlights a shift from political apathy in the 1950s to profound partisan division today, where even personal decisions like dating, friendships, and religious affiliations are influenced by politics. The article discusses how policy differences and social identity are intertwined, with people often changing views to fit their political tribe. This politicization contributes to increased animosity, hostility, and social homogeneity, impacting cooperation and public discourse.</p>

          <p>Major Russian industrial companies across sectors like metals, coal, and transport are furloughing employees and cutting staff as the war economy slows. The article highlights that firms like Cemros, Russian Railways, and Avtovaz have reduced working weeks to cut wage bills and preserve staff. This move reflects the strain on Russia's economy from the Ukraine conflict and Western sanctions, with non-military sectors contracting significantly. Despite low unemployment, economists point to high interest rates, strong rouble, and weak export markets as contributing factors to the industrial slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of National Guard troops remain in the Chicago area as Illinois and city officials await a judge's decision on stopping their deployment, ordered by President Trump. The article highlights the lack of federal communication regarding troop movements and the city's argument that the deployment infringes on state sovereignty and public safety. While the stated mission is to protect federal property, Trump has linked it to unsubstantiated claims of crime in Democratic-led cities. This situation underscores a broader legal challenge to the president's authority to deploy the National Guard domestically.</p>

Over 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software, and hundreds more used personal savings to cover phantom shortfalls. This aims to deliver justice more swiftly and fairly.</p>

While beneficiaries anticipate an average increase of about $54 per month, many still face high prices for necessities. Additionally, Medicare Part B premiums are projected to rise, potentially offsetting some of the COLA benefit for retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

Lesley, who served the Campbell County library system for 27 years, sued over her termination, alleging violations of her First Amendment rights. The article highlights that public officials sided with objectors who deemed the books inappropriate for youngsters. Lesley expressed vindication, hoping the settlement sends a message that the First Amendment and anti-discrimination values remain strong, particularly for public entities and government officials.</p>
