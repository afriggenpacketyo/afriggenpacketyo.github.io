          <p>A new report finds that current national commitments under the Paris Agreement could prevent 57 deadly hot days per year compared to a world without the accord. However, the world is still on track for dangerous levels of warming, which disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations and critical ecosystems like the Amazon. The analysis emphasizes that while the 2015 agreement has successfully steered the world away from the worst-case scenarios, significantly more ambitious emissions cuts and adaptation measures are urgently required to meet the treaty's goals.</p>

          <p>The British government has published key witness statements from its deputy national security adviser related to the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The documents were released following political pressure after the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges, sparking accusations of a cover-up and questions about the government's stance on China as a national security threat. The statements detail the perceived threat from Chinese intelligence activities while also emphasizing the government's commitment to maintaining a positive economic relationship with Beijing.</p>

          <p>One of Alaska's largest-ever airlifts is in progress to evacuate hundreds of residents from remote coastal villages devastated by flooding from the remnants of Typhoon Halong. The storm caused record-high water levels, washing entire homes out to sea and leaving two people missing, prompting a large-scale search-and-rescue operation. Officials are now focused on moving approximately 1,500 displaced people to shelters in hubs like Anchorage, highlighting the immense logistical challenges of responding to disasters in the state's isolated communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop purchasing Russian oil, a move the U.S. has been pushing as part of its economic pressure campaign against Moscow over the war in Ukraine. Trump stated the halt would occur within a short period, though Indian officials have not commented on the claim. The development comes amid trade tensions, as the U.S. had imposed significant tariffs on Indian goods, partly as leverage to curb its energy and weapons trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>The UK Cabinet Office has refuted claims made by former senior government aide Dominic Cummings that China successfully breached high-level systems containing extremely sensitive intelligence. Cummings alleged that he was briefed in 2020 about a massive compromise of classified data that was subsequently covered up. However, a government spokesperson called the claim untrue, and the former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre stated that, to his knowledge, no such breach of the nation's most secure systems occurred.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an emergency directive ordering all federal agencies to patch critical vulnerabilities in F5 networking products. The order follows the discovery that a nation-state actor gained long-term, unauthorized access to the company's internal source code, posing an imminent risk to federal networks. F5's public disclosure of the breach was delayed at the request of the Department of Justice, citing national security concerns, in one of the first known uses of this provision under new SEC rules.</p>

Under the plan, the government would help fund the purchase of new properties by councils and housing associations, which would first be offered to existing social housing tenants. The homes they vacate would then be used for asylum seekers, a strategy projected to cut accommodation costs from £54,000 to £4,000 per person annually while also expanding the nation's long-term social housing stock.</p>
