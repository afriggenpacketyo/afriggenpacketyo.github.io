After fleeing gang violence, he was granted protection from deportation to El Salvador by a US judge but was mistakenly sent there anyway in March. Following a Supreme Court order for his return, he was arrested on human smuggling charges and is now being threatened with deportation to Uganda, a country to which he has no known connection.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel experienced a sharp decline in its stock price, losing nearly $100 million in market value after unveiling a new, modernized logo. The redesign, which removes the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel, has been criticized by some commentators and marketing experts as "generic" and a departure from its established brand identity. This move is part of a broader effort by the company to refresh its image amid slowing growth and declining profits, but it has sparked a negative reaction from investors and parts of its customer base.

          <p>North Korean state media reported that leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test-firing of two new air defense missiles, which demonstrated "superior combat capability." The report did not specify the type of missiles or the location of the test. This military activity occurs amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, including a recent incident where South Korean forces fired warning shots at North Korean troops crossing the demarcation line. The tests also coincide with ongoing joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang has condemned.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce processing times and decrease reliance on housing migrants in hotels. A new independent body with dedicated adjudicators will be established to hear cases more quickly, as the current average wait for an appeal is over a year with 51,000 cases pending. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the goal is to end unacceptable delays for those appealing rejected asylum applications. The move comes amid public protests and legal challenges from local councils over the use of hotels for asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy received a written warning from the country's Environment Agency for fishing without a license. The incident occurred during a visit with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at Lammy's country estate, where the two held a bilateral meeting and participated in a fishing photo opportunity. Lammy, who called the situation an "administrative error," subsequently purchased a license and reported himself to the agency. The event drew some lighthearted commentary, with Vance joking that the Foreign Secretary was the only one who didn't catch a fish.</p>

          <p>Thousands of St George's and Union Jack flags have appeared on lampposts across England, sparking a debate about their meaning and motivation. The trend, which began in Birmingham, is attributed by some to a desire to express patriotism and reclaim the flags from far-right associations, while others view it as a reaction to immigration and a general sense of national malaise. The movement has drawn criticism from some who find the displays intimidating, but has been defended by politicians like Kemi Badenoch, who argue such patriotic expressions should be welcomed. This phenomenon highlights the complex and often contentious relationship many Britons have with their national symbols.</p>

An investigation found that while some major airports like Gatwick and Heathrow waive the fee, many others charge disabled drivers or have complex and inconsistent exemption processes. Critics argue the system is confusing, with some airports requiring online pre-registration that can be difficult for less tech-savvy individuals. The charity asserts that disabled customers deserve respectful treatment and should not be charged for accessing terminal drop-off zones.</p>

The works, now on display in a Bucharest museum, were reportedly discovered under a pensioner's mattress and are owned by Israeli businessman Yaniv Cohen. However, a leading scholar notes the paintings lack proper documentation and were never recorded during the artist's lifetime. Despite certificates of authenticity from one art historian and technical analyses dating the materials to the correct period, experts and laboratories stop short of confirming Malevich as the artist.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in their early 20s are opting for "preventative Botox" injections with the goal of stopping wrinkles before they form. This trend involves using botulinum toxin to relax facial muscles, thereby reducing the skin creasing that eventually leads to static lines. While some practitioners support the approach as a way to slow the aging process, others, including the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, argue it is often a waste of money to treat lines that do not yet exist. Critics also express concern about the societal pressure on young people to pursue anti-aging treatments.</p>

          <p>Patrick Cantlay and Tommy Fleetwood are tied for the lead at 16 under par heading into the final day of the Tour Championship at East Lake. Cantlay surged into contention with a strong back nine, shooting a 64, while Fleetwood maintained his position with a 67 despite a double bogey on the 15th hole. The leaderboard sets up a dramatic final round, with Russell Henley two shots behind in third place. A victory for Fleetwood would mark his first win on American soil, but he faces a tough challenge from the in-form Cantlay.</p>

          <p>The U.S. immigrant population has decreased by more than one million people since Donald Trump began his second term in January, reversing a 50-year growth trend, according to a new Pew Research Center study. The number of immigrants fell from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June. The study attributes this decline to several factors, including previous restrictions on asylum applications and the Trump administration's 181 executive actions targeting immigration, which have included mass deportations. The number of immigrant workers in the U.S. labor force has also dropped by 750,000.</p>

          <p>Marineland Antibes, a closed marine park in France, is sexually stimulating an 11-year-old male orca named Keijo to prevent him from inbreeding with his mother, Wikie. The two whales remain at the facility as authorities and activists have not yet agreed on a rehoming plan following the park's closure. Activist groups captured footage of the procedure, which they describe as unusual and concerning, raising questions about whether the park intends to collect semen for breeding purposes elsewhere. The park management denies this, stating the action is necessary to relieve the adolescent whale's sexual tensions and prevent conflict.</p>

The Democratic governors of both states have vowed to fight the decision, which they and other critics have linked to corruption and favoritism towards the fossil fuel industry.

          <p>Scientists have digitally reconstructed the faces of two men from 2,500-year-old skulls excavated at an ancient burial site in Tamil Nadu, India. The project, a collaboration between Madurai Kamaraj University and Face Lab in the UK, aims to understand the appearance of early inhabitants of the Keeladi civilization. This civilization, dating back to 580 BC, suggests a complex urban society existed in southern India independently of the northern Indus Valley Civilisation. The facial reconstructions reveal features primarily of Ancient Ancestral South Indians, but also hint at global migration through traces of Middle-Eastern and Austro-Asiatic ancestries.</p>

Lyle's hearing on Friday was temporarily halted after a TV station published an audio recording of Erik's hearing from the previous day, which prison officials confirmed was released "erroneously." The incident sparked outrage from the brothers' family and legal team, who accused the state of creating a public spectacle and violating their privacy. Both brothers will be eligible to petition for parole again in one year, with a new hearing possible in three years.</p>

          <p>Several major European postal and parcel services, including DHL and Royal Mail, are temporarily suspending some shipments to the United States due to new tariff policies. Effective August 29, the Trump administration is ending the "de minimis" rule, which allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. The shipping companies cite ambiguity in the new regulations and the extremely limited timeframe to implement new systems for data transmission and customs duty collection as the primary reasons for the pause. The change affects business packages, while letters and personal gifts under $100 remain exempt. (not investment advice)</p>
