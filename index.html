Trevor Milton, founder of Nikola, donated nearly $2 million to Trump's reelection efforts and received a pardon for his 2022 conviction of defrauding investors. Imaad Zuberi, a venture capitalist and major political donor, had his sentence commuted after donating at least $800,000 to committees associated with Trump and the Republican Party.

This dismissal comes as the Trump administration signals a pro-crypto stance, with the Justice Department curtailing its crypto enforcement team. Binance has also forged ties with World Liberty Financial, a project aiming to be a crypto bank, and Zhao has become an advisor to Pakistan's Crypto Council. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, as part of a series of clemency actions. Hoover, who is serving six life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges, will remain incarcerated due to a 200-year state sentence for murder. While Trump commuted Hoover's federal sentence, he cannot alter the state-level sentence. The move has sparked debate, with some arguing that Hoover has disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, while others maintain he still exerts influence over the gang.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reacted sharply to the "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out," during a press briefing. The term, coined by a Financial Times columnist, mocks Trump's inconsistent tariff policies. Investors use the "TACO trade" strategy by buying stocks cheaply after Trump announces tariffs and profiting when markets rebound as he delays or retracts them. Trump defended his tariff decisions, expressing agitation and calling the reporter's question "nasty." The legality of Trump's tariffs is currently under legal review.</p>

          <p>President Trump has imposed a series of tariffs on goods from other countries, aiming to boost American manufacturing and protect jobs. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of the product's value, which companies pay to the government. Trump argues that these measures will encourage consumers to buy American-made products and reduce the trade deficit. However, critics contend that tariffs will increase prices for U.S. consumers. Recent court rulings have challenged the legality of Trump's tariffs, adding uncertainty to the trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Malibu has contracted with a private security firm to patrol wildfire-affected areas, addressing concerns about looting and theft as the Pacific Coast Highway reopens. The security patrols will work alongside the Los Angeles sheriff’s office to provide continuous coverage during the recovery phase. The additional security aims to protect vacant homes and construction materials from burglary and vandalism. The city council approved the contract following widespread devastation from recent fires, which killed dozens and destroyed thousands of homes.</p>

          <h2>Costco Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates as Sales Surge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 17:20:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Costco reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue, exceeding expectations with an 8% sales increase. The warehouse club retailer's net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, driven by comparable sales growth and e-commerce performance. Costco's competitive pricing and bulk discounts could attract more customers amid economic uncertainty and rising tariffs. The company's ability to negotiate prices with suppliers and its steady traffic drivers, such as discounted gas and groceries, position it well in the current economic climate.
