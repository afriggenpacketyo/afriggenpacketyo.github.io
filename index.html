          <p>Shares of Circle Internet Group experienced a significant rally after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The stock price jumped over 16% on Friday, adding to a 33% increase on Wednesday following the news of the bill's passage. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments, with companies like Amazon and Walmart exploring their use. The GENIUS Act seeks to provide consumer protections, collateral requirements, and regulatory oversight for stablecoins, potentially paving the way for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>

          <p>Shubman Gill marked his captaincy debut with a century, complemented by Yashasvi Jaiswal's impressive ton, as India reached 359-3 on the first day of the Test match against England. Following the retirement of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Gill's ongoing partnership with Rishabh Pant, who is currently at 65 not out, underscored the strength of India's batting lineup. England's decision to field first after winning the toss is under scrutiny, as their bowlers struggled to capitalize on available swing. Despite the challenging start, England aims to leverage the ground's history of come-from-behind victories, though weather forecasts favor India's pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to ban Palestine Action after activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed red paint on military planes. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the incident as vandalism, prompting a security review at military bases nationwide. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will present a statement to Parliament to proscribe Palestine Action, effectively designating them as a terrorist organization. The group claimed responsibility for putting air-to-air refueling tankers "out of service," though the RAF stated operations would not be affected, as counter-terrorism police are investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Semiconductor stocks experienced a downturn following reports that the U.S. government is considering terminating waivers that allow some chipmakers to export American technology to China. Commerce Department official Jeffrey Kessler reportedly expressed interest in canceling waivers for companies like Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Taiwan Semiconductor, which permit them to send U.S. chipmaking technology to their factories in China. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF saw a decline of approximately 1%, with individual stocks like Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Marvell Technology also falling.

          <p>President Donald Trump and the Justice Department have requested a delay in oral arguments for his appeal of the $83 million defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll. Trump is appealing the 2024 verdict that ordered him to pay Carroll for defaming her in 2019, when he denied her accusation of sexual assault. Trump's attorneys argue they should be allowed to appeal the rejection of having the government substitute for him in the case before oral arguments take place. The Justice Department contends that Trump was acting within his presidential role when making the statements, thus the DOJ should defend him.</p>

          <p>This article explains the IRS Offer in Compromise (OIC) program, which allows eligible taxpayers to settle their tax debt for a reduced amount. The IRS assesses applicants based on their ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity, with strict criteria and a thorough evaluation process. Applicants must file Form 656 and detailed financial statements, and the offer must equal or exceed the IRS's calculated reasonable collection potential. Common mistakes leading to rejection include hiding assets, underreporting income, and failing to provide sufficient documentation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico is assessing the damage from Hurricane Erick, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm, resulting in at least two deaths and widespread disruption. The storm caused landslides, flooding, and power outages along Mexico's southern Pacific coast. Coastal residents, particularly in Acapulco, were reminded of the devastating Hurricane Otis in 2023. While restaurants and shops have gradually reopened, schools remained closed as authorities continue to assess the damage and monitor rising rivers.</p>

          <p>British lawmakers in the House of Commons voted to pass a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill will now undergo scrutiny by the House of Lords. The bill proposes that adults over 18 with less than six months to live could receive assistance to end their lives, subject to safeguarding checks. The vote marks a significant step towards a major change in social policy in the UK.</p>
