          <p>Australia is set to become the first country to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, with changes starting next month. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. Previously, men who had sex with men in the previous three months were banned from donating blood or plasma, but now most people in a sexual relationship of 6 months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The updated approach to blood donations will be implemented sometime in 2026. </p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with signing bonuses reaching $100 million and substantial annual compensation packages. Altman noted that Meta views OpenAI as a primary competitor, acknowledging Meta's aggressive pursuit of AI talent due to the shortcomings of their own AI initiatives. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is reportedly investing heavily in assembling a top AI team for its "superintelligence" AI lab. These efforts follow delays in the release of Meta's latest flagship AI model, highlighting Zuckerberg's frustration with Meta's AI standing and willingness to invest billions in top talent.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-over-year in May, marking the sharpest decline since September 2024, primarily due to falling shipments to the U.S. and China.

The Bank of Japan noted that the country's growth was likely to moderate due to trade uncertainties and overseas economic slowdown. Tariffs pose a main threat to Japan's economic outlook, with concerns that a full return to pre-Trump trade terms is unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling extends a previous order, suspending the policy for all Americans and allowing applicants to choose their gender identity or select "X" on passport applications.

The executive order, issued by President Trump, reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for Americans to self-select their gender. The ruling is based on the judge's finding that the Trump administration failed to provide a rationale for the new passport policy "related to an important governmental interest" and found that the policy discriminated against transgender Americans.</p>
