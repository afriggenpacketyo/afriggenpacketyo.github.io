          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man previously deported and then returned to the U.S. for federal prosecution on human smuggling charges, will remain in jail as lawyers debate whether the Justice Department can prevent his deportation if released pending trial. A judge has ordered Abrego Garcia's lawyers to submit arguments, with the government given time to respond, before a ruling is issued. The Justice Department appealed the release order, citing irreparable harm to the prosecution if Abrego Garcia is deported, while his lawyers argue that the deportation concerns are a "self-inflicted injury" by the Department of Homeland Security. The case gained attention after Abrego Garcia's initial deportation was acknowledged as an "administrative error".</p>

          <p>A New York state assemblyman, Matt Slater, challenged Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's claims of being a "Bronx girl" by sharing her high school yearbook photo from suburban Yorktown. This followed a social media exchange where Ocasio-Cortez referenced her Bronx roots in response to criticism from Donald Trump. Trump had called Ocasio-Cortez "stupid" after she called for his impeachment, prompting her to assert her Bronx identity. Ocasio-Cortez lived in the Bronx until age 5 before moving to Yorktown Heights for better schools, often highlighting her upbringing to emphasize the impact of zip code on opportunity.</p>

          <p>Plans to convert a shuttered prison in California City into California's largest immigration detention center have sparked outrage among advocacy groups. ICE is partnering with CoreCivic to transform the 2,500-bed facility, with initial funding of $10 million. Residents and advocacy groups voiced concerns at a city council meeting, arguing it will fuel harm and prioritize short-term jobs over long-term economic health. Concerns have been raised about the potential increase in raids, deportations, and broken families, while some residents believe it will boost the local economy.</p>

          <p>Immigrant rights activists are criticizing the Los Angeles Police Department after officers were filmed separating a crowd from federal agents during a detention in downtown L.A. The LAPD insists they were responding to a kidnapping report and not cooperating with ICE, claiming they aimed to de-escalate tensions between the crowd and federal agents. Activist groups, however, argue that the police were present to restrain the crowd while ICE agents made arrests. The incident has heightened tensions despite L.A.'s sanctuary city ordinance prohibiting the use of municipal resources for immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>BP shares experienced volatility following reports of a potential acquisition by Shell, which Shell has denied. The initial report caused BP shares to jump over 10%, but they later retreated after Shell's denial, closing up 1.64%. Speculation about BP being an acquisition target has arisen due to its underperformance compared to Shell and U.S. rivals. BP's earlier strategic shift towards renewable energy, which faced scrutiny as profits faltered, led to a recent reset, with increased focus on oil and gas and reduced spending on renewables.

          <p>Wall Street investors and business leaders are expressing concern over Zohran Mamdani's primary victory in the New York City mayoral race, fearing potential tax hikes and tighter regulations. Investors worry that Mamdani's policies could lead to an exodus of wealthy residents and firms to lower-tax states. Mamdani's emphasis on socialism and wealth redistribution contrasts with Wall Street's preference for deregulation and low taxes. Shares of New York regional bank Flagstar and office-focused real estate stocks have already declined in response to Mamdani's win. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. strikes targeted three facilities: Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordo, using massive bunker-buster bombs. While the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated it was "way too early" to know the full damage, Trump maintains that the sites were "totally obliterated."</p>

Republican Senator Susan Collins noted that a significant portion of the funding supports local programming and emergency communications.

The White House argues that the targeted foreign aid programs are "antithetical to American interests" and that federal spending on CPB subsidizes a politically biased system.</p>

Republicans, however, are eager to portray Mamdani's policies as evidence of the Democratic Party's move to the far left.
