          <p>European leaders, hosted by Germany, will meet virtually with Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy to express concerns ahead of Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin. The talks aim to caution Trump against making a deal that compromises Ukraine's interests, as Trump has suggested territorial concessions could end the war. This preemptive diplomatic effort highlights European anxiety over being excluded from the direct US-Russia negotiations. The discussions will focus on increasing pressure on Russia and preparing for potential peace talks.</p>

          <p>Forecasters report that Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic, is on track to become the first hurricane of the season. Early models project the storm will intensify into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands later in the week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, there is considerable uncertainty regarding its long-term path. This development aligns with NOAA's prediction for an above-normal hurricane season with an increased number of named storms.</p>

          <p>China's military announced it warned and "drove away" the USS Higgins, a US destroyer, for allegedly entering its territorial waters near the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The US Seventh Fleet refuted the claim as false, stating the warship was conducting a routine freedom of navigation operation in accordance with international law. The incident occurs amid heightened regional tensions, including recent clashes between Chinese and Filipino vessels in the contested waters where Beijing asserts broad, disputed sovereignty.</p>

In her message, she emphasized that her plea is a humanitarian one, stating she is not taking sides in the war but is focused on preventing children from starving. The call comes as international aid organizations continue to warn of a deepening humanitarian crisis and widespread malnutrition among children in the besieged territory.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's decision, allowing Arkansas's first-in-the-nation ban on gender-affirming medical treatments for minors to be enforced. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited a recent Supreme Court ruling on a similar Tennessee law, agreeing that the ban does not violate equal protection rights. Civil liberties groups condemned the decision as a "tragically unjust result" that harms transgender youth and their families by denying them access to necessary healthcare.</p>

The author suggests Putin will frame the conflict in terms that appeal to Trump's ego and worldview, portraying Ukraine as a corrupt drain on US resources and himself as a reasonable leader. If Trump emerges from the meeting echoing Kremlin talking points, it could fatally undermine Ukraine's position, regardless of any formal agreement.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that any agreements made about his country without its participation will not be effective, speaking ahead of a planned summit between Presidents Trump and Putin. While acknowledging a recent signal from Russia that it may be ready for a ceasefire, Zelenskyy remains firm that Ukraine will not withdraw from the occupied Donbas region. He expressed skepticism about the one-on-one meeting, suggesting its main benefit would be to provide a photo opportunity for the Russian leader.</p>

          <p>In the days following a shooting attack on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Atlanta campus, employees have expressed frustration over a perceived leadership vacuum and poor communication. Staff described an initial all-hands meeting with the new CDC director as "insultingly insufficient" and heavily scripted, lacking clear next steps or emotional support. The incident, viewed by investigators as a targeted attack related to COVID-19, has left staff feeling traumatized and looking for more substantial engagement from the agency's leadership.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has launched a year-long initiative to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans, aiming to boost household spending and support the economy. Under the plan, the government will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on loans for purchases in key areas like automobiles and education. This fiscal policy is designed to lower credit costs for families, unlock their spending potential, and reinforce domestic consumption as a primary driver of China's economic growth.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared that the state will proceed with drawing new, more Democrat-friendly congressional maps after what he termed a missed deadline by President Trump in an ongoing interstate redistricting conflict. Newsom's announcement, made in a mocking, Trump-like social media style, is a direct retaliation to Republican-led efforts in states like Texas to create maps favorable to their party. The move escalates a partisan battle over electoral boundaries, with California aiming to offset perceived Republican gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, reaffirming their nations' friendship and cooperation just days before his scheduled summit with US President Donald Trump. During the call, Putin praised North Korea's military support for Russia's war in Ukraine, where at least 10,000 North Korean soldiers are reportedly fighting. This high-level contact highlights the deepening ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, which have grown stronger amid Russia's increasing diplomatic isolation from the West.</p>

          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprise, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. The offer comes as Google faces a potential court order to divest Chrome following an antitrust ruling that found the company holds an illegal monopoly in the search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that an independent Chrome would benefit user safety and the open web, though the offer is seen by some analysts as a publicity stunt given Chrome's immense value.</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival has doubled in the last 50 years, a new study highlights a growing gap between different types of the disease. Cancers like melanoma now have 10-year survival rates above 90%, thanks to advances in treatment and detection. However, there has been little improvement for some of the deadliest cancers, such as those affecting the pancreas, esophagus, and lungs, which remain difficult to detect and treat. Experts are calling for new government strategies to focus on these less survivable cancers.</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a significant 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% of support among registered city voters, while Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, both running as independents, trail significantly. Mamdani's strength is concentrated among younger voters, while Cuomo performs better with Black and Jewish voters, setting the stage for a complex and ideologically charged election.</p>
