          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Chemotherapy May Accelerate Cancer Metastasis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:00:09 EDT</div>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy could potentially speed up the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings, focused on breast cancer, suggest a mechanism for why some patients experience metastasis in areas like the lungs even after their primary tumors are successfully treated. The research team also discovered that combining chemotherapy with specific drugs could inhibit this detrimental effect in mice. Based on these promising results, a clinical trial involving human breast cancer patients is now underway to explore this potential new treatment strategy.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans whose personal information was leaked in a UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) data breach are not expected to receive financial compensation. The MoD has stated it will "robustly defend" against legal claims from individuals who were not evacuated to Britain but whose lives were put at risk. The leak exposed the details of over 19,000 people who had applied for relocation, causing fear of retribution from the Taliban. An independent review commissioned by the government concluded it was "highly unlikely" that being on the spreadsheet alone would lead to an individual being targeted.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian court has ordered former president Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew amid an investigation into an alleged coup plot. The restrictions are intended to prevent him from fleeing while he stands trial for attempting to overturn the 2023 election results. The case has drawn international attention, with U.S. President Donald Trump calling it a "witch hunt" and threatening tariffs on Brazilian goods. In response, the U.S. has revoked visas for Brazilian judicial officials involved, escalating diplomatic tensions over the prosecution.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning for thunderstorms and torrential rain, with a risk of dangerous flash flooding. The Met Office forecasts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to likely road closures, transport disruption, and power cuts. The severe weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and parched, which increases the likelihood of severe surface water runoff as the soil cannot absorb the sudden downpour. The warning covers a large area including London and the south coast, with yellow warnings in place for other parts of England and Scotland.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the complete elimination of its scientific research division, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). The move is part of a broader agency reorganization and is expected to impact over 1,500 employees, including many leading scientists. The administration states the closure will result in nearly $750 million in savings and is part of an effort to streamline the agency's mission. Critics and former EPA officials argue that dismantling the internationally respected research body is dangerous, shifting public health costs to communities and leaving the nation more vulnerable to pollution.</p>

Originally planned with a 1.65 billion yuan investment, only a fraction was spent, leaving multiple buildings derelict.

          <p>Scientists with the Chinese army have proposed a new 'X-railgun' design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, first mounted on a ship in 2018, is limited by the weight of projectiles it can fire, making it less effective against large targets. The proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit, which would significantly increase bore pressure. According to the project team, this would allow the weapon to fire a 30kg projectile at Mach 7, overcoming a key technological hurdle and enhancing its military application.</p>

A cross-party committee of MPs described the performance as "woeful" and criticized regulators for being "missing in action."

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must adapt its regulations for a future dominated by tokenized assets. Shin Hyun-Song highlighted that the rise of stablecoins presents significant challenges, particularly for anti-money-laundering efforts and customer verification due to their borderless and pseudonymous nature. As private digital currencies gain traction, spurred by the Trump administration's recent embrace of the technology, international regulators are intensifying their scrutiny. The BIS emphasizes the need for a new framework to manage these emerging financial instruments. (not investment advice)</p>

While stating he is not a proponent of masks due to concerns about impersonators, Lyons said he will continue to allow it for the safety of his officers, citing an over 800% increase in attacks against ICE personnel.

Prominent figures who had recently expressed frustration with the administration's handling of the Epstein files are now praising Trump's actions as a victory.

The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa terms, such as not working without authorization or overstaying.

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. According to his White House physician, the condition is benign, common in people over 70, and was confirmed via ultrasound and blood tests, which ruled out more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, have difficulty returning blood to the heart, causing it to pool. Treatment for mild cases typically involves lifestyle changes such as wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs, and regular exercise to improve circulation.</p>

While many people dislike social wasps, experts emphasize their crucial ecological role as apex predators and natural pest controllers in gardens and agricultural landscapes. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them by placing a small amount of a sugary substance away from picnic areas.</p>
