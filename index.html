          <p>Rapper Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, has pleaded not guilty to four felony charges in Los Angeles. The charges include three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting an executive officer. This development follows his arrest last week after he was reportedly seen nearly naked on a Los Angeles street. The 26-year-old artist appeared in Van Nuys Courthouse to enter his plea, with no public comment from him or his representatives on the incident.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store has issued a statement in response to widespread criticism regarding its recent rebranding and new logo. The company acknowledged that it "could've done a better job sharing who we are" and reassured customers that its core values remain unchanged. The new logo, which removed the "Uncle Herschel" character and "old country store" phrase, had been described by social media users as "generic" and "soulless," leading to a 7% drop in company shares. Cracker Barrel clarified that Uncle Herschel will still feature on menus and in stores.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intends to withdraw federal approval for US Wind's offshore wind farm project off the coast of Maryland. A U.S. District Court filing indicated the Interior Department would vacate approval of the facility's construction and operations plan by September 12. This project, owned by funds managed by Apollo Global Management and Renexia SpA, was approved by the Biden administration last year and was expected to power 718,000 homes. The move signals a reversal of policies promoting clean energy technologies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, at the White House, discussing trade and North Korea. Trump lauded his "great relationship" with Kim Jong-un and expressed openness to future meetings, while Lee praised Trump's peacemaking efforts and suggested a "Trump Tower" in North Korea. The meeting followed a recent trade deal capping tariffs on South Korean exports to the U.S. at 15%. However, Trump had earlier posted critical comments on social media about alleged "raids on churches" in South Korea, though he softened his tone during the meeting.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police announced a substantial decrease in serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival compared to previous years. As of Monday evening, 423 arrests were made over two days, with only two stabbings reported, neither resulting in serious injury. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed this improvement to proactive measures, including the use of live facial recognition technology, metal detectors, and stop-and-search operations. Civil liberty groups, however, raised concerns about the reintroduction of facial recognition, calling it a mass surveillance tool.</p>

This strategic move, aiming for 2027 deliveries, targets a mass market segment often overlooked by pricier EVs. While EV sales in the U.S. have slowed, global markets are rapidly adopting electric vehicles, driven by government subsidies and environmental regulations.

          <p>Los Angeles police are investigating a violent incident at a livestreamed wrestling event where Raja Jackson, son of former UFC champion Quinton “Rampage” Jackson, repeatedly punched an opponent, Stuart Smith. Video shows Jackson entering the ring, slamming Smith, and delivering numerous punches, despite the event being supposedly staged. The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed an attempted murder report, with Smith hospitalized in stable condition, suffering facial injuries. Raja's father claimed it was a "work that went wrong" after Smith allegedly hit his son earlier, but event officials stated the attack was unscripted and reprehensible.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated feature "KPop Demon Hunters" saw significant box office success with a two-day theatrical release of its sing-along version, estimated to have generated $16 million to $20 million domestically. While Netflix typically uses theatrical releases for marketing its streaming service rather than for broad cinema runs, this event demonstrates the power of "eventizing" films. The movie has already become Netflix's second-most-watched English language film, and experts believe the theatrical buzz will further boost its streaming viewership. Despite this success, analysts predict it's a one-off and unlikely to alter Netflix's core streaming strategy.</p>

The judge expressed concerns about the government's intention to deport him to a country where he has no ties and questioned the conditioning of constitutional rights on a plea agreement.

It also targets foreign nationals engaged in such activity by revoking visas.

This stability is attributed to consistent new organizing efforts, particularly in the medical industry and at establishments like Starbucks, largely through the Service Employees International Union.
