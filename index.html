        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House East Wing is slated for demolition to make way for President Trump's $300 million ballroom project, a development first reported by The New York Times. The renovation, more extensive than initially announced, involves modernizing the entire East Wing, a move criticized by former First Lady Hillary Clinton. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has voiced concerns about the project's impact on the White House's classical design and called for a pause in demolition until public review processes are completed. The White House defends the project as a necessary addition, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissing the backlash as "fake outrage." The Treasury Department has instructed employees not to share photos of the demolition. Optimism is low given the historical and political implications of this decision.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, on Balkans-based gangs and financiers involved in facilitating small boat crossings across the English Channel. This action comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosts European leaders at a Western Balkans summit to address migration and economic issues. Starmer has pledged to "smash the gangs" responsible for ferrying people across the Channel, where over 35,000 crossings have occurred this year. The sanctions target a Kosovo-based organized crime group producing false documents and a Croatian gang leader supplying false passports. This is seen as an effort to curb irregular migration and address anxieties about the asylum system's effectiveness.</p>

          <h2>Border Patrol Plans Immigration Crackdown in San Francisco Area</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 19:09:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to expand its crackdown on illegal immigration in the San Francisco area, deploying Border Patrol agents to stage at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, known for his involvement in previous controversial immigration raids, is expected to lead the operation. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the administration of creating "conditions for anxiety" in American cities. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie stated local residents would protest peacefully against tactics targeting immigrant communities, while the Department of Homeland Security said it is targeting criminal illegal aliens. The operation reflects an aggressive expansion of deportation efforts across the country.</p>

          <p>The US has imposed new sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine. President Trump stated that conversations with Vladimir Putin were unproductive, leading to the sanctions announcement after shelving a planned meeting with the Russian President. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the need to halt the senseless war, while UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves had already imposed a similar sanctions package. The EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen praised the collective pressure on Russia and announced a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harry Kane's impressive scoring record with Bayern Munich has positioned him as a potential contender for the Ballon d'Or. Despite ranking 13th in September, Kane's recent performance, including 20 goals in 12 club games, has elevated his chances. He acknowledges that winning the Champions League and the World Cup would significantly boost his prospects. Kane's versatility and contributions beyond scoring, as highlighted by Lothar Matthaus, further strengthen his case. While Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe are also in contention, Kane's all-around game may give him an edge.</p>

While the new system showed promise, Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities were exposed early on, and the team has now conceded 18 goals in 13 games this season.

          <p>An 82-year-old Alaskan bush pilot, Kenneth Jouppi, is seeking Supreme Court relief after his $95,000 airplane was forfeited due to transporting three cases of beer into a dry village. Jouppi, an Air Force veteran, was convicted and fined after troopers found the beer hidden in a passenger's luggage. While lower courts initially sided with Jouppi, the Alaska Supreme Court reversed the decision, stating the forfeiture was not grossly disproportional to the offense. The Institute for Justice is assisting Jouppi, arguing the case is about protecting Americans from excessive financial penalties imposed by the government. The case raises questions about the constitutionality of excessive fines.</p>

          <p>The FBI is warning seniors about a tech support scam that resulted in a retired couple in South Carolina losing their entire life savings. The scam began with a pop-up message on the couple's computer, leading them to believe their information had been compromised. The scammers, posing as bank employees, instructed the couple to liquidate cash and purchase gold bars, which were then collected by couriers. The FBI says South Carolinians have lost nearly $10 million this year to similar scams, urging people to be cautious and contact law enforcement if they suspect they are victims.</p>

          <p>While the US President dismisses climate change, China's Xi Jinping unveils strategies to address the issue, aiming to cut emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035. China's policy is to pursue an ambitious transformation of its infrastructure, re-engineering urban landscapes to meet the challenges of a hotter, wetter, and more unpredictable climate. Driven by data showing rising risks of floods, heatwaves, and extreme weather, Chinese policymakers are emphasizing resilience. The transition to green and low-carbon energy is "the trend of the time", Xi said, urging the international community to “stay focused on the right direction”.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for Prince Andrew to give evidence before MPs regarding his lease of Royal Lodge, following increased scrutiny of royal finances. The request comes after a document revealed that Prince Andrew has only ever paid a token annual rent on the property, with large lump sum payments upfront for renovations. Baroness Margaret Hodge has described the Royal Lodge arrangement as "a rotten deal," calling for greater transparency regarding royal finances generally. There is nothing preventing a House of Commons committee from inviting Prince Andrew to give evidence.</p>

Other incidents include Young Republican officials making offensive jokes and an interim U.S. attorney discussing grand-jury matters in texts. The group chat dynamic fosters an eagerness to outdo one's friends, leading to extreme and politically damaging statements.

          <p>The U.S. conducted its eighth strike on an alleged drug vessel, this time in the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the deaths of two individuals, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The vessel was allegedly operated by a "designated terrorist organization" and involved in narco-trafficking, Hegseth said. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly has questioned the legal rationale for these strikes. The Trump administration argues it is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, justifying the attacks as a response to the narcotics they smuggle.

This comes amid debates about whether the US should emulate China's state-led system, which heavily invests in advanced manufacturing and future industries. Gina Raimondo, former commerce secretary, argued that industrial policy is necessary in areas of national security, like the Chips Act, but questioned the competitive advantage of manufacturing all goods in America.
