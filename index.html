          <p>India's foreign ministry has pushed back against U.S. tariff threats over its purchases of discounted Russian oil, arguing the imports are a vital national necessity. The ministry stated that the U.S. had previously encouraged India to buy Russian oil to help stabilize global energy markets after the war in Ukraine began. In its defense, India also pointed out that both the U.S. and the European Union themselves maintain significant trade with Russia, framing the criticism from the West as hypocritical while defending its own energy policies.</p>

          <p>A contentious political battle has erupted as Texas Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a new congressional redistricting map. California Governor Gavin Newsom has sided with the fleeing Democrats, threatening to fight "fire with fire" by pursuing similar partisan measures if the Texas GOP moves forward. This dramatic standoff has paralyzed the Texas legislature and drawn national attention, highlighting the extreme polarization surrounding the redrawing of electoral maps and the potential for retaliatory political actions between states.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deportations under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had allowed for the summary removal of migrants entering the country illegally, but the court ruled that the government cannot ignore other laws that protect individuals from being deported to places where they could face torture or persecution. This directive effectively reopens the U.S. asylum system, which the administration had credited for a steep drop in illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the investigation into alleged ties between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.

This legal escalation could lead to indictments against former officials and re-ignites the highly partisan debate over the legitimacy of the probe.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a Republican redistricting plan told CBS News they are prepared for the consequences of their actions. The legislators defended their quorum break as a necessary tool provided by the Texas Constitution to fight against what they call an egregious and harmful gerrymandering effort by the majority party. They plan to remain out of state for the remainder of the special session, asserting they are fighting for the continuation of representative democracy in Texas.</p>

          <p>A group of progressive Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, led by Congressman Ro Khanna, is circulating a letter urging the Trump administration to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The draft letter argues that the current conflict highlights the long-overdue need for Palestinian self-determination, while also stating that a viable state must recognize Israel and guarantee its security. This initiative comes as some key U.S. allies have also pledged to recognize Palestinian statehood, a move the Trump administration currently opposes.</p>

          <p>Maui firefighters are battling a brush fire that broke out on Monday in the hills above Ka'anapali. The blaze prompted the closure of the Honoapiʻilani Highway as smoke impacted the area and firefighting efforts got underway. The fire's location, just a few miles north of Lahaina, has raised concerns in the community, which is still recovering from the devastating wildfires that destroyed the town and became one of the deadliest in U.S. history nearly two years ago. Officials reported the fire was slowly being contained.</p>

Combs was convicted in July on two prostitution-related charges and faces up to 10 years in prison for each count, though he was acquitted on more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has attributed the stock market's recent rebound to the exceptionally strong earnings performance of the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies. Despite a weaker-than-expected labor report, Cramer argued that the market's resilience is fundamentally driven by the success of giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia. He suggested that these cash-rich companies, which he calls "nation states," have such diverse revenue streams and tight expense controls that they are effectively insulated from broader economic turbulence.
