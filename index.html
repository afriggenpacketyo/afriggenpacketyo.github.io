          <p>The article presents a range of perspectives from UK residents with varying income levels on the government's spending plans for the next four years, covering public services such as the NHS, schools, and public transport. A couple earning £71,000 expressed the need for more support for first-time buyers, while another resident earning £850 a month hoped for better job opportunities for young people. A family earning £52,500 highlighted the need for more help with childcare costs, and a pensioner living on £20,000 emphasized the importance of efficient spending of government money.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking to revoke a Biden administration rule that limited carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, a move projected to significantly increase carbon emissions and harmful air pollutants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin argued the Biden-era rules were stifling the economy, while former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy criticized the rollback as illogical and indefensible. The EPA also plans to loosen updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, despite evidence showing its effectiveness in reducing mercury emissions from power plants. Environmental groups are preparing to sue the EPA over these rollbacks, citing potential health and economic consequences.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's spending bill, highlighting the potential for a significant increase in the US deficit and its disproportionate benefits for the wealthy. The bill includes extensions of Trump's tax cuts, increased spending on immigration enforcement and defense, and cuts to Medicaid benefits. Concerns are raised about the rising national debt and its potential economic consequences, as well as the impact on healthcare coverage, with millions potentially becoming uninsured due to the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits for ACA insurance plans and new work requirements for Medicaid. The bill's provisions targeting immigrants, including a new tax on remittances, are also discussed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of sexual assault in a New York retrial, adding to his existing 16-year sentence for sex crimes in Los Angeles. The jury found him guilty of assaulting Miriam Haley but not guilty of assaulting Kaja Sokola, and they are set to continue deliberations on a charge of sexual assault involving Jessica Mann. The retrial centered on the testimonies of Haley, Mann, and Sokola, who accused Weinstein of using his power in the entertainment industry to sexually abuse them. The verdict follows an appeals court overturning Weinstein's previous conviction due to the inclusion of testimony from women beyond the specific charges.</p>

          <p>An estimated $1.4 trillion is paid annually in rent in America, yet only 20% of landlords report these payments to credit bureaus, limiting renters' ability to build credit. This financial inequity disproportionately affects minorities and immigrants, who are more likely to be "credit invisible." Esusu, a credit score reporting service, is partnering with rental companies and offering a direct line for renters to report their rent payments, aiming to democratize access to credit and boost credit scores for millions.

          <p>Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey has been indicted on three charges of assaulting federal law enforcement officers during a clash outside a Newark ICE detention center.

McIver has denied the charges, calling the indictment "a brazen attempt at political intimidation" by the Trump administration.

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's deployment of the military to enforce federal immigration laws, labeling it a "crass political stunt endangering American lives." DOJ lawyers argued that Newsom's request for a temporary restraining order would countermand the Commander in Chief's military directives and grant a "rioters' veto to enforcement of federal law." Newsom argued that Trump failed to meet the legal requirements for a federal deployment of the National Guard, as there is no "rebellion or danger of a rebellion" in Los Angeles.</p>

Despite this, many of the tailwinds that have propelled gold prices remain, including geopolitical and economic uncertainty.

          <p>The American Bar Association (ABA) has criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi's decision to exclude the organization from the judicial nomination process, calling it "deeply disturbing." The ABA has rated potential judges for decades, but Bondi accused the organization of favoring Democratic nominees and refusing to fix bias in its ratings. The ABA defended its impartiality, noting it rated all three of President Trump's Supreme Court nominees as "well qualified." The decision is part of a broader legal fight between Republicans and the ABA over allegations of bias, particularly related to abortion access, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the LGBTQ agenda.</p>

This offer is available to any player ranked in the world's top 750 who spends more than 10 weeks out of competition. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, praised the rule, saying it will reduce the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly after the procedure.

          <p>Elon Musk has expressed regret over some of his recent social media posts about President Donald Trump, stating that they "went too far." The comments follow a public dispute between Musk and Trump over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk opposed, claiming it would increase the U.S. budget deficit. The feud had dissolved a close partnership that had propelled Musk to spearhead the budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency. Musk's expression of regret suggests a potential effort to mend relations with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>This article examines the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the US economy, noting that companies are paying billions more to bring goods into the country. The Treasury collected a record $22 billion in tariff payments in May. While Trump argues that tariffs can generate income for the government and encourage domestic manufacturing, the article suggests that companies may soon pass these extra costs on to consumers. House Republicans have argued that tariff revenue will offset losses from their tax and spending bill, but the Congressional Budget Office projects that the proposed tax cuts would lead to revenue losses, even taking into account tariff revenues.

Capital expenditure on transport is going up by 3.9%, with long-term investment in infrastructure, but the department's annual day-to-day budget will decrease by 5%.
