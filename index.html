          <p>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared a strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal, ordering them to immediately return to work. The union had defied a previous back-to-work order, continuing a work stoppage that has disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers during the peak summer season. The dispute centers on disagreements over pay and working conditions, with both sides remaining far apart despite months of negotiations. The government has urged a swift resolution to mitigate the widespread travel chaos.</p>

          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been formally charged with 32 offenses, including four counts of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and multiple acts of violence.

Hoiby's lawyer has indicated he denies the most serious charges but plans to plead guilty to lesser offenses.</p>

          <p>In response to political pressure to lower medication costs, Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to cash-paying U.S. patients. This price is less than half the drug's monthly list price, making it more accessible for those without insurance coverage. The move aims to increase patient access and combat the use of potentially unsafe, unapproved compounded alternatives that have grown in popularity. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The comprehensive, two-stage plan reportedly involves a 60-day temporary truce during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages. In exchange, negotiations would commence for a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. There has been no immediate official comment from Israeli authorities on the reported agreement.</p>

          <p>An article by a research associate at a Chinese think tank critiques Donald Trump's style of international mediation, describing it as a heavy-handed, power-politics approach. The analysis suggests that while Trump's high-profile interventions can force conflicting parties into temporary ceasefire agreements, they often fail to address the deep-rooted historical grievances underlying the disputes. This method, the article argues, disrespects historical context and lacks the strategic patience needed for long-term resolution, potentially creating future friction.</p>

          <h2>Documentary Filmmakers Face Funding Crisis After Federal Support Is Eliminated</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. documentary film community is facing a severe funding shortfall following the elimination of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's budget and cuts at the National Endowments for the Humanities and the Arts. These changes have removed critical financial support for independent filmmakers, forcing them to seek alternative funding through international sources, private foundations, and streaming platforms. This shift raises concerns about the future of diverse storytelling and equitable access for audiences who rely on public media, particularly in underserved communities.</p>

          <p>A policy analysis suggests the only plausible path to a lasting peace in Ukraine involves strengthening its military capabilities to a point where Russia is convinced it cannot make further gains. The article examines the complexities of proposed territorial swaps and security guarantees, arguing that Russia's core demands for Ukrainian demilitarization remain the primary obstacle. It cautions that without a credible national defense backed by the West, any diplomatic agreement is likely to be a ruse by Moscow to buy time and weaken American resolve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The debate over ending the war in Ukraine centers on potential territorial concessions, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which Russia demands in their entirety. Ukraine's constitution, however, declares its borders indivisible and inviolable, creating a legal impasse, while Russia has already amended its own constitution to claim the annexed territories. Analysts warn that ceding the Donbas would force Ukraine to abandon its most critical defensive lines, leaving it vulnerable to future attacks without any guarantee of lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to President Donald Trump, has strongly criticized India for its continued purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling the practice as "opportunistic." In an op-ed, Navarro argued that India is undermining international sanctions against Moscow and must act like a strategic partner to the U.S. if it wishes to be treated as one. His comments highlight growing trade tensions, as the Trump administration has already threatened to impose additional tariffs on India over its energy trade with Russia.</p>
