          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of over 40,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean as part of its enhanced counter-drug initiative, Operation Pacific Viper. The operations, which occurred over the last month, also resulted in the apprehension of 36 suspected smugglers. The agency released images from the interceptions, including one of a burning vessel, highlighting its efforts to disrupt narcotics transport from South America. These actions are part of a broader U.S. military and law enforcement push to combat drug trafficking in both the Pacific and the Caribbean.</p>

The suspects, Jalen Lucas and Kelvin Thomas Jr., will be charged as adults with first-degree murder, while a search continues for a third juvenile suspect. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro stated that Tarpinian-Jachym was an innocent bystander and used the announcement to criticize the D.C. City Council's policies on juvenile crime.

          <p>A controversial Texas law that limits property ownership and leasing rights for Chinese citizens has officially gone into effect, leaving affected individuals in legal uncertainty. Plaintiffs who challenged the law are appealing an overturned decision, with the earliest potential relief not expected until November. This legislation is part of a broader trend, with over two dozen other states considering or having passed similar laws restricting foreign real estate purchases. The move reflects escalating U.S.-China tensions influencing state-level politics, with concerns expanding from agricultural land to broader property ownership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its military campaign against Caribbean drug cartels by deploying ten F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico. This move follows a recent deadly U.S. missile strike on a boat alleged to be carrying Venezuelan drug traffickers. The deployment is seen as a significant increase in military pressure in the region, particularly towards Venezuela, which the U.S. accuses of leading drug-trafficking operations. The action has drawn criticism from some lawmakers, including Rep. Ilhan Omar and Sen. Rand Paul, who have questioned its legality and potential for unintended consequences.</p>

          <p>A new photograph captured by the International Gemini Observatory in Chile shows the expanding tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The image reveals that the comet's coma and tail have grown significantly, indicating it has become more active as it approaches the sun. Scientists are using these observations to study the comet's composition and chemistry, which could provide insights into its origins from another star system. The comet poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October.</p>

          <p>A congressional investigation by House Republicans has found that the Pentagon funded hundreds of research projects in collaboration with Chinese universities and institutes, some of which are linked to China's military. The report, from the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues that these partnerships have allowed China to leverage U.S. taxpayer-funded research for its own military advancement. This occurs amid a fierce technological and strategic rivalry between the two nations. The report warns that failing to protect American research from foreign exploitation risks undermining U.S. technological dominance and national security.</p>

For a median-priced home, the lower rate could save a borrower nearly $170 per month.

While acknowledging the Epstein connection is a real political problem for Trump, the author suggests that constantly crying "distraction" is an ineffective opposition message.

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, massive compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $1 trillion over ten years. The plan would award Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion and mass-producing humanoid robots and robotaxis. The board argues the award is necessary to retain and incentivize Musk through a pivotal growth period. This proposal follows a Delaware judge's decision to revoke his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 after a shareholder lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency federal operation at a Hyundai electric vehicle facility construction site in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 people suspected of working in the U.S. illegally. Officials from Homeland Security Investigations described it as the largest single-site enforcement operation in the agency's history, targeting alleged unlawful employment practices. The majority of those detained were Korean nationals, prompting South Korea's foreign ministry to express concern over potential rights infringements. The raid is part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigration and has been criticized by labor groups.</p>

The new album continues in a similar musical vein, featuring indie rock and '80s R&B influences over which Bieber lays his signature vocals. The project was created with many of the same producers as its predecessor and includes guest appearances from artists like Tems, Lil B, and Hurricane Chris. Thematically, the album focuses on Bieber's experiences with marriage, fatherhood, and religion, continuing the personal tone established in the first "Swag" installment.</p>

The decision is part of several changes to England's white-ball teams, which also see opener Ben Duckett rested and all-rounder Sam Curran recalled.

The loans, backed by ships intended for scrap, soured after Yieldstreet lost track of the collateral and accused the borrower of fraud.

The U.S. Treasury Department took this action because the groups had requested that the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigate alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the sanctions were for engaging with the ICC's efforts to prosecute Israeli nationals without Israel's consent. The sanctioned groups condemned the move as "immoral, illegal and undemocratic," as it will hamper their ability to document rights abuses.</p>

Experts suggest that portfolios may be overly concentrated in a few mega-cap tech stocks, which now constitute nearly 40% of the S&P 500 index.

After a pandemic-fueled surge, the sector is now expected to see nearly flat growth for the remainder of the year. While a rebound is projected for 2026, the slowdown marks a major shift for what was recently commercial real estate's strongest asset class. (not investment advice)</p>
