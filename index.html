          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 21:42:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports increased by 4.2% year-on-year in September, ending a four-month decline, primarily driven by strong growth in shipments to Asia, especially China. This rebound occurred despite a 13.3% drop in exports to the U.S., notably a 24.2% fall in auto shipments, even after a new trade deal reduced tariffs. The country's economy also saw an upward revision in Q2 GDP, and the new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's policies are expected to further boost exports by weakening the yen.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw declines as investors processed Japan's September trade data and the implications of its new government. Although Japan's overall exports showed a 4.2% year-on-year increase, they fell short of the 4.6% rise anticipated by economists. The Nikkei 225 index experienced significant losses, with SoftBank shares plummeting over 10%. This market volatility underscores investor caution amidst new economic figures and political leadership changes. (not investment advice)</p>

These messages, published by Politico, included claims of having "a Nazi streak" and referring to Martin Luther King Jr. as "the 1960s George Floyd." The allegations led to bipartisan blowback and a lack of sufficient Republican votes for his confirmation, prompting his withdrawal from the Senate hearing.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit against President Donald Trump and the D.C. National Guard reveals that the deployment of Guardsmen in Washington, D.C., could be extended until summer 2026, coinciding with America's 250th anniversary. Federal officials are reportedly planning for a "long-term persistent presence," despite the current mission ending in November. The District of Columbia's attorney general alleges that the federalization of the Guard violates the U.S. Constitution by overriding local authority and state governors' command over their troops.</p>

          <p>Six individuals were arrested in Dublin after a violent protest erupted outside the Citywest Hotel, which houses asylum seekers. Protesters attacked Irish police with bricks, fireworks, and glass bottles, and set a police vehicle on fire. Gardaí deployed riot police, a water cannon, and mounted units to control the crowd, which attempted to breach the cordon using horse-drawn carts. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin and Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan condemned the "thuggery" and attacks on officers, emphasizing that such violence is unacceptable.</p>

Her presence could provide the crucial 218th signature needed for a vote, making her swearing-in a significant political maneuver with implications for government transparency.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Donald Trump's strong control over his administration, particularly his ability to rein in China hawks, could paradoxically act as a "guard rail" in fraught US-China relations. Despite ongoing trade tensions and threats of tariffs, Trump has shown restraint in antagonizing President Xi Jinping or challenging Beijing's red lines. This approach means leader-to-leader diplomacy gains heightened importance, as Trump "calls the shots," potentially offering a unique stabilizing force amid structural competition between the two global powers.</p>

Trump had advocated freezing the conflict at its current battle lines, a proposal rejected by Russia, which insists on addressing the "root causes" and Ukrainian demilitarization, making a productive summit unlikely.</p>
