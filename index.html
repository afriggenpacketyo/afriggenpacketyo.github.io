        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine conducted a large-scale drone operation targeting four Russian military airfields, reportedly destroying over 40 military aircraft, an effort allegedly supervised by President Zelenskyy and planned over a year and a half. The attacks utilized drones concealed in mobile containers transported by trucks deep into Russian territory, reaching as far as the Belaya air base in the Irkutsk region. Simultaneously, explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia, with officials investigating the cause of the blasts. These events unfolded as Ukraine announced plans to resume ceasefire talks with Russia in Istanbul, focusing on a complete ceasefire and the return of prisoners and abducted children. The optimism score reflects the ongoing conflict and uncertain prospects for peace. </p>

          <p>Investors are showing a strong preference for short-term Treasury investments, mirroring a strategy also adopted by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.

Experts suggest that long-duration investments are currently less appealing due to market uncertainty, while short-term T-Bills offer attractive annualized yields. Berkshire Hathaway has doubled its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential runoff election featuring Rafal Trzaskowski, a pro-European liberal backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's Civic Coalition, and Karol Nawrocki, a staunch nationalist endorsed by outgoing President Andrzej Duda. Trzaskowski advocates for softening abortion restrictions and protecting LGBTQ rights, while Nawrocki champions traditional Polish values and stricter immigration controls. The outcome of the election could significantly impact Poland's political direction, with a Trzaskowski victory potentially enabling Tusk's reformist agenda and a Nawrocki win bolstering the opposition Law and Justice party.

The book paints a picture of Jill Biden as an intensely loyal and protective force, but also one who faced criticism for allegedly covering up her husband's cognitive issues. </p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain (PSG) secured their first Champions League title, defeating Inter Milan 5-0, leading to celebrations and discussions about the competition's structure. Despite the win, PSG's high expenditure raises questions about financial fairness, as the club has spent billions on transfers since being acquired by Qatar Sports Investments. The victory also reignites the debate about whether the new Champions League format is essentially a European Super League in disguise. The optimism score is moderate, balancing the excitement of PSG's win with concerns about financial disparities in football.</p>
