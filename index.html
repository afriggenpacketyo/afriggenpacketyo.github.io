Al-Sheikh, a prominent figure in the Fatah movement, is now the frontrunner to succeed Abbas, though the appointment is unlikely to improve Fatah's image among Palestinians.</p>

It clarifies that identifying as trans does not change a person's sex under the Equality Act, but also notes that exclusions must be made on a case-by-case basis and alternative facilities should be available.</p>

          <p>Charles Burnett's "Killer of Sheep," a landmark film of American neorealism, has been restored in 4K, offering a complete version with previously uncleared music. The film portrays the life of Stan, a Watts-dwelling slaughterhouse worker, and his family, focusing on their struggles and resilience. Burnett's approach avoids stereotypes, presenting a nuanced depiction of ordinary Black life in 1970s Los Angeles. The film's understated beauty and soulful soundtrack create a powerful commentary on inequality and the human spirit.</p>
