          <p>Uber is set to acquire an 85% stake in Trendyol GO, a Turkish food delivery platform, for approximately $700 million in cash, pending regulatory approval and expected to close in the second half of the year.

Trendyol GO, founded in 2010 and majority-owned by Alibaba, facilitated over 200 million orders in 2024, generating $2 billion in gross bookings, marking a 50% year-over-year increase. This acquisition underscores Uber's commitment to the Turkish market and its confidence in Trendyol GO's team and growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump at the White House, marking their first encounter since Carney assumed office in March, against a backdrop of strained U.S.-Canada relations due to tariffs and comments about Canada becoming the 51st state. Carney has pledged to stand firm against the U.S. president and fundamentally reimagine Canada's economy in light of Trump's tariff regime. Trump has imposed a 25% import tariff on Canadian goods, citing concerns about fentanyl and migrants entering the U.S., leading to retaliatory tariffs from Canada. Carney has stated that Canada will only engage in trade and security talks with the Trump administration on their own terms, and he dismissed any discussions about Canadian statehood.</p>

          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a 13% drop despite the data analytics and AI software company reporting ongoing revenue growth acceleration. Analysts raised concerns about the modest full-year revenue guidance raise, sequential margin decline, and year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue, with one analyst noting that the company's high software multiple makes it vulnerable as revenue growth slows. Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and raised its revenue guidance for the year, posting adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues, a 39% increase from the previous year. CEO Alex Karp remains optimistic, highlighting the company's 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S. as drivers of growth.</p>

Thom Tillis, a key Republican senator, has announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, potentially jeopardizing Martin's confirmation chances. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot cases, which were prosecuted by the D.C. Attorney's Office. With Tillis's opposition, Martin's nomination is unlikely to be reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Republicans and Democrats are evenly split. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term will expire on May 20.</p>

Equipment outages, staffing levels in Philadelphia (where Newark's airspace is overseen), and runway rehabilitation work are contributing factors. United Airlines has canceled 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule, and lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the FAA and the ongoing issues, with the Transportation Secretary promising a plan to revamp the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>A late payment can significantly impact your credit score, affecting loan rates, apartment rentals, and job opportunities. To mitigate this, you can request a goodwill adjustment from the creditor, dispute inaccuracies with credit bureaus, or negotiate a "pay for delete" agreement. If these methods fail, the late payment will remain on your credit report for up to seven years, though its impact lessens over time. Consistent on-time payments after the late mark can help your credit recover faster. (not investment advice)</p>

Many American retailers rushed to import inventory ahead of President Trump's levies, but imports have since slowed sharply. Experts warn that the decline in trade activity could lead to COVID-19 pandemic-like shortages of products, including goods assembled in the U.S. that use materials from China. Products at risk of becoming scarce include toys, down feathers, textiles, footwear, cutlery, glassware, furniture, and apparel.</p>

          <p>A small boat capsized off the coast near San Diego, California, resulting in three deaths and at least seven people missing. The panga-style fishing boat had at least 16 people on board, including two children. Authorities are treating the incident as a suspected case of human smuggling, with Indian passports found near the site. The U.S. Coast Guard has suspended its search for the missing individuals. Panga boats are commonly used by smugglers, and officials believe the individuals on board were migrants.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a $7.5 billion tax credit program and offered to work with President Trump to boost U.S. film production, after Trump threatened tariffs on films made abroad. Newsom stated that California is "eager to partner with the Trump administration to further strengthen domestic production and Make America Film Again." The initiative was triggered after Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the U.S. film industry was "dying" and unveiled plans for tariffs on overseas-made productions. Jon Voight, Trump's "special ambassador" to Hollywood, also discussed a federal policy with tax incentives to encourage studios to conduct more production work in the U.S.</p>

The deal, expected to increase bilateral trade by $34 billion, involves India reducing tariffs on goods from Britain, including whiskey and cars, while Britain reduces tariffs on clothes, footwear, and food products from India. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a "new era for trade and the economy," emphasizing closer alliances and reduced trade barriers.

The body of 89-year-old Robert Markel was found near the unincorporated community of Jerome, close to Florida’s Big Cypress wildlife management area. Markel’s daughter reported witnessing a bear killing his dog, and Markel’s body was found nearby. The Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC) has recorded 43 human-bear encounters in Florida since 2006, almost all involving a dog. Florida has more than 4,000 black bears.</p>

Acting President Claire Shipman announced the cuts, representing about 20% of individuals funded by the terminated grants, and said the university is pursuing alternative funding sources.

The initial setback raised questions about his ability to wrangle lawmakers and address domestic and international crises, particularly amidst the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).

          <p>The Trump administration is offering a $1,000 incentive to migrants who "self-deport" using the CBP Home App, previously used to seek asylum. The Homeland Security Department is pitching this monetary incentive as a more cost-effective and "dignified" way to leave the country, estimating the average cost of arresting, detaining, and removing someone without legal status amounts to around $17,121. Immigration enforcement officials have noted that detention capacity is maxed out and the administration is seeking to streamline removals. Immigrant advocates are skeptical, stating that most migrants don't believe they will receive the incentive or eventually be able to apply for legal status.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups are petitioning the Trump administration to enforce federal regulations that curb wasteful water use in the Colorado River basin, citing chronic water shortages. The petition focuses on agriculture, which accounts for about three-fourths of water diversions from the Colorado River, and suggests reducing flood-irrigating practices and limiting the export of water-intensive crops. The groups also propose addressing wasteful water use in cities and industries, such as watering ornamental grass and using inefficient industrial processes. The Colorado River provides water for cities from Denver to Los Angeles, 30 Native tribes, and farming communities from the Rocky Mountains to northern Mexico.</p>
