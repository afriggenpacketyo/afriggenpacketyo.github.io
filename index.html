          <p>Morgan Stanley is preparing to launch direct crypto trading for its retail clients through the E-Trade division by the first half of 2026. This move signifies a major embrace of digital assets by a Wall Street giant, partnering with startup Zerohash for liquidity and custody. The firm views this offering, initially including Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana, as just the beginning of integrating traditional and digital assets within wealth management. This strategic shift follows a more favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump, positioning Morgan Stanley as a leader in crypto adoption among big banks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, citing their "unserious and ridiculous demands" for government funding. The cancellation occurred just days before a federal government shutdown deadline, with Democrats pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. Trump accused Democrats of seeking to fund "Radical Left Views and Policies," while Jeffries criticized Trump for "chickening out" and the extremists for wanting a shutdown. The impasse highlights deep partisan divisions over spending and policy priorities, creating uncertainty for the nation's financial stability.</p>

This poignant visit, following a previous engagement by the Princess after chemotherapy, underscored royal commitment to communities facing immense grief.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" temporarily increased the federal deduction limit for state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for 2025. This change, which benefits taxpayers who itemize deductions and begins to phase out for higher earners, is projected to offer substantial savings. A Redfin report indicates New York, California, and New Jersey residents could see the largest median tax benefits, while states like South Dakota and Alaska would experience the smallest. The article provides a detailed breakdown of potential savings across different states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority temporarily lifted restrictions on "roving" immigration patrols in the Los Angeles area, overturning a lower court's finding of indiscriminate targeting based on race. Immigration advocates warn this decision effectively legalizes racial profiling and could undermine civil rights protections nationwide. The ruling has prompted some US citizens of color to alter daily routines, fearing detention and choosing not to speak languages other than English in public. This article invites people of color to share their feelings on being targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs, initially 25% and then doubled to 50%, have severely impacted India's shrimp export industry, which previously supplied about 40% of US demand. The tariffs, imposed to penalize India for purchasing Russian oil, have halted shipments and caused a drastic drop in farm sales, threatening the livelihoods of over a million Indian workers and small farmers. Many processing plants have curtailed hours or closed, leaving workers like Sita struggling to survive.

          <p>Despite current mortgage rates being higher than in previous years, experts offer four key strategies for homebuyers and refinancers to find lower rates this October. These include comparing multiple lenders, as rates vary significantly, and focusing on improving one's credit score, which can substantially reduce rates on conventional loans. Borrowers should also consider adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or shorter-term loans, which often start with lower rates, and evaluate buying mortgage points if they plan to stay in the home long enough to recoup the upfront cost. Thorough research and comparison are crucial for navigating the market effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a robust first half of the year, single-family home rent growth began to slow in July, increasing just 2.3% year-over-year, below the 3.1% average a year prior. This moderation, with monthly gains also falling below historical averages, suggests landlords may need to adjust to struggling consumers. While markets like Chicago and New York City still lead in rent growth, others like Miami have seen no growth. The article notes a weakening across all price points, indicating a broader trend that could impact single-family rental REITs, despite their efforts to build more rental communities.

          <p>Palestinians in the West Bank express apprehension that Western recognition of Palestinian statehood, recently announced by several European nations at the UN General Assembly, is insufficient without concrete solutions. Residents of Ramallah emphasize the need for international pressure to secure their rights, fearing recognition alone will be "nothing more than ink on paper." Israeli Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vehemently rejected the idea of a Palestinian state, with ultranationalists calling for annexation of the West Bank. The article highlights the immense devastation in Gaza and the continued expansion of Israeli settlements, further fragmenting the possibility of a viable Palestinian state.</p>

One asylum seeker earned as little as £20 a day illegally to repay people smugglers.

This regulation requires proof that palm oil did not originate from recently deforested areas, posing a significant challenge for smallholders who control over 42% of plantations.

A federal judge already ruled that Amazon violated consumer protection laws by gathering billing information before disclosing Prime terms.
