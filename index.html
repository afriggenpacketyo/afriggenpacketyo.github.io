          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind energy projects across the United States. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the funds were wasteful and would be repurposed for upgrading ports and other maritime infrastructure. This action is part of a broader campaign against renewable energy, which recently included halting work on a nearly completed project off the New England coast. Industry executives warn these moves could lead to increased power prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>The government of Guinea-Bissau has blocked several Portuguese public broadcasters and a news agency, escalating concerns about press freedom three months before national elections. The head of the country's journalists' union described an atmosphere of growing fear, with reporters being systematically obstructed and insulted since President Umaro Sissoco Embalo took power. International organizations like Reporters Without Borders have condemned the move as a severe blow to democracy, suggesting the authorities intend to control election coverage. The opposition fears this is a prelude to electoral manipulation.</p>

          <p>Tanzania is preparing for elections with incumbent President Samia Suluhu Hassan promising constitutional reform and national reconciliation. However, the political landscape is fraught with tension as key opposition figures face legal challenges, disqualification, or imprisonment, leading to accusations of a state-sponsored crackdown. Several opposition parties have been disqualified or are boycotting the vote, citing the need for electoral reforms. Despite these issues and reports of attacks on government critics, some analysts observe improvements in the electoral system compared to previous years.</p>

          <p>Louisiana health officials have confirmed that two individuals have died after consuming raw oysters contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacteria. The bacteria thrives in warm coastal waters and can cause life-threatening infections through contaminated seafood or exposure of open wounds to seawater. The state has recorded 22 infections and a total of four deaths this year, a significant increase from the historical average. Health authorities are cautioning the public about the risks associated with eating raw or undercooked seafood, particularly during warmer months.</p>

          <p>A report from Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica, supported by the UN, reveals that over 14,000 migrants, primarily Venezuelans, have reversed their journey northward due to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies. This "reverse flow" migration highlights a significant 97% drop in northward travel, with most returnees citing the inability to legally reach the U.S. as their reason for turning back. These individuals face renewed vulnerability on their journey south, often with depleted funds and at risk of exploitation by criminal groups in dangerous regions.

          <p>Following the finalization of their divorce, Josh Hall, the ex-husband of HGTV star Christina Haack, posted a critical message on social media. He expressed relief at being a "free man" and advised against marrying someone who requires constant public validation. The divorce settlement details that neither party will receive spousal support, with Haack retaining her real estate properties and Hall keeping several vehicles. The couple, who married in 2021, had a contentious separation, with Haack previously stating she would have gotten a prenuptial agreement if she had understood the repercussions.</p>

          <p>A growing number of families are selling off large, historic "trophy" ranches that have been in their possession for generations, often due to disagreements among heirs or a lack of interest from the next generation. High-end brokers report a surge in listings for these sprawling properties, fueled by wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, a trend amplified by the "Yellowstone" effect. Properties like the 7,600-acre Reynolds Ranch in California and the 40,000-acre Antlers Ranch in Wyoming are now on the market for the first time in decades.

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to unilaterally cancel nearly $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid by employing a "pocket rescission," a rarely used budgetary tool. The action, which targets funds for the State Department and USAID, allows the president to withhold the money late in the fiscal year, effectively letting it expire before Congress can act. The move has drawn immediate bipartisan criticism, with Republican Senator Susan Collins, chair of the Appropriations Committee, calling it an "unlawful" violation of Congress's constitutional power of the purse. This escalation raises concerns about future budget negotiations and the potential for a government shutdown.</p>

The case raises significant questions about the president's authority to remove a Fed governor, a move that could shift the majority on the interest-rate-setting board.

          <p>Matt Wright, the star of several crocodile-themed reality shows, has been convicted by an Australian jury of lying to police and attempting to falsify records following a fatal 2022 helicopter crash. The crash killed his co-star, Chris Wilson, who was collecting crocodile eggs while dangling from the helicopter. Wright was found guilty of providing a false statement about the aircraft's fuel level and encouraging the injured pilot to alter flight records. The jury could not reach a verdict on a third charge related to destroying maintenance records, and Wright is currently out on bail pending an appeal.</p>

          <p>Mass protests and clashes with police have broken out in major Indonesian cities after a 21-year-old ride-sharing driver, Affan Kurniawan, was killed by a police vehicle during a demonstration. The initial protests were focused on cost-of-living issues and housing perks for politicians, but his death has now become a focal point for public anger. Police have used tear gas and water cannons against demonstrators, who have responded by throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. President Prabowo Subianto has apologized to the victim's family, and seven police officers have been cited for ethics violations.</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, showed that the annual inflation rate remained at 2.6% in July, consistent with the previous month. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose slightly to 2.9% from 2.8%, its highest level since February. The report also indicated robust consumer spending, which increased by 0.5%, suggesting economic resilience despite uncertainty. These figures may make Fed officials cautious about cutting interest rates, as inflation remains above their 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders before the transfer window closes, a move that would likely facilitate the sale of Marc Guehi to Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million transfer for the England defender, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace. While manager Oliver Glasner publicly insists Guehi must stay, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. Palace is reportedly in advanced talks for Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and is also pursuing an experienced defender.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Marvell Technology's stock fell sharply after the company's second-quarter data center revenue missed analyst estimates and it provided a lackluster forecast for the current quarter. While overall revenue grew 58% year-over-year, driven by AI demand, sales in the key data center segment were slightly below projections. The company expects data center revenue to be flat in the third quarter, attributing it to the "lumpiness" of custom AI chip orders from large clients. This guidance concerned investors, leading to a stock downgrade from Bank of America over uncertainty about near-term AI growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

According to survivors, the vessel overturned when passengers moved to one side after spotting coastal lights. Seventeen people have been rescued, but many more remain missing as coastguard search efforts continue. This tragedy highlights the extreme dangers faced by migrants attempting to reach Europe.</p>

The list guides government investment priorities, such as tax incentives and streamlined permitting for domestic mining and material recovery projects. The selection is based on identifying minerals where supply disruptions would pose the greatest risk to the U.S. economy and national security.</p>

Currently, these visas are typically valid for the duration of a program or employment, but the new rule would set specific end dates, such as a four-year maximum for students. Visa holders would then be required to apply for extensions to continue their stay in the U.S. The administration stated the change is necessary for better monitoring and oversight, but it is seen as part of a broader effort to create new hurdles for legal immigration.</p>
