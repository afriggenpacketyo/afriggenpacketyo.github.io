            <p>The United States and Iran recently concluded the first round of nuclear talks in Oman, marking the highest-level meeting between the two nations since 2018. Both countries characterized the initial discussions as "constructive," with plans for a second round next week. The US emphasized that direct communication is crucial for reaching a potential agreement. These talks are considered a vital first step in determining the possibility of a deal, especially given the US withdrawal from the previous nuclear agreement in 2018. The discussions aim to address Iran's nuclear program and regional tensions, potentially including prisoner exchanges.</p>

            <p>Israel has announced the completion of a new security corridor in the Gaza Strip, giving its military control over Rafah and effectively cutting off the city from the rest of Palestinian territory. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that the IDF will expand operations to additional locations throughout Gaza, urging residents to evacuate fighting zones. The IDF claims to have eliminated dozens of terrorists, dismantled tunnel routes, and completed the encirclement of Rafah. Katz reiterated support for the forced expulsion of Palestinians and said they are working towards making it possible for Palestinians in Gaza to "voluntarily move to various countries around the world."</p>

            <p>Dive teams are actively searching the Hudson River for remaining wreckage from a fatal helicopter crash that occurred after takeoff from New York City, which resulted in the death of all six people on board. Authorities are trying to recover the main rotor, main transmission, roof structure, and tail structure. Aviation experts believe finding the main rotor is crucial to determining the cause of the crash, as it could reveal whether parts sheared away before impact. Preliminary investigations suggest possible causes including bird strikes, drone interference, or mechanical failure, but the NTSB has refrained from speculation.</p>

            <p>Al Hurra, a U.S.-funded Arabic-language television and online news outlet, has terminated most of its staff and TV programming due to funding cuts. Chief Jeffrey Gedmin accused the Trump administration and Elon Musk of "irresponsibly and unlawfully" withholding congressionally approved funds. Gedmin claimed that Kari Lake, a Trump appointee overseeing Al Hurra, avoided discussing the funding cutoff. Al Hurra is the latest U.S. government-funded news outlet to face staff and service reductions amid concerns over withheld appropriations.

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing panic buying and paralysis among US consumers, with households facing potential price increases and shortages. The latest tariffs include a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on goods from China, leading to fears of soaring prices for clothing, electronics, and toys. Some retailers have begun introducing tariff surcharges, while others are canceling shipments from China. Economists predict a slowdown in consumer spending and potential recession due to the increased costs. Consumers are responding with stock-up behavior, but also expressing anxiety about the economy and future price rises.</p>

However, other tariffs may still apply to these products, as the exemptions only cover Trump's most recent tariffs.

The footprints, preserved in rocks dating back to the Jurassic period, belong to a theropod dinosaur previously unreported in Sardinia.

The rocky surface also provided evidence of other coeval species, marking the first evidence of dinosaurs in the Mesozoic period in Sardinia.</p>

The case is seen as an attempt to silence dissent and mobilize fear to regulate opinion, setting a dangerous precedent for future restrictions on free speech.

            <p>A U.S. missionary pastor, Josh Sullivan, was abducted at gunpoint from his church in South Africa while delivering a sermon. The abduction is suspected to be a kidnapping for ransom, a growing issue in South Africa. Sullivan was holding a prayer meeting with about 30 people, including his wife and six children, when the armed kidnappers entered. Police are investigating, and the U.S. State Department is aware of the incident. Sullivan's wife has released a statement thanking people for the outpouring of love and prayers.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration plans to release new documents related to Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination. The release is supported by President Trump and RFK's son, Robert F.

Many files on the assassination are already public through the California state archive and the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. Some hope the federal government may hold documents shedding new light on the event, particularly regarding CIA communications with the Los Angeles Police Department during the investigation.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of passengers were forced to stay on planes overnight after two international flights were diverted to an airport in Alabama that lacked customs facilities. The Delta flights, originating from Mexico, were redirected to Montgomery Regional Airport due to weather risks in Atlanta. Since the airport lacked customs, the nearly 300 passengers were confined to the aircrafts until the next morning. Delta has apologized for the incident and is offering full refunds to affected customers. Nearby Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport was not an option due to intense storms.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences has unveiled three puppies claiming they are the first successfully de-extincted animal, the dire wolf, but scientists say they have created a larger, whiter wolf. The project raises ethical questions about animal welfare and resource allocation. Critics argue that the focus should be on saving existing endangered species rather than resurrecting extinct ones. The high cost of maintaining resurrected animals could divert resources from conservation efforts, potentially leading to the extinction of more species. Some worry the idea that we can bring back species will undermine conservation.</p>

            <p>Former President Barack Obama's preference for medium-well steak continues to spark debate among culinary enthusiasts. Obama admits that he enjoys his steak cooked to a higher temperature, despite the common belief that it makes the meat tougher and less flavorful. While his choice may be controversial, it aligns with food safety guidelines, as medium-well steak typically reaches an internal temperature that reduces the risk of bacteria. In contrast, current President Donald Trump reportedly prefers his steak well-done with ketchup.</p>

            <p>California's sea lion population is facing a severe threat from toxic algae blooms, with rescue teams overwhelmed by the number of sick animals. The neurotoxin domoic acid, produced by the algae, is poisoning sea lions, dolphins, and birds, leading to seizures and heart failure. SeaWorld's animal rescue team has doubled its staff to cope with the surge in calls and rescues. Scientists believe warming oceans are contributing to the extreme algae blooms. Rescue teams work around the clock to treat and rehabilitate the affected animals, with the hope of releasing them back into the wild.</p>

Military activities include border-barrier construction and emplacement of detection and monitoring equipment. The order excludes native reservations.</p>
