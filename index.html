          <p>A new report from Deloitte reveals that the cost of preparing a packed school lunch has risen nearly 3% from last year, averaging $6.15, due to persistent grocery price inflation. The analysis points to price hikes in staples like milk and bananas, adding financial pressure on caregivers. In response, many families are switching to store brands and cheaper meal options. The price of cafeteria-provided lunches has also increased, though federal programs are receiving more funding to help offset these costs for schools.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials dropped nearly 14% after the company issued a weak financial forecast, falling short of analyst expectations. The guidance was attributed to growing uncertainty and reduced demand within its China business, as well as slowing spending from other leading-edge customers. Despite reporting third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded estimates, the pessimistic outlook prompted a stock downgrade from Bank of America, citing persistent headwinds in the Chinese market.

          <p>A parenting self-help book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" was recently returned to the San Antonio Public Library, nearly 82 years after its due date in 1943. The book was discovered in a deceased man's belongings by his child, who suspects their grandmother borrowed it before being transferred to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Fortunately for the family, the library system stopped charging late fees in 2021, forgiving what would have been an estimated fine of almost $900.</p>

          <p>Airlines are finding the peak summer travel season increasingly unpredictable, forcing them to make significant adjustments to their schedules. Travel demand is shifting, with more people flying earlier in the summer or pushing European vacations to the fall, while last-minute bookings have become more common. In response to these changes and rising costs, carriers are cutting their August flight capacity, a move that is likely to result in higher airfares for consumers during the late summer.</p>

          <p>Grand Slam Track, the new professional athletics circuit founded by Olympian Michael Johnson, is experiencing significant financial trouble and has failed to pay millions in prize money and appearance fees to its athletes. Johnson stated that the league's second season in 2026 is on hold until all outstanding payments are made, attributing the crisis to committed funding that did not materialize. The league, which had attracted top-tier talent with the promise of lucrative paydays, was forced to cancel its final event.</p>

          <p>An analysis of claims used to justify the federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police force indicates that the assertion of "out of control" crime is misleading. While the city experienced a significant crime spike in 2023, official police data shows a substantial drop in both violent crime and homicides throughout 2024 and 2025. The article also notes that comparing D.C.'s crime statistics to those of entire states is an inappropriate metric, as its rates are more comparable to other major US cities.</p>

Proponents argue that direct government involvement is needed to revitalize the American chipmaker and reduce the country's dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers in Taiwan and South Korea. While controversial, the move is seen by some as a crucial step to secure the domestic supply chain for critical technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article revisits the classic novella "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" by Scottish author Muriel Spark, examining its enduring themes of influence, education, and morality. The story focuses on an eccentric and charismatic teacher at a girls' school in 1930s Edinburgh and her profound, lifelong impact on a select group of students she claims as her own.

Experts suggest Russia's primary goals include securing a halt to U.S. aid for Ukraine and gaining international recognition for its territorial annexations, possibly through a deceptive peace proposal. Conversely, Ukraine remains steadfast in its demand for a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from all its territories, including those occupied since 2014, creating a formidable diplomatic challenge for the negotiations.</p>
