        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A passenger train derailed in the Bryansk region of western Russia after a highway bridge collapsed onto the railway tracks, resulting in at least seven fatalities and numerous injuries. The incident, which occurred close to the Ukrainian border, caused several heavy trucks on the bridge to fall onto the moving train, leading to significant damage and the need for extensive rescue operations. Moscow Railway alleged the bridge collapse was due to illegal interference in transport operations, prompting an investigation by authorities. Later that same morning, a second bridge collapsed in the Kursk region, causing a freight train to catch fire and injuring the driver. The optimism score is not being assessed here.</p>

          <h2>European Parenthood Study Reveals Complex Relationship Between Life Satisfaction and Meaning</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study conducted by sociologists at the University of Cologne indicates that while parenthood provides a deeper sense of meaning in life, it often correlates with lower life satisfaction, particularly for mothers. The study, based on data from over 43,000 respondents across 30 European countries, found that parents generally feel their lives are more fulfilled compared to child-free individuals. However, the level of life satisfaction among parents is significantly influenced by family policies and gender equality within their respective countries, with Scandinavian countries showing the least difference in satisfaction between parents and non-parents due to robust support systems. The study highlights the need for policymakers to view children as a societal responsibility, advocating for comprehensive childcare, financial support, and parental leave to enhance the well-being of parents and families.

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant rise in obesity rates, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals, with experts linking this trend to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. High food price inflation has reduced citizens' purchasing power, leading to increased consumption of processed foods with low nutritional value and high sugar content. The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but faces criticism for overlooking broader economic struggles and the inaccessibility of healthy foods for low-income households. Experts advocate for stricter regulations on unhealthy food marketing and a nationwide free school meal program to address malnutrition and promote healthier eating habits.

          <p>The UK's upcoming strategic defense review will outline significant new investments in national security, sending a clear message to hostile states, according to Defense Secretary John Healey. The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a new era of threat, particularly from Russia and China. The government also announced a Â£1.5 billion investment in new defense factories, creating 1,800 jobs across the UK, with plans to procure up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. The new funding will bring UK munitions spending to Â£6 billion during this parliament. The optimism score is not being assessed here.</p>

          <p>An analyst suggests that Donald Trump's policies towards China, characterized by both aggression and weakness, may inadvertently increase the likelihood of a conflict over Taiwan. Trump's trade policies and tariffs are seen as provocative, potentially pushing China's President Xi Jinping into a corner. The analyst argues that Trump's reluctance to commit to defending key interests and his perceived cowardice may embolden China to test US resolve regarding Taiwan. The situation is further complicated by policy confusion and Taiwan's own challenges in defense spending and military modernization. The optimism score is not being assessed here.</p>

A separate Hamas statement indicated the proposal aims for a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and ensured aid flow.
