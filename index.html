          <p>President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska ended without a formal ceasefire deal for the war in Ukraine. After the talks, Trump stated on social media that both sides agreed a direct peace agreement is preferable to a ceasefire, which he claims often fails to hold. He announced that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will visit Washington on Monday to continue discussions, suggesting a potential trilateral meeting could follow in the future.</p>

The posts criticize Trump's performance at the Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, accusing him of having "low energy" and being outmaneuvered. This online trolling is part of a broader political feud, which also references Newsom's recent controversial redistricting proposals in California.</p>

          <p>New York City coffee shops are concerned about the financial impact of the Trump administration's 50% tariff on Brazilian goods, a major source of coffee beans. Cafe owners fear that the increased costs will force them to raise prices for consumers, potentially jeopardizing their already slim profit margins. The article explains that while some businesses are trying to absorb the costs, the tariffs, combined with climate change effects, are making a daily coffee an unaffordable luxury for many customers.

          <p>Electricity costs in the United States are increasing more than twice as fast as overall inflation, placing a heavy burden on households, especially during the summer. The price surge is attributed to two main factors: the massive energy demands of new AI data centers and the rising cost of natural gas as more of it is exported. This situation is forcing many consumers, particularly seniors on fixed incomes, to make difficult choices between paying their power bills and affording other necessities.
