          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-to-4 decision due to Justice Barrett's recusal, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling, blocking the state from using public funds for St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, a religious charter school. The tie vote means the lower court's decision stands, but it sets no national precedent on the constitutionality of states sponsoring religious charter schools. The lack of a majority leaves the broader legal question unresolved, particularly concerning the First Amendment and government funding of religious institutions. The issue is expected to return to the court in the future, especially with the court's conservative leanings, and the next ruling will depend on Justice Barrett's views.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from enrolling international students, citing concerns about an unsafe campus environment due to anti-American and pro-terrorist agitators, many of whom are allegedly foreign students. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of refusing to provide information about purported criminality and misconduct of foreign students, leading to the revocation of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. Harvard has denounced the action as unlawful, stating it undermines their academic and research mission and threatens serious harm to the university community. A federal judge issued an injunction blocking the administration from terminating the legal status of international students, potentially impacting the enforcement of the order against Harvard.</p>

          <p>David Brooks challenges the populist narrative that America's economic woes stem from neoliberal globalization, arguing this account is historically inaccurate. He contends that the era between the Clinton and Obama administrations was not a libertarian free-for-all, but rather a period of balanced dynamism and solidarity. Brooks notes that deindustrialization and wage stagnation occurred primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, before the rise of neoliberal globalism. He also argues that foreign competition's impact on American workers is often exaggerated, citing studies that show job losses from Chinese imports were largely offset by job gains due to higher exports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, commonly used as weight loss drugs, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. Researchers compared GLP-1 drugs to DDP-4 inhibitors, another type of diabetes medication without the same weight loss effect, in over 170,000 adults with obesity and diabetes. The study found that patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause. While the results were not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had an 8% lower risk of obesity-related cancer and a 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis reveals that deaths from alcohol-related cancers in the United States have doubled between 1990 and 2021, rising from approximately 12,000 to over 23,000. The study, using data from the Global Burden of Disease database, found that mortality rates were significantly higher in males and individuals over 55. Washington, D.C., had the highest alcohol-related mortality rate, while Utah had the lowest. The findings underscore the critical need for targeted prevention efforts and increased awareness to address the rising impact of alcohol consumption on cancer-related mortality.</p>

          <p>The newly appointed head of the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, told agency staff that he had to Google the job after being offered it by the Trump administration. Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive with no prior government experience, shared his unfamiliarity with the role during a town hall meeting. Despite concerns about leadership turnover and scrutiny from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Bisignano assured employees that Social Security was "not going away" and emphasized the need to adopt a "digital-first" mindset, comparing the agency to tech giants like Amazon.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to terminate the Flores Agreement, a longstanding court settlement that provides basic rights and services to migrant children in U.S. custody. The Justice Department argued that the agreement hampers effective immigration policy and incentivizes illegal border crossings, while attorneys representing migrant children contend that eliminating the settlement's protections would grant the government unchecked power to detain children indefinitely in substandard facilities. The move seeks to end judicial control over immigration policy and lift a ruling limiting the detention of migrant children to 20 days, a bid that is expected to face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Svetlana Dali was found guilty on a federal stowaway charge after sneaking onto a Delta flight from New York City to Paris last year. Dali's sentencing guidelines call for up to six months in prison, and she has already been held without bail for five months. She was taken into custody by French authorities upon landing in Paris and later returned to New York, where she was re-arrested after allegedly removing her GPS monitor and attempting to cross the border into Canada.</p>

          <p>The UK government has transferred sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, citing legal and practical reasons related to the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia. The government feared that without ceding sovereignty, the operation of the base would become unworkable due to international legal challenges arguing that the UK had no right to separate the islands from Mauritius before its independence. Additionally, the agreement includes a veto for the UK preventing Mauritius from allowing a foreign power to establish a military presence in the islands.</p>

          <p>In this episode of "The Ezra Klein Show," Klein interviews Jake Tapper about Tapper's new book, "Original Sin," which examines the alleged cover-up surrounding Joe Biden's cognitive decline leading up to the 2024 election. Tapper discusses special prosecutor Robert Hur's report, which described Biden as a "well-meaning old man with a flagging memory," and the White House's subsequent efforts to discredit the report. The conversation delves into the accommodations made for Biden, the limited access to him, and the Democratic Party's alleged gaslighting of the public regarding his fitness for office.</p>

However, it also includes substantial cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, and would eliminate subsidized federal student loans, potentially increasing student debt burdens.

          <p>Hinge Health, a digital physical therapy company, saw its shares climb 17% in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, following a successful IPO that raised approximately $273 million.

          <h2>Echoes of the Past: D.C. Shooting Revives Memories of Unsolved 1973 Murder of Israeli Diplomat</h2>

          <p>The fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., has drawn parallels to the unsolved 1973 murder of Israeli military attaché Col. Yosef Alon, highlighting a recurring theme of violence amidst Israeli-Palestinian tensions. While a suspect was quickly apprehended in the recent shooting, the earlier case remains unsolved, despite an extensive FBI investigation. Both incidents underscore the global reach of the conflict and the enduring threat to Israeli officials and Jewish communities. Former FBI agent Eugene Casey hopes the new investigation will revive interest in solving the decades-old Alon case.</p>
