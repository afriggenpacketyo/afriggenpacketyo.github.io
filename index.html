          <h2>France Grapples with Political Instability and Worsening Fiscal Outlook</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is currently facing a critical political and economic juncture, with its Prime Minister calling a confidence vote on a contentious 2026 budget containing 44 billion euros in cuts. Economists are now unfavorably comparing France's current instability, marked by a high budget deficit of 5.8% of GDP and a rapid succession of prime ministers, to Italy's past political turmoil before its recent period of stability. The proposed budget aims to reduce the deficit to 4.6% by 2026, but this level still well exceeds EU rules, causing material concern for debt sustainability. Political deadlock among rival parties on the left and right makes passing the budget challenging, potentially leading to another government collapse and further financial market pressure, as evidenced by France's 30-year bond yield rising to levels last seen in 2008.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European leaders, led by France and the UK, are confronting difficult decisions regarding future security guarantees for Ukraine, as a "coalition of the willing" meets in Paris. A key challenge is the unresolved question of US involvement, with President Trump hinting at support but shifting away from demanding an immediate ceasefire, which aligns more with Russia's position. Experts highlight Europe's dilemma, unsure of the extent of US backing or the feasibility of a ceasefire, especially given Russian President Putin's dismissal of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy as illegitimate. This uncertainty complicates plans for a "reassurance force" in Ukraine, potentially leading European nations to focus instead on providing Kyiv with more weapons and ammunition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is under intense pressure following her admission that she should have paid a higher rate of stamp duty on her East Sussex flat, which saved her £40,000. She attributes the error to complex "deeming provisions" in a trust established for her son, which fresh legal advice has now clarified. While Sir Keir Starmer maintains full confidence in her, an investigation by the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests is underway to determine if she took appropriate advice, with some political figures calling for her resignation. Rayner has referred herself for investigation and contacted HMRC, potentially facing significant penalties of up to 100% of the underpaid tax if her actions are found to be deliberate, adding to her political fight for survival.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing, following no grand prize winners in Wednesday's $1.4 billion drawing. This potential payout, with an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes, would mark the third-largest in US lottery history, potentially even surpassing the second-largest depending on ticket sales. The current streak of 41 drawings without a jackpot winner ties a game record, with Saturday's drawing being the 42nd since the last win in May 2025. Hopeful players across 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands will try their luck against the daunting odds of 1 in 292.2 million to claim this massive prize.</p>

O'Donnell, born in New York, is protected by the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to those born in the US. Their long-standing feud dates back nearly two decades, originating from O'Donnell's criticism of Trump in 2006 regarding a Miss USA winner. O'Donnell, who is seeking Irish dual citizenship and has moved to Ireland citing the current political climate, responded defiantly to Trump's latest remarks, calling him "king joffrey with a tangerine spray tan."</p>

          <p>Shares of Nidec Corp, a major Japanese electronics components manufacturer, plunged over 22% on Thursday, marking its largest one-day drop, after the company announced an independent probe into allegations of improper accounting within its Chinese subsidiary, Nidec Techno Motor. An internal investigation revealed evidence suggesting management involvement in the malpractice, potentially extending to other group companies, which include operations in India, France, Germany, and the United States. This development follows a previous delay in financial reporting due to "potentially erroneous declarations" regarding country of origin for motors, which may have led to unpaid import tariffs. The company's stock has now declined significantly year-to-date, contrasting with the overall rise of the Nikkei 225 index.</p>

          <p>A man has been charged with the murder of Steven Cook, a British man who disappeared on holiday in Malia, Crete, 20 years ago. Cook, then 20, vanished on September 1, 2005, and his remains were tragically discovered at the bottom of a well in 2017. The 38-year-old British man charged, who was alleged to have been working in Malia at the time, is now back in the UK. Cook's older brother expressed complicated emotions, noting that no legal outcome can fully compensate for the family's two decades of suffering, especially as this anniversary marks the first without their parents. A hearing is scheduled for October 21 in Greece, with the possibility of the case being tried without the suspect's physical presence.</p>

Despite the arduous journey, with some traveling across 12 countries by train and bus, and Astana's modern, purpose-built architecture, fans report a warm welcome from locals.

          <p>Experts have determined that the world-famous Sycamore Gap tree, illegally felled in September 2023, was at least 100 to 120 years old, narrowing down its previously debated age. Dendrochronological analysis by Historic England involved counting growth rings in a cross-section of the trunk, which was found to be in "good condition" despite some challenges in ring definition. The tree, believed to have been planted by landowner John Clayton between 1860 and 1890 as a landscape feature, sparked global outrage when two men filmed themselves felling it. The section of wood will be preserved in Historic England's National Wood Collection for further detailed analysis, contributing to the iconic tree's remarkable legacy despite its tragic end.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to quickly intervene and reverse an appeals court ruling that deemed most of President Trump's trade tariffs illegal, arguing it misinterprets the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The government contends that the lower court's decision casts "a pall of uncertainty" over ongoing foreign negotiations and jeopardizes existing deals and future talks, with potential financial blows to the U.S. Treasury if tariffs are struck down. This legal challenge puts a centerpiece of Trump's trade policy before the Supreme Court, which he helped shape, but small businesses advocate for a prompt resolution, citing the serious harm inflicted by these tariffs and the associated uncertainty.

          <p>Intense wildfires that devastated Spain and Portugal this summer, claiming at least eight lives and forcing tens of thousands to evacuate, were massively fueled by climate change, according to a new report. The analysis from World Weather Attribution scientists concludes that climate change, driven primarily by fossil fuel burning, made the weather conditions for these fires 40 times more frequent and 30% more intense. The Spanish heatwave preceding the fires was 200 times more likely and 3 degrees Celsius hotter due to climate change, with such events now expected every 13 years compared to less than every 2,500 years historically. Experts stress the urgent need to shift away from fossil fuels and implement prevention measures like sustainable land management to prevent catastrophic future wildfires as temperatures continue to rise.</p>

These extraordinary protocols aim to conceal any clues about Kim's health from foreign intelligence agencies, even friendly ones, by preventing the acquisition of biological samples like hair and skin tags.

The study, by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre, found Chinese citizens are optimistic about their nation's future, economy, military, and culture, and largely regard their country as the greatest in the world. However, a significant plurality (48%) expressed interest in a "shared leadership role" with the US, implying an acceptance of peaceful coexistence rather than solely seeking to displace American global dominance.

The article warns that Trump's ambitious trade strategy, grounded in 19th-century mercantilism, carries significant risks without guaranteed rewards, potentially undermining American influence.

Eyewitnesses described the car hurtling down the steep street uncontrollably before impacting a building with brutal force, causing severe damage and leaving the train crumpled. The famous funicular, which opened in 1885 and transports around 3 million people annually, is used by both locals and tourists connecting downtown Lisbon to the Bairro Alto. An investigation into the cause of this "unprecedented tragedy" will commence, with the Portuguese government declaring a nationwide day of mourning and European leaders offering condolences.</p>

          <p>A professor at Cal State Channel Island, Jonathan Caravello, has been charged with felony assault for allegedly throwing a tear gas canister back at US Border Patrol agents during a heated protest. The incident occurred on July 10 at a Ventura County marijuana farm, where agents were conducting an immigration raid that led to over 300 arrests of undocumented workers and tragically, one worker's death while attempting to flee. Prosecutors allege Caravello picked up a canister, deployed by agents for crowd control, and lobbed it overhand back at officers, then resisted arrest when identified. He faces up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted, despite initially pleading not guilty to a misdemeanor charge.</p>

          <p>China is hosting an aviation training workshop for representatives from eight Southeast Asian nations this month, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, aiming to promote its home-grown civilian aircraft like the C919. The 14-day workshop in Beijing covers critical areas such as safety management, airworthiness certification, green development, and new technologies, with a specific focus on domestically produced large aircraft. This initiative reflects China's ambition to "break the duopoly" of Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market, leveraging Southeast Asia's leading role in accepting Chinese deliveries. The country's nine-year-old small C909-model regional jets have already operated successfully in the region for a decade, signaling a broader trend of China-Southeast Asia economic cooperation and influence.</p>

They urged the Department of Justice to release all documents, citing fears of repercussions for victims who might name individuals publicly, as "nobody protected them the first time." Despite claims by President Trump that the issue is a "Democrat hoax," survivors emphasize the criminal nature of sex trafficking and the need for justice for the hundreds, if not thousands, of girls and young women harmed.</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is seriously considering a bid to return to the Senate in New Hampshire, a state where Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is not seeking re-election in 2026, leaving the field wide open. Sununu, from an influential political family and with blessing from senior White House officials, is seen as a top recruit for Republicans, despite the party's recent struggles in New Hampshire Senate races since 2010. He plans to travel the state and make a decision by the end of next month, aiming to appeal broadly and secure support across the political spectrum, including potentially from President Trump. This sets the stage for a competitive GOP primary against Scott Brown and State Senator Dan Innis, followed by a general election against U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas.</p>

Jackson, who has consistently denied the allegations as a "political hit job," expressed his continued pride in his naval service.

          <p>A controversial Texas bill, allowing residents to sue out-of-state abortion pill providers, has reached Governor Greg Abbott's desk, potentially making Texas the first state to target this common abortion method beyond its borders. Supporters view it as a crucial tool to enforce the state's abortion ban, while opponents see it as an attempt to intimidate providers and women, fostering vigilantism and controlling reproductive decisions. The measure allows lawsuits for up to $100,000 against those who manufacture, transport, or provide abortion-inducing drugs to Texans, with specific provisions protecting women and preventing sexual assault perpetrators from suing. Legal challenges are expected, as this bill could significantly damage shield laws enacted by Democratic-led states protecting out-of-state providers.</p>

The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before his death in 1940 and the subsequent looting of his extensive collection by Hermann Göring. The painting was discovered last month after Dutch journalists spotted it in an online real estate listing in Mar del Plata, belonging to the daughter of a Nazi lawyer who escaped to Argentina.

This inability to execute in clutch situations and fundamental miscues have plagued the team during a puzzling 22-29 stretch since July 4, with the team failing to put together consistent urgent at-bats.
