          <p>Target and Ulta Beauty have announced the termination of their shop-in-shop partnership, effective August 2026. This deal had placed over 600 Ulta Beauty locations within Target stores, a strategy previously highlighted by Target executives to drive customer traffic. The dissolution of this partnership presents another challenge for Target, which has been contending with stagnant sales, declining store visits, and a falling stock price. Analysts suggest that operational issues at Target, such as theft and insufficient staffing, may have contributed to the decision to end the collaboration.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has commended what he described as "sincere efforts" by the U.S. to resolve the war in Ukraine, ahead of a scheduled meeting with President Donald Trump in Alaska. Putin also hinted at the possibility of new agreements on strategic offensive weapons, as the current New START treaty is set to expire soon. This high-stakes summit is the first between the two nations since June 2021 and comes as Trump pushes for a peace deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, has expressed skepticism about Russia's readiness to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has announced plans to construct over 3,000 new homes in the controversial E1 area of the occupied West Bank. This project, long frozen due to international pressure, would connect the Maale Adumim settlement to Jerusalem, effectively dividing the West Bank. Smotrich stated the development is intended to "bury the idea of a Palestinian state," coming as several countries consider formally recognizing Palestinian statehood. The plan has drawn condemnation from the Palestinian Authority and Israeli rights groups, who warn it deepens the occupation and hinders a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>European leaders are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, holding a video call with Trump to convey their unified stance on Ukraine. The primary European hope is for a ceasefire before any negotiations, and they fear Putin might persuade Trump to make concessions on Ukrainian territory or reduce U.S. military presence in Europe. While Trump has reportedly assured them that territorial decisions won't be made without Ukraine's involvement, significant concerns remain that he could be outmaneuvered, potentially weakening European security and cutting off vital support for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) recorded an $8 billion writedown on its large-scale "gigaprojects," such as the futuristic Neom city, according to its 2024 annual report. Despite the fund's total assets growing to nearly $1 trillion, the value of these ambitious developments declined, now constituting a smaller portion of the overall portfolio. This financial adjustment occurs as the kingdom faces lower global oil prices and a growing fiscal deficit, leading to a more cautious approach to spending. The PIF has also been diversifying its funding sources while its annualized returns have dropped. (not investment advice)</p>

The location, a key U.S. military installation for Arctic readiness, was chosen for its security capabilities and availability. The meeting follows several unsuccessful rounds of peace talks and comes as Trump seeks to broker an end to the conflict, a central promise of his presidency. While the White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise," Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated the goal is to achieve a ceasefire, with broader peace negotiations to follow.</p>

The drop is partly influenced by speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its key interest rate next month, following weaker-than-expected jobs data.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed off the coast of Africa and is expected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane by Friday. Current projections from the National Hurricane Center show the storm moving west toward the Caribbean, likely passing near or north of the Leeward Islands over the weekend as a major hurricane. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in the Cabo Verde islands, where at least eight fatalities were reported.</p>

          <p>A $177 million settlement has been proposed to resolve class-action lawsuits against AT&T following two major data breaches that exposed the personal information of millions of customers. Eligible individuals, including those whose Social Security numbers were compromised, can now file claims for compensation of up to $7,500 for documented losses. Notices are being sent to affected customers, and the deadline to file a claim is November 18, 2025. The settlement requires final approval from a federal judge, with a hearing scheduled for December, before any payments can be distributed.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have used generative AI to design two novel antibiotic compounds that have shown effectiveness against drug-resistant bacteria like gonorrhoea and MRSA. The AI was trained on millions of chemical structures to learn how molecules affect bacterial growth, allowing it to invent entirely new drugs atom-by-atom. In laboratory and animal tests, these compounds successfully killed the targeted superbugs. While these potential drugs are still years away from clinical use, the breakthrough suggests that AI could revolutionize antibiotic discovery and help combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

A record number of 18-year-olds secured a place at their first-choice university, with the most selective institutions seeing the steepest growth in acceptances. However, a growing regional disparity in England is evident, as the performance gap between London and the North East has widened. These results are the second set graded to pre-pandemic standards, affecting a student cohort that also faced disruptions during their earlier GCSE years.</p>

          <p>An article from DW details the horrific medical experiments conducted by Nazi gynecologist Carl Clauberg on Jewish women in Auschwitz's Block 10. Clauberg developed a non-surgical sterilization method by injecting toxic substances into women, causing immense suffering and infertility, all in the service of Nazi racial ideology. The research on hormonal compounds, financed by the pharmaceutical company Schering, contributed to the knowledge base that later led to the development of the first hormonal contraceptive pill, which was launched in 1960. This history highlights the dark origins behind a medical innovation that became a key factor in women's emancipation.</p>

          <p>Cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been observed with large, horn-like growths on their faces, prompting concern from local residents. However, wildlife officials have clarified that the animals are infected with the Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless virus. The virus, which is not transmissible to humans or pets, causes tumors that typically resolve on their own as the rabbit's immune system fights off the infection. This virus is believed to be the inspiration for the folkloric jackalope and has played a role in historical research on the link between viruses and cancer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent decision to allow the sale of certain advanced AI chips to China is being viewed as a significant concession that could undermine U.S. national security. This move reverses previous export controls and comes as President Trump seeks a trade agreement with Beijing to validate his economic policies. Critics, including former administration officials, argue that allowing companies like Nvidia to sell these chips endangers America's technological edge in artificial intelligence. This policy shift suggests Trump may be willing to trade long-term strategic advantages for short-term economic and political gains in his negotiations with China.</p>

The Social Security Administration will officially announce the 2026 COLA in October after reviewing inflation figures from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable, some economists are concerned that a modest COLA may not be sufficient to cover rising expenses for seniors if inflation accelerates later in the year.

They argue Trump's threats are a political tactic and that he lacks the legal authority to federalize local police forces outside of D.C.

While Kodak has seen increased demand for its film products in recent years, the company has not been able to overcome its broader financial challenges.

The ruling allows for significant cuts, including nearly $4 billion for global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS initiatives.
