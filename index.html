          <p>A Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), Colin Smyth, has had his parliamentary pass deactivated following reports he placed a camera in a Holyrood toilet. This action comes after Smyth was suspended by the Labour party and charged with possessing indecent images of children earlier in the month. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body made the decision to deactivate his pass due to the ongoing criminal investigation. Smyth has stated he is cooperating with the inquiries, while parliamentary officials have reminded staff of available confidential support services.</p>

The attack occurred during a Mass for students at the beginning of the school year, with the shooter using legally purchased firearms. Westman, who had a history of fascination with past mass shootings and expressed widespread hate, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. The investigation is exploring motives, including anti-Catholic sentiment, and is being treated as an act of domestic terrorism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot unilaterally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America. The ruling states that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressional advisory panel, which President Trump has effectively dismantled by dismissing most of its members. Judge Royce C. Lamberth found that Lake's efforts to remove Abramowitz did not comply with statutory requirements designed to insulate the broadcaster from political pressure. The decision comes amid broader concerns about Lake's actions to significantly reduce the scope and workforce of the international news agency.</p>

          <p>A woman arrested for spitting at a police officer was mistakenly held in a Washington, D.C. jail for a week due to a series of errors by federal and local officials. Despite the Justice Department not seeking pretrial detention, Kristal Rios Esquivel remained incarcerated because of an erroneous active warrant "hit" in the corrections database. A federal judge described the incident as "false imprisonment" and criticized the systemic failures that prevent timely releases. The case highlights growing scrutiny of the justice system in the district amidst the ongoing federal takeover.</p>

          <p>The White House has intensified its criticism of leaders in Democrat-run cities, particularly Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, regarding urban crime rates. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that "decline is a choice" and urged local leaders to request federal law enforcement support, referencing President Trump's potential mobilization of the National Guard. The administration points to Chicago's murder statistics as evidence of failed local policies, a claim countered by Mayor Brandon Johnson who cites recent reductions in crime. This escalation occurs as Pritzker and other Democrats describe the potential deployment of troops as an unconstitutional power grab.</p>

          <p>The 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese war highlights the paradoxical relationship between the two nations, characterized by both deep-seated historical grievances and strong contemporary ties. A recent blockbuster film in China depicting the 1937 Nanking massacre has reignited memories of wartime atrocities and drawn massive audiences. Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan is surging, with nearly a million visitors in July alone, making China the top source of inbound tourists. This love-hate dynamic reflects a complex interplay of historical trauma, geopolitical rivalry, economic interdependence, and shared cultural affinities that continues to shape their interactions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to launch significant immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, potentially starting as early as next week. According to sources within the Department of Homeland Security, these operations are expected to mirror recent actions in Los Angeles, which involved armored vehicles and tactical gear. This development is separate from President Trump's recent proposals to deploy the National Guard to address city crime, a move strongly opposed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

At the event near the CDC's Atlanta campus, the former leaders stated their resignations were a collective action to highlight the damage being done to public vaccine research and scientific integrity.

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between President Trump's statements on his executive power and the character of Homelander from the TV series "The Boys." The author argues that Trump's claim to "do anything I want" mirrors the unchecked power and narcissistic rage of the fictional, omnipotent villain. The piece suggests that both figures are surrounded by sycophants and exhibit a dangerous disregard for established limits on their authority. However, the author concludes that unlike the superhero, Trump is a mortal politician constrained by the Constitution, the courts, and ultimately, the voters, who can counter his authoritarian posturing.</p>

          <p>The recent leadership turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stems from a fundamental conflict over vaccine policy and political influence under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the resignation of four other top officials highlight concerns that the agency's scientific independence is being undermined. Officials who resigned cited the "weaponizing of public health" and an inability to serve in an environment that disregards scientific reality, particularly regarding changes to immunization schedules. This internal crisis threatens to erode public trust in the agency at a time when infectious disease threats are growing.</p>

          <p>Amid rising levels of employee burnout, a lifestyle expert suggests workers can reduce stress by focusing on channeling their energy and setting clear boundaries. Maisha Wynn, author of "The Wynning Way," advises using the first few hours of the workday for high-demand tasks and saving simpler activities like returning emails for later when energy wanes. She also recommends building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create small moments of joy and relief at the desk. A key strategy to avoid burnout is learning to say "no" when necessary, prioritizing one's own well-being to be effective for others.</p>

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), was fired by the Trump administration, a move he discovered after his work phone was locked upon returning from an Amtrak event. The ouster comes as the STB is reviewing a proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, a deal Primus had reportedly expressed opposition to. Rail worker unions condemned the termination, calling it an assault on the independence of federal oversight and suggesting it was politically motivated to favor the merger. The White House stated Primus "did not align with the President's America First agenda."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Trump to block his unprecedented attempt to fire her from the central bank's board. The lawsuit challenges the legality of the removal, which Trump justified by citing allegations of mortgage fraud that Cook's attorney calls "nakedly pretextual." The Federal Reserve Act permits a president to remove a governor only "for cause," a standard the lawsuit argues has not been met. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing on Cook's request for a temporary restraining order, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over the independence of the Federal Reserve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is within his constitutional and statutory rights to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, regardless of whether it is "for cause." The author contends that Article II of the Constitution vests all "executive power," including the removal of officers, in the president. The piece dismisses the idea of "independent" agencies as a constitutional aberration and suggests that Supreme Court precedent is moving toward restoring the president's full removal authority. The author concludes that the allegations against Cook provide a legitimate cause for removal and that asserting this power is essential for presidential control over the administrative state.</p>

The resulting album is sonically diverse, blending electronic soundscapes with traditional Latin genres like bolero and norteña, reflecting a playful and experimental approach. Del Real describes the process as transformative, a moment where the music simply "arrived" and he felt compelled to follow its lead.</p>

          <p>Large, gelatinous blobs that have been spotted in U.S. lakes, sparking curiosity and some alarm, have been identified by wildlife officials as magnificent bryozoans. These strange-looking masses are not single organisms but colonies made up of thousands of tiny, filter-feeding invertebrates called zooids. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service explained that these ancient creatures, which have existed for over 480 million years, are harmless and actually beneficial to their freshwater ecosystems. They play a role in cleaning the water by capturing and consuming plankton as they drift in slow-moving rivers and lakes.</p>

However, the company noted that shoppers remain deal-focused and hesitant about big-ticket purchases like appliances.

The administration's messaging focuses on "defending the homeland" and removing "the worst of the worst," a pitch that resonated with many applicants who expressed support for President Trump's immigration policies.

The recall affects 2015-2018 Ford Edge and 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX SUVs, in which a rear brake system hose can rupture. A leak could lead to increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances, and a warning light will illuminate if the fluid level becomes too low. Ford will notify affected owners in early September, but the remedy for the issue is still under development and is not expected to be available until next April.</p>

Barton accused the newspaper of "consistently misrepresenting" the council's policies, while the paper's editor called the move an "unprecedented" and "direct attack on the free press."

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the focus on President Trump's political attacks on the Federal Reserve overlooks a more fundamental threat: fiscal dominance driven by massive government debt. The author contends that as public debt exceeds 100% of GDP, the Fed's ability to conduct independent monetary policy becomes constrained by the government's need to finance its spending. If Congress fails to address spending and borrowing, the Fed may be forced to keep interest rates low or tolerate inflation to manage the debt burden. The article concludes that this underlying fiscal pressure will persist regardless of who is president. (not investment advice)</p>
