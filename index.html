          <p>Oracle's stock price increased after the company officially confirmed a significant cloud-computing agreement with Meta, the parent company of Facebook. During its AI World conference, Oracle executives detailed immense demand for their cloud infrastructure, revealing $65 billion in new commitments within a single 30-day period from four customers, including Meta. This deal is part of a broader trend of major technology firms heavily investing in AI infrastructure to support their strategic initiatives. The announcement underscores Oracle's growing competitiveness in the cloud market against rivals like Amazon and Google.</p>

          <p>A House-passed bill intended to fund the U.S. military through the ongoing government shutdown was blocked in the Senate. The measure failed to secure the 60 votes needed to overcome a procedural hurdle, with a final vote of 50-44. Most Democrats opposed the bill, citing controversial provisions added by the House that eliminated aid to Ukraine and restricted service members' access to certain healthcare. The failure highlights the deep partisan divisions that are prolonging the shutdown and preventing even broadly supported legislation, like military pay, from advancing.</p>

          <p>Conflicting reports have emerged from Senate leadership regarding efforts to end the federal government shutdown, now in its 16th day. Senate Majority Leader John Thune claimed he offered Democrats a vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies in exchange for reopening the government, an offer he said was rejected. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer publicly denied that any such proposal had been made, accusing Republicans of not negotiating. This public disagreement underscores the significant stalemate between the two parties, making an end to the shutdown appear distant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has begun debating a contentious bill to reintroduce a form of military service, starting on a voluntary basis. The proposal aims to significantly increase the size of the Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, in response to growing security concerns in Europe, particularly Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius acknowledged the passionate debate surrounding the issue, stating that if voluntary recruitment proves insufficient, a mandatory component may be considered in the future. The legislation reflects a major potential shift in Germany's defense policy after conscription was suspended in 2011.</p>

          <p>Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman was forced to leave a CONCACAF W Champions Cup match in tears after suffering an apparent right knee injury. The incident occurred in the 41st minute against Monterrey, with Rodman unable to put weight on her leg as she was helped off the field. This injury came just hours after the 23-year-old star was recalled to the U.S. women's national team roster for the first time since April, following a recovery from a chronic back issue. The severity of the injury is pending an official diagnosis after scans are conducted.</p>

          <p>The United States military flew three B-52 long-range bombers on a mission in the Caribbean Sea, approximately 150 miles north of the Venezuelan coast. This action is seen as part of the Trump administration's ongoing strategy to exert pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The flight follows a significant buildup of U.S. military assets in the region, including warships and thousands of personnel. The B-52 is a strategic bomber capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons, making its deployment a notable signal of military posture.</p>

Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, a Trump appointee, praised the move as a way to reduce compliance burdens and refocus supervision on material financial risks.

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the average annual percentage rates (APRs) on consumer credit cards have not seen a proportional decrease. A report from CardRatings.com found that while the Fed lowered its benchmark rate significantly in late 2024, the average credit card rate fell by only a small fraction. Experts suggest that credit card rates are influenced by various factors beyond the Fed's actions, including market competition and individual credit scores. This trend means that millions of American households continue to face high costs on their revolving credit card debt.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has accused the United States of creating unnecessary "panic" by exaggerating the impact of Beijing's new export controls on rare earth minerals. Despite the sharp rhetoric, a ministry spokesperson indicated that China is open to trade talks to resolve the dispute, which has escalated tensions between the two economic powers. The U.S. has criticized the controls as an attempt to dominate global technology supply chains and has threatened retaliatory tariffs. This development follows a period of intense trade disputes and strategic competition over critical resources.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed charges against two real estate executives in separate cases, accusing them of defrauding state programs designed to combat homelessness. The executives are alleged to have misappropriated millions of dollars from California's Homekey initiative, which funds the conversion of properties into housing for the homeless. One executive is accused of fraudulent property flipping, while the other is charged with embezzling grant funds for personal luxuries.

          <p>A new analysis by S&P Global projects that President Trump's tariffs will impose costs of over $1.2 trillion on global businesses in 2025. The report suggests this is a conservative estimate and concludes that the majority of these costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers rather than being absorbed by companies or foreign exporters. The analysis indicates that while businesses will face a significant hit to profit margins, consumers will bear approximately two-thirds of the financial burden in the form of higher prices for goods.

          <p>The U.S. federal budget deficit for fiscal year 2025 was $1.78 trillion, a slight decrease of $41 billion from the previous year, according to the Treasury Department.

However, the government also faced record-high interest payments on the national debt, which totaled over $1.2 trillion for the year.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued its winter forecast for December through February, predicting that a La Niña climate pattern will be the primary driver of weather across the U.S. The outlook anticipates warmer-than-average temperatures for much of the country, with southern states likely to experience drier conditions. Conversely, the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies, and western Great Lakes are expected to see cooler and wetter-than-normal weather. This forecast is consistent with the typical effects of La Niña, which is expected to persist through the winter before weakening in the spring.</p>
