        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has strategically hired Mike Liberatore, previously the finance chief at Elon Musk's xAI, to serve as its business finance officer, tasked with overseeing the company's substantial infrastructure spending. This recruitment intensifies the escalating rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, former co-founders who have become bitter competitors as OpenAI transitioned into a rapidly growing commercial entity. Liberatore's departure from xAI after only three months follows a series of high-profile exits from Musk's artificial intelligence venture. OpenAI, recently valued at an impressive $500 billion, is actively increasing its compute commitments, including a massive $300 billion deal with Oracle, signaling its aggressive expansion plans in the AI sector.</p>

          <p>A group of teenagers from Bradford, UK, participated in a five-day challenge to eliminate technology from their bedrooms, aiming to observe its effects on their daily lives and well-being. Participants like Elizabeth and Henry initially struggled with the absence of devices, but ultimately reported significant positive changes. These benefits included improved sleep patterns, the discovery of new hobbies such as ballet and baking, and increased engagement with their families in communal living spaces. The initiative, part of the BBC's Teen Summit, underscores a growing societal concern regarding excessive youth screen time and its broader impact on mental health and social development. Experts advocate for reducing digital device presence in bedrooms, citing its potential to enhance sleep quality and foster more diverse activities.</p>

          <p>Technology giant Oracle is reportedly a key member of a consortium poised to enable TikTok's continued operations in the U.S., contingent on a finalized framework deal between the United States and China. The precise terms of this arrangement, including the extent of Chinese firm ByteDance's involvement and control over TikTok's influential recommendation algorithm, remain undefined. Discussions between Presidents Trump and Xi are anticipated to finalize these details, navigating a complex geopolitical landscape. This development follows a U.S. law mandating ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban, a measure that President Trump has unilaterally delayed multiple times. Persistent national security concerns revolve around potential Chinese government access to U.S. user data and influence over the platform's content.</p>

          <p>Timothy Garton Ash issues a stark warning, asserting that American democrats have a crucial 400-day window to safeguard U.S. democracy, with the upcoming midterm elections being pivotal for constraining presidential power. He expresses profound concern over the swift erosion of established democratic norms under President Trump, highlighting issues such as executive overreach, partisan gerrymandering, pervasive violence, and the exploitation of intense capitalist competition. The article underscores the urgent necessity for Democrats to regain control of the House of Representatives to restore congressional checks and balances, despite acknowledging the party's internal disarray. Furthermore, it suggests that the economic repercussions of current policies might become sufficiently palpable to voters before the midterms, potentially influencing the electoral outcome.</p>

Ruth Porat, Google's President and Chief Investment Officer, emphasized the UK's "pioneering work in advanced science" as a primary reason for this strategic investment. The company also addressed environmental impact, confirming the facility will be air-cooled and powered by "95% carbon-free energy," while acknowledging the broader energy demands of AI data centers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reveals the historical and ideological inspiration behind the naming of China's missiles, with many, including the prominent "Dongfeng" (east wind), drawing from the words of Mao Zedong. The name "Dongfeng" specifically originates from a famous 1957 speech by Mao in Moscow, where he proclaimed, "Either the east wind prevails over the west wind, or the west wind prevails over the east wind," symbolizing the ideological struggle between the communist East and the capitalist West. This naming convention demonstrates a deep-rooted connection between China's military development and its foundational political rhetoric. Such designations imbue the nation's defense capabilities with a powerful sense of historical continuity and national purpose, reflecting a deliberate choice to link modern military strength to the country's revolutionary past.</p>

Concurrently, Nigel Farage has hinted that several more senior Tories might defect to Reform UK, further intensifying political instability.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are actively considering a versatile role for star player Shohei Ohtani in the upcoming playoffs, potentially utilizing him as a relief pitcher in specific high-leverage situations, despite plans for him to primarily serve as a starter. Andrew Friedman, president of baseball operations, confirmed the starting role but highlighted the possibility of bullpen appearances, drawing parallels to previous strategic uses of starters in postseason relief. This strategic flexibility, however, introduces complex logistical challenges due to MLB's unique two-way player rules. These regulations would necessitate removing Ohtani as a designated hitter if he enters the game as a reliever and subsequently exits the mound, forcing the team to weigh the offensive cost against the pitching benefit.</p>

He cautioned that this "threat that looms" could result in severe repercussions, including significant layoffs, budget reductions, and the suspension of crucial federal grants, profoundly impacting the university's mission. UC leaders are currently engaged in negotiations with federal officials, while Governor Gavin Newsom has urged the university to pursue legal action against what he characterizes as "ransom" and "extortion."</p>

The incident, which occurred at a branch of China's largest hotpot chain, Haidilao, in February, triggered widespread public outrage after the 17-year-olds posted the video online. The court determined that the teenagers' actions constituted an infringement upon the companies' property rights and significantly damaged their reputation through "acts of insult," causing considerable public discomfort. The parents were mandated to bear the compensation, as they were found to have "failed to fulfil their duty of guardianship." However, any additional compensation Haidilao voluntarily offered to its customers beyond their billed amounts was deemed a business decision not attributable to the teenagers.</p>

Colombian President Gustavo Petro expressed regret over the decision, arguing it disregarded decades of Colombian sacrifices in the U.S.-led drug war. This move highlights the unraveling of cooperation, particularly after the suspension of aerial coca eradication and a 2016 peace accord that shifted focus towards state-building and voluntary crop substitution programs.</p>

Both airlines have expressed deep disappointment with the decision, contending that unwinding the venture would inflict "significant harm to U.S. jobs, communities and consumers" traveling between the two countries.

He defended his comments, asserting they were protected by the First Amendment and did not represent UCLA, while criticizing the university's action as an example of "Project 2025" and "fascism at work." UCLA issued a statement affirming free expression as a core value but clarified that violence or its celebration is "completely unacceptable." This incident highlights intense societal tensions surrounding free speech, political commentary, and institutional responses to polarizing events.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran, President Trump's controversial pick and current chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to the Federal Reserve's board of governors by a vote of 48-47. This confirmation is notable as it marks the first time a sitting White House official will join the Fed board since the 1930s, sparking significant concerns regarding the central bank's long-standing independence. Miran, a proponent of Trump's global tariffs, is slated to participate in a crucial Fed policy meeting this week, where a quarter-percentage point interest rate cut is widely anticipated. His fast-tracked confirmation, alongside ongoing efforts to remove Governor Lisa Cook, underscores President Trump's determined efforts to reshape the Federal Reserve's composition and influence its monetary policy decisions.

          <p>The increasing prominence of Reform UK is generating considerable apprehension and "jitters" within both the Labour and Conservative parties across the UK political landscape. Recent weeks have proven challenging for the government, marked by internal mistakes and the departure of a senior aide to the prime minister due to leaked sexually explicit messages. Reform UK's sustained lead in opinion polls, coupled with the defection of Conservative shadow minister Danny Kruger, is accelerating fundamental questions for the Tories about their future. Labour, meanwhile, harbors deep fears that Reform UK could undermine their path to securing power, while the Liberal Democrats express frustration at a perceived lack of attention amidst the prevailing political turmoil. This situation highlights a period of significant political instability and uncertainty in British governance.</p>

The deliveries are intended to address a substantial backlog of $21.54 billion across 18 active arms orders, with the majority now on schedule for delivery. However, some critical systems, including the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon and F-16V Block 70 fighter jets, have experienced considerable delays.

          <p>Fume or smoke incidents on airliners, occurring at an alarming rate of more than three times a day, are generating serious health concerns for both passengers and crew members, with experts warning of potential toxic exposure. Dr. Robert Harrison, an occupational medicine specialist, reports treating over 100 flight crew members for nervous system problems linked to such exposures. A Wall Street Journal investigation indicated that Airbus A320 family jets accounted for a disproportionate 61% of reported incidents, nearly triple that of Boeing aircraft. While Airbus and Delta Air Lines affirm their commitment to safety and continuous product enhancements, flight attendants' associations are advocating for improved cabin air filtration systems. The FAA maintains that cabin air standards are strict, but acknowledges that mechanical failures, such as engine oil seal issues, can allow fumes to enter the cabin.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a ruling temporarily blocking President Trump's attempt to remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board, just prior to a critical vote on interest rates. The court's two-to-one decision upheld a lower court's finding that Cook's firing would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act, which includes specific provisions designed to insulate the central bank from political interference. Cook's legal team argued that the unproven allegations against her, related to conduct predating her appointment, do not meet the stringent "for cause" standard required for removal. This significant ruling prevents Trump from immediately appointing a fourth nominee, thereby safeguarding the Fed's autonomy and preventing a shift in the board's majority.

Trump asserted that the suspect should have been deported, although court records indicate some previous charges were dropped or resulted in acquittals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed Cobos-Martinez was under a final deportation order but could not be returned to Cuba, being released under supervision during the final days of the Biden administration.

Experts largely attribute this lead presence to incinerated lead paint from homes built before 1978, posing serious, permanent health risks, particularly to children.

The article also advocates for prioritizing quality over sheer quantity, encouraging individuals to curate their surroundings with objects that genuinely uplift and reinforce their desired narrative. Psychotherapists suggest differentiating between nostalgia and sentimentality as a crucial step in letting go of items, noting that cherished memories can often be preserved more effectively through photographs than physical objects.</p>

Vance further incited action, urging Americans to publicly call out and report anyone perceived to be celebrating Kirk's murder, even suggesting contacting their employers.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing the "black box" warnings associated with menopause hormone therapy (MHT) medications, which have historically cautioned about risks such as stroke, blood clots, dementia, and breast cancer. This re-evaluation is prompted by evolving research that challenges the conclusions of a flawed 2002 study, which reportedly overstated MHT risks by primarily focusing on older women. Contemporary experts now emphasize that crucial factors, including a woman's age at the initiation of treatment and the method of hormone delivery, can significantly mitigate these risks, positioning MHT as the most effective treatment for many perimenopausal symptoms. While an expert panel has suggested removing some warnings, some medical professionals advocate for further scientific assessment before implementing any changes.</p>

Mario Edgardo Garcia-Aquino is charged with sexually assaulting and killing Omar, whose body was discovered after he visited the coach's home. The lawsuit contends that the city failed to inform parents about Garcia-Aquino's prior sexual assault allegations, which the LAPD had investigated in 2022. Furthermore, the district attorney's office faced criticism for a 10-month delay in filing charges for a second sexual assault allegation against the coach, raising questions about missed opportunities to prevent this tragic outcome.</p>
