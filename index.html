          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record high, trading above $121,000, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation of favorable U.S. legislation. The U.S. House of Representatives is set to begin deliberations on a series of crypto-focused bills, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' which aim to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. This legislative push, supported by President Donald Trump, has boosted investor confidence and fueled institutional buying. Analysts suggest that increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity are key factors behind the cryptocurrency's recent bullish performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British TV presenter Gregg Wallace has issued an apology after an independent inquiry substantiated 45 allegations against him, including claims of unwelcome physical contact and inappropriate language. The report, commissioned by the production company behind the show 'MasterChef', covers a 19-year period and also notes Wallace's recent autism diagnosis, which he stated he does not wish to use as an excuse. In response to the findings, the BBC has confirmed it has severed ties with Wallace and has no plans for future collaborations. The investigation has prompted wider discussions about workplace culture and the protection of freelancers in the creative industries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, proposing that it could be transformed into a mutual organization owned by its postmasters. This move aims to rebuild trust and reform the organization's culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which resulted in the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While the government stated it does not plan to reduce the current network of over 11,500 branches, it is seeking public input on the Post Office's ownership structure and future services, particularly in banking. The proposal is seen as a way to empower frontline workers and prevent similar scandals. </p>

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market with high interest rates, this article reviews the national average for mortgage and mortgage refinance rates as of mid-July 2025. A 30-year mortgage averages around 6.70%, while a 15-year term is slightly lower at 5.88%. To secure better rates, experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, aiming for a score in the mid-to-high 700s, and comparing offers from multiple lenders, including those beyond a current mortgage provider. While rates remain elevated compared to previous years, there is cautious optimism that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring some relief to borrowers.

The lighthearted story provided a moment of amusement during the basketball game coverage, highlighting a funny intersection of sports, travel, and pop culture.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old inmate who escaped from a prison near Lyon, France, has been recaptured by authorities. The man orchestrated a highly unusual escape by hiding inside a large bag belonging to his cellmate, who was being legitimately released from the Lyon-Corbas prison. The escape, which was not discovered for 24 hours, highlighted what a prison administration director called a 'series of serious dysfunctions' at the facility, which is reportedly operating at 170% capacity. The man was found and arrested in a nearby town, though his accomplice remains at large as an internal investigation into the security breach continues.</p>

          <p>The price of gold reached $3,357.20 per ounce as of July 11, 2025, reflecting its continued appeal as a safe-haven asset for investors during times of economic uncertainty. This article outlines the multiple factors influencing gold's value, including supply and demand dynamics, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. The relationship between gold and interest rates is typically inverse; low rates make non-yielding gold more attractive. As a tangible asset, physical gold has historically maintained its value, making it a popular choice for those looking to hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring the use of specialized 'brain training' programs in schools to improve children's cognitive skills like working memory and attention, which some studies suggest have declined post-pandemic. A recent German study indicated that a 12-hour training program improved students' long-term academic outcomes, but the broader scientific community remains divided on the effectiveness of such interventions. Critics argue that the benefits of cognitive training often don't translate to real-world skills and that replacing core curriculum time with these programs could be detrimental, especially for disadvantaged students. Large-scale reviews have yielded inconclusive results, calling for more rigorous trials before widespread adoption.</p>

After the Office of Management and Budget director attacked the project as an 'ostentatious overhaul,' the Fed posted a webpage explaining the necessity of the renovations for its historic buildings, which haven't been updated since the 1930s. The Fed clarified that the project is self-funded, not paid for by taxpayers, and refuted claims of new 'VIP dining rooms.'

          <p>A new analysis by the non-partisan think tank Energy Innovation predicts a significant rise in U.S. household electricity costs over the next decade due to President Trump's recently signed energy bill. The legislation rolls back clean energy tax credits and expands fossil fuel leasing, which is expected to slow the development of cheaper renewable energy sources just as demand is increasing. The report estimates an average annual household cost increase of $170 by 2035, with states like Kentucky, Missouri, and South Carolina potentially seeing increases over $600. The changes are projected to increase reliance on more expensive natural gas. (not investment advice)</p>

In a recent interview, Biden asserted that he personally made every decision and that the autopen was used simply because of the large volume of documents.

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has signaled its intention to continue a 'moderately loose' monetary policy to support the nation's goal of achieving around 5% economic growth this year. A deputy governor of the central bank stated that the full effects of previous stimulus measures are still unfolding and that any future actions will be carefully calibrated based on economic conditions. This approach aims to stimulate domestic demand and stabilize market expectations. The announcement follows earlier measures in May, which included cuts to the reserve requirement ratio and key interest rates to bolster China's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Air China flight came within 300-400 feet of another aircraft over Siberia, a significant breach of the 1,000-foot minimum separation standard. The incident occurred when the Air China Airbus A350, traveling from Shanghai to Milan, made an unexplained and unrequested climb in altitude. Flight data shows the plane ascended from 34,100 to 36,000 feet over a 13-minute period. One possible explanation being investigated is that the Air China pilot may have misheard or misunderstood an instruction intended for a different plane in the same airspace. The event highlights ongoing concerns about aviation safety and communication protocols.</p>

          <p>Prominent boxing trainer Dave Coldwell has voiced his disapproval of Manny Pacquiao's upcoming world title fight against Mario Barrios, stating he will not watch the bout. Coldwell argues that allowing the 46-year-old legend to bypass a traditional comeback phase and jump directly into a championship fight undermines the merit-based system of the sport. He expresses concern for Pacquiao's health, noting that the boxer's high-energy style is difficult to maintain at his age and that his skills appeared diminished in a recent exhibition. The trainer fears the fight sets a dangerous precedent and hopes it does not lead to long-term harm for the iconic fighter.</p>

          <p>Emergency search operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been suspended due to a renewed threat of flooding. Heavy rains over the weekend have caused the Guadalupe and San Saba rivers to rise again, prompting new evacuation orders in several counties. The original disaster killed at least 132 people statewide, with 161 still missing in the Hill Country area. The initial flood was particularly devastating in Hunt, where the river rose over 20 feet in less than an hour, overwhelming a summer camp and leading to a high death toll.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United defender Axel Tuanzebe is suing the club for alleged negligent medical advice regarding an injury he sustained in 2022. The 27-year-old, who recently joined Burnley, has filed a high-value legal claim of over £1 million with the High Court. Tuanzebe, a product of United's youth academy, was sidelined for 195 days during his final season with the club before being loaned out. Having captained the team at every youth level, his career at Old Trafford was hampered by injuries before his departure in 2023.
