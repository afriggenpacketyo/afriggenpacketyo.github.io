          <p>Small businesses across the United States are grappling with severe financial pressure from President Trump's global trade tariffs, which have substantially increased the costs of imported goods. The article details the experiences of several entrepreneurs who have been compelled to take on high-interest loans, raise prices for consumers, and halt hiring or consider layoffs to manage the new duties. Economists featured in the article warn that the plight of these smaller companies could serve as an early warning for broader economic troubles. Their struggles highlight a potential ripple effect that may soon impact larger corporations and the U.S. economy as a whole.</p>

          <h2>Hospitality Experts Weigh In on Standard Tipping Practices for Bartenders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 08:30:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts in the hospitality industry are clarifying tipping etiquette for bartenders amid public confusion and reports of declining gratuities, particularly from younger generations. The general consensus suggests that a 20% tip is now the standard for mixed drinks and running a tab, evolving from the previous 15-18% norm. For simpler orders like a single beer or wine, a tip of $1 to $2 per drink is considered appropriate. The article also notes that factors such as exceptional service, the complexity of the cocktail, and being a regular patron can justify a more generous tip, while poor service may warrant a lower amount.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: U.S. Threats to Economically Decouple from China Highlight American Vulnerabilities</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Washington's strategy of threatening economic decoupling from China is a flawed approach that ultimately exposes the United States' own dependencies and vulnerabilities. The author contends that by waging a multi-year trade and technology war, the U.S. has positioned itself as an unreliable global partner, a label it attempts to place on China. The piece suggests that such aggressive tactics are unlikely to intimidate Beijing and may instead backfire by revealing the interconnectedness of the global economy. It frames China's recent restrictive trade actions as a direct and predictable response to American economic pressure, not unprovoked aggression.</p>

          <p>The UK government has been unsuccessful in its effort to prevent a judicial review of its decision to proscribe the direct-action group Palestine Action under terrorism laws. The Court of Appeal has permitted the challenge to proceed, allowing a High Court judge to review the ban next month. This legal challenge was initiated by the group's co-founder, Huda Ammori, following the ban which criminalizes support for or membership in the organization. Since the ban took effect, over 2,100 people have been arrested at demonstrations, with 170 facing charges for allegedly showing support for the proscribed group.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of millions of birds are killed annually in the United States from colliding with glass windows, a threat second only to habitat loss and predation by cats. During migration, birds are unable to perceive transparent or reflective glass, mistaking it for open sky or habitat, leading to fatal impacts. Volunteer groups like Lights Out DC monitor buildings to collect data and rescue stunned birds, highlighting that a few specific architectural designs are responsible for a large number of deaths. While new bird-friendly glass treatments and building codes are proving effective, advocates are focused on scaling these solutions to address the widespread and deadly problem.</p>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 and other global stock markets experienced a sharp downturn after two U.S. regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, reported issues with bad or fraudulent loans. This news ignited fears about instability within the banking sector, leading to a widespread sell-off that also affected major European and Asian indexes. Shares of prominent UK banks like Barclays and Standard Chartered dropped by over 5%. Analysts suggest that while there is no direct evidence of similar issues in UK banks, investors are reacting nervously to signs of poor risk management and loose lending standards in the U.S. financial system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gain popularity for their low costs and flexibility, financial advisors warn that common investor mistakes can significantly undermine long-term financial growth. One major pitfall is performance chasing, where investors follow market trends and buy into popular thematic ETFs, such as those focused on AI or crypto, often at their peak volatility. Another frequent error is ignoring expense ratios, as even small differences in fees can compound over time and lead to substantial losses in potential returns. Advisors stress the importance of aligning ETF purchases with individual long-term goals rather than succumbing to a herd mentality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is tightening its control over the global supply of rare earth elements by expanding its export regulations to include products made abroad using Chinese rare earth technologies. This move is part of Beijing's broader trade conflict with the United States, but analysts are skeptical about China's capacity to enforce these rules on a global scale. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China lacks the established legal frameworks, international licensing systems, and allied cooperation that the U.S. utilizes to monitor its technology exports. This deficiency could present significant challenges for Beijing in effectively implementing its ambitious new export control regime.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has ruled that the BBC committed a "serious breach" of broadcasting standards with its documentary "Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone." The investigation found the program was "materially misleading" because it failed to disclose that the narrator was the son of a Hamas official, a group proscribed as a terrorist organization in the UK. Ofcom stated this omission deprived the audience of critical context needed to assess the narrator's perspective, potentially eroding public trust. As a result, the regulator has ordered the BBC to broadcast a prime-time statement acknowledging its findings, a rare and significant sanction.</p>

However, the government has since published witness statements detailing large-scale espionage by Beijing, intensifying scrutiny of the Crown Prosecution Service's decision. Four parliamentary committees have now formally requested answers and are considering a formal inquiry.</p>

          <p>The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is under strain as the return of all hostage remains, a key component of the U.S.-brokered peace deal, remains incomplete. Hamas has stated it lacks the specialized equipment needed to locate and retrieve all the bodies from the rubble in Gaza. The U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, confirmed that American personnel will assist in the recovery efforts, which include finding the remains of two U.S. nationals. The process is fraught with difficulty and emotion, with Israeli officials warning that delays could be considered a violation of the agreement, potentially jeopardizing the fragile peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Trump-brokered peace plan for Gaza has established a ceasefire and initiated humanitarian aid, its long-term success is threatened by two major unresolved issues. The first is the lack of a specific timeline for the phased withdrawal of Israeli troops, creating ambiguity that could lead to disputes and stall progress. The second critical issue is the plan's vague provisions for Hamas's disarmament, which lacks clear monitoring and verification mechanisms. This vagueness allows both sides to potentially claim non-compliance, which could easily unravel the fragile agreement and risk a return to widespread conflict in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, known for her staunch support of Donald Trump and controversial rhetoric, has recently emerged as a vocal critic of her own party's leadership on several key issues. She has diverged from the mainstream Republican position on the government shutdown, particularly regarding the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies that affect millions of Americans, including many in red states. According to political analyst Tia Mitchell, this apparent shift is consistent with Greene's populist, hard-right values, which do not always align perfectly with the Republican party's evolving platform. Her willingness to challenge her party highlights a growing differentiation between the broader MAGA movement and Trump's specific directives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Robert Kiyosaki has issued a stark warning that the U.S. baby boomer generation faces a severe financial crisis that could leave many "wiped out" and homeless. He attributes this risk to inflation, excessive money printing by the Federal Reserve, and the projected insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, which could lead to benefit reductions. To protect against this potential downturn, Kiyosaki advocates for investing in assets that he believes are hedges against economic instability, such as gold and income-producing real estate. He suggests these tangible assets offer more security than traditional fiat currencies and financial instruments. (not investment advice)</p>

Abedi appeared at the Old Bailey via video link, where he entered not guilty pleas to multiple charges, including attempted murder and possession of offensive weapons.

          <p>Nottingham Forest's head coach, Ange Postecoglou, is under significant pressure just 38 days into his tenure, having failed to secure a single victory in seven matches. This difficult start follows his abrupt dismissal from Tottenham, where he had won the Europa League only weeks prior. It is understood that Forest is already identifying potential replacements, with a preference for a manager with a more pragmatic, defensive style, ironically similar to Nuno Espirito Santo, whom Postecoglou replaced. A defeat against Chelsea this weekend could seal his fate, with Fulham's Marco Silva and former Everton boss Sean Dyche reportedly on the club's radar.</p>

          <p>The BBC has confirmed its decision to air the upcoming series of "Celebrity MasterChef," despite the fact that its co-host, John Torode, was dismissed over the summer. Torode was sacked after an investigation upheld an allegation that he used an "extremely offensive racist term," an incident he claims to have no memory of. The broadcaster stated that it was not a "straightforward decision" but proceeded after consulting with all celebrity contestants and guests, who agreed to have the show broadcast. The series was recorded earlier this year before the allegations against Torode and former host Gregg Wallace came to light.</p>

          <p>The European Union Court of Justice has ruled that a pet traveling in an airplane's cargo hold is legally considered baggage, limiting the compensation airlines must pay if the animal is lost. The ruling stems from a case involving a passenger whose dog, Mona, escaped on the tarmac before a flight and was never found. The owner sought 5,000 euros in damages, but the court sided with the airline's argument that its liability was capped at the lower amount set for checked baggage under the Montreal Convention. The passenger's lawyer expressed disappointment, calling it a missed opportunity to advance animal rights.</p>

          <p>Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, has achieved a 37% reduction in drug overdose deaths since the national peak in 2023, the largest decrease among counties with the top 10 U.S. cities. This success is attributed to a comprehensive public health strategy that includes robust drug supply surveillance and widespread overdose prevention efforts. The city utilizes advanced technology like mass spectrometers to test street drugs for dangerous adulterants and quickly disseminate warnings. Additionally, Chicago has expanded access to naloxone and drug test strips, making them available in public libraries, and uses ambulance data to respond rapidly to overdose spikes at a hyper-local level.</p>

Experts express concern that misinformation and a reversal of vaccine policy under the Trump administration are creating a public health risk for neighboring countries.

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is characterized by an unusual political dynamic, according to Georgetown senior fellow Matt Glassman. Unlike previous shutdowns centered on unattainable policy demands, the current impasse revolves around a gettable issue: an extension of healthcare subsidies. However, the underlying issue is a deeper Democratic distrust of the president's willingness to honor any agreement. This has created a situation where the stakes feel both high, concerning executive spending authority, and low, due to the achievable policy goal. The lack of intense partisan animation and competing major news stories has also contributed to the shutdown feeling less like a crisis.</p>
