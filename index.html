          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill has lowered its same-store sales growth forecast for 2025 to be flat, a significant reduction from its previous low-single-digit projection. The revision comes after the company experienced a second consecutive quarter of declining customer traffic, with same-store sales shrinking by 4%. Executives attribute the downturn to broader economic concerns causing consumers to pull back on restaurant spending. Despite the negative quarterly results and forecast cut, the company noted that sales trends began to improve in June, driven by new promotions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share. The company's overall revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, with strong performance from its Search, YouTube advertising, and Google Cloud segments. However, Alphabet also raised its projected capital expenditure for 2025 by $10 billion to a new total of $85 billion, citing high demand for its Cloud and AI products. This increased spending forecast caused a slight dip in the company's stock during after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue for the second quarter, missing analysts' estimates for both earnings and overall revenue. The slump is attributed to a 14% drop in vehicle deliveries and a consumer backlash linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. In its report, Tesla mentioned it has started initial builds of a more affordable model, with volume production anticipated in the latter half of 2025. The company continues to focus investor attention on future projects like its robotaxi service and Optimus humanoid robots. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury records connected to the 2005 and 2007 federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg stated that her decision was bound by existing legal precedent in the Eleventh Circuit, which strictly protects grand jury secrecy with only narrow exceptions. The judge found that the government's arguments, based on public interest, did not meet the legal threshold required for disclosure. This ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to release more information about the case.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena compelling Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, to sit for a deposition in August. Committee Chairman James Comer stated that her testimony is sought to inform potential legislation aimed at combating sex trafficking and reforming the use of plea agreements in such cases. The subpoena comes amid intensified scrutiny of the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case, following a DOJ decision not to release more files. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein abuse underage girls.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is facing significant domestic and international backlash after President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law that places two key anti-corruption bodies under the control of the presidentially appointed prosecutor general. The move has sparked the largest anti-government demonstrations in Kyiv since the 2022 invasion, with critics arguing it undermines years of progress in fighting graft. Western allies, including the European Commission, have expressed strong concerns, emphasizing that an independent judiciary and robust anti-corruption efforts are essential for Ukraine's potential EU membership. In response to the outcry, Zelensky has pledged to submit a new bill to address the criticism.</p>

Dawson's recall came after an injury to Shoaib Bashir, and his performance was lauded for providing control and consistency.
