          <p>The Federal Trade Commission is investigating approximately a dozen advertising groups and watchdogs, suspecting them of violating antitrust laws by coordinating boycotts among advertisers. The regulator is examining whether these groups colluded to pressure advertisers to withdraw their support from certain platforms or content providers. This investigation raises concerns about potential restrictions on free speech and fair competition in the advertising industry, as well as the extent to which advocacy groups can influence advertising decisions. The outcome could significantly impact how advertising boycotts are organized and executed. The FTC's inquiry aims to ensure a level playing field and protect advertisers from undue pressure.

          <p>David Richardson, the head of FEMA, reportedly told staff he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, prompting confusion and concern within the agency. The comment was made as the hurricane season officially began and forecasts predicted an above-normal season.

Listings on TikTok Shop feature snacks and sweets without highlighting the 14 main allergens. Allergy charities warn that this poses a grave danger to allergy sufferers, as consumers are unable to verify the safety of the products. TikTok has removed some listings brought to its attention but continues to allow sellers to offer food without full allergen information, raising concerns about consumer safety.</p>
