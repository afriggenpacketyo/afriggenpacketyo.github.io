          <p>Singapore's headline inflation remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, slightly below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes transport and accommodation costs, also held firm at 0.6%, providing the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with room to potentially ease monetary policy. The MAS has maintained a subdued growth forecast for the second half of the year, citing global economic uncertainty and the potential impact of tariffs on the nation's export-dependent economy. This economic environment suggests a cautious outlook despite recent GDP growth figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's top administrative court has finalized the classification of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a "suspected right-wing extremist" group. This ruling allows the domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, to continue monitoring the party, which could include the use of undercover informants. The court upheld a previous decision citing sufficient evidence of anti-democratic tendencies within the AfD, particularly regarding the status of German citizens with migration backgrounds. This legal confirmation is a significant development in the ongoing scrutiny of the prominent opposition party.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released details of its planned 40% cut in foreign aid, reducing spending from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income to fund increased defense spending. The reductions will disproportionately impact Africa, with significant cuts to programs for children's education, women's health, and water sanitation. Aid organizations have warned that these cuts will harm the world's most marginalized communities, particularly women and children. While the government stated it will protect multilateral aid to bodies like the World Bank, the move marks a significant deprioritization of direct bilateral support.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a dismal 10-7 defeat to the Minnesota Twins, largely due to a catastrophic bullpen performance. In the sixth and seventh innings, Dodgers relievers issued a series of walks, allowing the Twins to score six runs on only two hits and turning a tied game into a blowout. The meltdown was compounded by sloppy fielding, including a critical throwing error that allowed three runs to score on a single play. This loss highlights the team's ongoing struggles in July and the severe challenges facing their injury-plagued relief pitching staff.</p>

          <p>Residents of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile are raising concerns about "overtourism," citing the proliferation of 72 tourist-focused gift shops along the famous thoroughfare. Locals argue that the dominance of these shops has displaced essential businesses like grocers and butchers, making the area less livable for families. The increase in international visitors and the conversion of residential properties to short-term lets have contributed to a decline in the local school's population. While tourism is a vital part of Edinburgh's economy, the situation highlights the growing tension between economic benefits and residents' quality of life.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Evidence Suggests Giant 'Terror Bird' Was Killed by a Caiman 13 Million Years Ago</h2>

          <p>A 13-million-year-old fossilized leg bone of a "terror bird" discovered in Colombia shows distinct teeth marks, suggesting the formidable predator was killed by an even larger reptile. Palaeontologists matched the bite marks to an extinct caiman species, which could grow up to five meters long. Terror birds were apex predators themselves, making this a rare glimpse into a battle between two top predators of the Miocene epoch. The lack of healing on the bone indicates the bird died during or shortly after the attack, providing new insights into the ancient ecosystem's food chain.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, federal judges in New Jersey voted to sideline interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump. The judges appointed her top assistant, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office instead. However, hours later, the Trump administration's Justice Department announced it had "removed" Grace, accusing the judges of a partisan move to undermine the president's authority. The rapid sequence of events has been condemned by New Jersey's Democratic senators as a blatant attempt to undermine judicial independence and politicize the state's top federal law enforcement position.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger's sudden guilty plea for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students has spared families a grueling trial but left many questions, including his motive, unanswered.

The case, which drew intense national media attention and fueled rampant online speculation, terrorized the small college town of Moscow. While some victims' relatives see the plea as a moment of closure, others feel they made a "deal with the devil."</p>

          <p>An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office has urged Chinese firms to become more deeply integrated with local economies in Southeast Asia. This advice comes as the U.S. cracks down on transshipments, with the Trump administration warning that goods diverted through countries like Vietnam to avoid tariffs will face steep penalties. By establishing genuine local operations rather than simply rerouting exports, Chinese companies can better navigate unpredictable trade policies. The recommendation highlights the growing pressure on Chinese businesses to adapt their supply chains in response to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

The initial certificate mentioned a failed TAVI procedure, but a revised version removed this, attributing his death to pneumonia. An unpublished review by the Royal College of Physicians, seen by the BBC, was highly critical of the care Mr. Holmes received, noting "poor clinical decision making at every stage." This case is part of a wider police investigation into a cluster of deaths following the same procedure at the hospital.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of "treason," claiming without evidence that he orchestrated a plot to undermine his 2016 election victory by linking him to Russian interference. Trump's accusation stems from a recently declassified intelligence report that he claims shows Obama's administration suppressed certain findings. In a rare response, Obama's office dismissed the allegations as "bizarre," "ridiculous," and a "weak attempt at distraction." The exchange marks a significant escalation in rhetoric, reviving disputes over the origins of the investigation into Russian election meddling.</p>
