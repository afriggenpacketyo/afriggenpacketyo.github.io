          <p>The Kremlin has pushed back against recent comments from President Trump that criticized Russia's military performance in Ukraine and suggested Kyiv could reclaim all its territory. A Kremlin spokesperson stated that Trump's assessment was likely influenced by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's perspective following their meeting at the UN General Assembly. While acknowledging economic pressures, the spokesperson asserted Russia's macroeconomic stability and resilience, rejecting the characterization of the country as a 'paper tiger' and instead calling it a 'real bear'. Despite the sharp rhetoric, officials noted the personal relationship between the two leaders remains warm.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged over 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal is part of renegotiations for a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. This move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in supply chains for critical minerals, which are essential for electric vehicle batteries. The deal, which has not been finalized, would provide taxpayers with an equity buffer to offset risks associated with the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oregon police have recovered partial remains in the state's oldest unidentified person case, belonging to a woman known as 'Oak Grove Jane Doe' who was killed nearly 80 years ago. The victim's dismembered body was found in burlap sacks in the Willamette River in 1946, but critical evidence, including her remains, later went missing from police custody. Investigators recently located the likely burial site at a cemetery in Oregon City and exhumed the degraded remains. Authorities are now hopeful that modern forensic testing can finally identify the victim and bring resolution to the decades-old mystery.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Rolex's CEO questioning whether the company is attempting to curry favor with President Trump to avoid tariffs on Swiss products. The inquiry follows Trump's recent appearance in the Rolex corporate box at the U.S. Open, which occurred shortly after his administration announced a 39% levy on Swiss exports. Warren's letter suggests the invitation may be an attempt to secure a special-interest exemption, drawing parallels to actions by other companies like Apple and Nvidia. The White House dismissed the concerns as 'asinine conspiracy theories,' while other Swiss watchmakers have responded to the tariffs with protest gestures.</p>

The Magen David Adom medical service reported that two of the individuals sustained serious limb injuries and were transported to a local hospital. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that attempts were made to intercept the drone before it hit the Red Sea coastal town.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Plans for the Northern Powerhouse Rail project, a key high-speed rail line intended to connect cities across the north of England, have been delayed once again. An announcement expected at the upcoming Labour Party conference has been postponed due to concerns over the long-term costs of the proposed Liverpool-to-Manchester line. The government is reportedly conducting an extended review to avoid the cost overruns and setbacks that plagued the HS2 project. This latest delay has caused frustration among northern mayors and stakeholders who see the project as vital for regional economic growth and improved transport links.</p>

The new album is described as having a classic 'Mariah' sound with a fresh twist and features collaborations with artist Anderson .Paak. The album's themes reflect her resilience, with one song, 'Nothing Is Impossible,' inspired by her recovery from a serious fall.</p>

This is one of several recent efforts by Republican lawmakers to honor Kirk, which also include proposals for congressional medals and a statue at the U.S. Capitol.

During her tenure, she was allocated a $3.5 million budget for mitigation efforts, which included public awareness campaigns and the introduction of rat birth control. While Mayor Adams praised her work and noted a decrease in 311 calls about rats, her resignation marks an end to this high-profile chapter in the city's ongoing battle against its rodent population.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly constructed homes in the U.S. surged by 20.5% in August compared to July, reaching their highest level since January 2022. This significant and unexpected increase occurred even as average 30-year fixed mortgage rates remained elevated throughout the month. Some analysts suggest the reported magnitude of the gain may be overstated due to the small sample size of the Census survey, though they agree the upward trend is directionally correct. The strong sales reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from a 9-month supply in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A financial advice column addresses the situation of a 55-year-old man facing a layoff who has accumulated $1 million in cryptocurrency but has not filed taxes for two decades. The advice strongly urges him to immediately hire a CPA and contact the IRS, noting that while the situation is serious, it is manageable, especially since he was employed and likely had taxes withheld. The columnist points out that the IRS typically requires filing for the last six years to be considered in good standing, but the man has likely forfeited years of potential tax refunds. The article also discusses strategies for early retirement using the 'rule of 55' for 401(k) withdrawals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has imposed 'maximum pressure' restrictions on Iranian officials attending the UN summit in New York, barring them from shopping at certain stores and purchasing luxury goods. A notice published in the Federal Register prohibits the delegation from visiting wholesale clubs like Costco and requires them to seek State Department permission for purchases of items valued over $1,000, such as watches and electronics. A State Department spokesperson stated the move is intended to prevent Iran's 'clerical elites' from enjoying a 'shopping spree' while their citizens face economic hardship and shortages, a situation exacerbated by U.S. sanctions.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is attempting to boost sales of its F-150 pickup truck by offering special financing rates to consumers with lower, subprime credit scores. The promotion extends lower interest rates, typically reserved for buyers with high credit scores, to those with a FICO score below 620. While such programs aim to make vehicles more affordable and reduce inventory, they also carry risks as subprime borrowers are more likely to default on loans. Ford Credit stated that it only finances customers it believes are creditworthy and that the promotion does not alter its fundamental credit decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show with an emotional monologue following a week-long suspension by ABC over his comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Visibly emotional, Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the murder or to blame any specific group for the actions of a disturbed individual. He also used his return to criticize threats to free speech, taking aim at the FCC chair and President Trump for what he called 'un-American' pressure. The show's return was preempted on some local affiliate stations, highlighting the ongoing political and corporate tensions surrounding the controversy.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered a massive and mysterious object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole. Such an object would have formed directly from the dense conditions shortly after the Big Bang, before the first stars existed. If confirmed, this finding would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that large black holes formed later from collapsed stars. While further observation is needed to verify the object's nature, its existence could force a significant revision of our understanding of how the universe's earliest structures evolved.</p>

          <p>Tom Brady has addressed criticism regarding his dual roles as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and a broadcaster for Fox, stating that only the 'paranoid and distrustful' see a conflict of interest. Critics argue that his broadcasting job gives him and the Raiders an unfair advantage by providing access to other teams' players and coaches. Brady countered that his passion for football creates an 'ethical duty' to improve the game, not a dilemma. The debate intensified after he was seen in the Raiders' coaching booth during a recent game, an action the NFL confirmed did not break any rules.</p>

The doctors argue that outsourcing care to the private sector diverts resources and that community health systems are often ill-equipped to handle veterans' specialized needs.

          <p>New changes from a recent Republican tax and spending law are set to reduce or eliminate food stamp benefits for millions of Americans. The legislation introduces stricter work requirements for a wider age range of adults and alters how benefits are calculated, potentially pushing 2.4 million people off the program entirely. These cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are occurring as grocery costs continue to rise, raising concerns among anti-hunger advocates about increased food insecurity.

An earlier renegotiation could add billions more to the league's revenue, potentially increasing the salary cap and further boosting team valuations, while giving media partners extended control over the highly valuable content.

The previous effort, which focused on 'saturation-style enforcement' of minor offenses, was found to unlawfully discriminate against Black residents and failed to reduce violent crime. Trump's new federal surge, supported by Tennessee's governor, appears poised to replicate this approach, raising concerns among local officials that it will strain community trust without addressing the root causes of serious crime like gun violence.</p>
