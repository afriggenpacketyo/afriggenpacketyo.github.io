          <p>Despite the stock market's recovery to pre-tariff levels, investors remain wary due to the uncertainty surrounding the final level of tariffs. The article highlights that while the administration has eased its trade offensive, businesses are hesitant to make investment decisions and consumers are pulling back on spending, slowing economic growth. Investors are finding themselves in a difficult position as they remain unsure of the economy's direction but are also reluctant to miss potential gains if tariffs are further lowered. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, refraining from lowering interest rates until the inflationary impact of the tariffs becomes clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee's Credentials subcommittee has recommended a re-vote for vice-chair elections due to alleged balloting irregularities, potentially jeopardizing the positions of David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta.

          <p>A federal court held its first hearing on President Trump's Liberation Day tariffs, raising questions about their legality under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The three-judge panel appeared troubled by the Trump administration's argument that the judiciary cannot review the tariffs' legality.

While the judges expressed concerns about the broad power Trump claims, they also struggled to find a clear legal rule to determine the validity of such tariffs, leaving the outcome uncertain.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing key parts of their bill to fund President Trump's agenda, including Medicaid cuts, despite significant internal disagreements. The article outlines the GOP plan to slash Medicaid spending through work requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, and restrictions on funding for certain services. The proposal faces opposition from both hardliners seeking deeper cuts and moderate Republicans wary of impacting constituents. While Trump has pledged not to cut Medicaid, the GOP plan aims to find savings through waste reduction, though the Congressional Budget Office estimates that millions could lose insurance coverage.</p>
