          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 12:25:01 EDT</div>

          <p>The first-ever Hermès Birkin bag, created for the late actress and singer Jane Birkin, has fetched over $10.1 million at a Sotheby's auction in Paris. This sale sets a new world record for the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic bag was designed in 1984 after Birkin expressed her need for a larger, practical purse to Hermès' then-leader, Jean-Louis Dumas, during a flight. The Birkin bag has since evolved into a globally recognized symbol of luxury and exclusivity, with demand consistently outstripping supply.</p>

          <p>Police in Northern Ireland have announced they will not help contractors dismantle a large bonfire in south Belfast, citing significant safety concerns. The decision came after a multi-agency meeting concluded that intervening posed a greater risk than allowing the bonfire to proceed. The bonfire, part of the annual Eleventh Night celebrations, has raised alarms due to its proximity to a major electricity substation supplying two hospitals and the presence of asbestos at the site. The event highlights ongoing cultural tensions surrounding unionist traditions in the region.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed plans to expand the company's robotaxi service area in Austin, Texas, and integrate the xAI chatbot, Grok, into its vehicles. The announcements come amid a turbulent period for Musk, who has been in a public feud with President Trump over a major tax bill, causing volatility in Tesla's stock. Musk also recently stepped down from his government role and is dealing with the departure of the CEO from his social media platform, X. These developments reflect Musk's continued push for innovation despite facing significant political and business challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's announcement of a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports has led to a surge in coffee futures prices, as Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer. The move, which President Trump described as a response to an "unfair trade relationship," has prompted Brazil's president to promise reciprocal measures. The article also notes a market rotation, with investors shifting from high-multiple tech stocks to lower-multiple industrial names. This reflects broader market uncertainty influenced by geopolitical and trade policy developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For savers deciding where to place a significant sum like $20,000, both short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and money market accounts offer competitive interest rates. While money market accounts provide more flexibility, including check-writing capabilities, their interest rates are variable and can change. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed, guaranteed rate for a set term, which often results in slightly higher earnings over periods of three to twelve months. The choice ultimately depends on the saver's need for liquidity versus the desire for a guaranteed return on their investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the enforcement of President Trump's executive order targeting birthright citizenship. The ruling, which certifies the challenge as a class-action lawsuit, comes after a Supreme Court decision limited nationwide injunctions but allowed for class-action relief. The judge found that the challengers, represented by the ACLU, were likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order was enforced. This legal victory for immigrant rights advocates represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to restrict the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.</p>

While excessive sun exposure carries health risks, a daily routine of about 15 minutes of morning sunlight can be beneficial.

          <p>Actress Rachel Brosnahan, who plays Lois Lane in the upcoming "Superman" movie, has shared insights into her portrayal of the iconic journalist. To prepare for the role, she interviewed real-life investigative reporters to understand the character's commitment to journalistic integrity. Brosnahan aims to challenge the misconception of Lois Lane as a "damsel in distress," emphasizing her capability and intelligence while acknowledging that even strong characters sometimes need help. The film, she notes, also explores Superman's humanity and his reaction to public sentiment turning against him, adding depth to the classic superhero narrative.</p>

          <p>The federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles is set to expire on September 30, a change enacted by President Trump's recent "big beautiful bill." Analysts predict this abrupt end will trigger a "summer of the EV" as consumers rush to purchase or lease eligible vehicles before the deadline. Automakers like Tesla are already urging customers to act quickly to capitalize on the savings. To qualify, consumers must take possession of the vehicle by the deadline, creating a sense of urgency that may lead to strong sales in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Amid the pressures of professional tennis, several top players at Wimbledon, including finalist Amanda Anisimova and world number one Aryna Sabalenka, are speaking about their mental health struggles. Anisimova, who took a seven-month break for burnout, highlights the importance of listening to one's body and mind. The grueling 11-month season, constant travel, and online abuse contribute to significant psychological strain. Players like Carlos Alcaraz and Madison Keys also emphasize finding balance, seeking therapy, and separating their identity from their on-court results to cope with the relentless demands of the sport.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists has discovered the tomb of Te K'ab Chaak, the founding ruler of the ancient Mayan city of Caracol, in Belize. This marks the first time an identifiable ruler's tomb has been found at the site. The king, who took power in A.D. 331, was interred around A.D. 350 with numerous artifacts, including pottery, a jadeite death mask, and carved bone tubes. The discovery provides crucial insights into the early history of the Caracol dynasty and its connections with other Mesoamerican powers, like the city of Teotihuacan, earlier than previously believed.</p>

The capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and the country's flag closely resembles that of the U.S. While some Liberians were not offended by the comment, others felt it reflected a lack of awareness about Africa's linguistic diversity and history.</p>

Although a federal judge has temporarily frozen the provision, the situation has created chaos and confusion for both patients and providers.
