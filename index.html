          <h2>Nvidia Plans to Restart Advanced AI Chip Sales to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 00:09:45 EDT</div>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, following assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary export licenses will be granted. This development reverses a previous halt caused by U.S. export controls designed to limit Beijing's access to advanced American technology. The policy shift comes after significant lobbying efforts by Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, who argued that the restrictions were undermining American tech leadership. Analysts view this as a major positive for the company, anticipating it will serve as a significant new growth catalyst in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>The murder trial of James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of poisoning his wife, began with jury selection, where the prosecution's focus on his internet search history is expected to be a central theme. Investigators allege Craig used a work computer to research "undetectable poisons" and make purchases of cyanide and arsenic before his wife's death in March 2023. His defense team had previously attempted to suppress this electronic evidence, arguing the searches went beyond the warrant's scope, but a judge denied the motion. The trial will likely feature significant debate over the admissibility of this digital forensic evidence and other key findings.</p>

          <p>China's Tianlong-3 rocket has successfully passed a critical ground-based stress test, a significant milestone for the private company Space Pioneer. The test simulated key mission phases, including lift-off and flight, using the rocket's nine-engine first stage. This success is particularly notable as it comes a year after a previous static-fire test ended in an explosive mishap where the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed. The company stated that the test confirms the structural integrity of the rocket's tail section, which must endure enormous stress during launch and landing, paving the way for future missions.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on constructing massive AI data centers in the United States to advance the development of "superintelligence." The first facility, named Prometheus, is set to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another multi-gigawatt cluster, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. Zuckerberg noted one of the sites could eventually cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan. While the announcement boosted Meta's stock, the article also highlights the significant environmental impact of such facilities, which are extremely intensive in their use of energy and water.</p>

          <p>A new report commissioned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews has found a significant issue with antisemitism in the UK, particularly within the NHS, and has issued ten key recommendations. The report calls for the creation of a standardized antisemitism training qualification and urges that Judaism be consistently understood as an ethnicity as well as a religion to ensure proper handling of discrimination. It specifically recommends that the NHS hold a summit to address what it calls an unaddressed problem, as many Jewish employees and patients feel unsupported or uneasy. The findings point to a broader failure to apply equal protections to Jewish people.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial over its potential liability in the 2019 death of Naibel Benavides, who was struck and killed by a Model S operating on Autopilot in Florida. Lawyers for the victim's family argue that the driver-assistance feature failed to warn the driver or apply the brakes before the collision. Tesla contends the driver is solely responsible, alleging he was distracted by a dropped cell phone at the time of the crash. The trial is significant as most past cases against the company have been settled or dismissed, and it will scrutinize Tesla's responsibility and the safety of its automated driving technology.</p>

          <p>Analysts in both the U.S. and mainland China believe it is unlikely that the United States will succeed in obtaining public commitments from Japan and Australia regarding their specific actions in a potential conflict over Taiwan. According to these experts, Washington's reported efforts to pressure its key allies reveal a weakening confidence in its own ability to manage regional tensions with Beijing. The push is seen by some as a strategy to amplify the perceived "China threat," thereby encouraging allies to increase their defense spending and military cooperation with the U.S., including purchasing American weaponry, rather than securing a firm defense pact.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico, ending a long-standing trade agreement that regulated prices. The Commerce Department justified the move as necessary to protect American farmers from what it terms unfair trade practices and artificially low prices. The decision has been praised by domestic growers, particularly in Florida, but faces criticism from others who warn it will increase consumer prices for products like salsa and harm U.S. businesses that depend on these imports. Mexico, which supplies approximately 70% of tomatoes to the U.S., has criticized the tariff as unfair. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration argues that conditions in Afghanistan have improved, while opponents and advocacy groups contend the country remains unsafe.

Four hijackers attempted to take over the plane to rob its wealthy passengers and hold them for ransom, but the plan went awry when the pilot resisted. In the ensuing struggle, the pilots were shot, and the plane crashed into the South China Sea, killing all but one person—a hijacker who was later identified. The event was so novel it was termed "air piracy" and predated modern security measures, ultimately foreshadowing the era of skyjackings that would transform global aviation.</p>

The study found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic sounds associated with distress, such as dehydration. While these sounds are beyond the range of human hearing, they can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. This groundbreaking research suggests that animals may use these plant-generated sounds to make crucial decisions about pollination, feeding, or seeking shelter, opening a new field of scientific inquiry.</p>

          <p>The official X account for the Sesame Street character Elmo, which has over 650,000 followers, was compromised by a hacker who posted multiple "disgusting" antisemitic and racist messages. The posts, which have since been deleted, included calls for violence against Jewish people and insults directed at Donald Trump. Sesame Workshop confirmed the hack and stated the account has been secured. The incident has drawn condemnation from organizations like the Anti-Defamation League, which highlighted the danger of using a beloved children's character's platform to normalize and spread hate speech on a social network already facing scrutiny over content moderation.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of superalloy turbine discs, a critical component in advanced aircraft engines. The method, developed at Dalian University of Technology, allows for faster cooling of the forged metal, which enhances the quality and durability of the discs. This breakthrough is crucial for China's ambitions to develop high-performance engines for its next-generation fighter jets, an area where it has historically lagged behind Western nations. The ability to produce more resilient turbine discs is key to increasing an engine's power, efficiency, and overall lifespan.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ contended that the agreement was limited to the district of Florida and did not grant nationwide immunity to potential co-conspirators like Maxwell, who was not even a known party at the time. This move seeks to uphold her 2021 conviction on charges of aiding in the sexual abuse of underage girls.</p>

          <p>Following a prolonged period of hot and dry weather, more regions in England are expected to be officially declared in a state of drought. The announcement is anticipated after a meeting of the National Drought Group, which includes the Environment Agency and water companies. England experienced its driest spring in over a century, and successive heatwaves have further depleted water levels in reservoirs and rivers. A drought declaration enables water companies to implement their management plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans, to conserve dwindling water resources amid the challenging conditions.</p>

Serafini was also convicted of the attempted murder of Spohr's wife, who survived the attack but later died by suicide. Security footage showed a hooded figure, identified as Serafini, entering the home hours before the attack. He now faces a potential life sentence for the calculated and brutal crime.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record volume of shipping containers in June, a surge attributed to shippers racing to import goods before President Trump's tariff deadlines on Chinese products. Port officials described this as a "tariff whipsaw effect," where shifting trade policy timelines create volatile swings in cargo volume rather than indicating sustained economic growth. While the numbers marked the busiest June in the port's history, executives anticipate that volume will likely ease once new tariffs take effect, making imports more costly for American businesses and creating continued uncertainty in global supply chains.
