          <p>Financial markets in Japan reacted positively to the news of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's planned resignation, with the Nikkei 225 rising significantly. Investors are reportedly optimistic about potential successors like Sanae Takaichi, who is viewed as pro-growth and supportive of deregulation. The announcement also impacted the Japanese yen, which weakened against the dollar, and government bond yields, which continued to rise amid fiscal uncertainty. The article also notes broader trends in other Asian markets and the global oil price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated that European leaders will visit the U.S. to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, while also indicating readiness for a new phase of sanctions against Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky endorsed the idea of secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia to cripple its war funding. The diplomatic activity follows Russia's largest aerial bombardment of the war, which hit a government building in Kyiv. U.S. officials are reportedly seeking more support from the EU to increase economic pressure on Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Norwegians head to the polls, the ruling Labour Party is projected to secure a slim majority in the parliamentary election. Opinion polls suggest its left-leaning alliance will win just enough seats to remain in power, though with a reduced majority compared to 2021. The election campaign focused on domestic issues like rising inflation and the quality of public services. However, global political instability, including the war in Ukraine and U.S. tariff policies, also played a significant role, potentially favoring the incumbent government due to a desire for stability.</p>

          <p>Following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, Sanae Takaichi and Shinjiro Koizumi are the leading candidates to succeed him, with Takaichi's election potentially making her Japan's first female prime minister. Opinion polls show the two are nearly tied in public support. Experts describe Takaichi as a decisive figure with strong, radical policy ideas, while Koizumi is seen as a "safe pair of hands" who could more easily build consensus. The leadership change occurs as Japan grapples with a cost of living crisis and the aftermath of a new trade deal with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is set to inaugurate the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), the largest in Africa, which will double the country's electricity generation capacity. While Ethiopia frames the project as a key to regional development and energy export, downstream nations Egypt and Sudan express deep concern over its impact on their water supplies. The Blue Nile is a vital resource for both countries, and they have long opposed Ethiopia's unilateral control over the river's flow. Despite years of failed negotiations for a legally binding agreement on the dam's operation, experts note that joint management could help mitigate regional climate challenges.</p>

          <p>A former British Army Sergeant Major, Michael Webber, has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting 19-year-old Gunner Jaysley Beck, who took her own life in 2021. An inquest previously found that the Army's mishandling of her complaint contributed to her death, as superiors reportedly pressured her to drop the allegations and failed to report the assault to the police. Beck's family stated they believe she would still be alive if the chain of command had acted properly. The Army has since apologized and stated it has implemented a zero-tolerance policy for such behavior.</p>

          <p>Germany's football manager, Julian Nagelsmann, drew criticism for his post-match analysis following a 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier. Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland's style of play as reliant on "long balls and second balls" and "not brilliant to watch," which pundits labeled as disrespectful. Critics pointed out that Germany also employed long-ball tactics during the match. The comments are expected to add intensity to the reverse fixture in Belfast, where the German team may face a more hostile reception from fans.</p>

          <p>China's export growth slowed to a six-month low in August, with overall shipments rising only 4.4%, missing economists' expectations. A significant factor was a 33% plunge in exports to the United States, attributed to fading trade truce effects and a U.S. crackdown on transshipments. While exports to regions like the EU and Southeast Asia surged, the slowdown highlights pressure on the Chinese economy. Muted import growth also points to sluggish domestic demand, increasing speculation about potential new fiscal support from Beijing to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro have held rallies in major cities just days before a Supreme Court ruling on his alleged coup attempt. Demonstrators gathered in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasília, with some demanding amnesty for those involved in the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings. Bolsonaro and several co-defendants are accused of plotting to overturn the 2022 election result. If convicted, he could face over 40 years in prison and would be the first former president in Brazil's history convicted of such a crime.</p>

          <p>Beijing has sanctioned Seki Hei, a conservative Japanese lawmaker, for what it describes as spreading falsehoods and undermining Chinese sovereignty. The Chinese foreign ministry stated that Seki, who is China-born, has made false claims regarding sensitive issues like Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Under the sanctions, any assets Seki holds in China will be frozen, and he and his immediate family are banned from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macau. This action represents a rare instance of China directly sanctioning an individual foreign lawmaker.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by a joint China-US research team has revealed that Mars, like Earth and the Moon, possesses a solid inner core. This finding was unexpected, as models suggested the planet had not cooled sufficiently to form one. By analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, scientists determined the solid core has a radius of about 600km. The discovery challenges existing theories about planetary formation and could revive the debate over whether Mars once had plate tectonics. The presence of a solid core suggests Mars's thermal history may be different than previously understood.</p>

          <p>Following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai manufacturing facility in Georgia that resulted in the detention of approximately 300 South Korean workers, former President Donald Trump has publicly called on foreign companies to respect U.S. immigration laws. In a social media post, he urged these companies to hire and train American workers while welcoming their investments. The raid, conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is the largest single-site sweep under Trump's anti-immigration campaign and has raised concerns about its impact on U.S.-South Korea relations.</p>
