          <p>Several local councils in the UK are proceeding with legal action to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, despite a Court of Appeal ruling that overturned a temporary injunction. The ruling was seen as a potential precedent, but councils argue the hotels' change of use constitutes a planning breach and public safety risk. The situation has become a political flashpoint, sparking both protests and counter-demonstrations, as the government aims to reduce its reliance on hotels for asylum accommodation amid rising application numbers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has declared that most of Donald Trump's 'reciprocal tariffs' were illegally imposed, ruling that the president overreached his emergency powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump used for justification, does not grant the authority to impose such taxes. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October, setting the stage for a significant legal battle at the Supreme Court with major implications for the U.S. economy and global trade.</p>

          <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has initiated a nationwide review of public housing to identify and remove residents who are in the country illegally. Under the directive, Public Housing Authorities have 30 days to conduct an audit to verify citizenship or eligible immigration status, with non-compliance potentially risking federal funding. The move, framed by HUD Secretary Scott Turner as prioritizing American citizens, has been praised by some Republicans while others raise concerns about diverting resources from serving eligible residents.</p>

          <p>After a landmark study identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor to Iowa's severe water quality problems and associated health risks, public officials have quietly eliminated the funding intended to promote the report's findings. The scientific report, which connects contaminants to the state's high cancer rates, has been controversial due to the economic and political influence of Iowa's farm industry. Critics and environmental advocates worry this move is a deliberate attempt to suppress the study's conclusions and impede necessary public health and environmental reforms.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist investment firm, has acquired a significant stake in Rexford Industrial Realty, a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in Southern California industrial properties. The move suggests Elliott will likely advocate for substantial changes at Rexford, targeting issues such as corporate governance, capital allocation, and overall shareholder value. This activist engagement could potentially lead to a strategic review or even catalyze a merger or acquisition, given Elliott's history with other REITs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's effort to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is being viewed by legal and financial experts as an unprecedented move that threatens the central bank's long-standing political independence. Critics argue that successfully politicizing the Fed would undermine the stability of the U.S. financial system by allowing short-term political goals to dictate monetary policy. Such a shift could erode the Fed's credibility, which has been built over decades, and potentially lead to severe economic consequences like hyperinflation.</p>

While overall visitor counts are down, Nevada's gaming revenue has remained strong, indicating that visiting gamblers are still spending heavily.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two civilian workers for their role in the 2021 Red Hill fuel spill that contaminated the drinking water for 90,000 people at Pearl Harbor. The indictment alleges the workers provided the Navy with false information about the quantity of jet fuel spilled months before it seeped into the water supply, leading to 6,000 people falling ill. These are the first criminal charges in the case, which exposed significant management failures and led to the permanent closure of the facility.</p>
