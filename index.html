            <p>Amid fears of a global trade war, US stocks experienced a volatile session as China and the European Union imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods following President Trump's increased levies on Chinese products, raising the cumulative tariff rate to 104%. This prompted a selloff in US Treasury markets, causing bond yields to rise, while key Asian and European markets also declined. China has vowed to retaliate with their own set of measures.

            <p>Adrian Chiles laments the increasing prevalence of people playing sound from their phones on public transport without headphones, creating a cacophony of noise. He recounts a past experience of offering his headphones to a child playing a cartoon on a train, highlighting the rarity of such behavior today. He reflects on whether this behavior is intentional, a giant two-fingered gesture, and seeks explanations for the change in public etiquette.</p>
