          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Alex Jones's Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver. The assets, including the company's brand name and equipment, will be sold to help pay the $1.3 billion Jones owes to the families of Sandy Hook victims for his false conspiracies about the 2012 school shooting. This move to state court could expedite the liquidation process and potentially lead to the brand being sold to the satirical site The Onion, which the families support. Jones has decried the ruling but faces the prospect of losing his platform and having future earnings garnished.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rising tariffs on imported goods are causing significant price increases for items like coffee, tea, and spices, placing a heavy burden on small businesses and consumers. Coffee prices, for example, have surged 14.5% year-over-year, forcing shop owners to raise their own prices to maintain thin profit margins. Importers of goods not produced in the U.S., such as coffee beans, have limited options to avoid these costs, and many small, quality-focused brands fear being pushed out of the market. The article highlights concerns that these tariffs, intended to penalize other countries, ultimately harm American businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who now chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, held a virtual meeting with House Democrats to discuss strategies against what they term Republican gerrymandering efforts. The discussion focused heavily on Texas, where the GOP-led state legislature is advancing a new congressional map that could significantly favor their party. In response to the situation in Texas, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to redraw his state's own congressional map in retaliation. The escalating national conflict over redistricting highlights the high stakes for control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain head coach Luis Enrique made the bold decision to drop star goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma for the Super Cup match against Tottenham, opting instead for newly signed Lucas Chevalier. Despite Donnarumma's crucial role in their Champions League victory, Enrique is seeking a "different profile" of goalkeeper who is more skilled with the ball at his feet to fit the team's possession-based style. Chevalier, who was named Ligue 1's best goalkeeper last season, made his debut in the match, which PSG won on penalties after a 2-2 draw. The move signals a strategic shift for the European champions.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study conducted in Sweden suggests that drug treatments for ADHD may have significant long-term benefits beyond managing core symptoms. Researchers found that individuals taking ADHD medication had notable reductions in their risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal activity. The findings, based on data from over 148,000 people, provide strong evidence that medication helps by reducing impulsivity and improving concentration. This research could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about treatment, highlighting the potential for medication to mitigate serious life risks associated with untreated ADHD.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization has led to mass arrests and a complex legal battle. Over 700 protesters, many of them elderly, have been arrested for showing support for the banned group, creating a challenge for the justice system. The future of the ban hinges on three key legal fronts: the prosecution of the individual supporters, upcoming trials of group members for alleged violent criminal damage, and a High Court challenge to the legality of the ban itself. This article explores how these court cases will ultimately define whether the proscription is a justifiable counter-terrorism measure or a disproportionate crackdown on protest.</p>

          <p>The government of Nova Scotia has implemented a sweeping ban on entering all wooded areas for activities like hiking and fishing, citing extreme wildfire risk due to prolonged dry conditions. The move, which includes a C$25,000 fine for violators, has been labeled as "draconian" by civil liberties groups, who argue it is an overreach of authority. Premier Tim Houston defended the restrictions, stating the province is a "tinder box" and that nearly all wildfires are human-caused. The ban has sparked a debate between those who see it as a necessary safety precaution and others who view it as an infringement on personal freedoms.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the digital payment network Zelle. The suit alleges that EWS knowingly launched the service with design flaws that made it highly susceptible to fraud, leading to over $1 billion in consumer losses between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit claims that features like a quick, unverified registration process and limited transaction information made it easy for scammers to exploit users. EWS, which is co-owned by seven major U.S. banks, has dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt," but the action seeks restitution for affected New Yorkers.</p>

For most of the match, Spurs effectively neutralized the European champions, leading 2-0 until the final minutes by employing a pragmatic, organized, and efficient style of play. Both of Tottenham's goals came from set-pieces, a clear indicator of Frank's tactical influence. While the inability to close out the game highlights areas for improvement, the performance suggested that the team is adapting well to a new system that prioritizes results over the high-risk approach of their previous manager.</p>

          <p>Nine years after legalizing Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), Canada is experiencing a surge in demand that has far outpaced predictions and raised complex ethical questions for clinicians. The country's system, which heavily emphasizes patient autonomy, allows individuals to choose MAID even if they have not exhausted all other treatment options, as long as they are aware of them. This principle has led to challenging cases, such as patients with curable diseases requesting MAID, forcing doctors to navigate a law with broad discretionary criteria. The rapid cultural acceptance and systemic promotion of MAID as an option are contributing to its unexpectedly high uptake.</p>

Although the 1973 Home Rule Act granted D.C. a local mayor and council, Congress retains ultimate authority.

The ruling is a significant blow to global health and humanitarian programs, as the withheld money includes funding for HIV/AIDS prevention.

          <p>A New York man has been arrested and charged with cyberstalking for allegedly leaving a series of threatening voicemails for Paulette Thompson, the widow of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The profanity-laced messages were left just hours after her husband was fatally shot in Manhattan in December, with the suspect calling the CEO a "capitalist pig" and warning that his family deserved to die. Investigators linked the suspect to the calls via his cellphone number. The suspect's alleged actions added to the family's suffering following the high-profile murder, for which another man has been charged.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs' independent inspector general has found that all VA hospitals are experiencing "severe" staff shortages, which have increased by 50% this fiscal year. The investigation revealed that 94% of facilities face a severe shortage of doctors, and a majority also lack sufficient nurses, psychologists, and police officers. This report comes as the VA is undergoing a department-wide reduction of 30,000 workers under the Trump administration. While the VA's press secretary disputed the report's methodology, a lawmaker stated the findings confirm fears that staff shortages are decreasing healthcare access and choice for veterans.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is on track to become the first hurricane of the 2025 season. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands and is moving westward, with forecasters predicting it will strengthen into a major hurricane by the time it approaches the Caribbean islands late this week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain. Erin is the fifth named storm of what NOAA has predicted to be an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, with five to nine storms expected to reach hurricane strength.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 high-ranking cartel members to the United States to face justice. The group includes prominent figures from the Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels, such as Abigael González Valencia, a leader of the allied "Los Cuinis" organization. This move comes as the U.S. increases pressure on Mexico to crack down on drug trafficking and fentanyl production. Mexican officials stated the transfers were a sovereign decision to dismantle criminal networks, while the U.S. Attorney General praised the collaboration in holding the criminals accountable for their crimes against the country.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable financial turnaround, the Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable franchise in the NFL, according to a new Sportico ranking. This represents a massive increase from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was last in the league with a valuation of $930 million. The surge in value is largely attributed to the team's relocation to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium by owner Stan Kroenke. The valuation reflects the successful monetization of the venue and the team's strong corporate and fan support in the major market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appeals court has denied rapper Tory Lanez's petitions to introduce new evidence in his case concerning the 2020 shooting of Megan Thee Stallion. Lanez, who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for the assault, sought to present a new statement from a security guard and challenge the fact that his driver did not testify. The court's denial is the latest setback in his efforts to overturn his 2022 felony conviction for assault with a firearm. Megan Thee Stallion's legal team has maintained that the case was properly adjudicated and that Lanez was convicted by a jury of his peers.</p>

Rare footage obtained by the BBC shows desperate civilians and volunteers at a community kitchen resorting to animal feed for sustenance.

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, experienced record-breaking flooding after an ice-dammed basin near the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive volume of water. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and threatening homes along the riverbank. This annual "outburst flood" is caused by a basin that fills with meltwater and rainwater each summer until the pressure forces a release. This year, newly installed temporary barriers helped prevent widespread damage to hundreds of homes, though some areas and trails in the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area were left underwater as the community grappled with the increasingly severe event.</p>

During the announcement at the arts center, Trump mused that he had never received an honor himself and joked about giving himself one. The move is seen as part of a broader effort by the Trump 2.0 administration to assert influence over the nation's cultural institutions.</p>

The pursuit, which began with a carjacking and shooting in Lancaster, saw the suspects steal two more vehicles, including a semi-truck, before ending up under a freeway overpass in Boyle Heights. Law enforcement sources believe the pair escaped from their final stolen vehicle with the help of accomplices in another car. The successful evasion is unusual for such a high-profile, televised chase and highlights the challenges police face when suspects use tactics to evade aerial surveillance.</p>
