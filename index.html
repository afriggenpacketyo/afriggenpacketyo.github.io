          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the thirteenth named storm of the Atlantic season, is tracking towards the Caribbean and is expected to bring significant rainfall to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane watch for parts of Haiti, as the storm could strengthen over warm ocean waters and potentially reach hurricane status. While its long-term path remains somewhat uncertain, current forecasts indicate it is not anticipated to have a major impact on the mainland United States. Forecasters are warning of the potential for life-threatening flash floods and landslides across the affected island nations due to the heavy downpour.</p>

          <p>Tracey Connelly, the mother of Peter Connelly, widely known as 'Baby P,' is making a new bid for release from prison. She was recalled for a second time in August 2024 for breaching her license conditions by secretly starting a relationship without informing her supervising officials. The parole board heard that this behavior mirrored the circumstances of her first recall, raising concerns about her tendency to prioritize relationships over the safety of children. Baby P died in 2007 after suffering more than 50 injuries, despite numerous visits from social services, police, and health professionals, leading to a case that shocked the nation.</p>

          <p>Major Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including Sinochem Holdings and China Huaneng Group, are relocating their headquarters to the Xiongan New Area, a city personally championed by President Xi Jinping. This strategic move is part of a broader plan to alleviate congestion in Beijing by transferring non-capital functions to the new economic zone, located about 60 miles southwest of the capital. Launched in 2017, Xiongan is envisioned as a hub for innovation and development, with the influx of SOEs expected to attract further investment and talent. The relocations aim to vitalize the city, though challenges related to the commute for employees remain.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old high school cheerleader in Pinson, Alabama, has died from injuries sustained after being shot at a bonfire party. The victim, Kimber Mills, was reportedly caught in the crossfire during a fight involving a 27-year-old suspect who was unknown to the partygoers and had initiated a confrontation. The suspect has since been charged with three counts of attempted murder, and Mills is being remembered by her community for her vibrant personality and aspirations to become a nurse. Her family arranged for her to be an organ donor, fulfilling her wishes in the wake of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris has reopened to the public after being closed for several days following a significant jewel heist, though the Apollo Gallery where the theft occurred remains sealed for investigation. Thieves stole historically significant jewels estimated to be worth €88 million, prompting renewed scrutiny of security measures at France's major cultural institutions. President Emmanuel Macron has ordered an acceleration of security enhancements at the museum. The Louvre's director, Laurence des Cars, is facing questioning from French senators about the security failures that allowed the organized crime group to succeed in the high-profile robbery.</p>

          <p>The planned reopening of Khartoum International Airport in Sudan was derailed by a series of drone attacks attributed to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The airport, which has been closed for over 30 months due to the country's devastating civil war, was scheduled to resume domestic flights as a sign of the government's control over the capital. However, explosions near the facility forced a delay, highlighting the ongoing instability and the RSF's intent to disrupt government efforts to normalize life.

The report highlights that 29% of employees feel guilty or pressured to demonstrate commitment by not using their leave, while 25% believe their manager would react negatively to a request for a full week off.

          <p>A peculiar natural event has occurred in Seaside, Oregon, where thousands of small, translucent sea cucumbers have washed up along the beach. The creatures, known as skin-breathing sea cucumbers, typically live burrowed in the sand but were dislodged by a combination of heavy surf and low tides, scattering them across more than two miles of shoreline. According to the Seaside Aquarium, this phenomenon happens infrequently when specific ocean conditions align. The stranded sea cucumbers are unable to return to the water and will become a food source for other beach-dwelling invertebrates before decomposing and blending back into the sand.</p>

This comes amid demands for greater transparency in royal finances after documents revealed the prince paid a large lump sum upfront for renovations in lieu of significant annual rent on the 75-year lease. Critics, including Baroness Margaret Hodge, have labeled the arrangement a 'rotten deal' for taxpayers, as the profits from the independently run Crown Estate go to the Treasury.

          <p>Homeowners with a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) may be in a good position to request a credit limit increase, providing a financial buffer amid economic uncertainty. To qualify, lenders typically assess a borrower's improved financial profile, including a higher credit score, lower debt-to-income ratio, and any appreciation in home value, which may require a new appraisal. Homeowners can request a modification from their current lender or refinance the HELOC for a larger amount. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, variable HELOC rates may become more favorable, potentially making it easier for borrowers to qualify for a higher limit.

          <p>Chinese authorities have launched a renewed crackdown on underground Christian 'house churches,' which operate outside the state-sanctioned religious institutions controlled by the Communist Party. Recently, about 30 pastors and members of the Zion Protestant Church, one of China's largest unofficial congregations, were arrested across seven provinces on charges of illegally disseminating religious content online. This move reflects President Xi Jinping's broader policy of 'Sinicization' of religion, which has led to a significant deterioration of religious freedoms over the past decade. International observers, including U.S. and German officials, have condemned the arrests and called for the release of those detained.</p>

          <p>China is planning to invite guests from Taiwan to a major event commemorating the 80th anniversary of the 'Restoration of Taiwan,' which marks Japan's surrender of sovereignty over the island. The announcement was made by Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, which framed the event as a shared victory for all Chinese people, including Taiwanese compatriots. This move comes despite warnings from the government in Taipei against attending such events. The commemoration is part of Beijing's ongoing efforts to reinforce its historical claims over Taiwan, which it views as a province to be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary.</p>

Police identified and located the mother after releasing security camera footage showing a woman carrying the infant. The baby was taken to a hospital and is reported to be in stable condition, while the city's Administration for Children's Services is involved to ensure her well-being.

          <p>Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to rising inflation, with consumers bearing a significant portion of the cost, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The research found that industries heavily reliant on imports, such as furniture, auto parts, and electronics, have seen notable price hikes. Economists determined that from June to August, the tariffs added 0.5 percentage points to the headline inflation rate. While businesses are still in the early stages of passing on costs, studies suggest that consumers could ultimately shoulder over half of the financial burden from the levies.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has formally requested a pause on the demolition, urging a public review process for the landmark site.

His approach marks a sharp deviation from the traditionally secular stance of military leadership, raising concerns among current and former service members about the separation of church and state.
