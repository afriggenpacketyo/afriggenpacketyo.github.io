          <p>Monica Sementilli has been found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors successfully argued she conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to stage the murder as a burglary to collect on a large life insurance policy. Key evidence included text messages, secretly recorded conversations, and Baker’s eventual no-contest plea, though he later testified Monica was not involved. Despite her daughters’ support and claims of innocence, a jury convicted her after an eight-year legal process, and she was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Amid the devastation from the Texas Hill Country floods, stories of bravery and survival are emerging from local residents. One man, Julian Ryan, is being remembered as a hero after he punched through a window to help his family escape their flooded home, suffering a fatal injury in the process. Another survivor credited her 19-year-old son with saving her life by holding onto her as they clung to a tree in the rushing water for an hour. The article highlights these personal accounts of courage and loss as the community grapples with the tragedy and continues to search for dozens of missing individuals, including children from a local summer camp.</p>

          <h2>Shohei Ohtani Shines on the Mound, but Dodgers' Bullpen Falters in Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 22:33:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his fourth pitching start of the season, Shohei Ohtani delivered another dominant performance for the Los Angeles Dodgers, throwing two scoreless innings and striking out the side in the second. Despite Ohtani's impressive outing, which included fastballs reaching 101 mph, the team ultimately lost 6-4 to the Houston Astros. The Dodgers' bullpen struggled, with long reliever Justin Wrobleski giving up five runs. While the loss clinched a series defeat, the game offered more encouraging signs of Ohtani's progress as a pitcher following his second Tommy John surgery, providing hope for the team's long-term rotation plans.</p>

          <p>A new biography titled "Mark Twain" by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow delves into the life of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, one of America's most influential writers. An excerpt from the book recounts Twain's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." The passage highlights Twain's mixed feelings of nostalgia and disappointment as he revisited the scenes of his youth. It captures the paradox of his life: the more famous and worldly he became, the more he yearned for the freedom and simplicity of his early years as a riverboat pilot.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time and charged with the murder of his wife, Suzanne, whose remains were discovered in a shallow grave in September 2023. The initial 2021 murder charges were dropped, but a new indictment reveals that a unique combination of animal tranquilizer drugs, known as BAM, was found in her bone marrow. Authorities state that Barry Morphew was the only private citizen in the area with access to this compound, which he had previously admitted to using on deer. Despite maintaining his innocence, Morphew now faces a new homicide trial after being held on a $3 million cash bond.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientific explainer details the geographical and meteorological factors that make Texas Hill Country, known as "Flash Flood Alley," exceptionally vulnerable to catastrophic flash floods. The region's steep hills, shallow soil, and the Balcones Escarpment combine to create rapid water runoff during heavy downpours, causing rivers like the Guadalupe to rise with terrifying speed. The article notes that Texas leads the nation in flood-related deaths and that climate change, which allows the atmosphere to hold more moisture, is exacerbating the risk of such extreme rainfall events. Improving forecasting models and public education, especially for drivers, are cited as crucial for enhancing safety.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old man has been arrested and charged with reckless conduct endangering life after setting fire to the entrance of a synagogue in Melbourne, Australia. The arson attack occurred on a Friday night while worshippers were inside sharing a meal for Shabbat; they all escaped unharmed through a rear exit. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the incident as a "cowardly" and antisemitic act of violence that has no place in the country. The attack is part of a rising wave of antisemitic incidents in Australia since the start of the Israel-Gaza war, with Jewish communities experiencing increased vandalism and threats.</p>

          <p>Recovery efforts are underway in Texas following catastrophic flash floods that have killed at least 43 people, including 15 children, with dozens still missing from a summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and leading to over 850 rescues. As Gov. Greg Abbott pledges full support, questions are being raised about the adequacy of weather warnings and the official response. Some critics point to recent budget cuts at the National Weather Service under the Trump administration, though officials maintain the storm's intensity was unpredictable and that warnings were issued.</p>

They recommend keeping CVs simple and tailored, using cover letters to show specific interest, and preparing thoroughly for interviews.

          <p>An analytical article examines how President Donald Trump is employing the "Madman Theory" in his foreign policy, using unpredictability as a strategic tool to coerce allies and adversaries. This approach, characterized by contradictory statements and sudden policy shifts, has created uncertainty about long-standing U.S. commitments, such as NATO's Article 5. While this has successfully pressured European allies to dramatically increase defense spending, its effectiveness against adversaries like Russia and Iran remains questionable. Critics worry the strategy could backfire by making the U.S. appear an unreliable partner, potentially pushing allies toward greater strategic independence from Washington.</p>

While some, like one man who received a £4,000 bonus towards his home deposit, praise the product, others are penalized by its strict rules. A key issue is the £450,000 property price cap, which has not increased since 2017 despite rising house prices, forcing some to pay a penalty to withdraw their own savings. Critics, including financial expert Martin Lewis, argue the rules are unfair and call for reforms to prevent savers from losing their own money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Real Madrid secured a spot in the Club World Cup semi-finals against Paris Saint-Germain with a 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund. The Spanish club dominated most of the match, with goals from academy products Gonzalo García and Fran García. A spectacular acrobatic goal from Kylian Mbappé in stoppage time appeared to seal the win, but a chaotic finish saw Dortmund score twice and Real Madrid's Dean Huijsen receive a red card. Despite the nervy ending, the win represents a strong start for new manager Xabi Alonso and sets up a highly anticipated clash between Mbappé and his former club, PSG.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Funding Cuts to HIV Research Threaten Progress, Experts Warn</h2>

          <p>Public health experts are expressing alarm over the Trump administration's recent cuts to funding for HIV and AIDS research, warning it could reverse decades of progress. While President Trump's first-term initiative to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S. by 2030 is still funded, broader research grants have been slashed. Dr. John Brooks, former chief medical officer for the CDC's HIV prevention division, fears this will lead to an increase in new infections. He notes that crucial work on an HIV vaccine and cure has been halted, and access to new, effective prevention drugs like PrEP could be severely limited for at-risk populations.

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business focused on competing with the Chinese Communist Party. His departure reduces the already slim Republican majority in the House to 219-212, at least until a special election is held to fill the seat in his solidly conservative district. This move further complicates House Speaker Mike Johnson's ability to manage his conference and pass legislation, a challenge recently highlighted during debates over President Trump's major spending bill.</p>

          <p>An executive order from President Donald Trump aims to curb the use of Chinese-made drones, but industry experts suggest that China's dominant position in the global market makes this a difficult goal to achieve. U.S. firms that rely on drones for commercial applications, such as inspections, note that there are very few non-Chinese manufacturers, and a ban would likely lead to significantly higher costs. While this is not the first attempt by Washington to challenge China's leadership in the drone industry, analysts and insiders believe that removing Chinese products from the supply chain will be a complex and potentially costly endeavor.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing sharp criticism for sending an email claiming that President Trump's newly signed spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled the statement as "blatant misinformation" and a "lie." The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, income-limited tax deduction for seniors. The communication from the typically apolitical agency has been blasted as a partisan political statement, with detractors arguing it misrepresents the actual effects of the legislation and undermines public trust in government communications.</p>

          <p>England delivered a powerful second-half performance to defeat Argentina 35-12 in their first Test match in La Plata. After a tight first half, England surged ahead with three quick tries, two from Tom Roebuck and one from Freddie Steward. Fly-half George Ford, earning his 100th cap, masterfully controlled the game, adding a drop goal and two crucial penalties to keep the Pumas at bay. While Argentina managed two tries of their own, England's clinical execution and strong defense, marshaled by Ford, proved decisive, setting a strong tone for the second Test next week in San Juan.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance since the 12-day war with Israel, according to Iranian state media. Footage showed him at a mosque in Tehran ahead of the Shia festival of Ashura, dispelling speculation about his status after he had only appeared in pre-recorded messages during the conflict. The war, which began in June, involved a surprise Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, followed by Iranian retaliation. Khamenei's appearance is being portrayed by state media as a sign of stability and leadership following the intense conflict that saw the killing of top Iranian commanders and scientists.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Environmental Science & Technology suggests that exposure to extreme heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy can negatively impact fetal development. Researchers found that exposure to high heat, particularly in the first trimester or even before conception, was linked to babies being smaller in the womb. The effect was nearly doubled for mothers in climate-vulnerable neighborhoods, which are often hotter and have less access to air conditioning. Wildfire smoke was also associated with smaller babies, with the combined effect of heat and smoke appearing to be even more detrimental, highlighting growing climate-related risks for pregnant people.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," aiming to serve as a deciding vote in Congress. The billionaire suggested the party could gain significant influence by focusing on a small number of key Senate and House races, leveraging the current razor-thin legislative margins to ensure the "true will of the people" is served. This announcement follows a public feud between Musk and President Donald Trump, primarily over Trump's recent major spending bill, which Musk vehemently opposed. Musk, a major donor in the 2024 election cycle, stated the new party would caucus independently and engage with both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

The meeting follows the toppling of the Assad regime by rebel forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK. Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future" and wants to ensure the new government is inclusive and provides stability, despite concerns over recent violent attacks on minority groups and restrictions on social freedoms. The UK has lifted sanctions and committed humanitarian aid, pledging to monitor the new government's actions closely.</p>
