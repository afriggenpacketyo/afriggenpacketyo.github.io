          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. secured a narrow points victory against Conor Benn in a highly anticipated boxing match at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The fight was a 12-round spectacle of aggression, with both fighters exchanging blows. Eubank's experience proved decisive, earning him the win with unanimous judge's scores of 116-112. This victory also gave Eubank bragging rights in a family feud that began 35 years prior, and Eubank Sr. reconciled with his son. This marks Benn's first professional loss in 24 fights.</p>

          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hussein al-Sheikh, a longtime confidant, as his deputy, signaling a potential succession plan amid growing concerns about Abbas's age and the future of the PA. This move comes at a time when the Palestinian leadership faces criticism for focusing on internal politics while the war in Gaza continues and Israeli military operations displace many in the West Bank. Some analysts view this appointment as Abbas's preference for his heir, while others consider it a cosmetic change to appease frustrated Arab officials. The appointment highlights the internal power dynamics within the Palestinian Authority.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by significant disruptions to global trade, characterized by tariff increases and reversals. After initially imposing tariffs on numerous countries, Trump temporarily paused some levies, calling for bilateral negotiations to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. However, continued trade tensions with China and a lack of progress in negotiations have unsettled investors. The unpredictable nature of Trump's trade policies has created uncertainty and raised concerns about the U.S.'s ability to manage the global economy.</p>

          <p>The 'Gran Abuelo,' an ancient tree in Chile estimated to be 5,400 years old, is facing threats from a proposed highway project that would cut through its protected rainforest habitat. This tree, a Patagonian cypress, is climate-sensitive, holding vital data for understanding climate change through its rings. Scientists warn the road would increase the risk of wildfires and damage the ecosystem. Despite government pushback, local residents and the scientific community are working to protect this invaluable natural resource.</p>
