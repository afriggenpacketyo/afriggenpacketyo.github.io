          <p>German special forces conducted raids across North Rhine-Westphalia, arresting a 27-year-old Bosnian-Herzogovinian citizen. The individual is suspected of financing a planned Islamist terrorist attack through fraudulent commercial activities. These operations, which took place in several cities including Essen and Düsseldorf, aimed to disrupt the plot and gather further evidence. The events highlight the ongoing threat of Islamist terrorism that security services in Germany continue to confront.</p>

          <p>Following the elimination of all 23 British players from the singles tournaments at Wimbledon, this article provides an expert analysis of the performances of key figures like Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu. It examines the high pressure players face at their home Grand Slam and what their results suggest for their future careers. While Draper's draw was unlucky, Raducanu's strong showing against the world number one indicates a potential return to the top rankings. The piece assesses both the disappointments and the positive takeaways for British tennis.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's railway system is undergoing a significant transition back to public ownership, with most train services set to be state-run under a new entity, Great British Railways. However, a debate is intensifying over the future of "open access" operators, private companies that compete with state-franchised services and are credited with lowering fares on certain lines. The new Labour government has expressed concerns about these operators, raising fears they may be phased out to protect the state-run system. This conflict presents a new crisis for the nation's perennially troubled rail network.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has praised Florida officials after Palm Beach County unanimously approved renaming a roadway "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." The four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard leads from Palm Beach International Airport to his Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump thanked the county and Governor Ron DeSantis for the "wonderful honor" in a post on Truth Social. The renaming is ceremonial, and the new signs are expected to be installed later this year.</p>

          <p>School food caterers in the UK are being forced to reduce portion sizes, use less meat, and opt for cheaper ingredients in student lunches due to escalating costs. The head of LACA, a school food organization, stated that government funding is not keeping pace with the actual expense of providing meals, which is now estimated to be around £3.45. Despite a recent government funding increase of only 3p per meal, schools are spending tens of thousands of pounds from their own budgets to bridge the gap. This situation raises concerns about the nutritional quality of food provided to children.</p>

          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham discusses her new Netflix series, "Too Much," which is loosely inspired by her own experiences moving to London.

Dunham explains how the show explores the cultural and social confusion of an American trying to navigate life and relationships in the UK. The series also features an extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Andrew Scott, Stephen Fry, and Jennifer Saunders.</p>

          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) dropped by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the most significant decline in nearly two years and continuing a multi-year deflationary trend. This fall was steeper than economists' forecasts and reflects a deepening price war among manufacturers amid weak consumer demand. In contrast, the consumer price index (CPI) saw a slight increase of 0.1%, returning to growth. Policymakers have criticized the aggressive price-cutting, which is hurting business profitability without significantly boosting consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European intelligence officials are increasingly concerned about a growing and more violent Russian-led sabotage campaign across the continent.

Officials note a shift from simple vandalism to more dangerous acts like arson and bombings, often carried out by recruited amateur proxies. This escalation, a response to the expulsion of Russian spies, raises the risk of serious injury or death as part of Moscow's disruption efforts.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States scales back its international development and foreign aid programs, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to fill the resulting gap. The piece contrasts the recent dismantling of USAID's independent status with China's launch of the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong. It suggests that Beijing's proactive role in global development, driven by expectations from the Global South, creates an opportunity for Hong Kong to become a prominent hub for providing international public goods. This shift represents a changing center of gravity in global cooperation.</p>

          <p>Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, has been released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise advocated on her behalf. Kashanian was detained last month despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. Following an outpouring of community support, Scalise asked the Department of Homeland Security to review her case, leading to her release. The case highlights the complexities and human impact of the administration's intensified immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>China has banned exports of dual-use materials and technologies to several Taiwanese companies, including a key supplier for Taiwan's indigenous fighter jet program. Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office described the move as a "stern warning" against what it calls provocations by separatist forces on the island. The new rules, which are effective immediately, are intended to safeguard China's national security and fulfill non-proliferation obligations. This action represents a significant escalation in economic pressure by Beijing on Taipei's defense and technology sectors.</p>

This sprawling operation generates hundreds of millions of dollars that are funneled back to the regime to fund its illicit weapons and missile programs.

Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has severely restricted women's rights to education, work, and freedom of movement. The Taliban has dismissed the warrants as "nonsense," but the move seeks to hold the regime's leadership accountable for their systematic oppression.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on imported copper, a decision stemming from a national security investigation into the metal's imports. The move, which is expected to take effect soon, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. The metal is a critical component in military equipment, construction, and electric vehicles, and the U.S. imports about half of what it consumes. This policy is part of the administration's broader strategy of using high tariffs to protect and boost American industries. (not investment advice)</p>
