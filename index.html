          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has sacked their manager, Ange Postecoglou, just 16 days after he led the team to a Europa League victory, their first major trophy in 17 years. Despite the 1-0 win over Manchester United in Bilbao, the club finished a dismal 17th in the Premier League after a season marked by 22 losses in 38 matches. Postecoglou, who had signed a four-year contract two years prior, had expressed optimism for the upcoming season. Thomas Frank, manager of Brentford, is reportedly a leading candidate to replace Postecoglou. The club's performance in the Premier League ultimately led to the manager's dismissal. Optimism for the future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a surge in measles cases, with 1,168 confirmed cases across 33 states, marking a near 30-year high. This year's figures have quadrupled compared to 2024, and the nation is on track to surpass the 1,274 cases reported in 2019, potentially reaching the highest number since 1992. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 95% of confirmed cases are among individuals who are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine, with one dose being 93% effective and two doses being 97% effective against measles. Vaccination rates have been declining in recent years, raising concerns among health officials.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump downplayed his public feud with Elon Musk, stating that Musk had "lost his mind" and that he was not interested in speaking with him. This exchange followed Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and immigration bill, which led to Trump suggesting the termination of Musk's government contracts and subsidies. Musk's father urged his son to end the feud, believing Trump would ultimately prevail. The White House characterized the dispute as an "unfortunate episode" and reaffirmed Trump's focus on passing his legislative agenda. Despite the heated exchanges, Musk later appeared to soften his tone, signaling a potential de-escalation of the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unpaid medical debt can negatively impact credit scores, but recent changes in credit reporting rules and available relief programs are easing the burden for many patients. Paid medical collections no longer appear on credit reports, and there is a one-year waiting period before medical bills sent to collections are added to credit reports. Smaller debts under $500 are excluded from credit reports altogether. Strategies for managing medical debt include reviewing and negotiating bills, applying for financial assistance, considering debt relief programs, and monitoring credit reports. Taking proactive steps can help individuals avoid collections and limit potential damage to their credit score.</p>

The operation involved cooperation between police forces from Britain, the U.S., and several European countries. Spain is a major gateway to Europe for drug trafficking networks.</p>

The decision comes after a series of attacks on Tesla vehicles and locations linked to the company.

          <p>The movie *Dangerous Animals* stars Hassie Harrison as Zephyr, a surfer who is kidnapped by Tucker, a boat captain played by Jai Courtney, who plans to film her being attacked by sharks. The film draws from serial-killer thrillers and shark survival stories but lacks narrative surprises or thematic depth. Despite Harrison's performance, the movie is a straightforward and underwhelming horror film. The film hints at the horror director's fixation with presenting unspeakable terrors, but fails to explore that connection provocatively.</p>

          <p>Agriculture experts are casting doubt on the FBI's claim that a crop fungus smuggled by Chinese students poses a significant threat to U.S. agriculture. The fungus, Fusarium graminearum, is described by prosecutors as a potential agricultural terrorism weapon. However, experts say it is a common type of fungus already widespread in U.S. crop fields that likely poses little risk to food safety. They note that the fungus has been in the U.S. for over a century and can be prevented by spraying pesticides, only becoming dangerous if ingested regularly and in large quantities. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI have declined to comment.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse is experiencing a rebound in traffic, with UBS analysts expressing confidence after meeting with the company's management. UBS estimates a 5% increase in second-quarter to-date same-store sales, which is particularly encouraging as dining trends normalize. The analysts raised their price target to $220 per share from $200, maintaining a buy rating. Despite concerns about beef inflation, the warmer season is boosting business. The company is still on track to open 30 new restaurants this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The movie *Bad Shabbos* is a farce that borrows from other comedies and fails to transcend its repurposed tropes. The film follows a Jewish family's Shabbat dinner that goes awry when a guest dies unexpectedly. The characters mostly come off as stereotypes, and the plot feels contrived. Method Man's performance as the building's doorman is a bright spot, but the film ultimately lacks originality and emotional depth. The movie's heart may be in the right place, but its execution falls short.</p>

The staff reduction is intended to streamline the Department and eliminate discretionary functions. The layoffs led to the closure of several offices tasked with enforcing civil rights and supervising federal student aid applications. Multiple parties have sued to save the department.</p>

The report, obtained by the BBC, states that "dominant personalities and a weak control environment facilitated opportunities to commit fraud" during the 2021 financial year. Auditors cited "unusual relationships" between former senior staff and Unite's customers and suppliers, as well as a culture that "did not challenge" financial transactions. The probe was ordered by General Secretary Sharon Graham shortly after she was elected in 2021. Unite took a financial hit of Â£53.8m on a hotel and conference center project in Birmingham.</p>
