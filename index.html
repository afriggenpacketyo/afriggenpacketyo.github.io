            <p>Several prominent figures who previously supported President Trump, including Joe Rogan, Dave Portnoy, and Bill Ackman, are now expressing concerns over his tariff policies. These individuals, influential in media and finance, are questioning the economic impact and strategic rationale behind the tariffs, which are disrupting global markets. Rogan has criticized Trump's approach to Canada, while Portnoy laments losing millions in the market turmoil. Ackman warns of an 'economic nuclear winter,' reflecting a broader unease among Trump's former allies about the potential consequences of his trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has cautioned that the U.S. economy is likely heading towards a recession as a result of President Trump's escalating tariff policies. Dimon pointed to the significant market decline as a factor that could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending. He encouraged the U.S. to negotiate trade deals while acknowledging his past support for tariffs, noting that the market's reaction could worsen if progress isn't made.

            <p>Delta Air Lines is scaling back its expansion plans for the second half of the year due to disappointing bookings, which CEO Ed Bastian attributes to the uncertainty created by President Trump's trade policies. The airline is revising its second-quarter revenue forecast and delaying updates to its full-year financial guidance. Bastian noted a decline in consumer and corporate confidence, impacting travel demand, particularly in the main cabin sector. While international and premium travel remain relatively stable, Delta's capacity will remain flat year-over-year, reflecting growing concerns about the economic impact of Trump's policies.</p>

            <p>China is escalating its trade war with the U.S. by raising tariffs on U.S. products to 84% in response to President Trump's latest import duties. This move follows Trump's decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on almost every nation, including a 104% duty on Chinese goods. China has criticized Trump's actions as unilateralism and economic bullying, adding American companies to an 'unreliable entities' list. Despite the escalating tensions, China maintains it is open to dialogue if the U.S. adopts an attitude of equality and mutual respect. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that a 'commercial solution' for British Steel is 'within reach' as the government considers nationalizing the Chinese-owned business. The company is at risk of running out of raw materials within weeks, raising fears over whether its blast furnaces which make high grade steel can keep running. It comes as the steel industry deals with a 25% tariffs on exports to the US, which came into force last month.</p>

Trump's next set of tariffs kicked in overnight, including a total rate of 104% on Chinese imports. China then retaliated early Wednesday, further embroiling the globe in trade turmoil. As Trump has started this trade fight with the world, equity prices have tumbled, with the S&P 500 losing 12% in only 4 sessions on growing worries he has triggered a recession.

The abuse did not come to light until both victims reported it to a family member years later, prosecutors said.</p>

Nonetheless, science is the only way to generate the foundational knowledge that enables technology, medicine and an understanding of how the world works, that can be applied for the benefit of humanity. Many science graduate schools are not accepting new students, many are rescinding earlier offers, and others are dramatically reducing their intake.</p>

On 27 March, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) called Sergei into the agency’s San Francisco office for a seemingly routine administrative appointment – and arrested him. Thatis why the couple decided that their best option would be to leave. They asked their lawyer to petition the government to release Sergei, so he, Marina and their daughter could depart the US and head to Serbia.</p>

            <p>Due to limited abortion training opportunities in the US, some doctors are traveling to Mexico for training. In 2023, MSI trained nine American doctors to perform abortions at clinics in Mexico. In 2024, it trained 27. So far this year, it is on track to double that number. Every abortion ban in the US permits abortions to save a patient’s life. But without adequate training, doctors may not be skilled enough to perform abortions even in those dire circumstances.</p>

The rate is 40 basis points lower than the same week one year ago. Much of the demand came from borrowers with larger loans, as they can get a bigger benefit from refinancing to a lower rate.

            <p>A full-scale trade war with China and the US is in prospect after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of more than 100% on Chinese goods imports. China has said it will "fight to the end" rather than capitulate to what it sees as US coercion, and will hike its own tariffs on American goods from 34% to 84% in response to the White House's latest move. The trade in goods between the two economic powers added up to around $585bn (£429bn) last year. Though the US imported far more from China ($440bn) than China imported from America ($145bn).
