          <h2>UK Government Eases Regulations for Car Manufacturers Amidst Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 17:30:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is relaxing regulations on car firms ahead of the 2030 petrol vehicle ban to support the industry amidst new US tariffs. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated the changes aim to protect and create jobs, while still committing to the 2030 deadline. The relaxed rules include easing mandates for phasing out petrol and diesel production, allowing smaller firms to continue making petrol cars beyond 2030, and extending the market presence of some hybrid vehicles until 2035. These measures are intended to help UK car firms navigate the challenges posed by President Trump's 25% tariff on imported cars to the US, a major export market for the UK.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $79,000, as cryptocurrencies joined a broader global market sell-off sparked by President Trump's restrictive global tariffs. The price decline followed a period where Bitcoin had largely resisted the market downturn, trading steadily in the $80,000 to $90,000 range. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and Solana, suffered even greater losses, each tumbling 9%. The Bitcoin sell-off triggered substantial long liquidations, with over $181 million in such liquidations occurring in the past 24 hours, indicating a shift in investor sentiment.</p>

          <p>The United States has revoked visas for all South Sudanese passport holders due to South Sudan's refusal to accept its citizens deported from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the US will also block any arriving citizens of South Sudan at US ports of entry, citing the need for every country to accept the return of its citizens. This action comes amidst growing fears that South Sudan may descend into civil war, prompting the US to order the departure of non-emergency staff from the country.

          <p>Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller publicly stated his opposition to tariffs exceeding 10%, distancing himself from President Trump's sweeping tariff plan. Druckenmiller reiterated his stance on social media, emphasizing his belief that tariffs should remain within the 10% range. He views tariffs as a consumption tax, partially paid by foreigners, and believes that the risks associated with tariffs in this range are outweighed by the potential rewards. His statement comes as stock prices have sharply declined following Trump's tariff announcement, causing significant market volatility.

          <p>Alex Ovechkin of Russia has surpassed Wayne Gretzky's NHL all-time scoring record, achieving his 895th career goal. Gretzky, a Canadian Hall of Famer, previously held the record since 1994. Ovechkin's historic goal occurred during a game against the New York Islanders, with Gretzky in attendance. The game was paused to acknowledge the moment, and Ovechkin celebrated with teammates and family. This achievement solidifies Ovechkin's legacy as one of hockey's greatest goal scorers.</p>

          <p>A federal justice department attorney, Erez Reuveni, has been placed on leave for not vigorously defending the Trump administration's position after a judge called a detention “wholly lawless.” Reuveni struggled to answer questions about the deportation of a Maryland man to El Salvador. Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, announced Reuveni's leave, stating that attorneys must vigorously argue for their client. The administration has appealed the case, and a ruling is expected soon.</p>

          <p>California has an opportunity to reduce emissions and improve climate resilience by investing in climate-smart agricultural practices. State programs assist farmers in adopting environmentally friendly methods that enhance soil carbon and improve water capture. However, these programs are underfunded, with farmer demand exceeding available funding. A larger allocation of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is needed to support climate-smart agriculture and benefit both farmers and the environment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered all national parks to remain open despite severe staffing shortages. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum's memo requires approval for any closures or reduced hours at park sites. The National Parks Conservation Assn. raised concerns, stating that the order sidelines the expertise of park staff. The order comes after the administration cut National Park Service workers, potentially affecting the agency's ability to maintain the parks and provide visitor services.</p>

          <p>As Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's NHL career goals record, Gretzky's legacy is being questioned. Once considered a Canadian hero, Gretzky's recent association with Donald Trump has alienated some Canadians. Gretzky has lived in the U.S. longer than in Canada, leading to a reevaluation of his connection to the country. With Ovechkin breaking the record, Gretzky's place in Canadian hearts is being reconsidered.</p>

          <p>On April 6, 1965, NASA launched the world's first commercial communications satellite, Intelsat 1, nicknamed "Early Bird." Built by Hughes Aircraft Company for COMSAT, it relayed phone, TV, telegraph, and fax communications. It provided direct and almost instantaneous communications between the U.S. and Europe. Early Bird also provided the first live TV coverage of a crewed spacecraft returning to Earth during the Gemini 6 mission. The satellite was briefly reactivated for use during the Apollo 11 moon landing.</p>
