        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Online retailer Shein has confidentially filed for an IPO in Hong Kong, a move reportedly designed to pressure UK regulators who have delayed approving its London listing. The company has faced scrutiny over its supply chain in China's Xinjiang region, a key sticking point in prospectus negotiations with both UK and Chinese authorities. This shift to Hong Kong follows an earlier pivot away from a New York listing due to similar regulatory and ethical concerns. Analysts remain skeptical that this will force the UK's hand, emphasizing the need to uphold strong governance and investor protection standards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Women in South Asia are reportedly entering menopause at a younger age, around 46-47, compared to the global average of 45-55. A US study also found South Asian American women begin menopause earlier than the general US population. Factors contributing to this accelerated aging process include genetics, vitamin D deficiency, and significant societal pressures that prioritize fertility over long-term health. The article highlights personal stories of women facing not only physical symptoms but also emotional and cognitive challenges, often with minimal medical or community support.</p>

          <h2>US to Resume Defensive Weapon Shipments to Ukraine After a Brief Pause</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon has announced it will resume sending defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a decision from the previous week to pause shipments. The move came at President Trump's direction, who stated that Ukrainians "must be able to defend themselves" against escalating Russian attacks. The initial pause, which included critical air defense systems like Patriot missiles, had surprised Ukrainian officials and raised concerns about US commitment. This reversal followed a productive phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been urgently appealing for more air defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Following the catastrophic flash floods on the Guadalupe River that killed over 100 people, scrutiny has fallen on Kerr County officials for not having an audible warning system. Records show that for nearly a decade, county authorities had discussed implementing high-decibel sirens, with a former sheriff advocating for them as far back as 2016. The former official specifically warned about the danger to summer camps along the river, citing a previous deadly flood. However, the plan was never funded, reportedly due to budget priorities and a desire to avoid raising taxes.</p>

          <p>England's children's commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, has reported that some children are living in "Dickensian" conditions, facing issues like rat-infested homes and lack of food. In a new report, she urges the government to scrap the two-child benefit cap, which limits benefits for families with more than two children. The report, based on children's own experiences, highlights a worsening situation over the past four years. While the government states it is working on a child poverty strategy, critics argue that lifting the cap would immediately pull 500,000 children out of poverty.</p>

          <p>One hundred years after John Scopes was tried for teaching evolution in Tennessee, the famous "Monkey Trial" remains a significant touchstone in America's cultural and political divisions. The 1925 case, which pitted defense attorney Clarence Darrow against prosecutor William Jennings Bryan, was a media spectacle that highlighted the conflict between modern science and religious fundamentalism. Historians note that the trial foreshadowed ongoing debates over issues like abortion, LGBTQ+ rights in schools, and the separation of church and state. While belief in evolution has grown, the cultural trench lines drawn a century ago remain remarkably persistent.</p>

The study also highlights a stark mortality gap, with American children being 80% more likely to die than their peers in other high-income nations, driven by gun violence, car crashes, and substance abuse.

          <h2>Two Deaths in North Carolina Attributed to Flooding from Post-Tropical Cyclone Chantal</h2>

          <p>Authorities in North Carolina have blamed two deaths on flooding caused by the remnants of former Tropical Storm Chantal. One victim was an 83-year-old woman whose vehicle was swept away in Chatham County, while the other was a woman found after going missing during heavy rainfall in Orange County. The storm system caused widespread flash flooding, leading to dozens of water rescues and voluntary evacuation notices in some areas. The storm, which has since weakened to a post-tropical cyclone, also caused road collapses and power outages as it moved up the US East Coast.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to prevent workers from reporting workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will render such confidentiality clauses void, a move Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said is needed to "stamp this practice out." The campaign to change the law was spearheaded by Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to Harvey Weinstein who broke her own NDA. The change will align the UK with other countries that have already outlawed the use of NDAs to cover up criminality.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to resume weapons shipments to Ukraine, just days after halting them, is described as a victory for common sense, albeit a potentially temporary one. The U-turn first alarmed and then relieved European allies, showcasing a volatile approach to foreign policy that has embarrassed the Pentagon. The reversal came after escalating Russian attacks and direct appeals from Ukraine's president. This episode leaves allies questioning the stability and reliability of American commitments, even when the administration ultimately lands on what many consider the correct policy decision.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, is putting forward a bill that would allow the government to call up conscripts in a national defense emergency. The plan, seen as a response to the changed security situation in Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, would not reinstate full compulsory military service, which was suspended in 2011. Instead, it creates a mechanism for a rapid troop increase if needed. The bill also aims to make voluntary service more attractive by significantly increasing pay, with the goal of boosting the number of active soldiers and reservists by 2026.</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank surprised markets by holding its key policy rate at 3.85%, defying widespread expectations for a cut.

The decision was met with disappointment by Australia's Treasurer, who highlighted the government's progress in fighting inflation.

While Trump hinted at future talks with Iran, Netanyahu urged constant vigilance.

          <p>Beijing's recent implementation of export controls on rare earth minerals has intensified global efforts to diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on China. In response, countries and companies are accelerating exploration and development projects in places like Brazil and Kazakhstan to establish alternative sources. However, analysts note that China maintains a "strong hand" due to its long-standing dominance not just in mining but, more critically, in the processing of these essential minerals. Despite the push for diversification, breaking China's grip on the rare earths market remains a significant long-term challenge. (not investment advice)</p>
