          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 19:38:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British reality TV show 'Love Island' is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, largely driven by its presence on TikTok. While traditional television viewership remains below its 2019 peak, the show's social media engagement has exploded, with millions of new followers and a massive increase in related content on the platform. Content creators and fans are using TikTok for recaps and discussions, making the show more accessible to those who don't watch the full nightly episodes. However, some experts caution that consuming the show through short, out-of-context clips can distort the reality of the contestants' experiences.</p>

          <p>A significant wildfire, the White Sage Fire, has rapidly expanded in Arizona's Kaibab National Forest, forcing evacuations near the Grand Canyon. This fire, along with the nearby Dragon Bravo Fire, poses a threat to the region amidst dangerously hot weather conditions. Concurrently, smoke from extensive wildfires in Canada is causing unhealthy air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest, affecting states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota. The events highlight a dual environmental crisis, with western states battling direct flames and heat while the Midwest contends with widespread air pollution.</p>

          <p>A devastating flash flood event along the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country has resulted in at least 129 deaths, with many people still missing. The disaster, which struck during the Fourth of July weekend, was particularly tragic at Camp Mystic, a summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors died. The flooding was caused by a massive weather system that dumped extreme rainfall in a flood-prone area, causing the river to rise 26 feet in under an hour. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the adequacy and timing of emergency warnings issued to residents and camps in the area.</p>

          <p>Investigators have begun a two-year excavation at the former site of St. Mary's mother-and-baby home in Tuam, Ireland, to uncover a suspected mass grave. The site is believed to contain the remains of nearly 800 babies and young children who died at the church-run institution between 1925 and 1961. The grave's existence was brought to light by local historian Catherine Corliss, whose research indicated the children were buried in an unmarked site, possibly a disused sewage tank. The excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a long-awaited and somber resolution for survivors and relatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to levy 30% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and the European Union, scheduled to take effect on August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, Trump cited Mexico's insufficient efforts to curb drug trafficking and persistent trade deficits with the EU as justifications for the new measures. The move represents a significant escalation of the administration's protectionist trade policies, disrupting established global trade norms. Both Mexico and the EU have expressed disagreement and indicated they will take necessary steps to protect their interests, potentially including retaliatory measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite advancing to the quarterfinals, Germany's defensive vulnerabilities were starkly exposed in a 4-1 group stage loss to Sweden at Euro 2025. After taking an early lead, the German defense collapsed, conceding three goals in rapid succession, including a penalty that resulted from a red card for makeshift fullback Carlotta Wamser. The performance highlighted personnel issues and tactical frailties that less formidable opponents in the group had failed to exploit. Coach Christian Wück now faces significant challenges to shore up his backline before a tough knockout stage match against a top-tier opponent.</p>

          <p>A new book, '2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,' provides a deeply sourced analysis of the election that returned Donald Trump to power. The authors argue that Trump's victory was not inevitable but resulted from a series of 'what-if' moments and institutional failures that fueled voter frustration. The book details the Biden campaign's internal struggles and overconfidence, as well as the Republican party's consolidation behind Trump despite his legal troubles. It chronicles how Trump effectively capitalized on a perception that the system was stacked against ordinary people, leading to his political restoration.</p>

This assessment comes amid confusion over steel tariffs and as President Trump announced a separate, harsher 30% tariff on goods from the EU and Mexico.

Sources indicate the firings include staff from former Special Counsel Jack Smith's classified documents and 2020 election probes, as well as prosecutors from the January 6th cases. The terminations were reportedly directed by a 'weaponization working group' established by Attorney General Pam Bondi to review Biden-era law enforcement policies.

The arrests in London, Cardiff, and Manchester were primarily for suspected terrorism offenses, such as showing support for a banned group. The proscription, which took effect last Saturday, makes membership or support for Palestine Action a criminal offense. The group is known for direct action targeting arms companies involved with Israel.

Analyst Marco Chan points to a known issue with a chip in the engine's control system that could lead to signal loss, effectively cutting off fuel. He notes that the switch design makes accidental activation by pilots highly unlikely, shifting focus towards a potential mechanical or electronic failure as the root cause of the disaster.</p>
