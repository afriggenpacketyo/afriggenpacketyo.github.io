          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced the removal of all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). This panel advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and HHS, reviewing vaccine data and making recommendations on vaccine eligibility and insurance coverage. The move is unexpected and the reasons behind it are not yet fully clear, but it signifies a major shift in the advisory structure for vaccine policy in the United States. The implications of this decision for future vaccine recommendations and public health policy remain to be seen.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended his decision to send the National Guard to Los Angeles amidst immigration protests, stating that California Governor Gavin Newsom should be "happy" about the deployment. Trump implied that the situation in Los Angeles is improving due to the National Guard's presence. He contrasted this action with his previous stance in 2020, when he stated that the National Guard should not be deployed without a governor's request, citing Newsom's alleged incompetence as the reason for the change in approach. The 101 Freeway has been reopened, though littered with debris, following closures due to the protests.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential earnings from investing $20,000 in a short-term Certificate of Deposit (CD). Short-term CDs, ranging from three to twelve months, offer savers the advantage of earning interest without locking up their funds for an extended period. The article provides calculations for potential earnings based on current interest rates, showing that a $20,000 investment could yield between $216 and $880 depending on the term length and interest rate. The piece also discusses alternative savings options, such as high-yield savings accounts, and highlights the benefits of CDs in a volatile market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Canada has pledged to meet NATO's defense spending target of 2% of GDP significantly earlier than previously planned, with Prime Minister Mark Carney announcing the goal would be achieved by March of next year. Carney cited the need to address multiplying threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities, and cyber criminals, as well as an aging military infrastructure. The new strategy involves increased investment in soldiers and equipment, expanding military capabilities, strengthening the domestic defense industry, and diversifying Canada's defense partnerships. This commitment includes a cash increase of C$9.3 billion for the current fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Shares of Robinhood experienced a decline after the online brokerage was not selected for inclusion in the S&P 500 during the latest quarterly rebalance. This decision comes after speculation that the company could earn a coveted spot in the benchmark index. Bank of America had previously identified Robinhood as a top candidate for inclusion, which typically leads to increased trading volume and passive fund investments. Despite this setback, Robinhood shares have seen a significant increase this year, driven by a rebound in both stocks and cryptocurrency.</p>

Attorney General Rob Bonta stated that the federalization of the National Guard deprives the state of resources needed to protect citizens.
