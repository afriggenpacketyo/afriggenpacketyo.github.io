          <h2>Trump Claims He Severed Ties with Jeffrey Epstein Over Poaching Employees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 11:07:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he ended his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein years ago because Epstein repeatedly hired staff away from his Mar-a-Lago club. Speaking in Scotland, Trump described the issue as "old history" but confirmed he "threw him out" after Epstein poached employees more than once. This explanation contrasts with other reports suggesting the fallout was over a real estate deal or Epstein's behavior. The comments come amid renewed scrutiny of Epstein's associates following the release of related legal documents.</p>

          <h2>Trump Suggests Global Baseline Tariff Could Be Set at 15% to 20%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 11:05:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that his administration will likely impose a universal baseline tariff of 15% to 20% on imports from countries without a specific trade deal with the U.S. This represents a potential increase from the 10% figure previously floated. The announcement, made in Scotland, suggests a broad application of tariffs rather than negotiating numerous individual agreements ahead of the August 1 deadline. This policy could significantly impact global trade dynamics and smaller nations hoping for a lower rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Arkansas couple, Clinton and Cristen Brink, were found dead in a suspected homicide while hiking with their two young daughters in Devil's Den State Park. The children, aged 7 and 9, were unharmed and are now with family. Authorities have released a description of a male suspect seen leaving the park in a black sedan and are asking for public assistance. The incident has prompted increased patrols in the park, and the FBI is assisting the Arkansas State Police in the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Maryland are developing a new technology to combat spatial disorientation, a factor in 5% to 10% of general aviation accidents. The system, which could be integrated into a flight suit or pilot's seat, uses haptic vibrations to provide sensory cues, similar to a car's lane departure warning. This tactile feedback is designed to help pilots maintain their orientation when visual and equilibrium senses become unreliable, particularly in poor weather. The goal is to reduce the high fatality rate associated with such incidents.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) is being criticized by NHS England for its "hardline" stance on rejecting requests for striking resident doctors to return to work for emergency situations. The derogation system allows hospitals to recall doctors to ensure patient safety, but the BMA has rejected 18 such pleas during the latest five-day walkout over pay. NHS England expressed concern that the union's central panel is overriding the judgment of local doctors and putting patient safety, particularly in cancer care, at risk. The BMA contends that hospitals are using the system to cover for poor planning.</p>

          <p>A new economic analysis warns that the housing affordability that fueled the growth of America's Sunbelt suburbs is coming to an end. Urban economists found that housing construction in metros like Phoenix and Atlanta has plummeted relative to their population growth, mirroring the trend that made coastal cities expensive decades ago. The slowdown is most pronounced in affluent suburbs, which are resisting densification.

          <p>Officials at an Orleans Parish correctional facility have confirmed the mistaken release of a 30-year-old inmate, Khalil Bryan, who was being held on multiple violent charges including aggravated assault with a firearm. The sheriff stated the release was due to a clerical error involving an inmate with a similar last name and took full responsibility for the failure. This incident occurred at the same New Orleans jail from which 10 other inmates escaped in May by ripping a toilet from a wall. An investigation into the breakdown of internal processes has been launched.</p>

          <p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications have surged to the top of Apple's App Store charts in the United Kingdom following the implementation of the Online Safety Act. The new law requires platforms with adult content, such as PornHub and Reddit, to use "robust" age verification methods. The spike in VPN downloads suggests that many users are using the technology, which can disguise a user's location, to bypass these new requirements. While effective, experts warn that many free VPN services may pose significant privacy and security risks to users.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is urging the Trump administration to stop funding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and resume support for U.N. aid distribution. In a letter to the Secretary of State, they expressed "grave" concerns about the Israeli-backed private group, citing the high number of civilian deaths at its distribution sites. The senators argue that blurring the lines between aid delivery and military security operations is dangerous and violates established humanitarian norms. The U.N. has warned that Gaza is on the brink of a "food catastrophe."</p>

          <p>Following international pressure, Israel has begun allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, including truck convoys and airdrops. However, the United Nations and aid workers on the ground stress that the amount is insufficient to address the severe humanitarian crisis. The U.N. agency UNRWA stated that at least 500-600 trucks are needed daily, compared to the 120 that entered on Sunday. The agency also warned that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished, and desperation is leading people to loot aid convoys in a phenomenon now termed "self-distribution."</p>

          <p>In a horrific incident in Nigeria's Zamfara state, kidnappers have killed at least 38 of the 56 people they abducted from a village in March, even after a ransom was paid. A local official reported that the victims, mostly young people, were "slaughtered like rams." The gunmen had demanded a ransom for each captive, and after receiving payment, they released 18 women and one boy before killing the remaining hostages. This event underscores the escalating brutality of criminal gangs in the region and the inability of the government to ensure citizens' safety.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis reveals how the Sahel region of Africa has become a major hub for smuggling people, drugs, and other illicit goods. Recent military coups in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso have led to new governments that are friendlier to Moscow and have dismantled previous anti-smuggling agreements with the EU. This political shift has fueled a boom in criminal networks, with drug seizures, particularly cocaine, increasing by over 11,000% since 2020. The article explores how corruption and the presence of Russian mercenaries have exacerbated the problem, creating a dangerous dynamic in a region already struggling with terrorism.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old Virginia man, Joshua Coleman, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder after allegedly killing his wife and another man. According to police, Coleman admitted to shooting his 22-year-old wife, Mandy Coleman, during an argument over alleged infidelity. He then reportedly took their two small children, who were unharmed, and sought out and killed a 68-year-old man, William Morey. The criminal complaint states Coleman killed the second man because he "knew he was going to jail" anyway. The relationship between Morey and the couple is currently unclear.</p>

The research highlights the risk of these genes transferring to bacteria that can infect humans, such as E. coli.
