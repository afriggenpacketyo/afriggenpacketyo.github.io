          <p>According to The New York Times, the UK is on track to be the first country to finalize a trade agreement with the U.S. after President Trump hinted at an upcoming announcement. While the U.S. imposed tariffs on various nations, the UK was spared the higher duties. A UK spokesperson noted ongoing talks with the U.S., emphasizing a commitment to finding solutions for UK businesses and consumers. The article notes uncertainty around whether the agreement will be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations, with Trump recently expressing that other nations must agree to deals with the U.S. rather than the other way around.</p>

          <p>South Korea and Japan reported that North Korea fired multiple ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, marking Pyongyang's first missile launch in nearly two months. The missiles, launched from the Wonsan area, traveled approximately 800 km, and Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani indicated that one missile may have followed an irregular trajectory. No damage to ships or planes was reported, but Japan lodged a stern protest. This launch occurs amidst military cooperation between North Korea and Russia in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and ahead of South Korea's upcoming presidential election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rapid analysis by climate scientists reveals that the historic storms that caused widespread destruction and fatalities across the central Mississippi valley in early April were made more severe and likely due to the burning of fossil fuels. Record rainfall across eight states led to catastrophic flooding, resulting in at least 15 deaths and significant economic damage. The World Weather Attribution study found that human-caused climate change intensified the rainfall by approximately 9% and increased its likelihood by 40%. The storms were fueled by warmer ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, which were 2.2F hotter due to the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>A study by researchers from the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force suggests China's hypersonic weapons can reach speeds up to Mach 20 and potentially be launched from space. The study detailed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of China’s re-entry glide missiles, revealing they can travel up to 21,000km/h in high altitudes. According to the study, space-based platforms could compress the adversary’s early-warning system response time. The analysis corroborates earlier reports from the U.S. that China tested hypersonic weapons released from near-Earth orbit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that climate change significantly worsened the deadly storms that struck eight U.S. states in early April, resulting in at least 24 deaths. The analysis by World Weather Attribution found that human-caused global warming made the record-breaking rainfall about 9% heavier and 14 times more likely. Unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by climate change, fueled the storm's intensity. The report also highlights concerns about staff shortages at the National Weather Service and rising insurance costs in high-risk areas. Without a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, extreme weather events are expected to become even more common and intense.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but revised its global container market volume growth forecast downward due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The company's underlying EBITDA rose 70% compared to the previous year, but it now expects global container market volume growth to be between -1% and 4%. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc cited rising trade tensions and uncertainty as factors impacting global supply chains, while disruption in the Red Sea is expected to continue throughout the year. The shipping industry continues to navigate a complex tariff landscape, including U.S. tariffs on products from China and retaliatory measures from Beijing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article suggests that Nigel Farage's opposition to net zero policies resonates with voters who prioritize cutting the cost of living. A recent poll indicated that nearly 60% of voters believe cutting the cost of living is more important than achieving net zero, while only 13% prioritize net zero. The author argues that this result shows voters do not genuinely believe in net zero, as they would prioritize it above all other issues if they did. The situation is compared to Jeremy Corbyn's policies, which polled well in isolation but failed to resonate with voters when weighed against other priorities.</p>

          <h2>The Ethics of Resurrecting the Dead with AI</h2>

          <p>The article discusses the ethical implications of using AI to resurrect the dead, citing examples such as an AI avatar of a murder victim testifying in court and a digital recreation of Agatha Christie hosting an online writing course. While some see value in providing closure or continuing legacies, the author argues that grief is about accepting the absence of loved ones and that digital resurrection can be exploitative. The lack of laws protecting the dignity of the deceased is also a concern, as companies profit from creating digital "deadbots" without meaningful public debate about the ethical ramifications.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, signaling the administration's first such deal since imposing sweeping tariffs. The specifics remain unclear, with uncertainty about whether it will require Congressional approval.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has resisted reducing food production standards to allow more trade of U.S. agricultural products.

          <p>The British film and TV industry is concerned that President Trump’s threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in “foreign lands” could have a devastating impact. Hollywood blockbusters are a critical part of the British industry, and last year, nearly 90 percent of the 5.6 billion pounds spent on film and high-end TV production in Britain came from abroad, mostly the United States. The industry is still recovering from disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the 2023 actors’ and screenwriters’ strikes in the United States, and the concern is that uncertainty about tariffs could wipe out that progress.</p>

The campaign has undermined the Palestinian Authority, with Israel arguing that the Authority has not done enough to curb militancy.

The challenge is to create a new economic model that balances growth with social and environmental concerns, particularly in the face of right-wing populism and the influence of big businesses.</p>
