          <p>General Motors surpassed Wall Street's first-quarter estimates but is reevaluating its 2025 financial guidance due to potential cost increases and uncertainties surrounding President Trump's auto tariffs. The company is also suspending additional stock buybacks until it gains more clarity on the economic and regulatory environments. While GM believes it can offset a portion of the tariffs, the instability has led to analyst downgrades of automotive stocks. GM is making adjustments to North American production but deferring significant capital shifts until there is more certainty, while first-quarter results showed a decrease in profit margins compared to the previous year.

          <p>The UK government has announced new legislation that will deny asylum rights to individuals convicted of sexual assault offenses, regardless of the length of their sentence. This amendment to the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill aims to address concerns highlighted by cases like Abdul Ezedi, who was granted asylum despite a prior sexual assault conviction. The changes also include a 24-week target for appeal decisions on asylum seekers who are foreign offenders or in government-funded accommodation, intending to reduce the asylum backlog and save taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola is anticipated to release its first-quarter earnings, with analysts expecting earnings per share of 71 cents and revenue of $11.14 billion. Despite projecting full-year organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% and comparable earnings per share increase of 2% to 3% in February, the company faces concerns due to President Trump's tariffs and declining consumer sentiment. Rival PepsiCo already cut its full-year earnings forecast, citing similar factors, and investors are increasingly seeking the stability of consumer staples, driving Coke's shares up by 15% this year.

          <p>With President Trump back in office and pursuing policies that challenge constitutional norms, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, known for his belief in a weaker executive branch, may become a crucial check on presidential power. Gorsuch's previous advocacy for limiting executive authority, including calls to overrule Chevron and revive the nondelegation doctrine, aligns with the current need to restrain potential overreach. The Supreme Court's recent expansion of judicial power through the major questions doctrine could provide a tool to challenge Trump's policies, particularly his tariffs, if the justices apply it fairly and non-partisanly.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates a partisan pattern in Americans' trust in the Federal Reserve, with individuals typically trusting the Fed more when their political party controls the White House. However, this pattern did not hold in the most recent presidential election, as Republicans expressed lower trust in the Fed despite a Republican president, potentially due to concerns about inflation or skepticism towards technocracy. The study also found that Republicans were more likely to believe inflation would decrease, while Democrats expressed greater faith in the Fed but feared rising inflation.</p>

          <p>The ACLU, representing early childhood organizations, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt the dismantling of Head Start, alleging that actions require congressional approval and compromise the program's quality.

The suit follows a series of disruptions to Head Start, including funding delays, staff layoffs, and the proposed defunding of the program by 2026.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison is facing scrutiny after contradicting its own filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) regarding the role of state Assemblywoman Lisa Calderon, who is sponsoring legislation favored by Edison.

          <p>Thousands of inmates in California prisons received false positive results for opiate use due to a laboratory error, raising concerns that parole decisions could be unfairly influenced. Attorneys worry that these incorrect test results, included in inmates' medical and parole hearing records, may have led to parole denials. The false positives stemmed from urine drug tests conducted by Quest Diagnostics, which temporarily changed the reagent used, and while the corrections department is notifying affected patients, questions remain about the extent of the impact on parole outcomes.</p>
