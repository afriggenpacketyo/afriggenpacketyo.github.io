          <p>Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse gathered at the U.S. Capitol to call for the public release of all investigative files related to the convicted sex offender and his network. One survivor, Lisa Phillips, announced that the group is compiling its own confidential list of Epstein's associates who they allege were involved in the abuse, creating a resource by and for survivors. The emotional event, organized by U.S. lawmakers, featured nine women sharing their personal testimonies to humanize their experiences and pressure the Department of Justice for greater transparency and accountability.</p>

          <p>Salesforce announced fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue climbing 10% year-over-year to $10.24 billion. Despite the strong performance, the company issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the upcoming third quarter, causing its stock to drop in extended trading. While Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook, the cautious guidance fueled existing Wall Street concerns about its slowing growth compared to other tech giants benefiting from the AI boom. The company also announced a $20 billion increase to its share buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, China, has launched a new stimulus measure to encourage consumer spending by offering subsidies for large dining events. Under the plan, banquet organizers who host five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan can receive up to 5,000 yuan back from the government. This local initiative aims to invigorate the catering sector as part of a broader effort to boost economic growth. The policy highlights the balance local officials must strike between stimulating consumption and adhering to national anti-extravagance campaigns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to open higher, following a strong performance on Wall Street where a tech rally lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Investor optimism was fueled by a favorable court ruling in an Alphabet antitrust case, suggesting tech giants may be resilient to regulatory threats. However, growing concerns about the broader economy and pressure on global bond markets, with the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield rising, continue to weigh on sentiment. Futures indicate gains for markets in Japan and Australia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report reveals that some members of Gen Z are creating a facade of a luxurious travel lifestyle online through deceptive means, often funded by debt. The article describes tactics such as booking day passes at exclusive resorts for photo sessions, splitting the cost of a single night in a high-end rental, and leveraging personal loans to fund trips. This behavior is driven by the desire to build a large social media following, which can then be monetized through brand partnerships, effectively turning a fabricated image into a source of income.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze over $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University. Judge Allison D. Burroughs stated the administration used allegations of campus antisemitism as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" without following proper legal procedures. The ruling restores funding for more than 900 research projects in critical areas like medicine and science. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, which has been hailed as a major victory for academic freedom.</p>

By processing a significant portion of their livestock locally and selling directly to consumers through their own restaurants and butcher shop, they are creating a sustainable, community-focused model.

Subsequently, one should check for injuries, move the vehicle to a safe place if possible, and activate hazard lights. It is crucial to call 999 if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the collision is blocking the road.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff described the company's disappointing third-quarter guidance as "appropriately conservative," despite it causing a significant drop in the company's stock price. Benioff emphasized that the quarterly results were "absolutely fantastic" and highlighted strong customer adoption of Salesforce's AI agent products. He argued that these AI tools are fundamentally transforming customer businesses and have also allowed Salesforce to streamline its own support services. The defense came after Wall Street reacted negatively to the software giant's cautious revenue forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that such an institution, bolstered by Chinese loans, could offer member states like Iran a crucial alternative to Western-dominated financial systems. This would allow them to bypass U.S.-led sanctions and reduce their economic vulnerability. The creation of an SCO bank is presented as a significant step toward shifting the global financial order and strengthening an economic bloc independent of Western influence.

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in a major antitrust case against Google caused its parent company Alphabet's stock to surge 9%. While Judge Amit Mehta found Google to be a monopolist in online search, he spared the company from the most severe potential penalty: being forced to sell its Chrome web browser. The judge deemed a divestiture "incredibly messy and highly risky." However, he did impose other remedies, including requiring Google to share some of its valuable search data with rivals to help restore competition in the market.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the Trump administration is actively working to reframe the January 6 Capitol attack from a violent insurrection into a moment of patriotic triumph. The article points to several key actions, including granting military funeral honors to rioter Ashli Babbitt, issuing sweeping pardons for those convicted of violence, and proposing a compensation fund for the perpetrators. These moves, it contends, are creating a "New Lost Cause" narrative where the insurrectionists are portrayed as victims and heroes, effectively turning their failed effort into a delayed victory.</p>

Vance stated that the administration hopes to cooperate with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who has called the president's comments "unhinged" and threatened legal action against any such deployment.</p>

Democrats have denounced the move as a partisan effort to rewrite the history of the violent event and exonerate the former president.
