            <p>Several French prisons were targeted in a wave of overnight attacks, including vehicle fires and gunfire, prompting an investigation by the national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office. Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin linked the attacks to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking, while Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau called for a "relentless" response. The prison guard union expressed "deepest concern and anger" and called for urgent government action to protect prison staff. The attacks come after a similar incident at France's national school of prison administration, with no group claiming responsibility but possible links to drug trafficking.</p>

            <p>The availability of low-deposit mortgage deals in the UK has reached its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, offering a boost to first-time buyers. Data from Moneyfacts shows a significant increase in deals requiring 5% or 10% deposits, though mortgage rates remain higher than in previous years. Despite the increased choice, buyers still face challenges, including high house prices and uncertainty over interest rates. Zoopla data indicates that homes are selling relatively quickly, with agreed sales taking just over a month on average.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump has controversially blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war with Russia, following a deadly Russian attack in Sumy. The US president also implicated President Vladimir Putin and former US President Joe Biden for the conflict. Trump questioned Zelensky's competence and criticized his pursuit of missiles. His comments sparked outrage, especially after the attack on Sumy, which resulted in 35 deaths and 117 injuries. Tensions between Trump and Zelensky have been high, particularly after a heated exchange at the White House in February.</p>

Farmers in Texas and the Midwest have suffered significant crop losses due to extreme weather, while tariffs threaten access to core markets like China and Mexico.

            <h2>Xi's Vision of Global Change Gaining Traction Amid Trump's Policies</h2>

            <p>President Xi Jinping's concept of "profound changes unseen in a century" is gaining traction as Donald Trump's policies create global instability. Chinese experts and policy analysts suggest that Trump's return to power signals a seismic reordering where American influence wanes and new powers rise. This view aligns with Beijing's belief in the relative decline of the U.S. and the ascendance of China. Xi's past statements, such as "Let's drive the changes together" with Vladimir Putin, are seen as signaling a strategic alignment against Washington.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff policy, initially broad and nonsensical, has been modified to focus primarily on China. Advisers hope to incentivize a U.S. manufacturing boom, reduce dependence on China, boost exports, and revalue the dollar. However, these goals are implausible and carry significant economic risks. The tariffs make imports more expensive, impacting consumers and manufacturers alike, and could lead to reduced spending and slower economic growth. The policy's erratic implementation further undermines its potential effectiveness.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, during a meeting with President Donald Trump, stated that he would not return Kilmar Abrego García, a migrant wrongfully deported from Maryland. Bukele dismissed concerns about Abrego Garcia's safety, echoing the Trump administration's claim that he is a "terrorist" gang member. Despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return, Trump officials insisted that his fate is solely up to El Salvador. The situation has raised concerns about the treatment of migrants and the administration's disregard for due process.</p>

The 10-year Treasury yield rose nearly 3 basis points to 4.395%, while the 2-year Treasury yield added nearly 4 basis points to 3.87%. The development follows a week of volatility in the bond market, with the sell-offs fueled by concerns about who is selling Treasurys.
