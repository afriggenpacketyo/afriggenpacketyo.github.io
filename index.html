          <p>A DW article reports that learning multiple languages induces physical changes in the brain, enhancing cognitive abilities. Neuroscientists have found that neural pathways reshape themselves as one learns a new language, improving memory, problem-solving skills, and overall brain health. A German study involving Syrian refugees learning German showed that their brains rewired as they became more proficient, indicating neuroplasticity. This rewiring strengthens neural connections and increases gray matter in language-processing areas, suggesting that multilingualism enhances cognitive functions and cultural experiences, though its direct impact on intelligence remains debated.</p>

          <p>In their final audio conversation, New York Times columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens discuss their eight-year-long weekly dialogue, "The Conversation." They reflect on maintaining civil discourse despite political differences, emphasizing the importance of humor and avoiding the pursuit of winning arguments. They address reader questions about how they chose topics and managed to keep the conversation respectful, highlighting the silent majority's desire for a different tone in political discussions. They note that the social media's algorithms tend to favor outrage, while their work sought to offer a more thoughtful and balanced perspective.</p>

          <p>Jack Goldsmith, in a New York Times guest essay, argues that Donald Trump's expansion of presidential power builds substantially on the excesses of recent presidencies. He notes that Trump's use of emergency powers and claims of untouchable national security authority echo moves made by presidents like Richard Nixon and George W. Bush. Goldsmith points out that presidents for decades have issued pardons as political favors, a practice Trump has taken to new extremes. He suggests that limiting the presidency requires a return to when Congress played a more vital role in domestic policy and law, and norms checked presidents from grabbing too much power.</p>

          <p>Fox News reports on the development of a potentially universal antivenom derived from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who intentionally subjected himself to numerous snake bites over 18 years. Friede's blood contained antibodies that reacted with neurotoxins from 19 of the world's deadliest snakes. Researchers combined two of these antibodies to create an antivenom that proved protective in mouse trials. The hope is that this research could lead to a broad-spectrum antivenom that can be administered in rural settings, offering a more effective and accessible treatment for snake bites globally.</p>

          <p>CBS News reports that Sean "Diddy" Combs is standing trial in New York City, facing multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, and other offenses since at least 2004. The indictment alleges Combs engaged in a pattern of abuse toward women, manipulating them into participating in commercial sex acts, often involving excessive drug use and elaborate performances. A 2016 hotel security video showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, is expected to be a key piece of evidence for prosecutors.</p>

The exhibition, guest-curated by Monica Miller, draws inspiration from her book on Black dandyism and the styling of Black diasporic identity. Miller emphasizes that Black fashion has historically been a clash of "respectable" outfits versus looks that are more outré. The event will be hosted by actor Colman Domingo, F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky, producer and designer Pharrell Williams and Anna Wintour, with LeBron James serving as honorary chair.</p>

The campaign provided crucial public health messaging, including recommendations on safe sleep practices. Advocates worry that the termination of this office will hinder efforts to educate parents and keep babies safe, as the NIH provided resources that non-profits cannot replace.</p>

The yuan's recent gain is largely attributed to expectations that the US and China will soon begin negotiations to dial down some of their tariffs. Despite this optimism, global investors are waiting for tangible signs that China can comfortably fend off Washington’s challenges before increasing their bets on Chinese assets.</p>
