          <p>A 44-year-old man, Clifton George, has been charged with the murder of 46-year-old Annabel Rook after a gas explosion at her home in Stoke Newington, north London. George is also charged with arson with intent to endanger life after Rook was found fatally stabbed at the scene. George, who was found with slash injuries, is scheduled to appear at Thames Magistrates' Court on Monday. Authorities have asked the public to refrain from speculation and respect the privacy of those affected while thanking the Hackney community for their support.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, are now available at GP surgeries in England, but only for individuals meeting strict criteria. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to manage demand and resources, prioritizing those most in need, such as individuals with a BMI of 40 or over and specific health conditions. Eligible patients will also receive wrap-around care, including regular check-ups and advice on exercise and healthy eating. Some GP practices have cautioned that only a few patients will initially qualify, and training is needed for healthcare staff to administer the drug safely. The long-term plan is for the jabs to be more widely available, but a staggered approach is needed to reach those most at need, manage GPs' workload and NHS resources.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief expressed shock and frustration over a planned protest in London supporting Palestine Action, which he described as an "organised extremist criminal group." This comes after Palestine Action activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and vandalized military planes, protesting the UK's support of Israel. While acknowledging the right to protest, Sir Mark Rowley stated that actions supporting the group go beyond legitimate protest. The Met has imposed conditions on the protest, limiting its duration and location to prevent disorder and disruption, as the Home Secretary is preparing a written statement to put before Parliament on Monday to proscribe the group, effectively branding it a terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries, with emergency crews working to rescue people trapped under the debris of a partially collapsed apartment building. The strikes hit residential areas, hospitals, and sports infrastructure across Kyiv, with the most severe damage in the Shevchenkivskyi district. This attack follows a previous one last week that killed 28 people in Kyiv, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to call it one of the war's biggest bombardments. The Kremlin has condemned recent U.S. strikes on Iran, stating that Putin has no immediate plans to speak with President Trump.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, speculation grows about the possibility of regime change in Tehran, but historical examples suggest such interventions often lead to disastrous outcomes. Foreign-imposed regime change is a controversial concept under international law, often resulting in power vacuums, violence, and instability. Case studies from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya illustrate the challenges and failures of externally driven regime change. Experts doubt the feasibility of a successful regime change in Iran from the outside, emphasizing the need for ground forces and local support, which are currently lacking.</p>

He expressed concern over the lack of congressional authorization for the strikes, emphasizing Congress's sole authority to declare war.

          <p>Iran's parliament has reportedly approved blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil supplies, in response to U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Experts suggest this move risks alienating neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, and could trigger hostilities. Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights believes the possibility of closure remains minimalistic due to the potential for self-inflicted harm. Closing the strait would affect not only Iran's oil exports but also those of nearby Gulf nations, potentially removing over 17 billion barrels of oil from global markets and severely impacting natural gas flows.

The scientists monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays and gamma ray-induced particle disturbances. Their findings, published in Nature Communications, suggest that these quasiparticle bursts lead to correlated errors in qubits. This could be significant for the scaling of quantum processors and the design of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The proposed detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has expressed some support for the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, viewing them as a signal of Washington's resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the importance of de-escalating the situation while acknowledging U.S. efforts to pursue dialogue. Japan maintains amicable ties with Iran and relies on the Middle East for crude oil imports. The government is closely monitoring the impact of the Middle East conflict on Japan's energy supply, particularly concerning the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran, was detained by ICE during a routine immigration appointment in New Orleans. Clouatre, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. as a minor seeking asylum, was breastfeeding her 3-month-old daughter at the time of her detention. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, is struggling to care for their children while she is detained. Immigration law experts say that the Trump administration's strict enforcement policies have reduced deference previously given to military families, with government memos showing that the federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation.</p>

          <p>Uncertainty in the Middle East, driven by President Trump's strikes on Iran and threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, is causing concern in global markets. Analysts warn that a shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz could lead to higher crude prices, increased U.S. inflation, and complications for the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plans. Gold is expected to benefit from geopolitical shocks, while Chinese assets may remain relatively shielded. The potential for escalation is pushing risk premiums higher, creating market volatility.

          <p>NATO allies are set to pledge increased defense spending at their annual summit, with the U.S. pushing for a target of 5% of GDP. This includes 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure like cyber warfare capabilities. While some members are committed, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold. The stakes are high due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, but analysts question whether these pledges will translate into concrete action.

A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from green energy levies. Energy-intensive firms will also receive increased discounts on network charges. The plan aims to support key industries, upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending.

          <p>Despite being the most sanctioned nation on Earth, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience, with growth outpacing G7 nations in 2024. This growth was driven by record military spending and stable oil exports to China and India. However, challenges are emerging, including high inflation, soaring interest rates, and worker shortages. The economy minister has warned of a potential recession, and oil and gas revenues have fallen, leading to a widening budget shortfall. While the economy is unlikely to collapse, it faces a period of stagnation due to sanctions and internal pressures.</p>

          <p>Iran's potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz in response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities poses a significant threat to global oil supplies. The Strait is a critical chokepoint for approximately 20% of the world's oil transit. Disruptions to oil flows through the Strait could lead to higher energy prices and economic instability. Analysts predict that oil prices could climb significantly if Iran closes the Strait and Western forces attempt to reopen it by force.
