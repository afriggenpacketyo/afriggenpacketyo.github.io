          <p>Comedian Marc Maron concluded his influential podcast, "WTF with Marc Maron," after a run of over 15 years, featuring former President Barack Obama as his final guest. The conversation, recorded at Obama's Washington, D.C. home, explored the current political landscape, the impact of social media, and the importance of civil discourse. Maron shared his apprehension about the future, prompting Obama to offer advice based on his own transition from the presidency, encouraging him to take time to appreciate the accomplishment before starting a new chapter.</p>

          <p>Wales suffered a significant setback in their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign, losing 4-2 to Belgium in a critical match. Despite an aggressive start, Wales was defensively exposed and ultimately outmatched by Belgium's clinical attack, effectively ending their chances for automatic qualification. Head coach Craig Bellamy defended his team's offensive strategy, stating it was necessary to secure a win, but the loss now means Wales will likely have to navigate the play-offs. The defeat marks the fourth loss in five games for the team, increasing scrutiny on Bellamy's leadership.</p>

          <p>The United States has publicly affirmed its support for the Philippines after a confrontation in the South China Sea where Chinese vessels allegedly rammed and used water cannons against a Filipino ship. China's Foreign Ministry warned Manila against challenging its territorial claims in the disputed waters. In response, the U.S. State Department condemned China's actions and reiterated that its mutual defense treaty extends to armed attacks on Philippine public vessels, including its Coast Guard. The incident highlights the escalating tensions in the strategic waterway, a critical route for global trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern Ireland's World Cup qualification hopes were dealt a blow following a narrow 1-0 loss to Germany at Windsor Park in Belfast. The decisive goal came from a fortunate deflection off Nick Woltemade's shoulder in the first half. Despite a disallowed goal for Northern Ireland and a strong second-half performance where they pressured the German defense, they were unable to find an equalizer. The loss leaves automatic qualification unlikely, but a play-off spot remains a viable path for the team, which showed resilience against a top-tier opponent.</p>

          <p>Alma Cocina Latina, a Baltimore restaurant founded by Irena Stein, is introducing diners to the distinct flavors of Venezuelan cuisine through a concept she calls "culinary diplomacy." The restaurant's unique taste profile is built around aromatic, sweet peppers like ají dulce, which are not commonly found in the U.S. and are now being grown locally by a Maryland farmer specifically for the restaurant. Chefs at the establishment emphasize that these fragrant peppers are the essential base of their food, providing an authentic cultural and sensory experience that aims to celebrate Venezuela's rich culinary heritage.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law designed to simplify the insurance claims process for residents who lose their homes in wildfires. Under the legislation, victims of a total loss in a declared state of emergency can now receive up to $350,000, or 60% of their personal property coverage, without providing an exhaustive itemized list of their lost possessions. This change aims to reduce the burden on survivors who previously faced the daunting task of documenting every lost item to receive full compensation. The law also extends the deadline for filing detailed claims.</p>

These subsidies, expanded during the pandemic, have saved many families hundreds of dollars per month on their marketplace plans. Democrats are demanding the renewal of these tax credits as part of any government spending deal, while some Republicans remain opposed. Health policy experts warn that failure to extend the subsidies could lead to millions losing their coverage, with the greatest impact felt in conservative-leaning states.</p>

          <p>Lindsey Halligan, the new U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia handpicked by President Trump, has removed senior prosecutor Maggie Cleary from the office. Halligan's appointment was controversial due to her lack of federal prosecutorial experience. Sources suggest the move is part of a radical reshaping of the office, with Halligan reportedly aiming to sideline prosecutors who might oppose her on politically sensitive cases. Cleary had previously opposed the Trump administration's decision to indict former FBI Director James Comey, a move the president had publicly advocated for.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) experienced a tumultuous weekend after receiving layoff notices, only for many to be informed less than a day later that their dismissals were rescinded. The botched downsizing, occurring amid a government shutdown, has been described by former officials as inept, with entire essential teams, like the editors of a key weekly report, being fired and then rehired. The chaotic process and targeted cuts appear to consolidate power under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., raising concerns about the agency's scientific independence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's successful brokering of a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza marks a significant diplomatic achievement, providing him with a celebratory victory lap on the world stage. The deal has garnered widespread praise and shifts focus back to expanding the Abraham Accords. However, analysts caution that the most difficult phases of the peace plan, including Hamas's disarmament and Gaza's reconstruction, are yet to come. The long-term success of the peace will depend on sustained international pressure and navigating the complex internal politics of both Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Stocks Recover as President Trump Eases Rhetoric on China Tariffs</h2>

          <p>U.S. stock markets saw a significant rebound on Monday, recovering from a sharp decline at the end of the previous week. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%, driven by President Trump's more conciliatory tone regarding trade tariffs on Chinese imports. This eased investor fears of an escalating trade war, which had been sparked by his earlier announcement of a 100% tariff. Despite the recovery, analysts note that market volatility remains a risk, with attention now turning to the upcoming corporate earnings season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Air Force A-10C Warthog has been observed with kill markings indicating it successfully shot down two Shahed-type drones during a recent deployment in the Middle East. This suggests the aircraft is now operationally using laser-guided rockets, specifically the Advanced Precision Kill Weapons System II (APKWS II), in an air-to-air capacity against unmanned aerial systems. This cost-effective method transforms standard rockets into precision weapons for a fraction of the price of traditional air-to-air missiles. The development marks a new role for the aging A-10 as it nears retirement.</p>
