          <p>Priscilla Presley is releasing a new memoir, "Softly, as I Leave You," detailing her life after her divorce from Elvis Presley. The book explores her decision to leave the marriage, not due to a lack of love, but a need to find her own identity outside of being "Elvis' wife." She reflects on their unusually close post-divorce relationship, her business and acting careers, raising their daughter Lisa Marie, and the grief following both of their deaths. The memoir serves as her final account of their complex relationship and her journey of self-discovery.</p>

          <p>Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy has accused President Donald Trump of employing federal agencies like the FCC and the Department of Justice to punish his political opponents. Murphy stated that this represents one of the most dangerous moments in American history, comparing the actions to those of repressive states like Iran or China. He specifically cited Trump's threats to reexamine broadcast licenses of critical media outlets as an illegal use of coercive government power to silence dissent. This situation highlights growing concerns over the use of executive authority to target critics.</p>

          <p>The once-iconic Las Vegas buffet is being replaced by trendier food halls, reflecting a significant shift in dining preferences. Rick Harrison of "Pawn Stars" notes this evolution, attributing it to changing tastes and promoting his own barbecue restaurant as an example of popular niche cuisine. The article discusses how major casinos are shuttering their buffets in favor of modern food courts to attract a younger demographic. Amid concerns about high prices and declining tourism, Harrison emphasizes that Vegas still offers a wide variety of dining options for every budget.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a mutual defense pact, significantly strengthening their long-standing security partnership. This move is seen as a strategic diversification for Riyadh, which is reportedly growing wary of its traditional reliance on the United States as its primary security guarantor. The agreement signals evolving alliances in the Gulf region amidst broader geopolitical tensions involving the U.S. and China. Analysts suggest this could also create new opportunities for arms sales and further complicate the regional security landscape.</p>

          <p>A credit expert advises consumers on how to maximize the value of rewards credit cards, highlighting several common pitfalls. The article warns against automatically choosing no-annual-fee cards, as those with modest fees often provide superior rewards that justify the cost. Other key mistakes include hoarding points, which can be devalued by issuers at any time, and failing to re-evaluate card choices as personal lifestyles and spending habits change. Consumers are also encouraged to negotiate with card issuers for retention offers before downgrading or canceling a card. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Expert Identifies Nine Parental Practices That Foster Exceptional Social Skills in Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 09:56:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships outlines nine key behaviors of parents who raise socially adept children. These practices focus on modeling emotional intelligence rather than simply teaching polite phrases. They include talking openly about feelings, demonstrating empathy in daily interactions, fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail, and teaching them how to repair relationships after conflict. The approach emphasizes validating a child's feelings and listening more than lecturing, creating an environment of emotional safety that builds a strong foundation for future relationships.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a provider of check-in and boarding systems, has caused significant disruption at major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels. The attack on the company's MUSE software forced airports to revert to manual check-in processes, leading to long queues, delays, and flight cancellations. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to supply chain cyberattacks, where compromising a single third-party vendor can have a far-reaching ripple effect. Authorities are working to restore the systems, but disruptions are expected to continue.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have joined over 150 other nations in recognizing a Palestinian state, a move intended to revive the two-state solution. However, this symbolic step raises significant practical challenges, particularly regarding who would lead a potential Palestinian state. The article explores the deep political divisions between Hamas in Gaza and the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which have prevented unified governance for nearly two decades. With an ossified political system and no clear successor to the aging leadership, the path to a viable, functioning government remains one of the largest obstacles to true statehood.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law that will prohibit most on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal agents from agencies like ICE, from wearing face masks. The legislation, which takes effect in January 2026, is a response to the use of masks by federal agents during immigration raids in Los Angeles. Proponents, like State Senator Scott Wiener, argue the ban aims to prevent the actions of "secret police" and ensure accountability. The law includes exceptions for specific situations such as undercover operations or protection against disease, but has been criticized by federal officials as an attempt to endanger officers.</p>

The piece explores how influencers promoting "tradwife" aesthetics can inadvertently support regressive policies that roll back women's rights, such as reproductive freedom and workplace equality.

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, has accused Elon Musk of being a "criminal" for allegedly inciting violence and failing to regulate harmful content on his social media platform, X. Davey cited Musk's comments to protesters at a far-right rally and the presence of ads related to self-harm and child abuse on the platform. He is calling for the UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, to investigate both X and Musk personally for potential breaches of the Online Safety Act. This escalation follows a public spat between the two figures and reflects growing political pressure on social media accountability.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested its position in the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, concluding a highly successful 17-year investment. The initial $230 million stake, purchased in 2008 at the urging of Charlie Munger, grew in value by approximately 3890% over the holding period. Berkshire began selling shares in 2022, and a recent financial filing confirmed the value of the investment is now zero. While Buffett has praised BYD, the sale is consistent with his recent moves to reduce exposure to geopolitical risks associated with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a fracturing national public health landscape, several U.S. states have formed regional collaboratives to strengthen health guidance and policy.

These groups are coordinating on issues like emergency preparedness and vaccine purchasing as federal agencies revisit key recommendations, creating state-level variability. The trend reflects a shift where states are increasingly decoupling their health policies from federal guidance to ensure consistent access to care, particularly concerning vaccinations.</p>

          <p>The United States recently held its Freedom Edge military exercise with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without the presence of an aircraft carrier. This departure from past practice has prompted speculation among analysts. Some suggest the move could be an attempt to de-escalate and improve diplomatic dealings with China and North Korea. Others interpret it as a reflection of the Trump administration's strategy to push Asian allies to take on greater responsibility for regional security. The decision highlights the complex strategic calculations currently at play in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

The article highlights common misconceptions, such as the significant decline in fertility with age and the impact of lifestyle on both male and female reproductive health. Doctors argue that integrating this knowledge into school curricula could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about family planning earlier in life.

They express concern that U.S. institutions are not adequately resisting these pressures, with Congress being particularly absent. Kasparov asserts that the 2026 midterm elections will be the "most fateful election in American history," representing a critical battle to defend democratic norms.</p>
