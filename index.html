          <p>The Trump administration has indicated that it may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a country other than his native El Salvador if he is released from jail. This development is the latest in a complex legal battle, which saw Abrego Garcia wrongly deported to El Salvador earlier this year despite a court order protecting him due to fears of gang persecution. He was returned to the U.S. only to face federal smuggling charges in Tennessee, where his release is being debated. His attorneys are fighting for his return to Maryland and protection from any further removal proceedings.</p>

          <p>A new audit by the International Association of Fire Fighters has reinforced allegations of financial misconduct against the former president of the Los Angeles firefighters' union, Freddy Escobar. The review found that even with newly provided materials, Escobar failed to properly document over $212,000 in credit card expenses, a significant increase from the initial audit's findings. Auditors noted a "flurry of activity" by Escobar to reconcile transactions after their investigation began. The parent union has since placed the local chapter under a conservatorship to restore financial oversight and accountability.</p>

          <p>In their closing arguments, federal prosecutors portrayed Sean "Diddy" Combs as the leader of a criminal enterprise who used his influence and resources to facilitate and conceal serious sex crimes. Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik argued that Combs wielded "power, violence and fear," believing his fame and wealth placed him above the law. The prosecution rested its case after seven weeks of testimony from 34 witnesses, including his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura Fine. Combs, who faces 15 years to life if convicted on racketeering and sex trafficking charges, has denied all allegations and did not testify.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly declared a victory over Israel following a recent ceasefire, claiming to have "knocked out and crushed" the "Zionist regime." In a video address, he asserted that Iranian missiles had hit numerous military targets and that an attack on a U.S. airbase in Qatar was a "big slap in the face," despite evidence that these attacks were largely unsuccessful. These claims contrast sharply with U.S. and Israeli intelligence assessments that Iran's nuclear program was set back by years. The rhetoric appears aimed at a domestic audience amid palpable anxiety in Tehran.</p>

However, its passage in the Senate is uncertain, with moderate Republicans expressing reservations and Democrats strongly opposing its deep cuts to programs like Medicaid and food assistance.

The treatment works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function correctly.

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive deportation goals are being characterized as unrealistic and legally fraught, as highlighted by a recent whistleblower complaint from a former DOJ lawyer. The complaint alleges that top officials considered defying court orders to expedite removals, pointing to the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia as an example of the administration's chaotic approach. Despite the president's aim to remove one million people this year, ICE statistics show only about 125,000 deportations have occurred so far. This article suggests the administration's public attacks on the judiciary may be a tactic to distract from the practical impossibility of its own promises.</p>

The audit will scrutinize the SBA's own business development program to prevent similar abuses and ensure federal contracts are awarded based on merit.

          <p>Brendan Foley, the CEO of spice manufacturer McCormick, has stated that the company is primarily focused on how new tariffs will affect its agricultural supply chain. While 90% of its products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, the company sources a majority of its raw ingredients, like black pepper, from various international markets. Foley expressed confidence that the company has effectively managed the tariff impact for the remainder of the year. He also noted that consumer demand for at-home cooking and flavor remains strong, which has bolstered the company's recent positive earnings report.</p>

The trailer hints at Lanthimos's signature bizarre and darkly comedic style, set to an energetic punk rock soundtrack.

          <p>Nike has announced that new tariffs will add approximately $1 billion in costs during the current fiscal year, a challenge it plans to mitigate through price increases and supply chain adjustments. The sneaker giant's profits fell by a staggering 86% in its fourth quarter as it implements a major turnaround plan involving clearing old inventory and rebuilding wholesale partnerships. Despite the hit, the company's revenue and earnings beat Wall Street estimates, and executives signaled that the worst financial impacts are now behind them. Nike expects sales declines to moderate and plans to reduce its manufacturing reliance on China. (not investment advice)</p>

His win is seen by some as a sign of momentum for the party's younger, more progressive wing, which focuses on working-class economic struggles. However, it has also drawn criticism from moderate Democrats and conservatives, highlighting the deep fractures within the party as it seeks a unifying message.</p>

The space agency stated that the object disintegrated approximately 27 miles above the ground, releasing energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT, which produced the sonic boom.

          <h2>Contentious 'Revenge Tax' Provision Dropped from GOP Bill at Treasury's Request</h2>

          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a controversial provision, dubbed the "revenge tax," from President Trump's major spending bill following a request from the Treasury Secretary. The provision would have allowed the U.S. to tax companies and investors from countries deemed to have unfair foreign tax policies, a measure critics warned would deter foreign investment and cost American jobs. The removal was requested after the Treasury reached a new understanding with G7 countries on a global tax deal. This change complicates Republican efforts to offset the cost of the bill's massive tax cuts ahead of a tight deadline.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Expected to Concede on Welfare Reforms After Facing Labour Rebellion</h2>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly set to announce a significant climbdown on its planned welfare reforms to avoid a legislative defeat from a large group of Labour rebels. Under the expected deal, controversial cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and Universal Credit will now only apply to future claimants, protecting existing recipients. Additionally, a Â£1 billion support plan will be fast-tracked to provide more immediate assistance. This marks a major U-turn for the prime minister, whose authority has been challenged by his backbenchers who were emboldened by recent government reversals on other policies.</p>
