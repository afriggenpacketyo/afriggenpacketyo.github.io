          <p>Microsoft has avoided a significant European Union antitrust fine by agreeing to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its Office software suites. The European Commission accepted legally binding commitments from the tech giant, which include offering versions of its software without Teams at a reduced price for at least seven years. This decision follows a 2023 investigation prompted by a complaint from rival Slack, owned by Salesforce, which argued Microsoft's bundling practices were anti-competitive and harmed consumer choice.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a change of plans regarding the deployment of the National Guard, stating they will be sent to Memphis, Tennessee, instead of Chicago. The decision was reportedly influenced by a conversation with a railroad executive who described Memphis as dangerously unsafe. The move follows vocal opposition from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker to a federal presence in Chicago. While Memphis's mayor has expressed a preference for financial resources over troops, the White House claims the deployment has local and state support.</p>

          <p>A Phoenix-based sports media outlet, PHNX, has terminated its lead Phoenix Suns writer, Gerald Bourget, following his controversial posts on social media regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Bourget stated he was "refusing to mourn" Kirk, whom he called a "bigot," and suggested the killing was ironic given Kirk's Second Amendment stance. The outlet announced the decision, emphasizing that it takes matters of violence seriously and that employee opinions do not represent the company's views. This follows a similar dismissal of a Carolina Panthers staffer for related comments.</p>

The claim is expected to be part of a presentation to a CDC advisory panel, which plays a key role in vaccine recommendations. This development aligns with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent policy shifts, which include dropping vaccine recommendations for healthy children. The report suggests the claim is based on unverified data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).</p>

          <p>Officials have provided a comprehensive overview of the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, identifying 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in custody. The arrest was reportedly facilitated by Robinson's family after he confessed. Investigators recovered a high-powered rifle and bullet casings with inscribed messages, and used surveillance footage to track the suspect's movements on the Utah Valley University campus. The attack, described as targeted, has been widely condemned as a political assassination.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies including Apple, Google, and Meta are intensifying their efforts to create real-time universal language translation devices, moving the concept from science fiction to reality. Apple recently highlighted a 'Live Translation' feature for its new AirPods Pro 3, which can instantly translate several languages. This move places Apple in direct competition with Google's Pixel phones, which offer a similar feature that preserves a speaker's voice inflections, and Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. The advancements in generative AI are driving this new technological battleground.</p>

          <p>On the 48th anniversary of his death, South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority announced it will reopen the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko. Biko died in police custody in 1977 at age 30, with authorities at the time claiming it was due to a hunger strike, a narrative long disputed by his family. His death from a brain hemorrhage, believed to be the result of torture, became a global symbol of the brutality of the apartheid regime. No one has ever been held accountable for his death.</p>

          <p>Amid rising inflation, many seniors are exploring ways to tap into their substantial home equity without taking on additional monthly debt. One primary option is a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners 62 and older, which provides funds that are repaid only when the home is sold or the owner moves out. Another method is a home equity sharing agreement, where a company provides cash in exchange for a share of the home's future appreciation, without interest or monthly payments.

Initially, many U.S. companies absorbed the tariff costs or stockpiled goods, but they are now increasingly passing the expenses on to consumers.

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is purchasing additional shares of Boeing, viewing the recent price drop as a buying opportunity. The stock fell after the CEO acknowledged delays in the 777X aircraft certification process. However, the club's analysis suggests this setback is temporary and does not alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory or its improving financial and cultural situation under new leadership. They are capitalizing on the short-term dip to build their new position in the aerospace company (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has overwhelmingly passed a resolution supporting the "New York Declaration," which calls for irreversible steps toward a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine without the involvement of Hamas. The resolution demands that Hamas release all hostages, end its governance in Gaza, and transfer its weapons to the Palestinian Authority. The French and Saudi-backed initiative, which passed 142-10, aims to lay the groundwork for a sovereign Palestinian state and comes ahead of a summit where France plans to formally recognize Palestine.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has made an unannounced visit to Kyiv to support Ukrainians who have suffered life-changing injuries during the war with Russia. The visit came at the invitation of Superhumans, an organization that provides prosthetics and rehabilitation services.

The visit is connected to his Invictus Games Foundation, which supports the recovery of wounded military personnel and has included a Ukrainian team since 2022.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has begun using the term "monkeypox" again, reversing a 2022 decision by the World Health Organization and U.S. public health bodies to adopt the name "mpox." The change to mpox was made to address concerns that the original name was scientifically inaccurate and carried racist and stigmatizing connotations, particularly against Black and LGBTQ communities. Public health experts have expressed bafflement at the reversion, suggesting it may be a political move by the Trump administration that could create confusion and revive harmful stigma.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is navigating a delicate political balance with President Trump regarding the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the city. While Bowser has acknowledged a recent drop in violent crime since the surge of federal officers, she has also pushed back against the use of masked ICE agents and out-of-state National Guard troops. This cautious approach contrasts sharply with her more confrontational stance during Trump's first term but reflects the political reality that Congress and the president hold ultimate authority over the district's governance.</p>

          <p>Apple is facing weakening enthusiasm from consumers in China, contributing to sluggish sales and a slipping grip on a crucial market. Many former loyal customers now perceive the company's new iPhone models as lacking significant innovation compared to previous generations. This sentiment, combined with the rise of competitive domestic brands, has led to a decline in Apple's status as a pioneer in the eyes of many Chinese consumers. The trend reflects broader challenges for multinational corporations operating in China's increasingly competitive and nationalistic market environment.</p>

          <p>A new book by Harvard historian and New Yorker writer Jill Lepore, titled "We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution," examines the origins and evolution of America's founding document. An excerpt from the introduction frames the Constitution not as a static relic but as a living entity composed of ideas that endure and change over time. Lepore highlights the document's ingenious design, which accounted for the passage of time and the need for reform. The book explores the ongoing struggle to amend and interpret the Constitution for an evolving nation.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is creating a noticeable shift in the apparel market, dubbed the "Ozempic effect." Clothing resellers report a significant increase in donations of larger-sized clothing, while demand for smaller sizes is growing. In response, some retailers are reducing the in-store stock of extended sizes, making them more frequently available as online-only items. While the plus-size market remains significant, brands are observing a trend of customers moving from the largest sizes (5-6XL) into a lower tier of plus-sizes (3-4XL).</p>

          <p>Julia Fenner, a UK-Belarus dual citizen and wife of a British diplomat, has been released from a Belarusian prison as part of a deal between Belarus and the United States. She was one of 52 political prisoners freed in exchange for the U.S. easing some sanctions on Belarus's national airline. Fenner had been detained in March 2024 and was serving a long sentence on charges related to extremist activity. UK Europe Minister Stephen Doughty praised the release as "great news" and thanked the U.S. for its diplomatic efforts.</p>
