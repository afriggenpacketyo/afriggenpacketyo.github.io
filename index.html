          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that its online services will experience disruptions until July due to a cyberattack that occurred over the Easter weekend. The retailer estimates that this attack will reduce profits for the current year by around £300 million, a significant hit to their financial outlook. CEO Stuart Machin stated that while there is no change to the company's long-term strategy, the incident allows M&S to accelerate the pace of change. The ransomware attack is believed to be the work of Scattered Spider, utilizing tools from the cyber-crime service DragonForce.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer in an effort to encourage residents to use air conditioning without worrying about costs amid increasingly extreme heat. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike announced that a supplementary budget bill, including 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) to cover the costs, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly session in June. This plan is expected to benefit about 8.2 million households, saving them around 5,000 yen on their water bills over the four months. Metered water usage will still be charged as usual.</p>

          <p>Indian writer, lawyer, and activist Banu Mushtaq has become the first author writing in the Kannada language to win the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp.' The collection, translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India. Judges praised Mushtaq's characters as "astonishing portraits of survival and resilience". Mushtaq's work mirrors many of the challenges faced by the women in her stories, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society. The win has shone a bigger spotlight on her life and literary oeuvre.</p>

          <p>Leanne Lucas, a survivor of the Southport stabbings that killed three children, is advocating for the use of blunt-tipped knives to reduce the risk of serious injuries. Lucas, a yoga instructor, realized that cooking had become a trigger for hyper-vigilance since the attack and launched the Let's Be Blunt campaign to promote safer alternatives to traditional pointed knives. She draws inspiration from figures like Idris Elba and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who have also spoken about the potential benefits of blunt-tipped knives. Lucas hopes to drive a cultural shift similar to the ban on indoor smoking, aiming to raise awareness and encourage safer kitchen practices.</p>

The U.S. administration has repeatedly criticized Pretoria for what it claims is the systematic persecution of white Afrikaner farmers. Ramaphosa wants to address Trump directly regarding race relations and his government's policies, particularly the false conspiracy theory of a "white genocide" in South Africa. A vital free trade agreement hangs in the balance amid other economic concerns, making the meeting crucial for South Africa.</p>

          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses are reporting that doing business in China has become increasingly difficult, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and a perceived depreciation of foreign firms in China’s evolving industrial policy. Despite these challenges, British firms continue to demonstrate substantial engagement with and commitment to the Chinese market. Escalating tensions between China and the US have compounded the issue, causing many firms to delay investments not just in China, but globally with any China exposure. The British Chamber of Commerce in China is calling for a more favorable policy environment with clear and fairly enforced rules.</p>

          <p>Japan’s agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage with a remark that he had never bought a bag of rice, his nation’s staple grain, which is currently in short supply. The comment drew attention to the government’s inability to resolve the rice shortage, which has driven up the cost of a food consumed by almost every Japanese household. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto’s resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister in an effort to contain the political fallout. The shortage has been blamed on decades-old policies meant to protect small-time farmers, blocking newcomers from buying or using agricultural land.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall “mega-tsunami” could potentially devastate a large part of America's West Coast if a strong earthquake hits the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. Such an event could sink coastal land by as much as 6.5 feet and trigger waves up to 1,000 feet high, endangering cities like Seattle and Portland. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this earthquake would occur rapidly, leaving no time for adaptation or mitigation.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Agriculture Minister Resigns After Insensitive Rice Comment</h2>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after making a remark about not having to buy rice because he receives it as gifts, which was seen as insensitive given high rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted the resignation, and the gaffe could cause further trouble for his struggling minority government ahead of a crucial national election in July. Eto said he made an extremely inappropriate remark at a time when consumers are struggling with soaring rice prices. Media reports indicate that his successor will be former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi.</p>

          <p>Young people are increasingly using nicotine pouches as an alternative to vaping, but health experts warn that these pouches are addictive and may have harmful side effects. Some teenagers have turned to nicotine pouches to quit vaping, only to develop a new addiction. While packs contain age restriction warnings, teenagers report having no problem purchasing them. There are concerns that the ban on disposable vapes could lead more young people to use the stronger nicotine pouches. Retailers claim they do not sell nicotine pouches to under-18s and promote them as a harm reduction technique for smokers.</p>

          <p>A recent study has revealed that high doses of radiation therapy, commonly used to target and destroy cancer cells, can paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. Scientists at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre discovered that high doses of radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even when these tumors had not directly received radiation therapy. The research highlights the potential double-edged sword of radiotherapy and raises questions about its impact on cancer progression.</p>

          <p>Cas Mudde argues that the media's focus on young men supposedly voting far right is empirically flawed and misses a more significant shift in public opinion among young people. While many surveys show a gender gap in support of far-right parties, young women are increasingly turning towards the left. Mudde suggests that center-left parties should focus on the priorities and values of female voters to transform the political debate and give young women a reason to vote.</p>

          <p>Veterinary students are in high demand due to a shortage of veterinary professionals, spurred by high turnover rates and a surge in pet ownership. However, these students face challenges such as rising student debt and alarming suicide rates. The lack of animal medical care has led to overcrowded shelters and a rise in pet illnesses. Although the demand for veterinary services is increasing, the profession is also marked by high stress and emotional demands, requiring veterinarians to balance care for pets, owners, and themselves.</p>
