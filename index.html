After joining the Nation of Islam, he denounced "white devils" and criticized Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent approach. A pilgrimage to Mecca shifted his views, leading him to seek an alliance of oppressed people of color against white colonial oppression before his assassination in 1965.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy's "non-conforming" driver became a significant topic at the US PGA, overshadowing Scottie Scheffler's victory. Rumors emerged that McIlroy had to switch drivers after his original club failed a legality test. The PGA of America confirmed that testing for driver heads is common and that results are kept confidential to protect players. McIlroy, who struggled at the event, did not comment, leading to speculation about the validity of his Masters win. Observers noted the potential for ill-informed conclusions due to the leaked information.</p>

          <p>Manchester City has reportedly cooled its interest in Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz due to the escalating costs associated with the deal. While Wirtz is considered a top young talent, the estimated 300 million euros required for transfer fees and wages is deemed too high. City has a history of walking away from transfers if they believe the deal does not represent value for money.

          <p>Alison Bechdel's latest work, "Spent," continues to explore the themes of anxiety and insecurity through her cartoon avatar. The novel touches on late-stage capitalism and personal exhaustion, but ultimately finds a sense of calm and happiness. Bechdel's art evokes the spirit of the moment through expressions and gestures, offering a wide and soothing expanse of tamed nature. The artist is able to distill her singular experience into a more generalizable one. The story revolves around her chosen family and is set in Vermont, where they actually live.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel will take control of the entire Gaza Strip, escalating the military offensive in the territory. Netanyahu said the aim was to have an area entirely controlled by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) where the entire civilian population of Gaza could receive the aid, with Hamas receiving nothing. Hamas' October 2023 attack, which triggered the ongoing war, killed 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians. Gaza's Hamas-controlled Health Ministry on Sunday said at least 3,193 people have been killed since Israel resumed its strikes on March 18, bringing the total death toll in the war to 53,339.</p>
