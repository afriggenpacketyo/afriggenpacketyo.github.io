          <p>Representative Gerry Connolly, a leading Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has announced his plans to step down from his role and will not seek reelection due to the recurrence of his cancer. Connolly, who was first elected in 2009, had previously announced his diagnosis of esophageal cancer six months prior and underwent treatments. His departure could potentially pave the way for younger leadership within the Democratic party as older members announce retirements following the 2024 election loss. Connolly has served on the Oversight Committee since his first term and has led Democrats on the subcommittee on government operations since 2013.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has called for mass protests against President Donald Trump and his administration, declaring them an affront to the country's founding values. He urged for Republicans to be met with resistance and punished at the ballot box, suggesting their portraits should be relegated to museums for tyrants. This statement has sparked controversy, with Donald Trump Jr. questioning if the governor was inciting violence. Pritzker has served as governor of Illinois since early 2019.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has been marked by significant policy shifts and widespread division within the United States during his first 100 days. The administration has faced criticism for its handling of the war in Ukraine, with Trump seeming to favor Russian interests over Ukrainian sovereignty. Immigration policy has also been a key focus, with Trump promising a large deportation program, although deportation numbers have not significantly increased. Economically, Trump's policies have led to mixed results, with some prices falling but concerns rising about the impact of tariffs on consumers and trade relations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration lined the White House North Lawn with booking photos of immigrants with previous convictions or charges, including violent crimes and drug offenses, to highlight its immigration enforcement measures. The administration aims to mark President Trump's nearly 100 days in office by showcasing its aggressive approach to immigration, particularly regarding immigrants suspected or convicted of crimes. White House officials assert they are actively seeking out and deporting illegal aliens who commit crimes. However, the administration has faced criticism for its handling of some migrant arrests and deportations, including deporting U.S. citizens with their non-citizen mothers.</p>

          <p>A fire at a southern Iranian port, caused by a massive explosion, has been extinguished, with the death toll rising to at least 65 people. Satellite images reveal the extent of the devastation, raising questions about the cause of the blast at the Shahid Rajaei port near Bandar Abbas. The port reportedly received a chemical component needed for solid fuel for ballistic missiles, a claim denied by Iranian authorities. The incident occurred as Iran began a third round of negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Refinancing student loans can be a strategic move for borrowers seeking better terms, such as lower interest rates or consolidated payments. Several private lenders offer refinancing options, each with unique terms and conditions. Key considerations include interest rates (fixed vs. variable), loan terms, repayment flexibility, and potential fees. Borrowers with federal student loans should carefully consider the implications of refinancing into a private loan, as it forfeits federal protections like income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs.
