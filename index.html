          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 17:37:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is considering eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, a proposal aimed at stimulating the housing market. Proponents, including the National Association of Realtors, argue this would release inventory by encouraging older homeowners to sell without facing a significant tax penalty. However, critics suggest the change would primarily benefit wealthy Americans, as many homeowners already fall under the current $250,000/$500,000 exclusion limit. The move could also potentially increase housing demand from investors, further impacting affordability for average families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced a nationwide crackdown focusing on undocumented immigrants with criminal records, highlighting several arrests of individuals with convictions for serious offenses like assault, burglary, and drug trafficking. The agency states that 70% of its recent arrests involved individuals with criminal charges or convictions, pushing back against criticism that its operations target non-criminal immigrants. An official praised the effort, stating the administration has "unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst" despite an increase in assaults against officers. This initiative occurs amidst intense debate over immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey man has pleaded guilty to leading a sophisticated criminal enterprise that trafficked stolen catalytic converters, generating over $600 million in revenue. The nationwide scheme involved purchasing stolen converters from various states and selling them to a metal refinery, which extracted valuable precious metals like platinum and rhodium. The operation was uncovered following a routine traffic stop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, during a period of surging catalytic converter thefts across the country. The man now faces a potential prison sentence of up to 17.5 years for his role.</p>

          <p>More than six months after the destructive Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles, the remains of another victim have been discovered in Altadena, bringing the total death toll to 31. The discovery highlights the long-lasting impact of the fires, which were among the deadliest in California's history and destroyed over 16,000 structures. The victim has not yet been identified, and officials note that the identification process can be lengthy due to the condition of the remains.

          <p>The National Urban League, one of the country's oldest and most prominent civil rights organizations, has issued a stark warning about the impact of the Trump administration's policies. The group stated that these policies have created a "state of emergency" for Black Americans, particularly concerning anti-discrimination measures, personal freedoms, and economic advancement. This declaration represents a powerful condemnation from a major civil rights group, highlighting deep concerns about the current political and social climate for the Black community under the administration's leadership. The statement adds a significant voice to the ongoing national conversation about racial equity.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has reignited the political debate over Russia's 2016 election interference by releasing declassified documents. Gabbard claimed the files show evidence of a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era officials to manipulate intelligence and undermine then-candidate Trump, and she has made a criminal referral to the DOJ. Democrats vehemently rejected these claims, accusing Gabbard of dangerously misrepresenting intelligence and ignoring bipartisan reports that confirmed Russia's influence campaign. The move was praised by President Trump and his allies, further politicizing the U.S. intelligence community.</p>

          <p>First Amendment and immigrant rights groups are advocating for the release of Mario Guevara, a Salvadoran journalist who was arrested while covering a protest and is now detained by ICE in Georgia. Despite the initial charges being dropped, Guevara remains in detention, leading groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists to argue he is being "punished for his journalism." Guevara, who has a pending green card application, is known for his coverage of immigration raids for Spanish-speaking audiences. His case raises serious concerns about press freedom and the targeting of journalists by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following an order from President Trump, the federal government has released a massive trove of over 230,000 pages of previously non-digitized records related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The files include FBI memos on the investigation, details about the search for assassin James Earl Ray, and documents concerning the FBI's extensive surveillance of Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement. While the release provides unprecedented online access, Dr. King's family urged the public to view the files with respect, noting they contain information from a campaign intended to degrade his legacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. has reached new trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, setting a 19% tariff rate on goods imported from both nations. According to the White House, the deals will see the Philippines and Indonesia significantly lower their own tariffs on U.S. goods, creating a more open market for American industrial, tech, and agricultural products. The announcement with the Philippines came after a White House meeting with its president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. These agreements are part of the administration's broader strategy to reshape global trade relationships.

          <p>The Republican-led House of Representatives announced it would end its work week a day early, a move Democrats claim is an attempt to avoid politically difficult votes related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Republicans downplayed the decision, stating that committee work would continue and that the White House is already addressing the issue.

Bessent expressed optimism about the state of trade relations, suggesting the talks could also address other key issues, including China's manufacturing surplus and its purchases of sanctioned Russian oil.

          <p>Major automakers are feeling the financial strain of U.S. tariff policies, with General Motors and Stellantis reporting combined tariff costs of nearly $1.5 billion in the last quarter alone. This has significantly impacted their profit margins, with GM's dropping from 9% to 6.1%. So far, car manufacturers have largely absorbed these costs rather than passing them on to consumers, who are already facing high vehicle prices. This strategy, however, is impacting company profitability and raising concerns on Wall Street about the long-term sustainability if the tariffs persist. (not investment advice)</p>
