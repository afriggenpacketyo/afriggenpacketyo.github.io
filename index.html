        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners, marking a rare moment of cooperation amidst their ongoing conflict. Each side released 307 soldiers, following a previous exchange of 390 combatants and civilians. The prisoner swap occurred hours after Kyiv experienced a large-scale missile and drone attack, resulting in injuries to at least 15 people. Despite the prisoner exchange, fighting persists along the 620-mile front line, with both countries continuing deep strikes, while diplomatic efforts remain complex, with Russia presenting draft conditions for a peace agreement and President Trump claiming progress after a phone call with Putin. Optimism in this scenario is relatively tempered due to the ongoing attacks and casualties.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist, passed away at 90; her book ‚ÄúAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Rape‚Äù reshaped the modern understanding of sexual assault by reframing it as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. Published in 1975, the book offered a comprehensive history of sexual assault across centuries and examined its use as a wartime tactic. Brownmiller's work contributed to the rise of anti-sexual assault groups, self-defense classes, and the rewriting of sexual assault laws in several states, including the abolishment of the corroborating witness rule and the implementation of rape shield laws. Despite facing criticism for some of her views, Brownmiller remained a significant figure in the feminist movement, advocating against pornography and emphasizing the importance of women recognizing potential danger.</p>

Renewed military action has included a blockade of Gaza, with limited aid trickling in, and allegations have surfaced accusing the Israeli military of using Palestinians as human shields.

While the monarchy's popularity varies among Canadians, the invitation marks a shift towards a more supportive stance from the Liberal government, even though some Quebec politicians are still calling for Canada to cut ties with the monarchy.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors say the condition, which involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, is treatable but often underdiagnosed, with symptoms that can mimic normal aging. Symptoms include difficulty walking, cognitive issues, and urinary incontinence, and diagnosis typically involves a CT scan or brain MRI, followed by a lumbar puncture. Treatment involves surgery to insert a shunt to drain excess fluid, and early detection is key for improving outcomes.</p>

          <p>As driving lesson costs rise, learners struggle to afford them, while instructors argue that the prices are fair due to increased expenses. The cost of lessons is rising alongside the already high cost of living, causing learners to cut back on other necessities. The DVSA survey shows that instructors are charging more, with a smaller percentage charging ¬£35 or less per hour compared to previous years. The rising prices are also causing learners to take lessons less frequently, prolonging the learning process, and a backlog in practical tests means learners need more lessons to maintain their skills.</p>

          <p>A BBC journalist in Amsterdam had her broadcasting bike stolen, which she described as more than just a bicycle, it was a mobile broadcasting studio used for her series "Dutch News from the Cycle Path". The bike allowed her to reach breaking news scenes and broadcast live, while also demonstrating the possibility of combining motherhood and career. The loss was felt deeply, not only by the journalist but also by the community, who recognized the bike's significance and offered support in finding it.</p>

          <p>The US refugee policy is under scrutiny as it welcomes white South Africans while other refugees remain in limbo, facing canceled flights and prolonged waiting periods. President Trump's administration has prioritized Afrikaners, citing "racial discrimination," while restricting access for other refugees, including those from the Democratic Republic of Congo. This decision has sparked criticism and accusations of unfair treatment, with some arguing that all cases of protection should be based on credible evidence of persecution and equal treatment under the law.</p>

These churches, particularly the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), are experiencing growth due to conversions, attracting men who feel alienated by modern American society. Converts express a desire for traditional gender roles, home-schooling, and a rejection of what they see as excessive feminization in Western culture, while the trend reflects broader political shifts and a growing interest in Russia as a bastion of traditional Christianity.</p>
