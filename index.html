          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a thorough examination of the Federal Reserve, suggesting its entire mission and institutional success should be evaluated. His comments come amid White House criticism of the central bank's interest rate policies and renovation-related cost overruns. Bessent questioned the Fed's effectiveness, comparing the need for a review to what would happen at the FAA after repeated mistakes. He also supported the idea of easing interest rates, citing moderating inflation numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

For instance, a dependent first-year undergrad can borrow up to $5,500, while the aggregate limit for all undergrad loans is $31,000. Since these amounts often don't cover the full cost of attendance, the article suggests exploring private student loans to fill the funding gap after exhausting federal options.

Warren countered White House claims of economic benefits by pointing to increased costs for families and a decline in manufacturing investment.

Berries are rich in flavonoids that protect brain signaling pathways, while seafood like salmon and sardines provides omega-3 fatty acids that may reduce amyloid protein clusters. Leafy greens such as kale and spinach have been linked to less plaque buildup in the brain. These foods are central to the MIND diet, which studies have shown can significantly cut dementia risk.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, the former Louisville police officer involved in the fatal 2020 raid on Breonna Taylor's home, is scheduled for sentencing in federal court. Last November, a jury convicted Hankison of one count of civil rights abuse for using excessive force by firing shots through a covered door and window. Although the shots did not strike Taylor, the jury found his actions involved an attempt to kill. The Justice Department's recommendation of only one day in prison has drawn sharp criticism from Taylor's family attorney, Ben Crump, as an insult to her life.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that recent congressional testimony from leaders of UC Berkeley, CUNY, and Georgetown has provided much-needed clarity on the campus debate over antisemitism. When asked directly, the university officials affirmed that denying the Jewish people's right to self-determination—a core tenet of Zionism—is a form of antisemitism. The author suggests this recognition is an important step for protecting Jewish students from discrimination and can help shift campus conflicts away from debates over Israel's existence. The piece concludes that the terms "Zionism" and "anti-Zionism" are outdated and should be retired from modern discourse.</p>

          <p>The process for launching an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is designed with multiple layers of redundancy to prevent unauthorized or rogue actions. Contrary to popular depictions, there are no single big red buttons inside the underground control capsules. Instead, launching a missile requires a complex sequence involving two officers, or "missileers," in at least two separate bunkers. Each officer must turn a key simultaneously with their partner, and both capsules must act in unison after decrypting and verifying launch orders and codes.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs, known for treating diabetes and obesity, are being explored as a game-changing treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common and underdiagnosed hormonal disorder. Women with PCOS often experience insulin resistance, and studies suggest that losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve this, in turn helping to balance hormones. Some patients in small trials and anecdotal reports have seen significant improvements in PCOS symptoms, including weight loss, hair regrowth, and the return of regular menstrual cycles. However, experts stress the need for larger trials and note that insurance coverage remains a major barrier.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block a new Mississippi law that bans diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at public schools and universities. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by plaintiffs, including the Mississippi Association of Educators, who argue the law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The judge cited that the law was already having a chilling effect on constitutional speech, such as discussions of gender theory at Jackson State University.

The two were often photographed at parties, and Trump once praised Epstein as a "terrific guy" who liked women on "the younger side."
