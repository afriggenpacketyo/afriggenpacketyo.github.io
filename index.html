          <p>SpaceX has rescheduled its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight from Starbase, Texas, due to an issue with ground systems, following three prior catastrophic in-flight failures. The mission aimed to test numerous upgrades and stress the vehicle, with objectives including a landing burn experiment for the booster and an in-space engine restart for Starship. This development impacts the ambitious timeline for Elon Musk's Mars colonization plans and NASA's Artemis moon landing program, which relies on Starship for astronaut transport and requires many successful refueling flights. Many aerospace observers consider the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing unrealistic due to these ongoing technical challenges.</p>

          <p>Asia markets, particularly Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, saw significant gains, rising over 2% and nearing a four-year peak, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential monetary policy easing next month. The tech sector contributed substantially to these gains, with companies like Nio and ASMPT experiencing strong rallies. Mainland China's CSI 300 also extended its upward trend, reaching a 37-month high. Analysts suggest that declining deposit rates could shift funds into equities, and potential capital rotation from the US to China following Fed rate cuts may sustain this momentum.</p>

          <p>Angry confrontations between opponents and supporters of migrants erupted across Britain over the holiday weekend, fueled by a court order to evict asylum-seekers from a hotel in Epping. This ruling has intensified the government's struggle to manage unauthorized migration and house refugees, an issue becoming a major political flashpoint. The government has pledged to accelerate asylum appeals to clear backlogs and potentially increase deportations. The protests, which included a sexual assault charge against a hotel resident, highlight broader tensions over public expense and the social impact of housing tens of thousands of asylum-seekers.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, reacting to increased expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This "dovish pivot" by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole conference has led to the offshore yuan climbing significantly. Analysts now widely anticipate a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve, shifting focus to the scale and pace of future easing. This development reflects global market reactions to US monetary policy signals and their impact on currency valuations.</p>

The 38-year-old Serb, returning after a six-week hiatus, acknowledged the "physical struggle" but attributed it to a lack of match practice rather than injury. Djokovic, aiming for a record 25th major title, has increasingly focused his schedule on Grand Slam tournaments. American hopefuls Ben Shelton and Taylor Fritz also advanced, continuing their bids to end the 22-year wait for a Grand Slam men's singles champion from the US.</p>

          <p>Chinese property developer Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a symbolic end to its spectacular rise and fall under $300 billion of debt. Once China's largest real estate firm, its collapse significantly contributes to the country's ongoing property crisis, which has heavily impacted the world's second-largest economy. The liquidation order followed the company's inability to offer a viable plan for its overseas liabilities. Experts believe the property slump remains the biggest drag on China's economy, affecting consumer spending and local government income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The A9, Scotland's longest road, continues to be a site of tragic fatal crashes, with 48 lives lost on the Inverness to Perth stretch in the last decade. A US family's dream trip ended in tragedy, with three members killed in a collision on a single-carriageway section. The road's design, with frequent changes between single and dual carriageways, encourages dangerous overtaking. The government's commitment to dual the entire road, initially set for 2025, has been delayed by a decade to 2035, drawing criticism from campaigners who argue that each delay risks more lives.</p>

          <p>New Justice Department allegations claim three indicted Smartmatic executives transferred money from a 2018 Los Angeles County voting machine contract into slush funds previously used for bribery in Venezuela and the Philippines. While prosecutors haven't confirmed if LA County money was used for new bribes, they aim to show a pattern of misconduct. Separately, Fox News, facing a defamation suit from Smartmatic, alleges LA County's registrar received improper gifts from the company, which he denies.

          <p>President Trump has told Maryland Governor Wes Moore to "clean up this crime disaster" in Baltimore before he would visit, and threatened to reconsider federal funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge. This follows Moore's criticism of Trump's deployment of armed National Guard troops to Washington D.C. and rejection of similar intervention in Baltimore, calling Trump's rhetoric "performative." Moore asserts that Maryland has seen a significant decrease in homicides and gun violence, attributing it to local strategies. The exchange highlights a deepening political conflict over crime and federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Russia is actively expanding its state-backed media, RT and Sputnik, across the Global South, including Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, following bans in Western countries. This strategy aims to counter Western influence, build support for its actions, and foster economic ties by appealing to anti-American and anti-imperialist sentiments. RT's content is tailored to specific audiences, often presenting a narrative that portrays Russia as a victim of Western aggression. While difficult to quantify the direct impact, this expansion contributes to a shifting world order and raises concerns about disinformation.</p>

          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of defense tech company Anduril, advocates for AI-powered autonomous weapons as the future of warfare, asserting they reduce human risk and transform the US into a "world gun store." Anduril's products, including jet-powered drones and electromagnetic systems, are already deployed by the US military and in Ukraine. Luckey argues these "smart weapons" are superior to "dumb weapons" and promote peace through deterrence, emphasizing a "kill switch" for human intervention. The company, building products rather than just contracting, anticipates over $6 billion in government contracts worldwide, challenging traditional defense contractors.</p>
