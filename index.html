          <p>The United States is conducting a review of its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, known as Aukus, to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This review, led by Elbridge Colby, questions the transfer of valuable assets amid stretched US submarine capacities. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, emphasizing the importance of the pact for security in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions, while some analysts suggest the focus may shift away from submarines. The agreement, signed in 2021, aims to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines as a response to China's growing power.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The appointments have raised concerns among public health advocates, who fear the lack of transparency and potential for undermining vaccine policy, while Kennedy asserts that his picks are committed to evidence-based medicine.

The discovery, published in Nature, is based on two 86 million-year-old skeletons found in Mongolia. This species represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, with features like skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw. The new species helps revise the tyrannosaur family tree and rewrite the evolution of tyrannosaurs, weighing about 750kg, smaller than an adult T. rex.</p>
