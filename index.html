          <p>Russia launched a large-scale air assault on Ukraine, deploying missiles and drones across multiple cities and villages, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including children, and dozens of injuries. Ukrainian officials reported that the attack involved nearly 370 missiles and drones, with air defenses neutralizing a significant portion of the aerial threats. President Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as deliberate acts of terror against ordinary cities and called for increased international pressure on Russia through sanctions.

          <p>Venezuelans are participating in elections for lawmakers and governors amid government repression and calls for a boycott from the main opposition, led by Maria Corina Machado. The vote is the first major electoral event since last year's presidential election, which Nicolas Maduro claimed to have won despite fraud allegations. Machado's faction argues that participation legitimizes Maduro's rule, while a smaller opposition group believes low turnout only strengthens Maduro's control. Recent polls indicate strong support for Maduro's party among those likely to vote, while the government has detained dozens linked to an alleged plot to disrupt the election.

She recounts how watching horror movies helped her cope with personal tragedies, providing a temporary distraction from her own grief. Feintzeig humorously describes her failed attempts to engage others in her zombie fascination and her husband's unhelpful matter-of-factness about the possibility of a fungal zombie pandemic. She concludes that while she looks forward to the end of the season, she also anticipates the challenge of finding a new terrifying alternate reality to escape to.

          <p>Sir Alan Bates, a former subpostmaster and campaigner for victims of the Post Office scandal, has criticized the government's compensation offer, stating it amounts to less than half of his claim. He accuses ministers of overseeing "quasi-kangaroo courts" and altering the "goal posts" on their judgements. Bates calls for an independent body to be created to deliver compensation schemes for public sector scandals. The government maintains it aims to give the benefit of the doubt to postmasters and that those unhappy with their offer can have their case reviewed.

          <p>A virologist from the University of Nottingham is urging the public not to be overly concerned after West Nile virus was detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found fragments of the virus in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire. Prof Jonathan Ball believes climate change will likely increase the range of mosquito-borne diseases further north, but stresses that the risk to the general public remains low. The best way to avoid the virus is to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using insecticide. The optimism score reflects the author's tone about the topic.</p>
