          <p>Hackers have breached the Tea App, a platform for women to share information about men they date, leaking data for users who signed up before February 2024. The breach compromised approximately 72,000 images, including selfies and photo IDs used for verification, but did not expose email addresses or phone numbers. The app's administrators confirmed the cyberattack on a legacy storage system and are working with security experts to secure their platform. The attack may have been instigated by users on the 4Chan message board, where a link to the stolen data was allegedly posted.</p>

          <p>A 14-year-old was killed and a 19-year-old was injured in a shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory in Albuquerque. The incident occurred early Friday when an 18-year-old suspect allegedly opened fire on three others while they were playing video games in a dorm room. New Mexico State Police have taken the suspect into custody, and charges are forthcoming as the investigation continues. The university closed its central campus for the day as a precaution but plans to resume normal activities, offering counseling services to the community.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, to denounce what they call President Kais Saied's authoritarian regime. The demonstration marked the fourth anniversary of Saied's 2021 move to dissolve parliament and rule by decree, an act critics labeled a coup. Protesters chanted for the "fall of the regime" and the release of jailed opposition figures, journalists, and activists, arguing that the country has become an "open-air prison." Since 2021, Saied has consolidated power, dismantled judicial bodies, and overseen the imprisonment of many political opponents.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing over 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program. This move, part of a Trump administration initiative to reduce the size of the federal workforce, would shrink NASA's personnel from 18,000 to about 14,000. The departures come amid a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and a recent leadership crisis. The agency has stated that safety remains a top priority as it aims to become more streamlined for future exploration missions.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that one of two military-style hand grenades recovered from a Santa Monica complex is unaccounted for following a deadly explosion. The blast on July 18 killed three Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives at a training academy where they were attempting to render the devices safe. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has determined that one grenade detonated, but an extensive search has not located the second one. The ATF is now leading the investigation into the origin and whereabouts of the missing explosive, though officials state there is no immediate danger to the public.</p>

Despite being without shortstop Mookie Betts, the team continued a recent trend of improved run production. Teoscar Hernández was a key contributor, drawing a bases-loaded walk and hitting a two-run home run, while Andy Pages also added to the offense with a double and a sacrifice fly.

The recall effort was initiated by civic groups after KMT lawmakers, in alliance with the Taiwan People's Party, obstructed government agendas and pushed controversial reforms.

The suspension was enforced because both players, who were voted into the MLS All-Star game, chose to skip the event, citing the need for rest. According to league rules, unapproved absence from the All-Star game results in a one-match ban for the player's club. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged it was a difficult decision but stated the league had to enforce its long-standing policy, though he added it would be reevaluated.</p>

The animals, including pregnant ewes, were airlifted over 200 miles to an isolated, disease-free mountain range.

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff blaming Hamas for showing a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire." The talks broke down over conflicting demands, as Hamas insists on a full Israeli withdrawal for the release of hostages, a condition Israel rejects. As diplomacy falters, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, with the UN reporting that children are starving to death and UNICEF finding a 180% increase in acute malnourishment since February. The war, which began after Hamas's attack in October 2023, has killed over 59,000 Palestinians.</p>

          <p>According to her attorney, Ghislaine Maxwell was questioned about roughly 100 different people during her two-day interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. The lawyer, David Oscar Markus, stated that Maxwell answered every question posed to her and "didn't hold anything back." The meetings took place as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more files related to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. While Maxwell's team has not formally requested a pardon, her lawyer noted that President Trump has the power to grant one, and they hope he exercises it in a "just way."</p>

          <p>Several former federal prosecutors have described Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's direct interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell as highly unorthodox and concerning. They noted that such interviews are typically handled by the line prosecutors who tried the case, not by high-ranking political appointees, raising questions about the motive and credibility of the process. Experts expressed concern that Maxwell, seeking to reduce her 20-year sentence, might not be a reliable source and that Blanche's involvement appears to be a political move rather than a standard judicial procedure. This is complicated by the recent firing of the lead prosecutor in Maxwell's case.</p>

Experts suggest that while these targets provide useful guidance, individual needs can vary significantly. For instance, a kidney specialist argues that thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most healthy people, while a nutritionist points to the benefits of a water target for preventing symptoms like fatigue. Most experts agree that consistency and a holistic approach are more important than rigidly adhering to specific numbers, advocating for adapting recommendations to fit one's own lifestyle.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how the female body is uniquely affected by elite athletic activity. Researchers are studying topics that were once taboo, such as the impact of the menstrual cycle on performance, the biomechanics of breast movement, and the reasons for a higher risk of certain injuries like ACL tears. This new focus moves away from treating female athletes as "mini-men," leading to better support, including properly fitted sports bras and training adjustments. The goal is to improve performance, reduce injuries, and keep more women and girls engaged in sports.</p>

          <p>The asteroid 2024 YR4, once considered the riskiest ever observed for a potential Earth impact, is now projected to miss our planet but may collide with the moon in late 2032. While an Earth impact has been ruled out, a lunar strike from the "city-killer" sized asteroid presents new concerns for planetary defense. Such a collision could endanger any future lunar missions and infrastructure, and it could also send a shower of high-velocity debris toward Earth, threatening the vital satellite networks we rely on for communication and navigation. This scenario is prompting scientists to consider expanding planetary defense to include threats to the moon.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the food boxes being distributed in Gaza by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised nutritional concerns among aid experts. While the boxes, containing items like pasta, lentils, and flour, provide sufficient calories for survival, specialists say they lack essential micronutrients like iron, calcium, and various vitamins. Experts warn that a prolonged diet of these contents could lead to "hidden hunger" and diseases like anemia and scurvy, and it lacks appropriate food for young children. The GHF's aid effort comes as the UN warns of a deepening starvation crisis across the territory.</p>
