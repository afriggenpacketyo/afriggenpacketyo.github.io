          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to revoke humanitarian parole for over 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, allowing their removal from the country to proceed while litigation continues. Justices Jackson and Sotomayor dissented, with Jackson expressing concern over the devastating consequences of abruptly upending the lives of so many noncitizens. This decision follows the administration's earlier move to terminate "Temporary Protected Status" for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans and comes amid criticism for accepting white South African refugees while restricting immigration from other countries. The administration's policies have faced legal challenges and accusations of undermining established humanitarian protections. The high court's decision means the Trump administration can move forward with it's policy change even as the litigation continues in lower courts on the merits. The implications of this ruling on immigration policy and the lives of affected individuals are significant. </p>

          <p>A paraglider in China miraculously survived after being unexpectedly pulled to an altitude of 28,208 feet without oxygen due to a powerful updraft. Peng Yujiang, an experienced paraglider, was conducting a routine equipment test when he became trapped inside a cumulonimbus cloud system, a phenomenon known as "cloud suck". Footage from his 360-degree camera captured the harrowing experience as ice formed around his face and equipment while he flew through thick clouds. Following the incident, Peng received a six-month flight suspension, as the flight site and airspace had not been approved in advance. This incident highlights the unpredictable dangers inherent in paragliding and the importance of adhering to safety regulations. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly making a renewed push to "decouple" the U.S. from China through various measures, including initiating a trade war, implementing export controls, and revoking student visas. This move represents a second attempt by administration officials to sever ties with China, potentially escalating tensions between the two nations. The actions are expected to have far-reaching implications for trade, education, and geopolitical relations. This strategy signals a more confrontational approach towards China, aiming to reduce economic dependence and assert American dominance.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed subdued figures in April, coinciding with a slowdown in consumer spending. This development has led the Federal Reserve to maintain a cautious approach, holding off on interest rate cuts until there is greater clarity regarding President Trumpâ€™s economic policies. The central bank's decision reflects concerns about potential economic uncertainties and the need for more data before adjusting monetary policy. The report underscores the delicate balance the Fed must strike between managing inflation and supporting economic growth. The data will be closely monitored by economists and policymakers alike.

          <p>The District Attorney of Orleans Parish has accused the Sheriff's Office of being "compromised" following a massive jailbreak involving 10 inmates. This accusation comes after the Sheriff, Susan Hutson, filed a lawsuit seeking to recuse the District Attorney, Jason Williams, from investigating the incident. Williams criticized the Sheriff's Office for not immediately requesting an independent forensic processing of the scene. The Louisiana Attorney General's office will now lead the investigation, focusing on recapturing the remaining escapees and understanding the systemic failures that led to the jailbreak.

The study contradicts claims made by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has advocated for ending water fluoridation, and underscores the effectiveness of fluoride in preventing tooth decay.

          <p>The United States' decision to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Communist Party mirrors similar restrictions imposed during President Trump's first term. This move has prompted a restrained response from Beijing, which has denounced the policy as "discriminatory" and lodged diplomatic protests. Analysts suggest that China's measured approach is due to its focus on trade negotiations with the Trump administration and a belief that the policy will ultimately harm the US. The visa crackdown is seen as a continuation of efforts to limit Chinese influence and protect national security. </p>

          <p>President Trump lashed out in response to the viral "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out," coined by a Financial Times columnist to mock his tariff policies. The meme suggests that Trump repeatedly delays or backs off from initial tariff demands, allowing investors to profit. Trump defended his decision to slash tariffs on China and push back deadlines for tariffs on European Union countries, calling the question about his policies "nasty". The legality of Trump's sweeping tariffs is currently in limbo after a court ruling, which has been appealed by the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Proposed changes to federal student loan repayment plans under the House Republicans' "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could extend repayment terms to 30 years, raising concerns about borrowers being in debt for an extended period. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz warns that such a long repayment term is akin to "indentured servitude". The bill would offer two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years or an income-driven repayment plan with loan forgiveness after 30 years. Critics argue that the extended repayment period could trap borrowers in long-term debt. (not investment advice)</p>

McAllen, Texas, is ranked as the top city overall, due to its stable housing prices and moderate median home prices.

          <p>President Trump has accused China of violating a recent trade agreement with the United States, potentially jeopardizing the accord and reigniting trade tensions. Trump did not specify the actions that constituted the violation. The accusation follows comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who expressed pessimism about U.S.-China trade talks. U.S. stocks fell slightly in early trading following the remarks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk are scheduled to appear together in the Oval Office as Musk concludes his tenure as a "special government employee." Musk, who led the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), announced his departure earlier this week. Musk's tenure has been marked by significant spending cuts and policy changes, though some actions have faced legal challenges. Musk has also publicly disagreed with Trump on his sweeping domestic policy package. </p>
