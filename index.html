        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As wildfires affect popular holiday destinations across Europe, including Greece and Turkey, travel experts are providing advice for concerned tourists. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems travel safe, those wishing to cancel non-refundable trips may not be covered by standard insurance unless official advice changes. Experts recommend travelers check with their airlines and hotels for potential bespoke solutions and consider purchasing additional insurance coverage for natural catastrophes. UK law mandates that airlines provide care for significant delays and accommodation for rescheduled flights, but compensation for wildfire-related disruptions is unlikely as they are considered "extraordinary circumstances."</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian's Skims brand has released a new facial shapewear mask, which sold out in under 24 hours but has drawn significant criticism. The product, marketed to provide a "sculpted" jawline, is part of a growing social media trend of extreme bedtime beauty routines. Medical professionals, however, state there is no scientific evidence to support the mask's long-term effectiveness, warning it could cause skin irritation at worst. Critics and body positivity advocates argue that such products fuel harmful beauty ideals and insecurities, particularly among younger consumers, by suggesting even natural features need to be altered.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid widespread dating fatigue, new apps are emerging that prioritize in-person meetings over prolonged online conversations. A reporter tested one such app, Breeze, which sets up a date at a partner venue with minimal pre-meeting chat, aiming for a more human and less algorithm-driven experience. While this specific date didn't lead to a romantic connection, the approach highlighted the potential benefits of reducing the often-draining "talking stage." This trend reflects a broader industry shift, as major platforms like Tinder and Hinge also introduce new features to address declining user engagement and the sense that online dating has become a chore.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has resulted in four deaths, including the bartender and three patrons. Law enforcement is actively searching for the 45-year-old suspect, identified as a former U.S. Army soldier who lived next door to the establishment. His niece stated that he has struggled with mental health issues for years and that the family had unsuccessfully sought help for him. The incident has left the small mountain town of 9,000 people on edge, with businesses locking down as the search continues in a nearby mountainous area.</p>

          <p>China's General Administration of Customs has tightened import rules for durians from Vietnam after detecting hazardous levels of cadmium and the organic compound alkaline yellow. The new regulations mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and require all shipments to include a "qualified" test report. Under the stricter protocol, Vietnamese durians will undergo "batch by batch" testing upon arrival, with any non-compliant fruit being returned or destroyed and the associated exporter suspended from shipping to China. This move follows a significant 45% year-on-year drop in the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam in the first half of 2025.</p>

The authors argue the accord is economically damaging, giving U.S. exporters preferential market access while key EU industries are sidelined and long-term tariffs remain. They contend the deal undermines the EU's international credibility by failing to resist U.S. coercion and criticizes von der Leyen's unauthorized promise of $600 billion in EU investment in America. The piece calls for EU governments and the European Parliament to reject the current terms and renegotiate a more balanced agreement.</p>

          <p>HBO has announced that "And Just Like That...," the reboot of "Sex and the City," will end after its upcoming third season. Showrunner Michael Patrick King stated that it became clear while writing the final episode that it was a natural place to conclude the story. The series, which followed the original characters in their 50s, has faced declining viewership and criticism for its attempts to diversify the cast and for apparent plot inconsistencies. Despite mixed reviews, many fans expressed sadness over the show's conclusion, with some wishing for its continuation rather than its end.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has scheduled a major case for its next term to determine if Louisiana's creation of a second majority-Black congressional district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court will examine whether the new map violates the 14th or 15th Amendments, a question that could significantly impact how states draw political lines to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The case stems from a yearslong legal battle over Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn after the 2020 Census.

          <p>Scientists have attributed the decadal pattern of summer precipitation in China, characterized by drought in the south and flooding in the north, to the influence of the solar magnetic cycle. A study published in the Journal of Climate identified a connection between long-term changes in solar activity and the positioning of the monsoon rain belt over the country. This research is considered crucial for climate predictions during flood seasons, as the location of this rain belt significantly determines the distribution of droughts and floods across China. The findings suggest that solar phenomena play a key role in regional climate patterns.</p>

This event highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry, as Trump simultaneously pressures companies for price cuts while engaging with their executives at high-profile political events.

Testimony also highlighted that FAA staff had previously raised concerns about the helicopter's flight path proximity to commercial routes, but no changes were made.

To avoid being stung, officials advise beachgoers to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish. If a sting occurs, the recommended treatment is to soak the affected area in hot water for up to 90 minutes to break down the venom and seek medical attention.</p>

          <p>A review of the Environmental Protection Agency's own analysis reveals that repealing Biden-era greenhouse gas emission standards would likely lead to increased gasoline prices and significant job losses. While the Trump administration promoted the rollback as a cost-saving measure, the cited U.S. Energy Information Administration data projects higher fuel costs due to increased demand for less efficient gas-powered cars. The analysis also estimated a loss of 450,000 jobs by 2035. A former EIA administrator confirmed that disincentivizing electric vehicles would logically result in higher gasoline consumption and, consequently, higher prices for all consumers.

Analysts note that while some companies initially absorbed the costs, this is unsustainable, and price hikes will likely become more apparent in the second half of the year.

This model stands in contrast to the national trend, where less than a third of those with Hepatitis C have been treated despite the availability of curative drugs for over a decade.

          <p>ESPN has reportedly reached an agreement to acquire several NFL media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular RedZone channel. In exchange, the NFL will receive an equity stake in ESPN that could be worth billions of dollars and may be as high as 10%. The deal, which is expected to be announced next week, would also grant ESPN access to more regular-season games and the league's fantasy football operations. This move comes as ESPN prepares to launch its direct-to-consumer streaming service and would significantly deepen the already close financial relationship between the sports media giant and the professional football league.

          <p>President Trump announced he has ordered the repositioning of two nuclear-capable submarines in response to what he called "highly provocative statements" from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia's security council, had posted on social media that Trump's ultimatums regarding the war in Ukraine were a "step towards war." In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated he moved the submarines "just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that." The move represents a rhetorical escalation, though some analysts note the U.S. already has submarines capable of striking Russia deployed.</p>

          <p>The constant, high-pitched whine of First-Person View (FPV) drones is inflicting a unique form of psychological trauma, dubbed "droneophobia," on Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. Soldiers returning from the front lines report acute stress disorders triggered by everyday sounds like lawnmowers and air conditioners, which mimic the noise of the drones that hunt them. This new form of warfare has extended the danger zone far from the front, with Russia now using FPVs to target civilians in cities like Kherson. The psychological toll is immense, transforming ordinary sounds into a source of constant fear and tension for a population under relentless threat.</p>

          <p>After five years of a diplomatic freeze following a deadly border clash, India and China are showing signs of thawing relations. New Delhi recently resumed issuing visas to Chinese citizens, and China has allowed Indian pilgrims back into Tibet, with direct flights expected to restart soon. Experts suggest that global trade wars and shifting geopolitical alliances are pushing the two Asian giants closer, though the unresolved Himalayan border dispute remains a significant obstacle. While a deep-seated trust deficit persists, these initial steps are fostering hope for renewed engagement and cooperation between the two nations on areas of common interest.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking charges related to Jeffrey Epstein, has been moved from a facility in Florida to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas. The reasons for the transfer are unclear, but it comes as Maxwell is appealing her conviction and has recently met with the U.S. Deputy Attorney General. The move has been condemned by victims' families, who called it "preferential treatment" and a failure of the justice system. The new facility houses inmates in dormitories with a lower staff-to-inmate ratio and is also home to disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes.</p>

The action was taken after he refused to enter his cell, citing concerns that a flooded common area posed a danger to his battery-powered prosthetics. This incident is the latest in a series of challenges for the double amputee, who has struggled to receive adequate medical care and properly fitted prosthetics while in custody.

          <p>The UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state has been met with mixed reactions from Palestinians, who see it as a significant diplomatic step but remain skeptical about its impact on the ground. While the Palestinian ambassador to the UK hailed it as a serious move toward a two-state solution, many in the West Bank feel it is "too little, too late." They point to Israel's continuous settlement expansion, which makes a viable Palestinian state increasingly impossible, and ongoing violence from settlers. Israeli officials, meanwhile, have rejected the plan, calling it a reward for terrorism and an unjust imposition on their sovereignty.</p>

The 26-year-old star, who is seeking a long-term contract extension, has been absent from on-field activities at training camp. In a lengthy post, Parsons expressed frustration with the team, citing a lack of contract negotiations with his agent, narratives being spread to the media, and feeling disrespected. The request comes after reports that the two sides are "far apart" on a new deal that would likely make him one of the highest-paid defensive players in the NFL.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector has provided a rare, detailed account of being sent abroad to work as a secret IT worker to generate funds for the regime. The man, using the pseudonym Jin-su, explained how he used hundreds of fake IDs to secure remote work with Western companies, earning thousands of dollars a month, 85% of which was sent back to North Korea. This scheme, which the UN estimates generates hundreds of millions annually, exploits the rise of remote work to bypass international sanctions. Jin-su's testimony reveals the daily operations and oppressive conditions faced by these workers, who are closely monitored and have little hope of escape.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to minors. The lawsuit argues the administration is attempting a de facto national ban by threatening criminal prosecution and demanding patient data, creating an atmosphere of fear. This pressure has led several prominent children's hospitals to close their gender clinics, even in states where the care is legal. The White House maintains it has the authority to stop treatments it describes as harmful, setting the stage for a major legal battle over transgender rights.</p>

The company has been ordered to pay as much as $243 million in damages, with the jury agreeing that the driver-assistance software should have alerted the driver and applied the brakes. Tesla, which maintained the driver was solely at fault for being distracted, has called the verdict "wrong" and plans to appeal. This case is the first of its kind involving Autopilot to go to a jury, setting a potential precedent for future litigation against the company.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that closes off a major avenue for millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance. The court did not uphold a previous finding that hidden commission payments to car dealers were inherently unlawful. However, the judgment left open the possibility for claims based on unfairly large commissions, shrinking the potential compensation bill for lenders from an estimated £30 billion to between £5 and £13 billion. While one claimant in the test case was awarded over £1,650, the ruling is a significant setback for the wider group of consumers who were hoping for redress.</p>
