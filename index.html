          <p>Japanese snowboarder Tomoka Takeuchi, a six-time Olympian, has announced she will retire at the end of the 2025-26 Olympic season. Takeuchi, who won a silver medal in parallel giant slalom at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, has already met the qualifying standards set by the Ski Association of Japan for the upcoming Milan-Cortina Olympics. The 41-year-old Hokkaido native made her Olympic debut in 2002 and took a break from competition after the 2018 Olympics before returning for the 2022 Beijing Olympics, where she finished 15th in the parallel giant slalom. Takeuchi expressed her determination to give her all in her final season and strive for victory.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal, criticizing the ruling as overstepping judicial authority in addressing a national emergency. The ruling was based on cases brought by small businesses and US state governments, with global markets responding positively, as stock markets in Asia rose and the US dollar gained ground.</p>

          <p>The UK government has outlined its plans to reform the pension industry, including the creation of Â£25 billion "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to stimulate economic growth and improve pension returns. Seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, although the government is also introducing legislative measures to ensure progress by the end of the decade. The reforms aim to consolidate local authority and defined contribution pension schemes, potentially leading to over Â£50 billion of additional investment in UK infrastructure, housing, and businesses. The government anticipates that these changes will lead to higher returns for pension savers through reduced waste, economies of scale, and enhanced investment strategies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand before the expected impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The company's global production also rose, increasing 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite the positive sales figures, Toyota anticipates a significant drop in net profit for the full business year due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen. Other Japanese automakers, such as Honda and Nissan, experienced mixed results, with Honda benefiting from solid U.S. demand but Nissan facing a decline in global sales due to restructuring efforts.</p>

          <p>The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) has scrapped its proposed "Grading for Equity" strategy following significant backlash from the community, including the mayor and lawmakers. The controversial plan, presented during a Board of Education meeting, aimed to alter grading standards by prioritizing final exams and de-emphasizing homework, weekly tests, and attendance. Critics argued the changes would lower standards and fail to adequately prepare students for success, betraying the American Dream of hard work and excellence. The SFUSD Superintendent stated that no changes to grading practices have been implemented and that the district remains committed to high standards and student success.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its focus on advanced manufacturing, potentially setting the stage for conflict with the U.S. as President Trump aims to boost domestic production of high-tech goods. President Xi Jinping has emphasized self-reliance in advanced manufacturing as crucial for China's economy, a strategy that has faced criticism for contributing to global trade imbalances. While China's manufacturing sector contributed significantly to its GDP, its push for self-reliance in high-tech sectors could contradict the Trump administration's demands for addressing trade imbalances and ending state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts anticipate that the U.S. will maintain high tariff rates on Chinese goods, with limited prospects for a major trade deal.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has denounced Nigel Farage's Reform policies as "fantasy" economics, drawing parallels between Farage and former PM Liz Truss, suggesting Reform's plans could lead to increased mortgage costs. Starmer accused Farage of pledging unfunded tax cuts that could trigger an economic crisis, similar to the turmoil caused by Truss's mini-budget in 2022. Reform's proposals include more generous tax breaks for married couples and scrapping the two-child benefit cap, but economists have questioned the feasibility of funding these measures. Reform defends its policies by proposing to scrap net-zero climate measures and cut public sector initiatives.</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly launched an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying competition with industry leaders like OpenAI. The company's initial R1 model gained prominence for outperforming rival offerings at a lower cost and with a shorter development time, raising concerns about potential overspending by U.S. tech giants. The upgraded model, released with minimal fanfare, is a reasoning model capable of executing complex tasks through logical thought processes. DeepSeek's advancements highlight the ongoing development of Chinese AI despite U.S. efforts to restrict access to key technologies.</p>

          <p>A federal court in New York has blocked President Donald Trump's plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country, ruling that he overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The court's decision overturns decades of U.S. trade policy, disrupts global commerce, and raises the risk of higher prices and recession. The ruling leaves in place other Trump tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminum, and autos, but those levies were invoked under a different law. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official, says the court's decision "throws the presidentâ€™s trade policy into turmoil."</p>

          <p>A Chinese scholar suggests that Beijing should be prepared for Washington to adopt alternative pressure tactics in future trade negotiations, as the Trump administration has recognized the limitations of imposing heavy tariffs. Wu Xinbo of Fudan University notes that while Trump may continue using tariffs, he is likely to show more restraint after observing their mixed results. He warns that the U.S. might explore measures related to science, diplomacy, and security as alternative negotiating strategies. This shift in approach could stem from the realization that tariffs have limited impact on China but carry significant side effects for the U.S.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has criticized Israel's military conduct in Gaza, describing it as "beyond comprehension," prompting a measured response from Israeli officials. Experts suggest the slow reaction from the Israeli government indicates that Merz's remarks have resonated deeply. Simon Wolfgang Fuchs from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem notes the lack of formal government response, suggesting that Merz's criticism, though vague in terms of consequences, has "stung the political elite." Peter Lintl of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs believes Israel heard Merz's remarks clearly, especially given the EU's review of its trade ties with Israel.</p>

This marks a significant shift in Portugal's political landscape, where center-right and center-left parties have traditionally alternated in leading the government or opposition. Chega's rise coincides with gains by far-right parties in other European countries, such as France's National Rally and the Brothers of Italy. The party secured 60 of the National Assembly's 230 seats, campaigning on a hardline stance against immigration under the slogan "Save Portugal."</p>

          <p>A gas cylinder discovered at a construction site in eastern Tokyo, the location of explosions that injured 10 people and damaged numerous nearby buildings, had an expiration date of November 1964. The explosions occurred during piling work for a new house in Edogawa Ward, a site that had been a parking space for approximately 40 years. Authorities suspect that workers accidentally drilled into the cylinder, causing the acetylene gas used for welding to ignite. The recovered cylinder had a hole measuring about 6 centimeters in diameter and was heavily covered in rust.</p>

          <p>A federal court ruling has undermined President Trump's core economic policy by finding his sweeping tariffs unlawful, leading to potential upheaval in global trade. The court determined that the president lacked the authority to impose tariffs without congressional approval, invalidating his executive orders. This decision challenges Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tactic and revenue generator, as well as his broader strategy of declaring "emergencies" to bypass constitutional barriers. The administration is appealing the ruling, but if it stands, it could significantly alter Trump's economic agenda.</p>
