          <h2>DNI Gabbard's Release of 2016 Election Files Sparks Political Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 19:23:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has released declassified documents related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, reigniting fierce political debate. Gabbard alleged the files show evidence of a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era officials to undermine Donald Trump, a claim amplified by the White House. Democrats have strongly refuted this, accusing Gabbard of dangerously misrepresenting intelligence and eroding trust in the agencies she leads. The controversy centers on the interpretation of Russia's intent and capabilities during the election cycle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has released a vast collection of previously sealed government records related to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The files include extensive FBI surveillance documents, which had been blocked from public view since 1977. King's family expressed mixed reactions, with some condemning the release as a potential misuse of documents intended to undermine his legacy, while others praised it as a step toward transparency and truth. The release fulfills a campaign promise to declassify files related to major assassinations.</p>

          <p>At the urging of the Trump administration, the Texas Legislature has convened a special session to redraw the state's congressional district map. The goal of the Republican-led effort is to create a map more favorable to the GOP, potentially picking up several seats and helping the party maintain its narrow majority in the U.S. House in the upcoming midterm elections. Opponents have decried the mid-decade redistricting as a partisan power grab that aims to let politicians choose their voters, rather than the other way around.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who was detained by ICE while live-streaming a report on immigration protests, says he has been "emotionally destroyed" by the experience. Guevara believes his arrest is a direct retaliation for his work covering ICE raids and that the government is trying to send a message to discourage such reporting. His case has drawn attention to the administration's aggressive immigration tactics and raised concerns about press freedom, particularly for journalists covering sensitive community issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), President Trump's recently signed tax bill is projected to add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, with the resulting loss in revenue far outweighing savings from proposed cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps. Critics argue the bill will not produce significant economic benefits and will worsen the country's long-term financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>
