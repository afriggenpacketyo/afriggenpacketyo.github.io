        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for Webtoon Entertainment saw a significant jump after the company announced a major partnership with Disney to create a new digital comics platform. The deal will consolidate over 35,000 comics from Disney's Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and 20th Century Studios brands onto a single subscription service. As part of the agreement, Disney will also acquire a 2% equity stake in Webtoon. While some analysts see this as a validation of Webtoon's platform and a way to diversify revenue, others remain skeptical about the immediate earnings impact due to the necessary investment in building the new infrastructure.</p>

          <p>In response to growing concerns over political violence, highlighted by the recent murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, House Republicans are proposing an additional $30 million for security funding. The measure, part of a stopgap government funding bill, aims to reimburse local law enforcement for protecting lawmakers in their home districts. Lawmakers from both parties have expressed fear and are adjusting their public activities, with some canceling events and others increasing personal security measures. The U.S. Capitol Police report a significant rise in threat assessment cases, underscoring the tense political climate facing public officials.</p>

Sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations report that significant progress has been made, with most major obstacles already resolved between the two nations. Both sides are now focused on finalizing the remaining details of the agreements. The successful conclusion of these deals is seen as a critical prerequisite for the diplomatic visit to proceed, signaling a potential thaw in trade relations.</p>

The announcement coincides with President Trump's state visit to the U.K., where he and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to sign a new technology deal. Microsoft President Brad Smith noted an improved business and regulatory climate in the U.K. as a key factor enabling this significant investment in AI infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is advancing legal arguments in three separate Supreme Court cases that could significantly expand his control over the U.S. economy. The cases concern the president's authority to impose tariffs, the power to impound funds appropriated by Congress, and the ability to fire governors of the Federal Reserve.

          <p>President Trump has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, pushing the date to December 16th to avoid a national ban. The extension follows reports of a "framework deal" in which an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz would acquire a majority stake in the app's U.S. business. This marks the fourth such delay, providing more time for the complex negotiations between U.S. investors and the Chinese parent company to be finalized. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the commercial terms have been largely settled for months but were delayed by broader U.S.-China trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A new retrospective study analyzing medical records from over 4 million people found that cannabis users are nearly four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to non-users. Researchers from Boston Medical Center observed that 2.2% of cannabis users developed the condition over a five-year period, versus just 0.6% of the control group. Experts speculate this link may be due to marijuana's effects on appetite, metabolism, and insulin resistance, often leading to poor dietary habits. The study's authors acknowledge limitations, such as reliance on self-reported data, but suggest the findings highlight a need for greater health risk awareness as cannabis becomes more widely legalized.</p>

Officials cite public health risks from untested products, untaxed sales that undermine the legal market, and links to broader criminal activities as justification for the enforcement.

          <p>The South American trade bloc Mercosur, consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, has signed a free trade agreement with four non-EU European countries: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. The deal, signed in Rio de Janeiro, aims to deepen economic ties and is presented as a commitment to rules-based international trade amid rising global protectionism. This agreement comes as Brazil seeks to diversify its trading partners, particularly after the U.S. imposed significant tariffs. The Mercosur bloc is also working towards ratifying a much larger and long-negotiated trade deal with the European Union.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Secretary Says Trump's Threat to Shut Down TikTok Spurred China Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 15:08:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's willingness to let TikTok "go dark" in the U.S. was the critical factor that prompted China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent stated that while the commercial terms of a sale had been essentially finalized for months, China had stalled negotiations following the imposition of U.S. tariffs. The president's firm stance on national security reportedly broke the stalemate, leading to renewed discussions. An executive order has now extended the divestiture deadline to December 16, allowing time for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have advocated for ending mental health screenings in schools, arguing they medicalize normal childhood behavior and create stigma. In a recent op-ed, they proposed that schools should instead focus on "natural sources of mental well-being" like family and nutrition. Mental health experts have pushed back, stating that universal screenings are crucial for early detection of symptoms, reducing stigma by normalizing conversations, and connecting vulnerable students to care. They clarify that these tools are for screening, not diagnosis, and are essential for addressing the youth mental health crisis.</p>

          <p>Speaking at an anti-hate summit, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro recounted the arson attack on his home and called on leaders to condemn all forms of political violence without partisan bias. He detailed the emotional scars left on his family after a man set fire to his residence on Passover, and criticized those who selectively condemn violence to suit a political narrative. Shapiro argued that such cherry-picking only deepens division and can be interpreted as a "permission slip" for more attacks. He asserted that leaders have a responsibility to be unequivocal in their opposition to violence, regardless of the perpetrator's motivation.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of middle- and high-income consumers are shopping at discount stores like Aldi, Dollar General, and Walmart, a trend that has accelerated since 2021. According to data from GlobalData Retail, nearly 28% of high-income households now frequent these chains, up from 20% four years ago. Analysts attribute this shift primarily to persistent inflation, which has eroded the savings of even wealthier households and increased the cost of essentials. In response, discount retailers are actively courting these new customers by remodeling stores, improving the shopping experience, and expanding their selection of premium and name-brand products.</p>

Roach also explores futuristic technologies like 3D printing of human tissue, profiling labs working to create functional muscle and even a tiny heart ventricle.

          <p>President Donald Trump commented on the death of actor Robert Redford, calling him "great" and acknowledging a period in his career where "there was nobody better." The remarks came as Trump was departing for a state visit to the U.K. and did not address Redford's past and pointed political criticism of him. Redford, a vocal Democrat, had previously described Trump's presidency as a "dictator-like attack" on the country and endorsed his political opponents. The actor and filmmaker, known for his iconic roles and founding the Sundance Film Festival, passed away at his home in Utah at the age of 89.</p>

          <p>After more than a decade of steady increases, the national average FICO credit score in the U.S. has dropped for the second year in a row, now sitting at 715. The decline is driven by mounting financial stress on American households, with high interest rates and inflation pushing consumers deeper into debt. Delinquency rates for credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans have reached levels not seen since the 2009 financial crisis. Gen Z borrowers have been hit particularly hard, with a significant percentage experiencing substantial score drops, potentially hindering their long-term financial stability.

However, critics argue her initial comments dangerously blur the line between protected and unlawful speech, especially as the Trump administration signals a crackdown on certain political groups in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination.

This article suggests that prospective buyers should consider locking in a current rate if it is affordable, as there is no guarantee that rates will continue to fall. It also emphasizes the importance of shopping around with multiple lenders, as their responses to market changes will vary. Finally, buyers are encouraged to explore all financing options, such as adjustable-rate mortgages or purchasing mortgage points, to potentially secure a lower interest rate than widely advertised averages.
