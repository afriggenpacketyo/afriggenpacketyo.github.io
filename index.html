          <p>South Korea's former President Yoon Suk-yeol has been arrested and returned to a detention center on charges of insurrection related to his declaration of martial law last December. The Seoul Central District Court approved a new warrant over concerns he might destroy evidence, following his initial release on procedural grounds. Yoon, who was impeached in April, is accused of sending armed soldiers to parliament to block his impeachment, a charge that could result in a life sentence.</p>

          <p>Detectives in Wales are investigating new historical sexual abuse allegations against a former Church in Wales bishop, who is already imprisoned for other child sexual abuse offenses. The BBC investigation reveals that concerns about the bishop were first reported to church officials in 1986 but were allegedly ignored, allowing him to rise through the ranks. Victims are now calling for a full independent inquiry into what they describe as a systemic culture of concealment within the Church.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California in 2024 is still nearly a year lower than it was in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. While the virus was the initial cause of the sharp decline, the lingering gap is now primarily driven by deaths from drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The research also highlights persistent disparities, with Black and Hispanic populations, as well as low-income residents, experiencing the slowest and most incomplete recovery.</p>

In a letter, Trump called the trial a "witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!" and demanded it be stopped.
