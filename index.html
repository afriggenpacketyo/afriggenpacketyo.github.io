            <p>Amid Easter celebrations, Nigerian Christians face heightened fears due to ongoing violence perpetrated by Islamist militants, with reports indicating a surge in attacks resulting in numerous deaths and displacement. Groups like International Christian Concern (ICC) and Open Doors UK highlight the severity of the persecution, characterizing it as a potential genocide aimed at erasing Christians from their homeland. Bishop Ayuba Matawal links the violence to an ideology of land seizure from Christian communities, while the ICC urges the U.S. State Department to designate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern, advocating for sanctions and aid cuts until attacks decrease. The U.S. State Department expresses concern and urges the Nigerian government to protect all citizens. (no investment advice)</p>

            <p>A report warns that the U.S. risks losing its technological edge to China due to complacency and insufficient engagement with developing nations in the Global South. Developing countries are expected to play a crucial role in shaping advanced technology in the coming decades, potentially strengthening their ties with China. The report urges the U.S. to actively consolidate its presence in the Global South to counter China's growing influence in setting global technological norms and standards, as failure to do so could undermine U.S. geopolitical, economic, and technological interests. Tariffs imposed could further alienate developing countries.</p>

            <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of tuning out political news for mental health while feeling guilty about civic duty. It frames attention as an ethical resource, emphasizing the importance of moral attention and reclaiming attentional sovereignty in an era of information overload. The author suggests a strategic approach to news consumption, balancing engagement with personal well-being and investing attention in activities that train moral awareness, such as literature or meditation. It also distinguishes between empathy and compassion, advocating for compassion as a means to stay present with suffering without experiencing burnout, and recommends techniques like Tonglen meditation to cultivate compassion while reading the news.</p>

A 10-year-old girl, a house painter, and a teenager are among those struggling to access their life-saving HIV medications after U.S.-funded clinics closed down, causing chaos and confusion. These individuals report that they are falling ill without their medication. These closures have left many without access to both medication and basic food, as the clinics also provided meals, because the medication cannot be taken on an empty stomach.</p>

            <p>The U.S.'s trade war with China, marked by escalating tariffs, risks strengthening China's geopolitical position and weakening the U.S. economy. China's dominance in key industries, such as batteries and rare earth minerals, gives it an advantage, while the U.S. struggles to quickly replace Chinese imports. China has been preparing for this conflict by investing in domestic industries and seeking new export markets, while the U.S. has alienated allies and failed to invest in its own industry. While the U.S. could win with a coalition of allies, the current administration's approach makes that unlikely, potentially leading to economic pain and emboldening China on the global stage.

            <p>Luigi Mangione, indicted for the murder of a UnitedHealthcare CEO, has sparked controversy, with his online activity, particularly his review of the Unabomber Manifesto, drawing scrutiny. Sean Fleming, a researcher, notes parallels between Mangione and Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, including their disaffection and backgrounds in STEM fields. The Unabomber's manifesto, which critiques modern technology and society, has seen a resurgence in popularity, appealing to both the left and right due to its complex and uncategorizable ideology. The article explores the manifesto's key arguments, Kaczynski's lack of remorse, and the ongoing debate surrounding its ideas.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, cautioned against repeating the protectionist tariff policies of the Great Depression era amid escalating trade tensions. Drawing on ancient Chinese philosophy, Xie urged for addressing the root causes of economic issues and focusing on global economic growth rather than protectionist measures. He specifically cited the Smoot-Hawley Act as a cautionary example of how high tariffs can lead to a dramatic decline in global trade and prolong economic downturns, emphasizing the importance of learning from past mistakes.</p>

Despite this, 20-25% of people seeking abortions are still blocked by state bans. The Trump administration's dismantling of the CDC team responsible for abortion surveillance reports has raised concerns among researchers about the ability to track public health outcomes and assess the impact of policies. This move contrasts with Project 2025's recommendation to expand abortion surveillance.</p>

            <p>Hotplate is a software-as-a-service platform that enables professional chefs and home cooks to create and manage pickup food "events." It automates scheduling, order flow, and pickup logistics in exchange for a percentage of the seller's sales. Hotplate revolves around what it calls food “events,” which are scheduled food drops. One advantage to selling food via events is that it creates a sense of scarcity. This software is particularly nice because there’s no cost until you make a sale.</p>
