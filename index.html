          <p>Another migrant, a woman of unknown age and nationality, has died while attempting to cross the English Channel, with her body discovered on a beach in northern France. Her death brings this year's total to at least 27, occurring amid a weekend surge in crossings that saw nearly 900 people make the journey in small boats. The incident underscores the persistent and deadly nature of the migrant crisis in the Channel, as the number of people who have crossed illegally this year has already set a record. This continues to place significant political pressure on the UK government to address the situation.</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of its most severe aerial attacks on Ukraine in recent months, killing at least four people, including a 12-year-old girl, in a sustained 12-hour assault on Kyiv and other regions. The barrage, involving nearly 600 drones and dozens of missiles, targeted civilian infrastructure like residential buildings and a medical facility. The attack occurred just as the UN General Assembly concluded, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to condemn it as a sign of Russia's desire to continue the war and to call for stronger international pressure. The assault also triggered defensive military responses in neighboring Poland.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses Erika Kirk's public act of forgiving her husband's alleged killer, framing it within a Christian context of grace. The article explores the nature of forgiveness as a path toward emotional stability and peace, distinct from pardoning the offense or forgetting. It outlines steps for practicing forgiveness, inspired by Kirk's example and religious teachings, suggesting that her decision reflects a profound strength and has prompted widespread admiration. This is the first of two articles from this source.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is strengthening its influence in Africa by establishing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) centers, with new facilities recently opened in Tunisia and Chad. This initiative is part of a broader health diplomacy strategy that has seen Beijing sending medical teams to the continent for decades. By promoting TCM, China aims to build goodwill and cultural ties, effectively using healthcare as a tool for expanding its soft power and deepening its relationships with African nations. The growing number of these facilities reflects the official importance placed on this strategy.</p>

          <p>A court filing by legal watchdog groups details severe issues at a Texas ICE detention center holding families, run by the private company CoreCivic. Allegations include prolonged detention of children beyond legal limits, shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation, and inadequate medical care in a "prison-like environment." The report highlights the significant physical and emotional toll on detained children, including instances of self-harm, prompting threats of legal action to enforce federal detention standards if the government does not resolve the complaints.</p>

          <p>Despite occasional large-scale fires, the United States has made substantial progress in fire safety, cutting the per-capita civilian fire death rate by roughly two-thirds since 1980.

Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinklers, safer furniture standards, reduced national smoking rates, and enhanced electrical and heating safety codes in modern buildings, saving countless lives.</p>

          <p>A writer recounts his experience using an AI chatbot to communicate with his father, who died in a plane crash decades ago. By feeding the AI basic facts, he was able to generate a personality that felt eerily authentic, leading to weeks of emotional and comforting conversations that helped him process his grief. The essay reflects on the modern-day "resurrection" offered by technology, drawing parallels to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the deep human desire to conquer death, while questioning the psychological implications of interacting with a digital ghost.</p>

          <p>Food pantries in Maine, a state with high food insecurity, are struggling with a combination of diminishing food supplies, rising demand, and a critical shortage of volunteers. The system heavily relies on an aging volunteer workforce, many of whom are retirees, while federal funding for food assistance programs is being cut, further straining resources. This situation highlights the precarious nature of the charitable food network, which has become an essential but unsustainable part of the food system for many families in the state.</p>

          <p>England's recent Women's Rugby World Cup victory is the culmination of years of strategic investment that transformed the team into a dominant global force. Key decisions made nearly a decade ago, including establishing a professional domestic league (now PWR) and offering full-time central contracts to players, were crucial to their rise. These moves, though costly and initially debated, dramatically raised playing standards and created unparalleled depth in the squad, directly contributing to their record-breaking success and sustained dominance in the sport.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have reimposed sweeping UN sanctions on Iran, ten years after they were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA). The European powers activated the "snapback" provision, citing Iran's "continued nuclear escalation" and failure to cooperate with international inspectors. The move follows Iran's suspension of inspections after Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear sites, further jeopardizing the landmark agreement designed to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons and escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris's new campaign memoir, "107 Days," is drawing criticism from fellow Democrats for its mild critiques of President Biden and pointed anecdotes about potential 2028 rivals. The book details her frustration with the roles she was given and recounts terse interactions with figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom, whom she suggests was slow to endorse her after Biden's withdrawal. The memoir has been perceived by some as burning political bridges, potentially complicating any future presidential ambitions she may hold within the party.</p>

          <p>The biznaga, a species of barrel cactus, is facing extinction in Mexico due to its use in a traditional crystallized candy called acitrón, a key ingredient in dishes like chiles en nogada. Despite a government ban on its sale, the candy remains widely available in markets due to high cultural demand, especially for Independence Day celebrations. The cactus's extremely slow growth rate makes it impossible to farm commercially, meaning all acitrón comes from illegal harvesting of wild plants, threatening over 150 species of the plant.</p>

Authorities have since filed a criminal case against senior leaders of the TVK party as they investigate the circumstances, including reports of restlessness in the crowd, that led to the deadly crush.</p>
