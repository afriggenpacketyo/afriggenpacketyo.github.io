The decision follows retaliatory tariff increases from China and has resulted in significant market fluctuations, with stock indices experiencing a substantial rally after the announcement.

            <p>In a victory for President Trump, an appeals court has vacated a lower court ruling that ordered 20 federal agencies to reinstate employees they had fired. The decision allows the Trump administration to re-fire probationary employees, typically those in their first or second year or recently promoted. The court said the administration was likely to succeed in showing that the lower court lacked jurisdiction, without ruling on the lawfulness of the firings. This ruling follows a similar Supreme Court decision, representing a setback for efforts to block the summary firings of over 24,000 federal workers.</p>

GOP leaders inserted language into the budget blueprint that would prohibit the House from forcing a vote on legislation to rescind Trump's national emergencies authority until at least September. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the move, stating that the president has executive authority to deal with unfair trade practices. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>According to Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist, President Trump's tariffs represent the most significant trade policy shock in history. Trump has ordered a minimum 10% tax on nearly everything the U.S. buys from other countries, with higher levies on China, Japan, and the European Union. Minton Beddoes suggests the tariffs could be a tool to renegotiate trade agreements or a means to re-industrialize America. However, the tariffs also create uncertainty and pain for consumers, who ultimately bear the cost, and could lead to retaliatory measures from other countries.</p>
