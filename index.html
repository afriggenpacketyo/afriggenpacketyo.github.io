        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated boxing match between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford, experts are divided on the likely outcome, presenting compelling cases for both fighters. Crawford's supporters point to his technical brilliance, adaptability, and potential to expose a perceived decline in Álvarez, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, those backing Álvarez emphasize his significant size and power advantage at super-middleweight, his ring intelligence, and Crawford's less convincing performance in his last fight at a lower weight. The article thoroughly analyzes each fighter's strengths and weaknesses, making it clear why the matchup is considered one of the most intriguing in modern boxing.</p>

          <p>Officials in the UK Prime Minister's office and the Foreign Office were reportedly aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly defended the ambassador. Sources indicate Starmer himself was not briefed on the emails' contents at the time of his defense during Prime Minister's Questions. The revelation has led to internal criticism from Labour MPs over the government's handling of the situation and the vetting process for Mandelson's appointment. Lord Mandelson was subsequently dismissed from his post as ambassador to the US after the emails, which showed a deeper relationship than previously known, were published.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the collapse of the previous government, Nepal has sworn in its first female interim prime minister, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The youth-led "GenZ" demonstrations, fueled by economic frustrations and a social media ban, successfully pushed for new leadership. In a move to restore stability, the president dissolved parliament and scheduled new elections for March 5, as recommended by the new prime minister. With Karki's appointment, a sense of calm has returned to the capital, Kathmandu, as curfews are eased and troop presence is reduced.</p>

The initiative, starting with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to 20 eligible new mothers. To qualify, applicants must be under 40, hold a doctoral degree, and have given birth within the last two years. While the program's initial scope is limited, it is viewed by some female researchers as a positive step toward addressing career challenges faced by women in science.</p>

The woman, Faye Hall, was arrested alongside the couple in February and held for two months before her release. She described how the couple's health has severely deteriorated in a maximum-security prison, with Peter, 80, requiring daily medication for heart and cancer treatment, and Barbie, 76, suffering from significant weight loss. The couple, who ran a charity in Afghanistan, still do not know why they are being held after four court appearances.</p>

          <h2>California Passes Bill to Ban Most Law Enforcement Officers from Wearing Face Coverings</h2>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill that would prohibit most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks or other facial coverings that obscure their identity while on duty. The measure, which now heads to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk, was proposed in response to recent immigration raids where some federal agents concealed their faces. Proponents argue the ban is necessary for public trust and accountability, especially after a recent Supreme Court ruling allowing agents to target migrants based on race or language. Law enforcement agencies and Republican lawmakers oppose the bill, citing concerns for officer safety.</p>

          <p>NATO is reinforcing its eastern flank with additional troops and fighter jets after more than a dozen Russian drones violated Polish airspace, escalating regional tensions. Denmark, France, and Germany are among the first to contribute to the new mission, with other allies expected to join, in a direct response to what Poland has called a deliberate and unprecedented incursion. The incident, which saw some drones shot down while others crashed, has been described by Poland's Prime Minister as the closest the region has been to open conflict since World War II. Moscow has downplayed the event, claiming it had no intention of targeting Polish facilities.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the potential reasons behind soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo's sudden interest in returning to play in the United States after a 12-year absence. The author speculates that the shift could be linked to the current political climate under President Donald Trump, suggesting it may create a more favorable environment for Ronaldo, whose absence coincided with sexual assault allegations made against him in 2017. The piece posits that a US appearance, possibly in a friendly match, could serve as a strategic move to clear the way for his participation in the upcoming World Cup. This would allow Ronaldo to re-engage with the massive American market and enhance his global brand.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Rebecca Solnit argues that the recently released 2003 Jeffrey Epstein birthday album is a relic of a culture that normalized the sexual exploitation of underage girls. The author recounts numerous examples from 1970s and 80s films, music, and media where relationships between adult men and teenage girls were commonplace and often romanticized, from Woody Allen's "Manhattan" to the culture of "baby groupies" in rock music. Solnit contends that the rise of feminism was crucial in shifting societal norms by establishing the principles of consent, recognizing power imbalances, and exposing the ubiquity of abuse. This movement, she asserts, denormalized the predatory behavior that was once widely accepted.</p>

The attack has thrown ceasefire negotiations into disarray, potentially endangering the remaining hostages in Gaza.

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is anticipating significant success in local elections in Gelsenkirchen, a traditional stronghold of the center-left Social Democrats in western Germany. The party has capitalized on local frustrations over issues like dilapidated housing and crime, which they link to labor migration. Following a strong showing in the last federal elections, the AfD's mayoral candidate has a chance of reaching a runoff, which would be a first for the party in the region. Local social workers and anti-fascist activists express fear that AfD gains could lead to funding cuts for integration projects and social services.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-immigration protests across Australia have left some Chinese nationals feeling insecure and unwelcome in the country. A 27-year-old Chinese woman living in Perth described canceling her plans to leave her home during the marches due to safety concerns. She expressed that such events exacerbate feelings of not fitting in and being in an unfamiliar environment. This sentiment highlights the personal impact of rising anti-immigration rhetoric on individuals who have moved to Australia for work or to seek permanent residency, contributing to a sense of vulnerability within the community.</p>

          <p>The United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt have issued a joint call for an immediate three-month humanitarian truce in Sudan, to be followed by a permanent ceasefire. The plan proposed by the four nations, known as the "Quad," also outlines a nine-month transitional process to establish a civilian-led government. The conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which began in 2023, has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The statement emphasized that there is no military solution and that Sudan's future governance must be decided by the Sudanese people.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive timeline details the Karen Read case, from the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in January 2022 to her recent retrial. After her first trial ended in a hung jury, Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges but convicted of driving under the influence. The defense argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, while the prosecution maintained she struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die. The case drew intense media attention and involved numerous pretrial motions, a federal investigation, and the firing of the lead state police investigator.</p>
