          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla 33% liable for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system, which resulted in one death and serious injuries. The verdict requires the automaker to pay a portion of the total $329 million in compensatory and punitive damages awarded to the victims' families. Tesla has stated its intention to appeal the decision, arguing the driver was solely at fault for overriding the system while distracted. The outcome could influence numerous other pending lawsuits related to Tesla's automated driving technology.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an order blocking the Trump administration from using an expedited removal process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. This ruling could curtail the controversial practice of ICE agents arresting individuals at courthouses immediately after their immigration hearings for rapid deportation. The decision, which the Justice Department is expected to appeal, was praised by advocates as a protection for those following legal procedures. The judge noted the case raised a "question of fair play" for migrants who had complied with rules.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has announced it is reversing a 2022 policy that allowed the agency to provide abortion services. The VA stated the reversal aligns with federal law and historical precedent, which did not authorize such services within the standard medical benefits package. This change restores restrictions that were in place before the Biden administration's adjustment following the Dobbs Supreme Court decision. The department emphasized that care for pregnant women in life-threatening situations will not be affected by this policy shift.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been moved from a low-security facility in Florida to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Texas. The new facility, which also houses Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, has a lower staff-to-inmate ratio and houses non-violent offenders. The transfer has drawn sharp criticism from Epstein's victims, who called it "preferential treatment" and a failure of the justice system. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed the move but did not provide a reason, though an official cited potential safety concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he has ordered two U.S. nuclear submarines to be positioned in "appropriate regions" following what he described as "highly provocative statements" from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.

Trump stated that words can have unintended consequences and he hopes this situation does not escalate further. The White House did not comment on the specific locations of the submarines, citing military protocol.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer hours after the agency released a weaker-than-expected jobs report. In a social media post, Trump accused the commissioner, a Biden appointee, of faking numbers to harm his administration politically. The report showed only 73,000 new jobs in July and included significant downward revisions for the previous two months, sparking a sharp drop in financial markets. The move to terminate a high-ranking civil servant over unfavorable economic data has raised concerns about the politicization of federal statistical agencies.</p>

          <p>The forecast for gold prices in August suggests a period of potential stagnation rather than the significant increases seen over the past year. Key factors influencing this outlook include the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady, which removes a major catalyst for price movement. Additionally, uncertainty around upcoming inflation data and evolving demand for portfolio diversification contribute to the mixed signals for the precious metal's short-term performance. Experts suggest that while gold remains a long-term asset for hedging, its price may not see dramatic shifts this month. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies in Thailand and the EU managed to secure lower rates than initially threatened, while Brazil faces a steep 50% levy on many goods.

This behavior, which researchers have termed "divorce," involves the birds finding new mates for subsequent nesting periods.

It highlights that monogamous pairings in some species are not always for life, with various factors potentially influencing their decisions to seek new partners.</p>

          <h2>Germany Debates Raising Retirement Age to Address Pension System Strain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate has been reignited in Germany over the possibility of raising the national retirement age beyond the currently planned 67. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche argued that Germans need to "work more and longer" to ensure the long-term sustainability of the pension system, which is strained by an aging population. This proposal was met with immediate backlash from political opponents and trade unions, who argue it unfairly penalizes workers in physically demanding jobs. The discussion highlights the significant demographic and fiscal challenges facing Germany's social welfare system.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized set of exercises for schoolchildren that was phased out in 2013. The test, which included exercises like the one-mile run and push-ups, was a fixture in American physical education for over 50 years. The administration argues its return is necessary to combat declining physical fitness and rising obesity rates among youth. While some educators welcome the focus on physical activity, the test has a controversial history, with critics citing its potential negative impact on students' mental health and its one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

The move follows a campaign by the administration to defund public media, which it has labeled as biased.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed repealing its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health, a move that would roll back federal vehicle emissions standards. The proposal specifically targets California's long-standing authority to set its own, stricter tailpipe rules, which has been critical for the state's air quality and its plan to ban new gas cars by 2035. The EPA's own analysis suggests that without California's leadership and existing federal tax credits, national EV adoption would decline and gasoline prices would rise.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent tariff actions suggests a more coherent strategy than his earlier, more chaotic moves. The administration appears to be using the threat of steep tariffs as leverage to force bilateral trade concessions from dozens of countries, rewarding those who comply with lower rates and punishing those who do not. While this shakedown approach has yielded some short-term agreements, it remains fraught with legal and economic uncertainty. The policy faces significant challenges in appellate courts and coincides with a weakening U.S. jobs report, heightening concerns that the strategy could ultimately backfire and harm the economy.</p>
