          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 storm in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 season. While it is not expected to make landfall, the National Hurricane Center warns it will generate dangerous swells, causing life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast, Bermuda, and Canada. The storm's development comes after the climatological peak of the hurricane season, which has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA. Gabrielle's path is currently tracking northeastward, further out into the open ocean.</p>

          <p>A landmark $100 billion investment by Nvidia into OpenAI has ignited a significant rally across the global semiconductor market. The deal, which involves OpenAI deploying massive data centers using Nvidia's GPUs, boosted shares for key suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's SK Hynix. Positive sentiment extended to European chipmakers, although equipment firms like ASM International saw mixed results due to separate revenue warnings. The market reaction highlights the immense influence of AI-related investments on the entire technology supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Hurricane Gabrielle moves through the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center is monitoring two additional tropical disturbances for potential development. One system, located between the Lesser Antilles and the Cabo Verde Islands, has an 80% chance of forming into a tropical depression by late week. A second, less organized system further west also shows potential for slow development.

          <p>Following President Trump's decision to raise the H-1B visa fee to $100,000, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have expressed support for the policy change. In an interview, both executives emphasized the importance of attracting the world's brightest minds to the U.S. and viewed the new financial structure as a way to streamline the process for highly skilled immigrants. The new fee represents a major shift for the technology and finance sectors, which heavily rely on the H-1B program to fill specialized roles, particularly with talent from India and China.</p>

The U.S. growth forecast was also lifted to 1.8% for 2025, supported by strong AI-related investment. However, the report warns of significant risks ahead, including high policy uncertainty and the impact of increased U.S. tariffs, which have reached their highest effective rate since 1933. The OECD also noted that while inflation is slowing, further tariff hikes could reintroduce price pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that media coverage of the memorial service for assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk should focus on its profound religious nature rather than framing it solely as a political event. The author highlights the service's scale, with over 100,000 attendees, and its explicit Christian themes of witness, forgiveness, and testimony from high-profile figures like President Trump. The piece contends that many newsrooms lack the fluency to properly report on evangelical Christianity and risk missing the story's true impact by forcing it into a purely political or cultural narrative.</p>

          <p>Germany's trade deficit with China has dramatically increased, jumping 142.8% to US$17.4 billion in the first eight months of 2025, according to Chinese customs data. This sharp rise is raising concerns in Berlin, as it signals a shift in the economic relationship between the two manufacturing powerhouses. Notably, Germany's iconic car exports to China have been overtaken in value by shipments of unwrought gold and medicines. The data suggests that China is becoming a less lucrative market for German carmakers, a cornerstone of the country's economy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that U.S. doctors will soon be advised against prescribing Tylenol to pregnant women, citing a disputed link between the pain reliever and autism. Medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have strongly refuted the claim, stating it is not supported by the full body of scientific evidence. The FDA issued a more cautious notice, advising doctors to consider limiting the use of acetaminophen while acknowledging it remains the safest option for treating fever and pain in pregnant women. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, also firmly disagreed with the president's assertion.</p>

          <p>This article provides a scientific perspective on the causes of autism, directly addressing President Trump's recent claims linking the condition to Tylenol. Medical experts emphasize that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with strong polygenetic links, meaning hundreds or thousands of gene variants contribute to risk, rather than a single medication. While diagnoses have risen, this is largely attributed to better awareness and broader diagnostic criteria, not a single external factor. The scientific consensus remains that extensive studies have shown no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism.</p>

          <p>Voters in Guinea have overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, with provisional results showing over 90% in favor. The referendum was put forward by General Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup. While the new constitution paves the way for future elections, it is controversial because it extends presidential terms and allows military members to seek office, potentially enabling Doumbouya to run. The vote was boycotted by major opposition parties, which are currently suspended, leading to a nearly non-existent "no" campaign amid a crackdown on dissent.</p>

          <p>Algerian writer Kamel Daoud, now living under police protection in France, has released "Houris," a novel that breaks the official silence surrounding the country's brutal civil war of the 1990s. The book, which won the prestigious Prix Goncourt, has been banned in Algeria, and authorities have issued international arrest warrants for Daoud. He explains that writing about the massacres and torture makes enemies of the regime, Islamists, and some intellectuals, placing him in grave danger. The novel focuses on the often-ignored suffering of women who were victims of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, currently a major storm in the Atlantic, is forecast to weaken as it travels east but could still impact the UK's weather this weekend. Weather models are uncertain, but one scenario shows the storm's remnants bringing a band of extremely wet and windy weather across the country. This potential storm follows an already soggy September for England and Wales, which have seen above-average rainfall. A period of high pressure is expected to bring drier conditions for a few days before the possible arrival of the ex-hurricane system.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's efforts to roll back support for clean energy, global investment in renewables reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, a 10% increase over the previous year. A report from Zero Carbon Analytics indicates the sector retains strong momentum, with investment in wind power growing by about 25%. A separate report found that major U.S. companies are also continuing to pursue their net-zero climate goals, with firms representing nearly two-thirds of U.S. corporate revenue maintaining such targets, suggesting the White House's influence on corporate strategy is limited.</p>

According to state media, technologies like AI, digital twins, and blockchain were employed to create a "3D-printing-like" construction process.

The event has heightened security concerns in Northern Europe, which has seen a recent increase in Russian sabotage activities and incursions into NATO airspace.

          <p>Porsche's stock price fell by over 7% following an announcement that it is delaying its electric vehicle (EV) rollout and extending the production of combustion engine models due to weakening demand. The company significantly reduced its profit margin forecast, citing U.S. tariffs, a slowdown in the Chinese luxury market, and the slower-than-expected adoption of EVs. This strategic shift reflects broader challenges for European carmakers, who are facing intense price competition from Chinese EV brands like BYD and XPeng. Parent company Volkswagen's shares also fell on the news. (not investment advice)</p>

Forty years ago, with the event dying due to decades of American dominance, Jacklin took over as Europe's captain in 1983 and professionalized the team's approach, demanding better travel, attire, and the inclusion of star player Seve Ballesteros. Although they narrowly lost in 1983, his changes laid the groundwork for Europe's historic victory at The Belfry in 1985, their first in 28 years, which secured the future of the competition.</p>

Fishery experts attribute the scarcity to rising ocean temperatures around Japan, which have increased by as much as 5 degrees Celsius in recent years. This situation is part of a global trend where climate change and extreme weather are impacting food staples and driving up prices for items like Louisiana crawfish and olive oil.
