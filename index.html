          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts claims made by President Trump to justify using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo, released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, states that intelligence agencies do not believe that Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro controls the criminal gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump had asserted. The release of the memo further weakens the administration's rationale for using the wartime statute and raises questions about its criticism of press coverage that reported the intelligence community's findings. The Justice Department had previously opened a criminal leak investigation after The New York Times published its article on the intelligence community's conclusions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking a federal judge in Texas to dismiss a case aiming to restrict access to the abortion drug mifepristone, continuing the Biden administration's position that Texas is not the proper venue for the lawsuit. The Justice Department argues that Idaho, Missouri, and Kansas have no ties to Texas and therefore lack standing in the suit against the Food and Drug Administration. The three Republican-led states are challenging FDA actions that loosened restrictions on the drug in 2016 and 2021. The Trump administration also argued that the states' challenge to FDAâ€™s 2016 actions is outside the six-year statute of limitations.</p>

          <p>A study led by Peking University has found that migratory pests from mainland Southeast Asia, thriving under El NiÃ±o conditions, are contributing to rice yield losses in southern China. Warm, humid weather in Southeast Asia creates favorable breeding conditions for the pests, while wind gusts help them migrate to southern China. The researchers emphasize the need for collaborative, international pest control strategies to ensure food security in the region. The team warns that continued global warming will further change the ecological niches of pests and increase the occurrence of crop pests, posing a major obstacle to stabilizing food production.</p>

          <p>The bodies of 13 gold miners were discovered in an underground shaft at a site operated by Peru's largest gold-mining company, La Poderosa, in a region experiencing increased conflict over ore access. The miners worked for an artisanal mining operation contracted with La Poderosa, which stated that armed criminals had attacked the operation and kidnapped the workers. President Dina Boluarte has responded by suspending mining activity in the Pataz area for 30 days, imposing a curfew, and establishing a military base to restore order.

Myers ordered the State Board of Elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by 734 votes over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin.

          <p>Utah is struggling to save the Great Salt Lake from drying up, an environmental disaster with health and economic implications beyond the state's borders.

While state lawmakers have invested in water conservation, critics argue that the efforts are insufficient and that industries like agriculture and real estate development are not being adequately constrained. The lake's decline has stabilized due to recent heavy snowfall, but significant cuts in water consumption are needed to reach a healthy elevation.</p>

          <p>Despite criticism of James Harden's playoff performance, the Clippers' front office, particularly President of Basketball Operations Lawrence Frank, supports him. Frank highlighted Harden's regular-season contributions, including his leadership while Kawhi Leonard was injured, his high assist numbers, and overall scoring. While not mentioning Harden's underwhelming postseason stats, Frank emphasized that re-signing Harden is the team's "first priority." Harden has a player option for next season and can either opt-in or opt-out and work on an extension with the Clippers.</p>

The train was designed by Ross and Nigerian fashion designer Ugo Mozie, and it included the names of Ross's children and grandchildren. The theme of this year's Met Gala was inspired by the museum's exhibit, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," and the dress code was "Tailored For You." Ross is set to go back on tour in June across the United Kingdom and Europe and said she does not plan to retire.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, echoing the Biden administration's earlier position. The Justice Department argues that the case, filed by the attorneys general of Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Texas court where it was filed. This move is surprising given Trump's anti-abortion stance, but analysts suggest it may be a strategic delay to avoid politically sensitive actions until after the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>India is concerned about Chinese 'dumping' of goods, particularly viscose yarn, as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate. Chinese producers are seeking alternative markets due to tariffs imposed by the U.S., leading to cheaper imports flooding Indian ports. The situation is causing production slowdowns in Indian spinning mills. India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods and has imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports. China has assured India it will not dump products and wants to buy more high-quality Indian products.</p>

The shift is largely among Democrats and the young, but also includes some Republicans. The close relationship between the US and Israel has been a permanent part of the geopolitical infrastructure, but this has come down to cultural connections. A sustained shift in public opinion might eventually lead to reduced real-world support for the country.</p>
