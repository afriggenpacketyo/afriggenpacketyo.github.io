          <p>A promising HIV vaccine project, nearing clinical trials after 15 years of research, is being terminated due to Trump administration funding cuts. The project, funded by the NIH, aimed to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies to combat the rapidly evolving HIV virus. This termination is part of a broader trend of cuts to HIV vaccine research, raising concerns about the future of finding an effective vaccine. Researchers are now scrambling to find alternative funding sources and scaling back their ambitions, potentially delaying progress in HIV prevention.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has significantly increased its military spending despite facing economic challenges, raising its defense budget by approximately 20% to 2.55 trillion Pakistani rupees ($9 billion). The decision follows recent clashes with India and comes as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government unveiled its annual federal budget. Analysts suggest the increased spending is driven by the need to ensure sufficient resources after the conflict and a surge in the military's popularity. The government plans to offset the increased defense budget with cuts to spending in other areas, including welfare (not investment advice).</p>

The unrest has led to numerous arrests, property damage, and clashes between protesters and law enforcement. The deployment of the National Guard has triggered a political row with state politicians, with California Governor Gavin Newsom suing the administration over the move.</p>
