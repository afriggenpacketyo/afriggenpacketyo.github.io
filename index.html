          <p>With interest rates on the decline, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is currently a cheaper borrowing option compared to a personal loan, as HELOCs average 7.99% while personal loans average 12.47%. HELOCs are secured by the borrower's home, making them less risky for lenders. HELOCs also have variable interest rates that are likely to decrease further as rates are cut. The article provides examples of monthly payment differences between HELOCs and personal loans for borrowing $50,000 and $100,000 over 10 years, showing significant savings with a HELOC.

Kroger disputed the findings, stating the errors were nominal and represented only a small fraction of customer transactions. The investigation also noted potential staffing issues contributing to the problem, as the number of employees at Kroger-owned stores has decreased.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is revisiting a plan to cap drug prices based on amounts paid in other high-income countries, a strategy Senate Democrats and the Biden administration previously considered but ultimately rejected. The plan aims to lower drug costs by tying them to prices in countries like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. While Democrats initially supported the idea, concerns about its impact on drug innovation led them to pursue alternative approaches. The Trump administration believes it has the authority to implement these caps, despite legal challenges that blocked a similar effort during Trump's first term.</p>
