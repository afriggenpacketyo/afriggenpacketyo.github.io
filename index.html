The Israeli military is investigating why the Houthi missile, carrying internationally banned cluster bombs, was not intercepted.

Jeffries stated Trump is 'playing games with the lives of Americans' and violating the Constitution with his domestic military deployments, which have already included Los Angeles and Washington D.C. Mayor Johnson highlighted a significant drop in Chicago's shooting incidents, asserting that any federal override of local authority would be illegal.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in California to reduce the cannabis excise tax from 19% to 15% for six years has ignited a conflict between the legal weed industry and child-care advocates.

This standoff highlights the inherent instability of funding social services with 'sin taxes' amid state financial struggles.

          <p>Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, will have her 'unsparing' memoir, 'Nobody's Girl,' published posthumously this fall. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at 41, had completed the manuscript and expressed her 'heartfelt wish' for its release regardless of her circumstances. The book promises intimate and disturbing new details about her experiences with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their associates, including Prince Andrew. Giuffre's goal was to shed light on systemic failures enabling human trafficking and foster necessary discussions for justice.</p>

          <p>Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee, argues that AI surveillance tools like those developed by Palantir pose invisible dangers, enabling mass surveillance and targeting. He asserts that these 'AI kill chains' combine vast amounts of data to track and detain individuals, violating First and Fourth Amendment rights by limiting public expression and enabling warrantless data seizures. Pinto highlights the use of these systems by agencies like ICE and the IDF, warning that their proliferation threatens civil liberties and could be increasingly integrated into the private sector to control behavior.</p>

          <p>Internal correspondence reveals that Jesuit officials in the 1970s and 1980s were aware of a priest, Donald B. Dickerson, molesting children but allowed his ordination and continued assignments. Despite warnings and psychological reports, leaders struggled to contain his repeated sexual assaults. The revelations stem from a pending lawsuit alleging Dickerson sexually assaulted a student at Loyola University New Orleans. The handling of these cases raises serious questions about the ongoing cause for canonization of former Jesuit superior general Pedro Arrupe, who was aware of some concerns regarding Dickerson.</p>
