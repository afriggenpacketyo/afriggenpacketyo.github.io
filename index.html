          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on two charges: making false statements to Congress and obstruction of justice. The indictment alleges he lied during his September 2020 testimony regarding the authorization of classified information leaks to the media. Comey, who maintains his innocence, is set for arraignment on October 9 in Alexandria. This legal development marks a significant moment, as he is the first ex-FBI director to be indicted for a crime, with the case overseen by a former personal lawyer for President Trump, raising questions about political motivations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new wave of tariffs, including a 100% levy on branded drug imports, unless companies commit to building manufacturing plants in the U.S. Additionally, a 25% tariff will be imposed on heavy-duty trucks and a 50% tariff on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, with upholstered furniture facing a 30% duty. These measures, effective October 1, aim to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition and address a perceived "flooding" of products into the U.S. The move comes despite calls from U.S. businesses against further tariffs, which critics argue will likely increase consumer prices and create trade friction.</p>

          <p>Raj Ganguly, co-founder of B Capital, asserts that artificial intelligence is in the early stages of a "super cycle" that could span 15 to 20 years, profoundly changing the world. He notes significant shifts like Silicon Valley's resurgence and the empowerment of sole founders through AI-driven coding. While acknowledging a potential "bubble" due to overvaluation, Ganguly emphasizes the long-term impact on sectors beyond consumer tech, such as healthcare and climate, and highlights India's emergence in developing AI-native applications.

The bridge also claims the title of the world's longest mountain bridge, spanning 2,890 meters across the "Earth's crack" gorge.

          <p>This article details the long-standing animosity between Donald Trump and former FBI Director James Comey, culminating in Comey's recent indictment. Trump fired Comey in 2017 after Comey reportedly refused a loyalty pledge and publicly confirmed an FBI investigation into Russian election interference. Ironically, Comey's previous actions, such as his public statements on Hillary Clinton's email investigation just before the 2016 election, significantly impacted the outcome in Trump's favor. The indictment is widely perceived as a fulfillment of Trump's public desire to punish a perceived political enemy, raising concerns about the politicization of justice.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential mass layoffs, known as reduction-in-force notices, ahead of a possible government shutdown next week. This directive applies to employees in programs funded by discretionary spending or those not aligned with "the President's priorities." Democratic leaders have vehemently dismissed the move as an "intimidation tactic," accusing the Republican-controlled government of intentionally seeking a shutdown. This unprecedented step of considering permanent layoffs, beyond typical temporary furloughs, signifies a severe escalation in the ongoing budget dispute and raises concerns about government stability.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted a stark economic divide: a robust segment fueled by the artificial intelligence boom versus a struggling consumer sector needing interest rate cuts. He noted AI giants like CoreWeave and Meta are making multi-billion-dollar investments, seemingly indifferent to interest rates. Conversely, consumer-oriented companies like CarMax, KB Home, and Starbucks are facing challenges, with Starbucks planning store count reductions and layoffs. Cramer argues that strong GDP growth is largely AI-driven, with little trickle-down benefit to the day-to-day workforce, signaling a need for policy adjustments to support the broader economy.

          <p>Major cities worldwide, including New York, Washington D.C., and San Francisco, are experiencing a "remarkable" increase in rat populations, attributed largely to rising temperatures and urban development. Warmer winters allow rats to breed more frequently, while increased urbanization provides more habitats and food sources. Pest control experts and urban rodentologists highlight that traditional poisons are becoming less effective due to rat neophobia and genetic mutations. The article suggests that cutting off food sources and improving urban hygiene are crucial strategies, rather than relying solely on inhumane methods, to manage this growing public health and environmental challenge.</p>
