          <p>A Jewish student at Columbia University has voiced apprehension regarding Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist candidate for New York City mayor. The student, TJ Katz, fears that a Mamdani administration might adopt a weak stance on condemning hate, which could embolden antisemitic actions on campus and throughout the city. The article notes a broader trend of some Jewish voters shifting toward the Republican party amid concerns over campus safety and the Democratic party's progressive wing. It also highlights efforts by organizations like the Israel on Campus Coalition to support pro-Israel students who feel increasingly outspoken.</p>

          <p>The owner of the "Trump Burger" restaurant chain in Texas, a Lebanese national named Roland Mehrez Beainy, has been arrested by ICE and is facing deportation. Beainy entered the U.S. in 2019 and allegedly overstayed his visa, with authorities also questioning the legitimacy of a marriage he used to apply for legal status. The case highlights the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement, which has not spared some of the former president's own supporters. Beainy, who denies most of the allegations, is also involved in separate legal disputes regarding his business.</p>

          <p>A preseason NFL game between the Detroit Lions and Atlanta Falcons was suspended after Lions safety Morice Norris sustained a serious injury. Norris was carted off the field and hospitalized but was reported to be in stable condition with feeling and movement in all his extremities. The injury occurred during a tackle, prompting a lengthy delay and a mutual decision by both head coaches to end the game early. The incident recalls similar game suspensions in the 2023 preseason, highlighting the league's increasing caution with severe player injuries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a plan to roll back protections and open up 82% of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to oil and gas drilling. This proposal, affecting the largest single tract of U.S. public land, has drawn widespread opposition from environmental groups, the public, and Alaska Native communities. Critics argue the move threatens critical wildlife habitats for species like polar bears and caribou, undermines Indigenous subsistence rights, and accelerates climate change in a rapidly warming region. The administration's push is seen as part of a broader effort to industrialize the Alaskan Arctic for resource extraction.</p>

          <p>A growing number of concertgoers, particularly younger generations, are using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services to afford increasingly expensive event tickets. A LendingTree survey found that 37% of Gen Z and 35% of millennials have used these loans for concerts, a trend fueled by "funflation." While BNPL offers interest-free installment options, financial analysts caution that these plans may lack the consumer protections of credit cards and can carry hefty late fees. Instead of relying on debt, experts recommend proactively budgeting and creating dedicated savings funds for entertainment expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A high school football player who suffered from debilitating headaches and dizziness for months following a concussion was diagnosed with a rare brain condition. After the injury, Logan Coleridge's symptoms persisted despite therapy, prompting a specialist to order an MRI that revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a dangerous tangle of blood vessels. He underwent successful surgery to remove the AVM, which was likely the true cause of his long-standing symptoms. Now recovered, his family is advocating for earlier and more thorough diagnostic testing for persistent post-concussion issues.</p>

          <p>San Francisco startup Marathon Fusion has proposed a modern form of alchemy: transmuting other elements into gold using the byproducts of nuclear fusion. The concept, which is currently theoretical, suggests that neutrons from a fusion reactor could change mercury atoms into gold, creating a valuable revenue stream to subsidize the high cost of developing clean fusion energy. While scientists have created minuscule amounts of gold in labs before at prohibitive costs, Marathon's idea is gaining some interest from physicists. The primary obstacle remains the lack of commercially viable fusion reactors, a technology still believed to be years away.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Residents Take Street Safety into Their Own Hands by Painting Crosswalks</h2>

          <p>Frustrated by government inaction and bureaucracy, a group of Los Angeles residents recently painted their own crosswalks in the Sawtelle neighborhood to improve pedestrian safety. Although the city's Department of Transportation (LADOT) quickly removed the unsanctioned markings, citing liability and procedural concerns, it repainted them days later following public pressure. The incident highlights a broader issue of low "state capacity" in Los Angeles, where simple projects are often bogged down by lengthy studies and red tape. The author argues that this bureaucratic paralysis forces citizens into DIY solutions and calls for streamlining city processes.</p>

          <p>India is upgrading a key road in the Galwan Valley, a region disputed with China, to better accommodate tanks and missile launchers. The country is also constructing an alternative, less exposed route to the area, aiming to enhance troop and equipment mobility in the event of a confrontation. The infrastructure projects are designed to strengthen India's strategic position along the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border. Experts note that these developments are part of Delhi's efforts to ensure it can respond quickly to any emergency situation with China in the sensitive border region.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Biden administration shares responsibility for the famine in Gaza by failing to use its leverage to stop Israel's siege of the territory. The author asserts that despite repeated warnings from the UN and aid groups about imminent starvation starting in late 2023, the administration continued to provide unconditional military support to Israel. The article claims that President Biden ignored U.S. laws that restrict arms shipments to countries obstructing humanitarian aid and undermined reports detailing the crisis. It concludes that this complicity is a significant stain on Biden's presidential legacy, predating the current Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the FBI should not assist Texas Republicans in locating Democratic state lawmakers who fled to prevent a partisan redistricting vote. The author contends that the FBI's jurisdiction is limited to federal crimes, and involving the agency in a state-level civil matter would be a lawless expansion of its authority. The piece warns that using the FBI as an enforcement arm for a political party would be a dangerous step toward a police state. It calls on the agency to resist any pressure to get involved, stating that its neutrality is vital for American democracy.</p>

          <p>The Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, once the de facto capital of the Palestinian diaspora, lies in ruins after years of civil war, siege, and looting. Volunteer engineers are now assessing the catastrophic damage, but the return of residents has been slow, with only a fraction of its pre-war population back. The war shattered the community and has altered residents' connection to the Palestinian cause, with many now focused on immediate survival. The destruction has left a legacy of suspicion that the former Assad regime intended to displace the population permanently, leaving those who remain to rebuild their lives amidst the rubble.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece uses Vice President JD Vance's complaint about Republican underrepresentation in California to critique partisan gerrymandering across the U.S., particularly in Republican-controlled Texas. The author notes that while Vance decries the practice in a blue state, his own party has used it aggressively in states like Texas to maintain power disproportionate to its voter base. The article also points to a case in Illinois where Democrats gerrymandered out a moderate Republican, Adam Kinzinger, who later became a key critic of Donald Trump. The author concludes that gerrymandering is a self-defeating practice for both parties that erodes democracy.</p>

The commission and SpaceX are already in a legal battle, with the company suing the agency after it rejected a previous expansion plan. The dispute raises questions about federal versus state authority, as military officials argue the launches are a federal activity exempt from state permits, even though most launches support SpaceX's private Starlink network.</p>

          <p>Göbekli Tepe, a nearly 12,000-year-old archaeological site in Turkey, has become a hotbed for conspiracy theories, popularized by figures on platforms like Joe Rogan's podcast. These theories often claim, without evidence, that the site was built by a lost advanced civilization and that archaeologists are hiding the truth. Lee Clare, the lead archaeologist at the site, refutes these claims, explaining that the slow pace of excavation is necessary to preserve the complex, layered site for future generations. He argues that rushing the process would destroy invaluable information, and the real danger of such misinformation is it drowns out the genuine story of early human society.</p>

The reciprocal actions mark a shift from the hard-line approach of the previous South Korean government and reflect the new administration's efforts to reopen dialogue.

          <p>As catastrophic hunger grips regions like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are warning about the dangers of "refeeding syndrome," a potentially fatal condition that can occur when malnourished individuals resume eating too quickly. The sudden intake of nutrients can cause severe electrolyte imbalances, leading to organ failure or cardiac arrest. To prevent this, aid workers use a slow, managed approach with specially formulated therapeutic foods, like fortified peanut paste. However, experts stress that delivering this life-saving care is nearly impossible without safe and consistent access for aid agencies, which is currently being denied in these conflict zones.</p>
