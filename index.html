            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 mass shooting at an El Paso, Texas Walmart, is expected to plead guilty in state court to avoid the death penalty. Crusius, who killed 23 people in a racially motivated attack targeting Hispanics, already received 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level after pleading guilty to hate crimes and weapons charges. El Paso County District Attorney James Montoya stated that the decision to forgo the death penalty was influenced by the majority of victims' relatives who desired closure. Crusius's defense attorney noted that he suffers from schizoaffective disorder, highlighting his long history of debilitating mental illness.</p>

            <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to exchange 252 Venezuelan deportees held in El Salvador for an equal number of political prisoners in Venezuela. Bukele addressed President Nicolás Maduro on X, listing family members of opposition figures, journalists, and activists detained during Venezuela's electoral crackdown. Venezuela's prosecutor's office responded critically, calling Bukele's statements "cynical" and demanding a list of the detained Venezuelans, their legal status, and medical reports. The proposal comes amid international scrutiny of El Salvador's detention of deportees, including some wrongly accused of gang affiliation, in a "mega-prison."</p>

            <p>China has cautioned countries against appeasing the United States in trade negotiations concerning President Donald Trump's tariffs. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson responded to reports that Washington plans to pressure governments to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from US import taxes. The spokesperson stated that "appeasement cannot bring peace" and that China would firmly oppose any deal reached at its expense, vowing to take resolute countermeasures. Trump's administration has initiated tariff talks with trading partners, including Japan and South Korea, following the imposition of hefty tariffs on Chinese imports and other countries' goods.</p>

            <p>Ukraine's military reported Russian drone attacks on several regions shortly after the end of a 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by Moscow. Air raid alerts were issued for the Kyiv region and other areas, with explosions reported in Mykolaiv. While Russia's military has not commented on the attacks, both sides previously accused each other of violating the ceasefire. US President Donald Trump expressed hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine this week, without providing further details. The conflict, ongoing since February 2022, has resulted in significant casualties and territorial control by Russia.</p>

            <p>Approximately 60,000 families and individuals in the United States are at risk of losing their rental assistance due to the depletion of funds for the Emergency Housing Vouchers program. Launched in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, the program provides rental assistance to those fleeing homelessness, domestic violence, and human trafficking. With rising rent costs, the allocated $5 billion is expected to run out by the end of next year, potentially leading to widespread evictions. The program's future hinges on congressional action, but securing additional funding is proving challenging amid efforts to cut federal spending.</p>

It suggests that Europe should focus on completing the capital markets union, striking trade deals with reliable partners, developing common defense capabilities, and providing greater military assistance to Ukraine. Furthermore, it advocates for building international coalitions to defend liberal democracy and expanding economic partnerships with middle- and low-income countries. By taking these steps, Europe can enhance its role on the world stage and become a more reliable partner in the face of US protectionism and Russian aggression.</p>

The PBOC's move comes after China reported better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% year-on-year GDP growth in the first quarter, providing room to maintain steady rates. The decision aligns with economists' expectations, as the PBOC appears to prioritize currency stability over further monetary easing.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the war-linked Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, coinciding with the shrine's three-day spring festival. The shrine, viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism, honors wartime leaders and war dead. Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine during the festival, likely due to diplomatic considerations. Cabinet ministers also sent offerings. Past visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders have drawn criticism from China and South Korea, given Japan's history of invasion and colonization.</p>

            <p>US Vice President JD Vance is visiting India to discuss a bilateral trade deal with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The visit aims to review progress on bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments. Discussions are expected to focus on fairness in trade and expanding the defense partnership. While Modi and Trump have a good rapport, the US president has previously labeled India a "tariff abuser," raising concerns about potential tariffs on Indian imports. India hopes to secure a trade deal within a 90-day pause on tariffs declared by Trump.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen in March in a second group chat using the messaging app Signal that included his wife, his brother and his personal lawyer. Those details shared in the second chat included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets involved in the pending attack on Houthi positions, according to the officials. The sharing of the details reportedly occurred around the same time in mid-March when key members of President Donald Trump's National Security Council, including Hegseth, inadvertently shared details about the March 15 missile strike in Yemen with the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. The Pentagon's independent inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app.</p>

            <p>Ingrid Lindblad grew up figure skating. The dynamic sport of balance and precision tested her limits before she ultimately surrendered the ice for the green full-time. As one of two LPGA rookies atop the JM Eagle LA Championship leaderboard Sunday afternoon, Lindblad needed to channel her success, which propelled her to becoming the 2024 Honda Award winner for golf, the same under-pressure skillset that helped her qualify for the LPGA tour in the first place. Lindblad, 25, converted six birdies Sunday, enough to weather the field and win the LA Championship at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana — her first LPGA victory in her third career tour start. Lindblad was unaware of her first victory until cameras swarmed her as she nervously snacked in front of the clubhouse.</p>

While the first season focused on building relationships in impossible circumstances, the second season delves into the darker aspects of animosity and grief. The show's limited imagination and unrelenting cheerlessness have made it a punishing watch, with the characters seemingly lost in the darkness. The season explores Ellie's journey of rediscovering her humanity while being overwhelmed by grief, but the focus on anguish has made the storytelling more circular and suffocating.</p>
