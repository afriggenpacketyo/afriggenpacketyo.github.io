          <p>President Trump stated that he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom, escalating tensions amid immigration protests in Los Angeles. Trump criticized the protesters as "professional agitators" and "insurrectionists" who should be jailed, while also standing by his decision to deploy the National Guard to the city. Newsom responded by accusing Trump of authoritarianism and stated that calling for the arrest of a sitting governor crosses a critical line for the nation. The protests began after ICE raids in the Los Angeles Fashion District, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement, as well as damage to businesses.</p>

          <p>Waymo has temporarily suspended its car service in downtown Los Angeles after multiple vehicles were vandalized and set on fire during anti-ICE protests. The company stated that it does not believe its vehicles were intentionally targeted, but rather happened to be present during the protests, and they are cooperating with the LAPD. Protests in Los Angeles escalated following President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard, with demonstrators damaging businesses in addition to the Waymo vehicles. The LAPD has advised businesses in the area to report any damage to the police and document it before cleaning up.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Italian referendum aimed at expediting citizenship for immigrants and strengthening labor rights failed due to low voter turnout, after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other right-wing political parties urged Italians to boycott the democratic process. The referendum sought to reduce the naturalization waiting period from 10 to 5 years, potentially benefiting second-generation Italians born in the country to non-EU citizens. Right-wing parties opposed the change, advocating for reduced immigration and emphasizing blood ancestry as a key aspect of Italian identity. Civil rights activists and opposition parties criticized the boycott strategy, arguing that it undermines the foundations of democracy, and the leader of the center-left Democratic Party called it a betrayal of constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old girl who was groomed and charged with terrorism offenses before taking her own life, revealed missed opportunities by authorities to provide her with adequate support. The coroner concluded that there were chances for the police and Derbyshire County Council to refer Rudd earlier for consideration as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd had been groomed and sexually exploited online by an American neo-Nazi and became fixated on Adolf Hitler, but the terrorism charges were dropped after the Home Office concluded she was a victim of exploitation. The inquest highlighted a need for improved mental health support and safeguarding measures for vulnerable children involved in such cases.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation countersuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star. The legal battle between the two actors, who starred in the 2024 film *It Ends with Us*, has been ongoing for several months, with a trial initially scheduled for next year. Baldoni's countersuit alleged extortion, defamation, and other claims, but was dismissed by Judge Lewis Liman on Monday. The case originated from a legal complaint filed by Lively last year, in which she accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and initiating a smear campaign against her.</p>

Other cases before the court involve the Trump administration's efforts to end birthright citizenship, Louisiana's congressional map, and parental opt-outs from school lessons with LGBTQ themes.

          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 22 years for attempting to murder a colleague, Graeme Perks. Brooks broke into Perks's home in January 2021, armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, and stabbed him, with the judge stating that Perks had a 95% chance of dying. The attack stemmed from Brooks's belief that Perks was responsible for his professional difficulties and disciplinary action at work, and the judge described Brooks's actions as a "murderous expedition". Despite the physical and emotional trauma, Perks expressed no ill will towards Brooks, viewing the incident as another chapter in his life.</p>

Martha's death has led to the implementation of Martha's Rule in hundreds of hospitals in England, giving parents the right to an urgent second opinion.

          <p>A new study in JAMA Pediatrics reveals a significant increase in firearm-related deaths among children and teens in the U.S. following a 2010 Supreme Court decision that gave states more power to set their own gun laws. The study found over 7,000 more children died from firearm-related injuries in the years after the decision, with most deaths occurring in states with more permissive gun laws. Firearms are now the leading cause of death in children and teens in the United States, outpacing motor vehicle crashes and cancer, and the increases in firearm deaths were not confined to a single demographic or region.</p>

          <p>The deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell immigration protests echoes historical instances of overreaction to peaceful demonstrations in California. In 1894, the National Guard was called up to suppress a railroad strike, but guardsmen showed sympathy for the strikers, highlighting the risks of militarizing domestic disputes. The administration's decision to federalize the Guard is seen as adding fuel to an already tense situation, reminiscent of past events where government overreach exacerbated public support for protesters. History suggests caution in deploying military force against citizens exercising their rights to protest.</p>

The ban includes exemptions for lawful permanent residents, existing visa holders, and individuals whose entry "serves U.S. national interests," with some foreign leaders and international groups criticizing the policy as discriminatory.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to largely reverse cuts to winter fuel payments has raised questions about its spending and savings plans, with BBC Verify analyzing the key numbers. The government initially planned to restrict winter fuel payments to pensioners receiving pension credit, but has now decided that all pensioners will receive the payment, although it will be clawed back from higher earners. The U-turn will cost an estimated Â£1.25bn, and the Treasury will need to address a resulting Â£1bn gap in the next Budget, which could involve raising taxes or cutting spending elsewhere. Some analysts think the net saving for the government could actually be lower still.</p>
