          <p>Chinese provinces, including Zhejiang, are organizing business delegations to the United States in the coming months, aiming to capitalize on a recent stabilization in US-China relations. These visits, which require Beijing's approval, seek to foster trade and investment opportunities by engaging with local US authorities and businesses. The initiative comes after a temporary pause in blanket tariff increases between the two economic powers. This strategic move highlights China's effort to leverage subnational exchanges to strengthen economic ties, even as broader geopolitical tensions persist.</p>

Among the victims were a transport worker and several foreign nationals from various countries, including Germany, Spain, and Canada. The incident occurred when a carriage lost control, crashing into a building on a steep cobblestone street. Authorities are currently investigating the cause of the accident, with emergency services working to identify all those affected by this devastating event.</p>

          <p>Applications for unemployment benefits in the U.S. saw a modest increase last week, rising by 8,000 to 237,000, slightly above economists' expectations. Despite this uptick, the overall number of claims remains within a historically healthy range, suggesting that employers are largely retaining their workforces. The four-week average of claims also rose slightly to 231,000, while the total number of Americans collecting benefits decreased to 1.94 million. This indicates a resilient, albeit possibly slowing, labor market as the economy navigates various pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intentionally selected the notorious Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola, to detain immigration offenders, according to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. The facility, now dubbed "Camp 57" in homage to Louisiana's governor, is intended to house the "worst of the worst" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees. This decision has raised significant alarm among immigration and criminal justice advocates, who cite Angola's dark history of abuse and the potential for human rights violations. Officials state that detainees will be kept separate from the general prison population, with plans to expand capacity to over 400 individuals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Labor Department is set to release its August employment figures, a report highly anticipated amidst signs of a cooling labor market. This release follows President Trump's controversial dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner after July's disappointing job growth numbers and significant downward revisions for prior months. Economists are closely watching for indications of whether the job market is stabilizing or further losing momentum, with forecasts generally predicting a modest gain of 80,000 jobs. The data will also be crucial for the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, with a weak report likely reinforcing expectations for a cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justice Democrats, a left-wing PAC known for backing progressive candidates, has endorsed Angela Gonzales-Torres in a primary challenge against four-term Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez in Los Angeles. The group criticizes Gomez for accepting significant funding from AIPAC and corporate lobbies, linking it to his stance on issues like the Gaza conflict and cryptocurrency regulation. This contest is shaping up as a proxy battle between the activist left and pro-Israel lobbying groups within the Democratic Party. Gonzales-Torres, a community activist, emphasizes her roots in the district and aims to represent working-class constituents, despite Gomez's own progressive record.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its anti-drug-trafficking operations in the Caribbean, deploying multiple warships and announcing a strike on a vessel allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela. President Trump claimed the strike killed 11 "narcoterrorists" from the Tren de Aragua gang. Analysts suggest these actions, including a prior $50 million reward for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's arrest, aim to pressure the Maduro regime. The scale of the naval build-up is unusual for counter-narcotics missions, raising concerns about potential escalation and the legality of such military actions under international law.</p>

ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, attributed the slowdown to consumer worries, labor shortages, and disruptions from artificial intelligence. While leisure and hospitality saw gains, sectors like trade, transportation, utilities, education, and health services experienced job losses. (not investment advice)</p>

While federal law mandates a 24% withholding and an additional 14.6% due at tax time, states like California, Florida, and Texas do not levy state taxes on lottery winnings, allowing winners there to take home considerably more.

This approach, exemplified by the reinstallation of Confederate symbols and the dismantling of civil rights initiatives, aligns with neo-Confederate "lost cause" mythology.

          <p>Thousands of Lloyds Banking Group staff are at risk of redundancy as the financial firm implements a performance shake-up, targeting the lowest-performing 5% of its workforce. This policy, affecting all levels from branch staff to senior directors, could lead to approximately 1,500 job losses, according to reports. The bank states it is striving to embed a "high-performance culture" and continuously seeks ways to optimize employee output. Unions have expressed concern over staff being "hounded out," while analysts suggest the move aligns with broader industry trends towards cost reduction and offshoring roles.

          <p>The peace sign, or V-sign, has become an increasingly ubiquitous photo pose among Gen Z and Gen Alpha children, surpassing older gestures like bunny ears. While originating as a symbol of victory in WWII and later peace during the Vietnam War, its current widespread use is influenced by Japanese pop culture, particularly anime, where it signifies cuteness or celebration. For many kids, the gesture has lost its specific historical meaning, serving primarily as a default pose for pictures. This trend reflects a generation growing up with constant photography and a strategic awareness of how to present themselves visually.</p>
