          <h2>Australian Central Bank Unexpectedly Holds Interest Rates Steady</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's Reserve Bank has surprisingly maintained its policy interest rate at 3.85%, diverging from economists' expectations of a rate cut. The RBA stated it needs more time to assess inflation data to ensure it is sustainably on track to reach its 2.5% target. This decision comes despite recent data showing inflation at a four-year low, prompting criticism from the country's treasurer who highlighted the government's progress in combating the cost of living. The Australian dollar strengthened following the announcement amid a broader economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's announcement of renewed tariff threats has drawn sharp, yet measured, reactions from key international allies, including Japan, South Korea, and Thailand. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called the move "truly regrettable" but affirmed that negotiations would continue ahead of the new August 1st deadline. Other nations, such as Thailand and Malaysia, expressed shock but remained optimistic that diplomatic engagement could lead to more favorable terms. The letters detail steep potential levies, like 25% on Japanese imports and 36% on Thai goods, continuing a period of global trade uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new malaria treatment specifically formulated for babies weighing less than 4.5kg (10lbs) has been approved, addressing a critical gap in pediatric care. Previously, infants were treated with medications designed for older children, which carried a significant risk of overdose due to their developing liver functions. Developed by Novartis in collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture, the drug is expected to be rolled out in African countries on a not-for-profit basis within weeks. This breakthrough is hailed as a major step in reducing the high mortality rate among children under five.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed United Nations investigators that the U.S. maintains legal responsibility for Venezuelan migrants deported to the country's notorious CECOT prison. This admission contradicts public statements from both governments, which had suggested the men were outside of U.S. jurisdiction after their transfer. Lawyers for the migrants argue this proves the U.S. government has been dishonest with the courts and can be compelled to return the men. The revelation complicates the Trump administration's legal defense of its controversial $6 million deal with El Salvador to house the deportees.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki volcano has erupted violently, sending an ash cloud 18 kilometers into the sky and triggering further evacuations on the island of Flores. Authorities have raised the alert to the highest level, expanding the exclusion zone to a 7km radius due to the eruption's intensity and the risk of lahar mudflows. The event has disrupted air travel, with dozens of flights to and from the nearby island of Bali canceled. Over 4,000 people have been evacuated, and communities remaining in the area face shortages of clean water and food as thick volcanic ash blankets the region.</p>

          <p>China has issued a stern warning to the Trump administration, threatening retaliation if steep tariffs are reinstated next month. An official commentary in the People's Daily stated that dialogue is the only path forward and that China would firmly protect its interests against U.S. "bullying." Beijing also cautioned other nations against striking deals with the U.S. that are designed to cut China out of supply chains, vowing to respond resolutely to any such agreements. The warning sets the stage for a potential re-escalation of the trade war ahead of an August 12 deadline for a new agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially delayed the implementation of higher tariffs on U.S. imports, setting a new deadline of August 1 for 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea. The move extends a 90-day pause on some of the administration's most aggressive trade measures, providing more time for negotiations. Trump shared letters sent to world leaders detailing the proposed rates, such as a 25% tax on Japanese goods, but indicated the levels could be modified based on diplomatic relationships. Economists note that the extension was expected, as comprehensive trade deals typically require extensive time to finalize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he had nominated U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The visit was expected to focus on securing a ceasefire in the 21-month Gaza war, with Trump expressing optimism that Hamas is ready for a deal. When questioned about the displacement of Palestinians, Netanyahu stated that people should have the "free choice" to leave Gaza, adding that Israel is working with the U.S. to find countries to help. The meeting occurred as indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas resumed in Qatar.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% decline in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of analyst expectations. The company is struggling to meet the high demand for advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a key component in the booming artificial intelligence sector, where competitor SK Hynix has become a key supplier to Nvidia. Samsung cited inventory value adjustments and U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China as contributing factors to the disappointing forecast. The announcement reflects ongoing challenges in its foundry business and delays in getting its latest HBM chips certified. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man was stabbed and sustained life-threatening injuries during a dispute over a place in line for a Pokémon card restock at a GameStop in Colma, California. Police arrested two suspects who allegedly attacked the victim after one of them cut in line. The altercation escalated, with one suspect allegedly striking the victim with a mason jar and the other using the broken glass to stab him multiple times. The incident highlights a growing trend of violence associated with the highly profitable resale market for the popular trading cards, which has prompted some retailers to halt in-store sales.</p>

The university will also establish a faculty oversight committee for its other professional education programs, marking a significant development in the scrutiny of university partnerships with online program managers.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes the Trump administration's priorities, contrasting increased funding for immigration enforcement with budget cuts to scientific and medical research. The author highlights a recent show of force by federal agents in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park as a political stunt designed to provoke fear, while arguing it does little to address the area's real problems. The piece condemns the administration's new budget, which slashes funding for the NIH and climate-related agencies, as a dangerous misallocation of resources. It frames these decisions as ignoring existential threats in favor of a manufactured immigration crisis.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its plan for a large-scale reduction-in-force that could have laid off tens of thousands of employees in August. The VA now expects to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through a federal hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition, eliminating the need for mass layoffs. The initial plan, aimed at returning staff levels to those of 2019, would have required cutting over 80,000 jobs. Critics, however, argue the high attrition rate is due to a toxic work environment and will inevitably harm services for veterans.</p>

          <p>China has activated the W121 flight path, the last of three branches off the main M503 route that runs through the Taiwan Strait, a move made without consulting Taipei. At its closest, the M503 route is just 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial median line separating Taiwan and the mainland. Beijing's Civil Aviation Administration stated the change was a technical adjustment to improve air traffic safety and efficiency. However, the unilateral move has raised alarms in Taipei, which views such actions as a potential security threat and an attempt to alter the status quo in the sensitive waterway.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that no evidence of a so-called "client list" or blackmail material was ever found.

Officials stated the review found no credible evidence to pursue investigations against other uncharged individuals. The memo emphasized that perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the more than 1,000 victims who suffered unique trauma.</p>

Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," acknowledging that while his performance this season might not typically warrant a selection, he intends to enjoy the experience.

          <p>South Korea has canceled a $2.2 billion plan to purchase an additional 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, citing cost increases and the platform's vulnerability on the modern battlefield. A member of the National Assembly noted that the war in Ukraine has demonstrated the significant threat posed by advanced air defenses and drones to low-flying helicopters. Instead of investing in legacy platforms, the funds will be redirected toward developing drones and other advanced smart systems. The decision reflects a growing global reevaluation of the attack helicopter's role in high-intensity conflicts against peer adversaries.</p>

Authorities stated that participants likely believed the event was legal due to organizers' comments. The move is a setback for Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government, which has enacted a series of anti-LGBTQ+ laws and described the parade as "repulsive and shameful."</p>
