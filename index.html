            <p>Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times is set for a retrial after an appeals court overturned the initial dismissal. Palin alleges that a 2017 editorial falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting, damaging her reputation. The Times acknowledges the inaccuracy but claims it was an honest mistake, quickly corrected. The retrial occurs amidst heightened scrutiny of media outlets and accusations of unjust treatment, mirroring similar lawsuits filed by Donald Trump against news organizations.

            <p>Goldman Sachs suggests that ESG investors should reconsider their stance on oil and gas companies, arguing that the energy transition will be longer than expected and that these companies are significant investors in low-carbon energy. An analyst at Goldman Sachs, Michele Della Vigna, outlined three reasons to back-up his view on why ESG investors should bring oil and gas stocks in from the cold. She emphasizes the need for new oil and gas development well into the 2040s and highlights the role of these companies as market makers and risk-takers. However, some ESG experts disagree, citing the negative impacts of fossil fuels on the climate. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Baby boomers and first-time travelers are driving a trend towards "coolcations," opting for destinations in northern Europe to avoid the extreme heat, crowds, and high costs associated with Mediterranean hotspots during peak summer months. Bookings to Iceland, Estonia, and Scandinavia have increased significantly, while bookings to southern Europe have shifted to shoulder seasons. Experts predict this trend will intensify as climate change worsens and the effects become more unpredictable, with travelers consciously choosing cooler climates to avoid heat waves and wildfires. This shift presents an economic opportunity for northern European countries like Sweden and Estonia. </p>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge of 12.4% in March, exceeding expectations, as businesses accelerated shipments to the U.S. to preempt potential tariffs. Imports, however, continued to decline, reflecting sluggish domestic demand. Analysts suggest that exports may weaken in the coming months due to escalating trade tensions and increased U.S. tariffs. The Chinese leadership has set an ambitious annual growth target of around 5%, which may be challenging to achieve given the trade war and lackluster domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tenants on the Nags Head Estate in east London are battling Peabody housing association over long-standing issues of damp and mould in their homes, which they claim are causing respiratory illnesses and mental health problems. The tenants have enlisted lawyers and health professionals from the charity Medact to push for a solution, citing ineffective repairs and a lack of proper insulation. Peabody acknowledges the issues and says it has invested over £1m on improvements, but tenants argue that the repairs are only cosmetic and do not address the root causes of the problem. The situation highlights broader issues of overcrowding and rising costs in social housing.</p>

The article explores the duality of the US as both a violator and upholder of international law, and the increasing insecurity felt by those who once relied on the US as a safe haven. Malik argues that the world must begin building a new global order where all nations have a stake, as the US's influence, despite its flaws, provided a degree of stability.

            <p>China's exports surged by 12.4% in March, driven by businesses frontloading shipments to avoid upcoming tariff increases from the United States. Imports, however, declined by 4.3%, indicating weak domestic demand. Analysts suggest that this export surge may be a "final hurrah" before the impact of new tariffs takes hold. The situation creates uncertainty for businesses and could lead to supply chain disruptions and potential inflation in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
