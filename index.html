        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high of $112,052.24, driven by a broader rally in technology stocks led by Nvidia. Despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the cryptocurrency had been trading in a narrow range recently, but its status as a risk asset means it often rises with growth-oriented stocks. Analysts suggest that increased corporate buying and potential U.S. crypto legislation could fuel further upward momentum, with some predicting prices could reach $120,000 soon.

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former chairman of the UK's Conservative Party, has announced his defection to the rival Reform UK party, becoming the fourth former Tory MP to do so in two weeks. In a statement, Berry criticized both the Conservative and Labour parties, stating that "Britain is broken" and the political system has failed. The move highlights growing momentum for Nigel Farage's Reform UK, causing concern within the Conservative party, while Labour suggests it shows Reform is adopting the reckless economics of the Liz Truss era.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports has caused market prices for the metal to surge and raised concerns among economists about inflation. Copper is a critical component in electrical wiring, appliances, electric vehicles, and infrastructure, meaning the tariff could increase costs for consumers and industries. While the administration argues the policy will boost domestic production and create jobs, experts warn it could have widespread negative ripple effects on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, for her vocal criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza, which she has described as a "genocide." The move follows a failed U.S. campaign to have her removed from her post and is part of a broader effort to counter criticism of Israel's nearly two-year-long war. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused Albanese of antisemitism and political warfare, while Albanese maintains she is advocating for international law and human rights.</p>

          <p>Ben McLemore, a former NBA guard, has been sentenced to 100 months in prison after a jury found him guilty of first-degree sexual assault and other related charges.

Prosecutors highlighted the victim's courage in coming forward, hoping it encourages others, while McLemore's defense had argued the encounter was consensual.
