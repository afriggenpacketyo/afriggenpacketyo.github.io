          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran intensifies, American students and tour groups in Israel are making arrangements to evacuate. Julia Cohen, a University of Michigan student participating in the Birthright Onward program, found herself seeking shelter in Southern Israel after missile exchanges. The U.S. Embassy in Israel initially announced plans for evacuation flights and cruise ships, but the State Department later retracted the statement, leaving many uncertain. Despite the dangers, some students expressed reluctance to leave, highlighting their strong connections to the country and its people. Lauren Field, visiting her son studying in Tel Aviv, is also waiting for evacuation with her family, emphasizing the mixed feelings of safety and connection amidst the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks faced backlash on social media after posting an image of rookie guard Sarah Ashlee Barker in what some users considered a sexualized manner. The post, intended to promote the team's game against the Seattle Storm, featured Barker wearing what appeared to be a crop top, prompting criticism from fans who felt it was inappropriate and detracted from the team's professionalism. This incident follows similar criticism faced by Sparks forward Cameron Brink, who was accused of prioritizing off-court activities over rehabbing her ACL injury. Brink defended herself, emphasizing her dedication to recovery and expressing disappointment in the fan's insinuation, showing the pressures players face regarding their image and performance. The situation underscores ongoing debates about representation and professionalism in women's sports. The team has shared game day posts of players wearing their uniforms in the past.</p>

Xu emphasized the importance of collaboration with global carriers to achieve sustainable growth, but he did not address the geopolitical challenges Huawei has faced since U.S. sanctions were imposed in 2019.

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors have charged 19 people in a conspiracy orchestrated by an alleged member of the Mexican Mafia to murder rapper Swifty Blue, also known as Nelson Abrego. The plot allegedly stemmed from Abrego angering Mexican Mafia member Manuel ‚ÄúSnuffy‚Äù Quintero, who issued the order to kill him in 2022. The conspiracy involved communication through TikTok messages and recorded jail calls, implicating prisoners and gang members from various locations. Despite an attempt on his life in jail, Abrego survived, and the investigation led to multiple arrests and charges related to the murder conspiracy.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" has turned reporting idling vehicles into a full-time job, earning over six figures annually. New York City law prohibits trucks and non-city buses from idling for more than three minutes, but enforcement is lax. Under the Citizens Air Complaint Program, individuals can report idling vehicles and receive 25% of the fines, which range from $350 to $600. While some truck drivers view the program as a "bounty hunter" scheme, proponents argue it addresses a significant public health issue by reducing air pollution. George Pakenham, who helped create the law, emphasizes the health benefits of reducing vehicle idling.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo has successfully hatched ten condor chicks, contributing to the restoration of California's condor population. These chicks will eventually be released into the wild to increase the genetic diversity of the condor population. The zoo uses a double-brooding method, where two chicks are raised simultaneously by surrogate condors, a technique pioneered by the Los Angeles Zoo. This initiative is part of the California Condor Recovery Program, which has helped increase the condor population from just 22 individuals four decades ago to 561 as of 2024, though the species remains critically endangered.</p>

Despite the uncomfortable accessory, the bear survived and was able to feed itself, though its neck was scarred. The department of natural resources set a trap and safely removed the lid on June 3, releasing the bear back into the wild, showing the resilience of the animal.</p>

Gilead Sciences' CEO, Daniel O'Day, hailed the approval as a "milestone moment" in the fight against HIV. However, the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research raises concerns about long-term progress, with experts emphasizing the continued need for a vaccine despite the drug's approval.</p>

          <p>Leading climate scientists warn that the Earth could breach the 1.5C warming limit within three years if current carbon dioxide emission levels persist. A new study indicates that the "carbon budget" to maintain warming below 1.5C has shrunk significantly due to continued record emissions. The current rate of warming is approximately 0.27C per decade, much faster than anything in the geological record. The study highlights the urgent need for rapid and stringent emissions cuts to mitigate the severe impacts of climate change, including increased weather extremes and sea-level rise.</p>
