        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. This followed Newsom's announcement, alongside Attorney General Rob Bonta, of a lawsuit against Trump for deploying the National Guard to address immigration protests, which they deemed an illegal federal overreach. Trump's remarks came after his border czar, Tom Homan, threatened to arrest Newsom and others obstructing immigration actions. Newsom responded by accusing Trump of authoritarianism, highlighting the escalating tensions between the state and federal governments. The situation further intensified with the arrest of labor leader David Huerta on felony conspiracy charges related to impeding an officer during the protests. Optimism remains low due to the escalating conflict and potential overreach of federal power.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification for domestic flights or accessing federal facilities, which require a Real ID or other approved document. This clarification follows a rumor that Costco cards could be used as a form of identification at airports, prompting the TSA to address the issue on social media. While a Costco card might help establish a baseline identity during the identity verification process if a traveler has lost their ID, it does not replace the need for an acceptable form of identification. Acceptable forms of identification include passports, U.S. Department of Defense IDs, and DHS trusted traveler cards. This announcement is intended to prevent delays at airport security checkpoints.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's initial lawsuit alleging sexual harassment on the set of their film "It Ends With Us." Baldoni's suit claimed Lively and others aimed to ruin his career by promoting a false narrative. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to prove Lively's threats regarding film promotion constituted extortion and that he hadn't demonstrated defamation since Lively's statements were privileged under her lawsuit. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, while Baldoni has been given until June 23 to amend and refile allegations related to contract interference. This ruling comes after Lively withdrew claims of emotional distress in her suit against Baldoni.</p>

Seltzer received over 90 percent of the electronic vote, emphasizing the rule of law as a central theme of her campaign. The election became a focal point for broader clashes within the American legal system, partly due to Bondi's connection as the brother of Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi expressed disappointment that the race became politicized, lamenting the shift away from focusing on training programs and pro bono work for lawyers. Seltzer's victory signifies a renewed focus on upholding legal principles and ensuring lawyers can safely represent their clients.</p>

          <p>Emerson Colindres, a recent high school graduate in Ohio, faces deportation to Honduras after being detained by ICE during a routine check-in. Colindres and his family sought asylum after arriving from Honduras but were denied, with a final removal order issued in 2023.

Community members and teammates have gathered to protest Colindres's detention, describing him as an exceptional person and player.

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old girl groomed and charged with terrorism offenses, concluded that authorities missed opportunities to help her. The chief coroner determined that police and Derbyshire County Council could have referred Rudd earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd, the youngest girl charged with terrorism offenses in the UK, took her own life at a children's home in May 2022 after charges were dropped due to her exploitation. The inquest highlighted a "systems failure" but found no single organization to blame for her death. Despite the tragic circumstances, the coroner found it necessary and appropriate to investigate and prosecute the teenager for terrorism offenses.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued an order blocking the Trump administration from enforcing anti-diversity and anti-transgender executive orders related to grant funding requirements. The judge ruled that the government cannot force recipients to halt programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion or acknowledge transgender individuals. The plaintiffs, including health centers and LGBTQ+ services groups, argued that the executive orders infringe on free speech rights. This decision is a victory for LGBTQ+ organizations and other groups that rely on federal funding to support their missions, ensuring they can continue their work without censorship. The order will remain in effect while the legal case continues.</p>

          <p>China's control over the global supply of samarium, a rare earth metal essential for military hardware, poses a significant threat to Western militaries. The United States and its allies rely on samarium to rebuild inventories of fighter jets, missiles, and other crucial equipment. China's monopoly on this resource raises concerns about potential supply disruptions and strategic vulnerabilities. This situation underscores the need for Western nations to diversify their sources of rare earth minerals and reduce their dependence on China for critical military components.

Carney stated that Canada needs to reduce its security dependence on the United States, especially given the changing nature of U.S. global leadership under President Trump. The focus will shift towards purchasing more defense equipment from Europe, and the government is reviewing the purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets.
