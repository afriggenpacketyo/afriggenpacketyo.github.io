          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for over half a century and is now slowly spiraling back to Earth. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur within a specific window, but the exact location remains unknown. Despite the spacecraft's heat shield, some parts may survive the atmospheric entry, but the risk of injury on the ground is considered low.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she would not be running for Senate in 2026, citing disillusionment with the Senate's functionality and criticizing both Democrats and Republicans. Greene claimed the Senate obstructs the will of the people and protects the 'Uniparty's' power, making meaningful change difficult. She also attacked fellow Republicans for failing to deliver on campaign promises due to the influence of donors and consultants. Greene's decision follows Governor Brian Kemp's choice to also pass on a Senate bid, leaving the GOP searching for a strong candidate to challenge Senator Jon Ossoff.</p>

          <p>A new study by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) highlights the potential vulnerability of China's rapidly expanding network of nuclear power plants in the event of a military conflict. With over 100 reactors either operational or under construction, primarily along the coast, these facilities could become high-value targets, posing significant risks to lives and property. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, where civilian nuclear plants faced military threats, prompted this re-evaluation and proposals for enhanced defense strategies.</p>

The mayor's office stated the purpose of the meeting was to discuss city priorities, including infrastructure, but Trump suggested Adams came to thank him for past support. The released documents revealed an F.B.I. investigation into potential witness tampering by Adams, although he was never charged with that crime. The Justice Department's decision to drop the case against Adams had previously led to resignations within the department.</p>

These toxins, produced by algae blooms, can accumulate in shellfish and cause severe illness or death.

          <p>Newspaper headlines reflect key events, including President Trump's openness to easing tariffs on China ahead of trade talks, and the Navy chief stepping back due to a misconduct probe. The Financial Times reports Trump's suggestion of nearly halving tariffs on Chinese goods, while the Times highlights concerns about net migration. Many papers cover the story of Admiral Sir Ben Key, the Navy chief facing a misconduct probe, and the Daily Mirror reports on an alleged feud between the Beckham family and their son's wife.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating residents' data privacy rights. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, accusing the company of unlawfully tracking and collecting user data. The settlement covers allegations in two separate lawsuits related to Chrome's incognito setting, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. Google did not admit wrongdoing but stated that the settlement resolves old claims concerning product policies they have since changed.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariff policy has significantly impacted the port of Long Beach, the busiest port in the western hemisphere, with traffic down by a third compared to the previous year. This reduction translates to fewer ships, containers, and trucking jobs, affecting the local economy. The tariffs have also led to shortages and price hikes on imported goods, particularly in the toy district of downtown Los Angeles. The U.S. Trade Secretary is scheduled to meet with his Chinese counterpart in Switzerland to address these growing economic concerns.</p>

The holdup is attributed to President Trump's transactional offer requiring Ukraine to share critical minerals in exchange for arms shipments. A meeting between Trump and Zelensky in Rome offered some hope, but no additional aid packages have been forthcoming.</p>
