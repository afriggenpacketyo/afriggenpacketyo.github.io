          <p>Analysts predict China's economy likely experienced a slowdown in the third quarter, with official data anticipated to confirm weaker growth. Gross domestic product is forecast to rise 4.8% year-on-year, down from 5.2% in the previous quarter. This deceleration is also reflected in expected slower retail sales and industrial production, alongside minimal expansion in fixed-asset investment. Despite these internal challenges, China's exports have shown resilience amidst ongoing tensions with the U.S., presenting a mixed economic picture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a massive statue of Robert E. Lee, have been melted down and transformed into art pieces for a new Los Angeles exhibition titled "Monuments." Curator Hamza Walker spent eight years acquiring the statues, which once sparked nationwide protests due to their association with white supremacy and slavery. The exhibit, opening October 23, displays these reimagined pieces alongside contemporary art, challenging historical narratives, particularly as President Trump advocates for reinstalling such monuments. This artistic transformation aims to purify a toxic representation of history.</p>

          <p>Hollywood actor Cate Blanchett is actively involved with Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB), which is celebrating its 25th anniversary. The MSB stores over 2.5 billion seeds from 40,000 wild plant species globally, initially conceived as a "doomsday vault" but now focused on environmental restoration. Blanchett, an ambassador for Wakehurst, emphasizes the importance of this "insurance policy" against plant extinction, especially after events like the Australian wildfires. The project utilizes these seeds to restore threatened habitats worldwide, including chalk grasslands and tropical forests.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are poised for a mostly higher open as investors await a series of economic data releases from China. Analysts project China's third-quarter GDP growth to slow to 4.8% year-on-year, a decrease from the previous quarter's 5.2%. Futures for Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index indicate stronger opens, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 opened slightly lower. This regional anticipation follows a positive close for major U.S. averages, influenced by a softening U.S. stance on trade talks with China and a recovery from earlier credit concerns.

          <p>The global secondhand luxury market is experiencing rapid growth, expanding three times faster than the firsthand market and projected to reach $360 billion by 2030. As counterfeit items become increasingly sophisticated, robust authentication processes are now paramount for resale platforms. Companies like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in proprietary verification systems, combining visual inspections, scientific equipment, and AI to combat "superfakes" and build consumer trust. This focus on authenticity is driving significant business growth in the luxury resale sector, attracting a new wave of consumers, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, who prioritize affordability and access to rare items.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to roll out new vocational qualifications, "V-levels," for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify the post-16 education landscape in England. These V-levels are set to replace existing Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, with a focus on practical skills leading to employment. Ministers also intend to reduce GCSE English and maths resits by offering an alternative qualification. While the Sixth Form Colleges Association expresses concern about V-levels filling the gap left by BTecs, the initiative seeks to provide clearer pathways for students, potentially allowing a mix-and-match approach with A-levels.</p>

          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, discusses China's economic resilience amidst the US rivalry. She argues that the impact of US tariffs on China's economy is exaggerated, as exports to the US constitute a small percentage of China's GDP, and its largest export destination is now ASEAN. Qian emphasizes that the US-China rivalry extends beyond trade into technology and ideology, urging for healthier competition. She also advocates for the critical role of women's voices in policymaking, highlighting their importance in shaping global outcomes.</p>

          <p>During the IMF annual meetings, with the US government in shutdown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Ambassador Jamieson Greer accused China of "economic coercion," specifically citing its expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. They argued China's actions aim to "chokehold" the global economy and technology supply chain, impacting high-tech goods and AI systems. This accusation comes as the Trump administration's own tariff policies have created trade disruptions and as concerns grow about a potential AI tech bubble. The article highlights an uneasy global economic calm shaped by US-China tensions and market uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A closed-door meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly escalated into a "shouting match," with Trump warning Zelensky to accept Russia's terms or face destruction by Vladimir Putin. According to the Financial Times, Trump adopted many of Putin's talking points, insisting Zelensky surrender the Donbas region. Trump also reportedly dismissed battlefield maps and refused Zelensky's request for Tomahawk missiles, citing U.S. needs. This contentious encounter highlights a significant divergence in strategy and support between the two leaders regarding the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that in today's multipolar world, great powers must choose between rigid alliances leading to conflict or managed accommodation, drawing lessons from Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai's diplomacy. It highlights that nuclear weapons make total war irrational, and technological interdependence creates immense costs for systemic rupture, compelling nations towards cooperation. The article suggests that despite current great power competition, powerful domestic constituencies in major economies have a strong interest in avoiding breakdown. The question remains whether contemporary leaders will demonstrate the statecraft needed to prevent catastrophic confrontation.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, "Nobody's Girl," reveals her profound fear of dying as a "sex slave" within Jeffrey Epstein's circle. The book, published after her death, also reiterates her claims of having sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including one "orgy" with Epstein and other underage girls. Prince Andrew, who settled with Giuffre in 2022 and recently relinquished royal titles, has consistently denied the allegations. The memoir provides disturbing details of Epstein's sex trafficking, including requirements for girls to appear "childlike" and instances of physical abuse, underscoring the horrific experiences endured by his victims.</p>

          <p>Millions across the U.S. participated in "No Kings" demonstrations, peacefully protesting President Donald Trump's policies and perceived overreach of presidential authority. The large turnout, exceeding previous rallies, signals a potential Democratic opportunity despite their lack of formal power in national politics. While the White House dismissed the protests, the scale and Trump's negative approval ratings hint at voter dissatisfaction. Democrats are currently engaged in a government shutdown standoff over healthcare subsidies, a strategy that carries risks but has so far seen public blame shared with Trump and Republicans, setting the stage for upcoming elections.</p>

The drone features split rudders and a recessed engine exhaust, suggesting a twin-engine design. Its underside coating might be counter-shaded camouflage to obscure its shape. While its exact purpose remains unclear, potential roles include a very large unmanned combat air vehicle, a stealth bomber, or a high-altitude reconnaissance drone, showcasing China's rapid advancement in combat aircraft development.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former US congressman George Santos described his recently commuted prison sentence as "disproportionate" but acknowledged receiving "a very large slice of humble pie." In his first interview since President Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, Santos, released less than three months into his term, expressed being "all politicked out." He called for a commutation for his former campaign staffer and indicated he would pay restitution "if it’s required of me by the law." Trump had also pardoned around 1,500 January 6 participants and former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich.</p>
