          <h2>Trump Administration Threatens High Tariffs on Imported Pharmaceuticals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 13:58:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 200% on pharmaceuticals imported into the United States, a move President Trump said could happen "very soon." However, he suggested a grace period of about a year and a half for drugmakers to adjust their operations. The pharmaceutical industry has previously warned that such levies could disrupt supply chains, deter U.S. investment, and ultimately increase drug costs for patients. This announcement represents the most significant development on this front since a national security investigation into pharmaceutical imports was launched in April.</p>

          <p>Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the Wimbledon semifinals with a dominant straight-sets victory over Britain's Cameron Norrie. The Spanish second seed showcased a masterclass performance, winning 6-2 6-3 6-3 in just one hour and 39 minutes. This victory marks Alcaraz's 23rd consecutive win on grass as he aims to become the fifth man in the Open era to win three successive Wimbledon titles.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top economic advisor for the White House, Stephen Miran, downplayed the risk of President Trump's tariffs causing significant inflation, comparing the likelihood to rare events like a meteor strike or a pandemic. Speaking on CNBC, Miran defended the administration's trade policies by pointing to a new report showing that prices of imported goods have actually fallen in recent months. Economists, however, argue that the full impact of the tariffs has been delayed by implementation postponements and company stockpiling, with many still expecting prices to rise.</p>

          <p>A new survey from Resumebuilder.com indicates that a significant number of managers are using AI tools like ChatGPT to make critical personnel decisions, including hiring, promotions, and layoffs. The study found that despite a third of these managers having no formal AI training, 65% rely on it for work-related choices. This growing dependence raises serious ethical and legal concerns, particularly around AI bias and the lack of human oversight in decisions that profoundly affect individuals' livelihoods, potentially exposing companies to discrimination lawsuits.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire has reached the edge of Marseille, France's second-largest city, forcing the closure of its main airport and the evacuation of dozens of residents. The blaze, reportedly sparked by a car fire, has consumed approximately 700 hectares and is being exacerbated by strong winds. The city's mayor described the situation as firefighters "waging guerrilla warfare" to protect homes, as large plumes of smoke filled the sky and authorities urged people to remain indoors.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Member of Parliament, has announced he will leave the Reform UK party to sit as an independent following media scrutiny of his business dealings. A Sunday Times report raised questions about whether two of his companies were eligible for £70,000 in government-backed Bounce Back loans received during the COVID-19 pandemic. While McMurdock insists his actions were compliant with the rules, he stated that becoming an independent will allow him to focus entirely on the interests of his constituents.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new spending legislation includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, a move that will likely affect the revenues of pharmaceutical companies. An analysis from Leerink Partners suggests that drugmakers with a greater focus on conditions like cystic fibrosis and HIV, such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead, have a higher financial exposure to the Medicaid market. While the full impact of the cuts, which are considered a "marginal negative" for the industry, will not be felt until after 2026, they represent a significant future challenge.
