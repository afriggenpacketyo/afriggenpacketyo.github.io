            <p>Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian has expressed concern about the impact of President Donald Trump's shifting trade policies on consumer confidence and bookings. Delta is scaling back its planned capacity expansion due to weaker-than-expected main cabin bookings and corporate travel demand. Bastian noted a decline in consumer and corporate confidence in recent weeks, leading to increased sales volatility. While international and premium travel remain relatively resilient, the overall outlook has become more uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic policies, particularly tariffs, are criticized for harming U.S. manufacturing rather than helping it. The author argues that Trump's approach of imposing tariffs on imports from various countries, including allies, is disrupting supply chains and creating uncertainty in financial markets. This is undermining the very manufacturers he aims to support. The article contrasts Trump's approach with the CHIPS and Science Act, which aimed to bolster U.S. manufacturing in key sectors through targeted investments and strategic alliances.</p>
