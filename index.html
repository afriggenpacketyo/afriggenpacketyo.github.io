          <p>The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has deteriorated rapidly, stemming from disagreements over Trump's spending bill and various unfulfilled promises. Musk publicly criticized the bill, leading to a heated exchange with Trump, who expressed disappointment in Musk's stance, while Musk claimed Trump would have lost the election without him. The feud extends beyond policy disagreements, involving a pulled NASA nomination for a Musk ally and a promised $100 million donation that never materialized, highlighting a deeper rift between the two former allies. This public falling out carries significant implications, particularly regarding clean energy credits and space policy, where Musk's business interests are directly impacted.

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant drop as tensions between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump escalated, with Trump threatening to withdraw government contracts from Musk's companies. The conflict arose from Musk's criticism of the spending bill, which lacks EV credits, leading to a public back-and-forth between the two figures on social media. Trump accused Musk of being upset about the potential loss of EV mandates, while Musk retorted that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The market reacted negatively to the escalating feud, reflecting investor concerns about the potential impact on Tesla's business and government relations.

          <p>The latest search for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal in 2007, has ended after three days of investigation near Praia da Luz. German investigators led the search, with Portuguese counterparts assisting, focusing on areas where the three-year-old vanished. While authorities are unlikely to disclose results for several weeks, initial observations suggest nothing significant was discovered during the search. The investigation involved combing land with pitchforks, digging with pick-axes and shovels, and using a digger to remove rubble from abandoned structures, marking another chapter in the high-profile missing persons case. The tone of the article is neutral, reflecting the lack of immediate findings and the somber nature of the case.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, once a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, has publicly criticized Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," citing concerns about excessive spending and its potential impact on the national debt. This shift marks a significant divergence from Musk's previous support for the administration, aligning him with fiscal conservatives in Congress who also oppose the legislation. Musk's criticism underscores a broader debate within the Republican party regarding fiscal responsibility and the national debt, with the White House defending the bill as essential for funding Trump's agenda.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit filed by Mexico against American gun manufacturers, claiming their products contribute to gun violence by being trafficked to Mexican drug cartels. The court cited the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which generally shields gunmakers from liability for misuse of firearms by third parties. Justice Kagan's opinion referenced the Twitter v. Taamneh case, stating that merely providing a good or service to all comers does not make a merchant liable if a bad actor uses their product for illegal purposes, unless the merchant actively promotes the crime. The ruling underscores the legal challenges in holding gun manufacturers accountable for the actions of criminals using their products, emphasizing the limitations imposed by existing legislation.

          <p>A California appeals court has ruled that holding a cellphone while driving, even for navigation purposes, violates the state's law against distracted driving. The court determined that merely looking at a map on the screen while holding the phone constitutes "operating" the device, thus breaking the law. This decision reverses a previous ruling that required active use or manipulation of the phone for a violation to occur, reinforcing the legislature's intent to reduce distracted driving. The ruling clarifies that only mounted phones operated with a single swipe are exempt, aiming to encourage drivers to keep their eyes on the road.

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit significantly narrowed in April, coinciding with President Donald Trump's tariff escalations, as imports plunged. The trade gap fell sharply from $140 billion to $61 billion, reflecting the impact of trade barriers taking effect. While Trump touts tariffs as a means to slash the nation's trade deficit, economists argue it reflects the consumer-driven nature of the U.S. economy. The outlook remains uncertain due to Trump's fluctuating tariff policies and anxious consumer sentiment, although key economic measures like unemployment and job growth have largely defied downturn fears.

          <p>Democrats and civil rights groups have strongly criticized President Donald Trump’s travel ban on 12 countries, labeling it “reckless” and “discriminatory.” Critics argue that the ban, which includes countries like Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, and Haiti, is a distraction from Trump’s controversial tax bill. Some Republicans have also expressed disagreement, with concerns raised about the inclusion of Haiti given its humanitarian crisis. The ban has been condemned by organizations like Amnesty International and CAIR, who view it as discriminatory and ineffective for national security. The author's tone reflects the negative reaction and the broader debate over immigration policy. </p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a ban on travel to the U.S. from 12 countries, citing national security risks, and imposed partial travel restrictions on seven additional countries. The ban, set to take effect on Monday, includes exemptions for lawful permanent residents, government employees, and athletes participating in major sporting events. The White House stated the restrictions are to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, but critics have condemned the ban as discriminatory.

          <p>Apple suffered a setback in its legal battle with Epic Games, as a U.S. appeals court rejected Apple's plea to halt mandated changes to its App Store. This ruling could cost Apple "substantial sums" and analysts estimate that 2% of Apple's earnings per share, 10% of App Store revenue and 3% of overall revenue for its important services division are at risk if the ruling is upheld. The legal battle, along with other factors such as higher tariffs and Google's legal feud with the Justice Department, has made Apple a worrisome position in recent months. However, despite the challenges, the article suggests that Apple's strong user base and high-quality products provide reason enough to maintain confidence in the stock.

Both Ukrainian and Russian forces are attempting to capture advantageous positions in the border area for shelling and operational control, with Russia potentially targeting the strategically important village of Yunakivka.

          <p>President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" proposes several tax repeals and cuts, including making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, and creating "Trump savings accounts" for newborns. The bill also aims to raise the SALT cap and repeal federal excise taxes on gun silencers and tanning services, while reducing or eliminating green energy tax credits. Republican fiscal hawks have raised concerns about the bill's potential impact on the deficit, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating it could add $2.4 trillion over the next decade.

Mexico's government had argued that the "flood" of illegal guns across the border is a result of "deliberate" practices by US firms.
