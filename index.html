          <h2>At Least 16 Dead in Pakistan Residential Building Collapse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:43:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has resulted in at least 16 fatalities, with search and rescue operations ongoing for a second day. Officials confirmed that ten more bodies were recovered overnight, adding to the initial six found. Rescue efforts are complicated by the building's location on a narrow street, which hinders the use of heavy machinery, as teams search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped. Such incidents are common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards and a lack of regulation often lead to tragic structural failures.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Member of Parliament for the Reform UK party, has lost the party whip following allegations of improper business conduct. The party's chief whip stated that McMurdock "removed the party whip from himself" while an investigation into claims published by the Sunday Times proceeds. The allegations pertain to business activities during the pandemic, before he was elected. This development reduces Reform UK's number of sitting MPs to four, marking the second instance of a 2024-elected Reform MP losing the whip.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google X executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage difficult emotions like anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule suggests allowing oneself a minute and a half for the physiological response to an emotion to pass before consciously choosing to shift focus. Gawdat, who began writing about happiness after the tragic death of his son, explains that this brief period allows stress hormones to flush from the system. He pairs this with a three-question framework to challenge negative thoughts, promoting a more fulfilled and resilient mindset.</p>

          <p>Democratic Governor Josh Stein of North Carolina has vetoed four bills passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, including three that aimed to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in state government and schools. Stein criticized the legislation as "mean-spirited" and a distraction from more pressing issues like the state budget. The fourth bill combined age verification rules for pornography websites with controversial provisions, such as banning state-funded gender-affirming care for prisoners. The bills now return to the General Assembly, where Republicans are one vote short of a supermajority needed to override the vetoes.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the Danish emphasis on hobbies for well-being, Emory University professor Marina Cooley undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different activities, from pottery to pickleball. She found that dedicating time to these pursuits fundamentally changed her life, helping her overcome doomscrolling, reduce loneliness, and redefine self-care beyond passive consumption. Cooley argues that engaging in hobbies forces individuals to set boundaries with work and other obligations, leading to better balance and confidence. The experience convinced her that actively pursuing hobbies is a key secret to happiness, rather than something to be postponed until balance is found.</p>

While Combs was convicted on lesser charges, his acquittal on the most serious counts demonstrates how existing laws are ill-equipped for such complex dynamics, often forcing prosecutors to use trafficking charges. The author suggests that without better legal frameworks for domestic abuse, powerful and wealthy individuals can exploit loopholes.

Advances in emergency response, such as widespread CPR and portable defibrillators, along with improved hospital treatments like angioplasty and stents, have also saved millions of lives.

          <p>This article recounts a user's startling experience with Google's Gemini AI, which drafted a deeply personal and accurate birthday letter for a friend by accessing the user's files in Google Drive. The author explores the implications of this new wave of hyper-personalized AI, which mines personal data from emails, documents, and calendars to create highly individualized content. While this capability can be incredibly useful, it also raises significant privacy concerns. The piece notes that Google, with its vast ecosystem of user data, is uniquely positioned to lead this shift toward bespoke AI assistants.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the cultural and commercial power of the British monarchy's Royal Warrants, the official seal of approval granted to goods and services. As the Prince and Princess of Wales prepare to grant their own warrants, the article notes the wide range of endorsed products, from luxury cars to chimney sweeps. The author suggests that this royal endorsement serves as a powerful marketing tool, conveying quality and class, particularly to American consumers. The piece humorously connects this influence to a recent poll showing a surprising number of young Americans would favor being ruled by the British monarch.</p>

          <p>An arsonist set fire to the front door of a synagogue in Melbourne, Australia, while about 20 people were inside for a Shabbat dinner. The worshippers were able to evacuate safely through a rear exit, and no one was injured in the attack. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese denounced the incident as a "cowardly" act of antisemitism that has no place in Australian society. Police are investigating the attack, which comes amid a rising wave of antisemitic incidents in the country since the start of the Israel-Gaza war.</p>

          <p>Following her third-round loss at Wimbledon, British tennis player Emma Raducanu criticized the accuracy of the tournament's new electronic line-calling system. Raducanu pointed to several "dodgy" calls during her match against Aryna Sabalenka, stating she and other players do not fully trust the technology. Wimbledon replaced human line judges with the automated system this year, but players have raised concerns about both its accuracy and the volume of the automated calls. An All England Club official defended the system, noting it was implemented partly in response to player requests for more accuracy.</p>

          <p>A group of eight OPEC+ nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, has agreed to a larger-than-anticipated oil production hike of 548,000 barrels per day for August. This move continues the gradual reversal of voluntary supply cuts that were implemented to stabilize the market. The OPEC Secretariat cited a steady global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals as the reason for the accelerated increase. This decision comes as the producers unwind a 2.2 million barrel-per-day voluntary cut, signaling confidence in global oil demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article profiles the Rev. William Barber and his Poor People's Campaign, a national movement using nonviolent protest and moral framing to challenge systemic inequality and what he calls "policy murder." Rooted in the tradition of Moral Mondays, the movement organizes diverse "fusion" coalitions to protest policies that harm the poor and vulnerable. The piece explores whether this prophetic approach, which indicts the moral failings of the political system, can be effective in the current political climate. It questions if the movement can scale its impact beyond witnessing to achieve concrete policy change.</p>

          <p>Michigan's tart cherry industry, which produces 75% of the U.S. crop and is central to the state's agrotourism, is facing a severe crisis.

Additionally, rising land prices due to development, labor shortages, and uncertain tariffs are squeezing the multi-generational family farms that dominate the industry. The interconnectedness of specialty crop farming means the struggles of the cherry industry have a domino effect on the wider regional economy.</p>

The research suggests the drug may bolster the immune system's anti-tumor response by strengthening dendritic cells, which are crucial for identifying and attacking cancer. These "intelligence agent" cells can become depleted as a tumor progresses, and the study found that sildenafil could help reverse this impairment. The findings, published in the journal Nature, are being hailed as a potential new strategy for tumor immunotherapy.</p>

The conflict has escalated tensions, and with Iran now limiting international inspectors' access, the situation may evolve into a perpetual cat-and-mouse game.
