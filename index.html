          <p>Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro stated that the band is "forever destroyed" following an onstage fight between him and frontman Perry Farrell. Navarro cited the incident as the end of any potential for the band to perform together again, expressing disappointment over the collapse of their improved dynamic after he had returned to the band after a long COVID absence. The fight, which involved Farrell shoving and punching Navarro, stemmed from Farrell's frustration with the sound levels during a Boston concert. Following the incident, Jane's Addiction canceled their tour, citing Farrell's mental health difficulties.</p>

The ruling reinstates the USIP board and allows the agency to resume its peacebuilding activities.

          <p>President Trump is pressuring major companies to absorb the costs of his tariffs, rather than passing them on to consumers. This comes as companies like Walmart and Mattel signal that they may need to raise prices due to the persistent global trade war. The White House insists that foreign countries should bear the burden of the tariffs. The president has increasingly criticized companies for trying to mitigate the financial fallout from the tariffs, which economists believe fall hardest on U.S. companies and consumers.</p>

          <p>Falling behind on a payday loan can lead to it being sent to collections, resulting in increased fees, damaged credit, and potential legal action. It's crucial to understand your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and request debt validation. Negotiating with the debt collector to settle for a lower amount is often possible. Seeking help from a credit counselor or debt relief expert can provide guidance and protect your rights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Moody's downgrade of the US government's credit rating, citing rising debt, has driven up borrowing costs. The interest rate on the US government's long-term debt surpassed 5%, the highest level since October 2023. The downgrade underscores concerns about the rising debt and a lack of progress toward resolving it. A tax-and-spending bill advancing through Congress would add trillions to the US government's debt. (not investment advice)</p>
