          <p>Key inflation readings and Treasury auctions are set to challenge the bond market this week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release consumer and producer price reports for May, with economists anticipating modest increases. Any unexpected surge in inflation could unsettle investors concerned about inflationary pressures stemming from tariffs. The Treasury Department will also sell $39 billion in 10-year notes and $22 billion in 30-year bonds, providing insights into investor demand for Treasurys amidst rising debt and deficits. These factors combined could significantly impact the economy and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to use "heavy force" against protesters at the military parade in Washington, D.C., scheduled for this weekend. The parade, honoring the Army's 250th anniversary and coinciding with Trump's birthday, is expected to feature tanks, aircraft, and thousands of soldiers. Trump stated that those protesting "hate our country" and will face significant opposition. While the Secret Service anticipates nine small protests, they do not expect violence, though the National Guard will be activated but not armed. Progressive groups plan to hold "No Kings" protests in Philadelphia and elsewhere, outside of Washington.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services proposed a budget for the 2026 fiscal year that consolidates divisions and establishes a new "Administration for a Healthy America" (AHA). This new agency would take over funds for the CDC's chronic disease and global health centers, as well as some NIH institutes, cutting the CDC's budget significantly. AHA aims to take a "root cause" approach to chronic disease prevention, but critics argue the cuts will destabilize public health systems and jeopardize decades of progress. The budget also reduces NIH funding and dissolves agencies like SAMHSA and HRSA, reflecting reforms to address healthcare spending and improve health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Vaihingen an der Enz, Germany, unearthed the grave of a woman and young girl dating back to 400 B.C. The bodies, adorned with Celtic-era jewelry, were arranged in a way that suggests they were "dumped" rather than respectfully buried. Historians speculate they may have suffocated due to gases in the pit. The discovery was part of a larger excavation yielding 1,100 artifacts, including other graves, longhouses, ceramics, tools, and jewelry, offering insights into the region's history dating back 7,000 years.</p>

Hegseth stated ICE has the right to safely conduct operations in any state, while critics like Rep. Betty McCollum questioned the suitability of Marines for domestic law enforcement.

          <p>The Trump administration argued in a court filing that it complied with a court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges in Tennessee, following legal battles where the administration initially claimed it was unable to return him. His lawyers, however, maintain that the case is not over and seek accountability for the government's previous violations of court orders. The Justice Department intends to file a motion to dismiss the case, calling Abrego Garcia's attorneys' request to continue the case "desperate and disappointing."</p>

          <p>A major international study has revealed a two-way relationship between screen time and the emotional and social well-being of children. The study, analyzing data from nearly 300,000 children, found that increased use of devices like TVs, tablets, and gaming consoles is associated with a higher risk of aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Conversely, children with existing social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. Time spent on gaming consoles was particularly linked to emotional problems, suggesting that parents should ensure screen time does not interfere with sleep and physical activity.</p>

          <p>Hummingbird feeders, while intended to help these birds, can become deadly if not properly maintained. Sugar water left out too long can spoil and grow harmful microbes, leading to infections in hummingbirds. A common infection is candida, which causes swollen tongues and starvation. To prevent this, feeders should be cleaned every two to three days with hot water, or more frequently in hot weather, using a mixture of vinegar and water. Planting native wildflowers is also a good way to support local hummingbird populations.</p>
