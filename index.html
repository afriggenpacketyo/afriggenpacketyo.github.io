          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers and their ownership group, Guggenheim Partners, are facing a federal civil rights complaint alleging their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives constitute unlawful discrimination. Filed by the conservative nonprofit America First Legal, the lawsuit claims the organizations' employment practices violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by giving preferential treatment based on race and sex. The complaint specifically targets programs and Business Resource Groups geared toward women and people of color, arguing they create discriminatory classifications. This legal challenge comes amid a broader national rollback of DEI initiatives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered a 30-day review of U.S. policy towards Cuba with the goal of strengthening existing sanctions. The directive instructs top cabinet officials to examine Cuba's treatment of dissidents and to find ways to restrict financial transactions that benefit the Cuban government and military. The review also considers shutting down all tourism and limiting educational tours to the island, signaling a significant reversal of the eased relations established under previous administrations. This move aligns with the administration's broader strategy of applying increased pressure on the Cuban government.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office has identified Kevin Devine, 54, as the 18th victim of the deadly Eaton fire. Devine, an actor and substitute teacher, had been missing since the fire ignited in January, with his remains discovered in April near his Altadena apartment. He had last spoken to his mother on the night of the fire, reassuring her he was safe before he was last seen by his landlord. His death adds to the toll of the devastating fires that swept through Los Angeles County, which have claimed at least 30 lives in total.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government is confronting a significant internal rebellion over its proposed changes to welfare benefits, particularly the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite holding a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is undertaking a major persuasion effort to convince dozens of his own MPs to support the reforms. Critics within the party are concerned that tightening eligibility criteria for disability benefits is a wrong-headed approach driven by fiscal targets rather than need. The controversy highlights deep ideological divisions within Labour, with a crucial vote expected to be very close.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session, known as a 'vote-a-rama,' on President Trump's massive domestic policy bill as Republicans aim for passage before a July 4 deadline. The legislation, which includes increased spending on border security and defense offset by cuts to healthcare and social programs, has been a key focus of Trump's second term. Democrats are using the procedural tool to force votes on numerous controversial amendments, putting Republicans on the record ahead of midterm elections. The process follows a nearly 16-hour reading of the bill, highlighting the deep partisan divide over the legislation.</p>

After the shooting, Simmons allegedly carjacked a vehicle and fled but was later apprehended. Simmons, a federal inmate facing bank robbery charges, will now also be charged with first-degree murder in the officer's death, according to the local district attorney.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine works by inhibiting an enzyme called TBK1, which helps prevent inflammation and the aging of multiple organs. This discovery illuminates the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The findings could also pave the way for new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise on the body.</p>

The review will address issues such as low take-up of shared leave and the fact that many fathers cannot afford to take paternity leave due to low statutory pay.

The policy, which reverses a previous allowance for trans individuals to serve openly, deems a history of gender dysphoria incompatible with military standards. The article follows the personal stories of decorated officers like Army Maj. Kara Corcoran, who now face potential involuntary separation from careers they have dedicated their lives to.

          <p>President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' contains sweeping changes that would directly affect the lives of many Americans, from social program recipients to green energy workers. The legislation proposes significant cuts to programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, which could cause millions to lose food aid and health insurance. Simultaneously, the bill phases out green energy tax incentives, threatening jobs in the solar and wind industries. While provisions like eliminating federal taxes on tips and overtime are popular with some groups, the broader impacts on social safety nets and specific economic sectors are causing widespread concern.</p>

          <p>Senator Ron Johnson, a key Republican and fiscal conservative from Wisconsin, has indicated that he will vote in favor of President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill. Previously critical of the bill's impact on the federal debt, Johnson's support provides a boost to GOP leadership as they push for passage. He stated that while he doesn't like the bill, it is 'about as good as we can get' and necessary to prevent a massive tax increase that would occur if the 2017 tax cuts expire. Johnson's vote was seen as a crucial get for the bill's proponents, who are operating with a very slim majority.</p>

The request comes as California faces the start of fire season with its specialized National Guard firefighting unit at just 40% of its normal staffing levels. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization of the troops for immigration-related unrest, supports the move, urging the president to 'stop the political theater' and return the Guard to their critical duties.

          <p>A new report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical and logistical obstacles are a primary reason for declining childhood vaccination rates in the UK. Rather than being driven solely by vaccine hesitancy, parents face challenges such as difficulty booking GP appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders and information. With no childhood vaccine meeting the 95% WHO target since 2022, preventable diseases like measles are re-emerging. The report calls for better support, easier access, and improved digital tools to help families keep their children's immunizations up to date.</p>

However, his approach is highly controversial, blending mainstream concerns about processed foods with a history of promoting unfounded health conspiracies and dismantling parts of the public health apparatus. He has targeted food additives and backed state-level regulations, but has also drawn intense criticism for his skepticism towards vaccines and for appointing a noted vaccine skeptic to review autism data.

Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the Amazon marketplace, with its two million sellers, helps keep prices down as many sellers will absorb costs to gain market share.
