          <p>The Israeli military announced the recovery of the bodies of Judi Weinstein-Haggai and Gad Haggai, two hostages who were taken during the October 7th attack. The couple, in their 70s, were found in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza and their bodies were returned to Israel for identification. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences to the family, vowing to continue efforts to bring all hostages home, both living and deceased.

          <p>Serena Williams revealed that winning the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant was her most important career moment. Williams, who was nine weeks pregnant at the time, recalled the physical challenges she faced, including fatigue and breathlessness. She kept her pregnancy a secret from most people, only confiding in her sister Venus, whom she defeated in the final. Williams humorously remembered having to rely on aces and winners to shorten points due to her condition, reflecting on the surreal experience of competing at such a high level while pregnant. </p>

          <p>The government announced that from September 2026, any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible and save parents £500 a year, potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated £1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, and has pledged £13 million to food charities to combat food poverty. While the announcement has been largely welcomed, some argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective at reducing child poverty.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in the Erin Patterson mushroom trial suggested that photos found on her phone showed her weighing wild fungi, implying she was measuring a fatal dose for her guests. Patterson is accused of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder another using death cap mushrooms in a beef Wellington meal. Patterson has pleaded not guilty, claiming it was a tragic accident. The court was shown images from Patterson's phone depicting mushrooms being weighed, and prosecutors allege she knowingly foraged death caps days before the lunch.</p>

          <p>The US-China trade truce is showing signs of unraveling as both countries accuse each other of violating the agreement to cut tariffs. The US is frustrated by China's stalling on export license approvals for rare earths, while China points to US curbs on chip design software. Despite the tensions, a call between Trump and Xi is anticipated to address the deadlock. The lack of clarity over Trump's tariffs after a US trade court ruling adds to the uncertainty, as does the diversion of resources from US firms' ability to achieve technological dominance over China.

It is uncertain whether these medicines could harm an unborn baby, and they may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, particularly in overweight or obese individuals. The MHRA recommends using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before attempting pregnancy.
