          <p>India stated it conducted military strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" following a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 people were killed. The Indian Ministry of Defence emphasized that the strikes were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, with no Pakistani military facilities targeted. Pakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused India of violating its territorial sovereignty and attacking its civilian population, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed a strong response, raising concerns about escalating tensions between the two nations. Operation Sindoor refers to a red- or orange-colored powder mostly worn by Indian Hindu married women.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, dubbed "Operation Sindoor". The Indian defense ministry framed the strikes as a commitment to hold those responsible for the April 22 attack accountable, while Pakistan has denied involvement and described the strikes as unprovoked. Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone, which India has yet to respond to, and reports indicate civilian casualties on both sides. The article provides context on the escalating tensions and the history of Kashmir as a flashpoint between India and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>As Russia commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War II, the nation is drawing parallels between that conflict and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Historical re-enactments and nationalistic displays emphasize Russia's role as both victor and victim, while the official narrative portrays the war in Ukraine as a continuation of the fight against Nazism. However, this narrative contrasts with the reality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been widely condemned as an act of aggression. The article explores how the Kremlin uses the memory of World War II to unite the population and justify its current military actions.</p>

The New York Times article notes that this attack represents a significant escalation, as it targeted Pakistani territory outside the contested Kashmir region. Global leaders have warned of dire consequences if the two sides fail to de-escalate, and India is bracing for a response from Pakistan.</p>

          <p>A new bill in England and Wales proposes that criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings could face an additional two years in prison. The bill aims to ensure that offenders cannot "opt out" of justice and that victims' families receive a moment of recognition and reparation. The legislation was initiated after several high-profile cases where killers did not attend sentencing, prompting calls for change from victims' families. The Justice Minister expressed gratitude to the families who campaigned for the new law, emphasizing that justice is not optional.</p>
