          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk, once allies, have engaged in a public feud, with Trump threatening to revoke government contracts and Musk suggesting Trump couldn't have won the election without him. The conflict began with Trump criticizing Musk's stance on the Republican tax-cut and spending bill, escalating into online exchanges. Musk also alluded to Trump's name appearing in the Jeffrey Epstein files, further intensifying the dispute. This public falling out has drawn reactions from various figures and impacted Tesla's stock value, creating uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment for Tesla under the Trump Administration.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is leading to a surge of cheap exports, raising concerns among Asian economies about squeezed local industries. However, economists suggest this influx of low-cost Chinese goods could alleviate inflation for consumers in other economies. This development could provide central banks with some breathing room as they balance lowering living costs and stimulating growth amidst rising trade tensions. Nomura predicts that emerging growth risks and subdued inflation may lead to rate cuts across Asia, decoupling from the Federal Reserve's policies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a legal challenge against President Trump's recent directive to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend the college, calling it illegal retaliation. The university argues that the action is a vendetta against Harvard and circumvents a previous court order. The legal battle has created uncertainty for admitted international students, who are now unsure if they will be able to attend the school. The situation has also affected prospective students, who are starting to look at universities outside of the U.S.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing annually due to lost, damaged, or missing police evidence. Data from the Crown Prosecution Service indicates over 30,000 prosecutions failed between 2020 and 2024, including serious violent and sexual offences. Former police officers attribute the issue to overwhelming amounts of evidence and resource cuts following the loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service in 2012. The increasing proportion of cases failing due to unavailable evidence raises concerns about justice and public safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries, has been met with concern amid a series of draconian immigration restrictions. Since taking office, Trump has suspended the asylum system, ended temporary legal residency for thousands, and moved to restrict student visas. The new ban is likely to face legal challenges and disproportionately affect those seeking refuge. Experts suggest the ban is more likely to stand up to legal challenges compared to Trump's first travel ban in 2017.</p>

          <p>Travis Decker, the father accused of murdering his three young daughters near a Washington campground, lacked mental health resources and struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, his ex-wife's attorney told ABC News. Paityn Decker, 9; Evelyn Decker, 8; and Olivia Decker, 5, were killed after they left home for a "planned visitation" with Decker at approximately 5 p.m. on May 30, officials said. The courts didn't fail these girls. It wasn't the judge and it wasn't Whitney; it was our system, and if somebody would have provided Travis with the help that he needed, those girls would be alive."</p>

          <p>North Korea has launched a warship two weeks after it was damaged during an earlier launch attempt, in an incident that drew harsh criticism from the country's leader Kim Jong Un. Kim, who witnessed the warship tipping over during the first launch attempt, criticised the incident as a "criminal act" that "severely damaged the [country's] dignity and pride". The ship is expected to be fully restored before a ruling party meeting sometime this month, KCNA added.</p>

          <h2>Musk says SpaceX will decommission Dragon spacecraft</h2>

          <p>Elon Musk on Thursday said that his company SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft "immediately" because of threats by President Donald Trump to cancel government contracts with Musk's businesses. Musk's initial tweet about decommissioning Dragon responded to a Truth Social post by Trump, who wrote, "The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts."</p>

          <p>The sun rises every morning. Spring turns to summer. Water is wet. Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s relationship has ended with a tweet about Jeffrey Epstein. This was inevitable. When Elon Musk attached himself to Trump during Trump’s presidential transition last fall, there was great speculation that these two massive egos would, eventually, clash and that their strategic partnership would flame out spectacularly.</p>
