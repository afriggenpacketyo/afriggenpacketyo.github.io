The bill, which faces opposition from Democrats, required lengthy negotiations to secure enough votes from conservative senators concerned about deficit reduction. The legislation extends tax cuts and funds border security and defense, offset by cuts to programs like Medicaid. Trump also used the opportunity to comment on foreign policy, suggesting Iran might have joined the Abraham Accords. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Jensen Huang recently sold approximately $15 million in shares as part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 6 million shares by year-end. The significant stock sales by executives and insiders have been prompted by the share price surging above $150. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States is critically vulnerable due to China's dominance over the rare earth minerals supply chain, which is essential for modern technology and defense. Despite years of awareness, the U.S. has failed to create a coherent strategy to counter this dependency, allowing Beijing to weaponize its control through export restrictions. Recent trade talks have offered a temporary six-month reprieve on some export licenses, but this does not solve the underlying structural problem. The author contends that the U.S. must treat critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rising popularity of "Love Island USA" has been accompanied by intense cyberbullying of its contestants, prompting the show to issue a plea for kindness. This situation draws parallels to the UK version of the franchise, which faced scrutiny and a parliamentary inquiry following the deaths of former contestants. While producers say they have enhanced mental health support, providing psychological services before, during, and after filming, experts note the inherent conflict between producing dramatic television and ensuring contestant well-being. The article explores the immense pressures of overnight fame and the ongoing challenges of reality TV's duty of care.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary signals a significant shift in the party, particularly within the Jewish community. As an outspoken critic of Israel, his success in a city with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel shows that such a stance is no longer a political disqualifier for many voters. His win reflects a growing divide, especially among younger, progressive Jews, over Israeli policy in Gaza, while also stoking fears among others about rising antisemitism. The election has become a focal point for the evolving relationship between American Jews and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>An intense, early-summer heatwave is affecting large parts of Europe, with temperatures breaking records for June. Spain recorded a new national high of 46Â°C (114.8Â°F), while Italy has placed 21 cities, including Rome and Venice, on high alert. The extreme heat is expected to persist, with London predicted to reach 35Â°C (95Â°F). Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such heatwaves to human-driven climate change, and officials are warning of heightened wildfire risks and impacts on biodiversity, such as struggling bird populations.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that Iran could restart enriching uranium in "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent US military strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. Grossi believes the damage to the sites was significant but not total, and that Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to quickly resume its program. His comments contrast with the Trump administration's claims of having "totally obliterated" the facilities, and he emphasized the need for inspectors to regain access.</p>
