          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees in several divisions, including search, ads, commerce, marketing, research, and communications, as part of ongoing efforts to reduce headcount since the 2023 layoffs. The "voluntary exit program" applies to U.S.-based employees, with some teams also mandating office returns for remote workers. Google's finance chief previously stated that cost-cutting would be a top priority as the company increases spending on AI infrastructure in 2025. Google is also revamping its internal learning platform to focus on AI tools, shifting away from less essential programs, and employees not meeting expectations are encouraged to consider the buyout, while those performing well are urged to stay. Optimism surrounding the buyouts is tempered by the context of job losses and corporate restructuring.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that current U.S. tariff levels on Chinese imports will not change, even without a finalized trade deal between Washington and Beijing.

The announcement follows high-level trade talks in London, but a comprehensive agreement remains elusive. The stability of tariffs offers some predictability for businesses amidst ongoing trade tensions, although the absence of further concessions may limit potential economic gains. </p>

Unlike 2020, Trump acted swiftly, facing objections from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is suing over the move. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the action aims to prevent a repeat of the 2020 unrest in Minnesota, where the governor waited to call in the National Guard. During the 2020 riots, Trump deferred more to governors, some of whom struggled to balance law and order with sympathy for protestors, but this time Trump's administration is emphasizing a firm stance against violence.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. edged up slightly in May, driven by higher grocery prices that offset lower gasoline prices, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists anticipate that President Trump's tariff policies will exert upward pressure on consumer prices in the coming months, with some evidence of their impact already emerging. While the monthly inflation rate showed a modest increase, economists suggest that the underlying trend points towards inflation returning to the Federal Reserve's target. However, the full effect of tariffs is expected to become more apparent in the summer and fall. (not investment advice)</p>
