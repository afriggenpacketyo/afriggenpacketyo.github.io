          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested a suspect in connection with recent ransomware attacks that caused significant disruptions at major European airports, including London Heathrow, Dublin, and Berlin. The cyberattacks targeted software from Collins Aerospace, forcing airport staff to revert to manual check-in and baggage processes, which led to numerous delays and cancellations. The suspect, a man in his 40s, was detained in southern England as the investigation continues. Officials noted a significant increase in cybercrime targeting the aviation sector, which relies on interconnected systems for its operations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged nearly 80% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal comes as the company renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a major future source of lithium for electric vehicle batteries. The potential deal would give the U.S. government direct ownership in a critical mineral supply chain, mirroring a previous investment in rare earth miner MP Materials. The move aims to reduce risk for taxpayers while supporting a project vital to U.S. interests. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A body language expert observed that the international audience at the UN General Assembly reacted to President Trump's latest speech with silence, a stark contrast to the laughter his 2018 address provoked. According to the analysis, this shift suggests that global leaders no longer view his rhetoric as mere amusement but as a serious reflection of his global influence and unpredictable actions. The expert noted that Trump's physical presence and mannerisms are designed to project dominance and an 'alpha' status. The muted reaction from delegates indicates a changed political atmosphere where his pronouncements are now weighed with significant concern for the future.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Rolex's CEO questioning whether the company's hosting of President Trump at the U.S. Open was an attempt to gain favor and secure exemptions from new U.S. tariffs. The inquiry comes after Trump announced a 39% levy on Swiss exports, which is expected to significantly impact the country's renowned watchmaking industry. Warren's letter suggests Rolex may be following a pattern seen with other companies, like Apple and Nvidia, that have allegedly cultivated relationships with the president to influence policy. The senator expressed concern over the timing of the event and its potential implications for fair trade practices.</p>

          <p>Returning to his show after a suspension by ABC, Jimmy Kimmel delivered an emotional monologue addressing the controversy surrounding his comments on the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the killing or to blame a specific group, expressing understanding for those who were offended.

          <p>During his address to the UN General Assembly, President Trump directed harsh criticism toward Russia for its role in the Ukraine war while adopting a comparatively softer tone on China. He threatened Russia with powerful new tariffs if it does not agree to a peace deal, identifying China and India as primary funders of the conflict through their oil purchases. This focus on Moscow, coupled with his administration's efforts to end the war in Ukraine, has led some observers to suggest Washington may be pulling back from its more confrontational stance toward Beijing. The shift in rhetoric could signal a realignment of U.S. foreign policy priorities.</p>

          <p>This opinion article characterizes President Trump's speech at the UN General Assembly as an embarrassing and unfiltered rant filled with personal grievances and attacks on international norms. The author notes that Trump strayed from his prepared remarks to complain about a malfunctioning teleprompter, a stalled escalator, and losing a bid to renovate the UN headquarters over two decades ago. The speech included sharp criticism of European migration policies, insults directed at London's mayor, and a denial of climate change science. The performance is framed as a reflection of a president unrestrained by diplomatic conventions during his second term.</p>

In response, Khan stated that he appears to be "living rent-free inside Donald Trump's head" and highlighted London's success as a multicultural city.

Other changes, such as new restrictions on how benefits are calculated, could affect millions more households.

An earlier deal could secure billions in additional revenue for the NFL, potentially increasing the salary cap and team valuations.

The review praises the novel's depiction of how these repressive forces can lead to destructive outcomes, particularly after Wonder has a queer encounter that sends him spiraling.

A fiduciary has a legal duty to act in their client's best interest, whereas other professionals may only be held to a "suitability" standard, meaning their recommendations only need to be appropriate, not necessarily optimal. Working with a non-fiduciary can lead to being sold high-cost products that benefit the advisor more than the client.

          <p>The Kremlin has responded to a shift in rhetoric from U.S. President Trump, stating that Russia has no choice but to continue its war in Ukraine. The comments came after Trump suggested that Ukraine, with European support, could win back all of its occupied territory, labeling Russia a "paper tiger." A Kremlin spokesperson rejected this characterization and asserted that the military operation would continue to achieve its goals. This development is part of a broader context that includes new Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian petrochemical facilities and EU discussions about imposing higher tariffs on Russian oil.</p>

          <p>A wildfire near the town of Paia on the Hawaiian island of Maui has forced urgent evacuations, with emergency sirens activated to alert residents. The fire, which grew to over 100 acres, prompted officials to go door-to-door to ensure people left the area, which is surrounded by dry brush. The incident has evoked memories of the deadly 2023 Lahaina fire, which destroyed the town on the opposite side of the island. Unlike the Lahaina disaster, where high winds grounded helicopters, two helicopters were deployed to help fight this new blaze, and the American Red Cross has established evacuation centers for displaced residents.</p>

          <p>A cost comparison highlights the financial benefits of driving an electric vehicle like a Tesla over a traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, such as a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Due to higher efficiency, charging a Tesla is often significantly cheaper than fueling an ICE vehicle, with savings becoming more pronounced the more miles are driven. The analysis is based on average residential electricity rates for home charging, which is where the majority of EV charging occurs. The article illustrates that even for average monthly mileage, the fuel savings for a Tesla owner can be substantial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung has initiated a campaign to amend the constitution to allow future presidents to serve two consecutive four-year terms, replacing the current single five-year term limit. Proponents argue the change would create political stability by aligning presidential and parliamentary election cycles, fostering policy continuity. The reform, which requires a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, faces likely opposition from conservative parties. The proposal also includes introducing a run-off round in presidential elections and updating constitutional language on minority rights and relations with North Korea.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese technology companies are choosing to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange as a strategic move to fund their overseas expansion plans. Firms such as China Micro Semicon and Mech-Mind Robotics are leveraging the city's status as an international financial hub to connect with global markets and capital. This trend has led to a significant increase in fundraising, with around 60 companies raising a collective US$18.5 billion in Hong Kong so far this year. Analysts expect this pattern to continue as mainland tech firms pursue greater international presence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's home secretary has ordered an urgent review into the cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments following a BBC investigation. The report found that some individuals were being taken on long-distance journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment that reportedly cost £600. While asylum seekers receive a weekly bus pass, taxis are booked for other necessary travel without public transport being presented as an alternative. The practice has drawn criticism for being a questionable and wasteful use of taxpayer money amid a strained asylum system.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump as productive, following a notable shift in Trump's public stance on the war with Russia. After their discussion, Trump posted on social media that he believes Ukraine is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back," a significant pivot from his previous skepticism about Kyiv's military prospects. Zelenskyy noted that Trump now seems better informed about the details of the conflict. While the statement was met with cautious optimism in Kyiv, it remains unclear if this rhetorical change will translate into a concrete U.S. policy pivot.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp in Texas, plans to partially reopen next summer, one year after a catastrophic flood on the Guadalupe River killed 27 campers and counselors. The owners announced that the destroyed low-lying area of the camp will remain closed, but an undamaged section will welcome campers again. The decision comes after the state passed tougher camp safety laws, spurred by the tragedy, which mandate emergency plans and prohibit cabins in dangerous flood zones. The camp also plans to build a memorial to honor the victims, including the owner who died attempting to rescue campers.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the European Union is harming its own economic and social interests by treating China as an adversary. The author points to the EU's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), a deal that would address trade deficit concerns by providing greater market access, as a prime example of this self-defeating approach. The suspension of the deal, stemming from a dispute over sanctions, is seen as counterproductive. The article also contends that this confrontational stance will slow the EU's green energy transition by obstructing the adoption of affordable Chinese clean energy technologies.</p>
