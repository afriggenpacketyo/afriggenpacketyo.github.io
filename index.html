          <p>A US federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's policy limiting passport gender markers to male or female.  The judge ruled that the policy likely violates the constitutional rights of transgender and non-binary individuals by discriminating based on sex. This decision temporarily allows the continuation of issuing passports with an 'X' gender designation, a practice implemented under the Biden administration. The Trump administration's response to the ruling was immediate and highly critical.</p>
