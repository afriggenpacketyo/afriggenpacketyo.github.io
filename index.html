          <h2>Deadly Boat Accident in Nigeria Claims Dozens of Lives</h2>

          <p>A devastating boat accident in Nigeria's north-central Niger State has claimed the lives of at least 29 people, with rescuers managing to save 50 individuals, while two remain unaccounted for. The overloaded vessel, carrying over 100 passengers, capsized after striking a submerged tree stump near the Gausawa community. This tragedy highlights the persistent dangers on Nigeria's busy river networks, where accidents are frequently caused by poor maintenance and a failure to comply with safety regulations. The high death toll and ongoing search efforts underscore the urgent need for enhanced maritime safety measures and stricter enforcement to prevent future such incidents, as the local community mourns its significant loss.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally asked the Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court decision that declared many of its imposed tariffs illegal, warning that the ruling could leave the U.S. economy vulnerable. The Justice Department is pushing for an expedited consideration, seeking clarity on whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) grants the president broad tariff authority and if the law involves an unconstitutional delegation of power. The lower court previously ruled that the right to impose tariffs rests primarily with Congress, not the executive branch. This high-stakes legal battle has significant implications for U.S. trade policy, international economic relations, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, with the administration asserting tariffs are crucial for national prosperity.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets recorded gains on Thursday, tracking an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that propelled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite higher. Major indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi showed positive movement, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also climbed after a report indicated robust household spending growth. This market uplift was largely driven by renewed optimism in the tech sector, stemming from a federal court's decision in an Alphabet antitrust case, which eased some regulatory concerns. However, global bond markets, including U.S. Treasuries and Japanese bonds, continued to face pressure, with yields rising amidst lingering economic anxieties and uncertainties regarding future tariff revenues.

          <p>Shares of Nidec Corp, a prominent Japanese electronics components manufacturer, experienced their largest single-day drop, plunging over 22% on Thursday. This significant decline followed the company's announcement of an independent, third-party investigation into alleged improper accounting practices at its Chinese subsidiary, Nidec Techno Motor. An internal review had already revealed evidence indicating a potential connection to Nidec's senior management, necessitating a more objective inquiry. The market's sharp negative reaction underscores serious investor concerns about corporate governance and the potential financial repercussions of these accounting issues. The ongoing probe aims to uncover the full extent of the malpractice and clarify management's involvement. (not investment advice)</p>

Eyewitnesses described the 140-year-old cable car speeding uncontrollably down a steep street before violently crashing into a building, causing extensive damage. Lisbon's mayor has declared the event an "unprecedented tragedy," with the government announcing a national day of mourning. Despite the public transport operator's claims of regular maintenance, initial reports point to a potential braking system failure. An official investigation has been launched to determine the exact cause of this devastating and unexpected accident, which included foreign nationals among the victims.</p>

          <p>The Restoration of America Foundation (ROAF), a pro-life organization, is calling on the Senate Finance Committee to hold Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accountable regarding the safety protocols for the abortion pill mifepristone. ROAF argues that the Biden administration's decision to roll back Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements, which had been in place for over two decades, endangers women by permitting telehealth prescriptions and mail-order delivery without proper medical screening. The group emphasizes that these changes eliminate essential safeguards, potentially exposing women to serious risks, such as undetected ectopic pregnancies. They are demanding clear answers on why these protocols were removed and when they will be reinstated to ensure women's safety and prevent increased taxpayer burden.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Caravello, a 37-year-old professor at Cal State Channel Island, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on a felony count of assaulting U.S. Border Patrol agents. The charge stems from a July 10 protest against an immigration raid at a Ventura County marijuana farm, where Caravello is accused of picking up a tear gas canister deployed by agents and throwing it back at them. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in federal prison. This re-escalation of charges, from an initial misdemeanor, underscores the gravity of the incident and the ongoing tensions between federal law enforcement and immigration protesters. The case highlights the legal consequences of actions taken during demonstrations, particularly when involving direct confrontation with agents.</p>

Proponents argue it's vital for enforcing the state's abortion ban, but critics denounce it as an overreach designed to intimidate providers and foster vigilantism.

          <p>The UK and its allies have affirmed their readiness to support Ukraine comprehensively, both in the lead-up to peace negotiations and in securing an eventual post-war settlement. UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated this commitment includes ensuring the safety of Ukraine's skies, seas, and land, ahead of a crucial meeting in Paris. This stance contrasts with Russian President Vladimir Putin's defiant remarks from China, where he threatened continued invasion while also vaguely suggesting a potential "light at the end of the tunnel" for a resolution. The allies, including the UK, are intensifying economic pressure and providing military aid, exemplified by the £1 billion of seized Russian assets repurposed for Ukraine, underscoring a united front against Russian aggression and a long-term commitment to Ukraine's security.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that Americans largely maintain a negative perception of the U.S. economy, frequently describing its current state as "uncertain" and "struggling," with overall ratings experiencing a slight downturn in the last month. A minority, approximately one-third, view the economy as "rebounding" or "expanding," and a substantial number perceive it as "unfair." The primary factor influencing these negative views is the continuous rise in prices, with two-thirds of respondents anticipating further increases. Personal financial well-being is closely tied to these economic perceptions, with individuals in higher income brackets generally reporting better situations. The poll underscores widespread economic anxieties and a prevailing sense that significant improvements are not imminent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, emphatically declared on Thursday that any prospective foreign military deployment in Ukraine is deemed "unacceptable" by Moscow and will not be a subject of discussion in any capacity. This statement directly responded to comments from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had outlined plans for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees, reportedly with U.S. backing. Germany had also expressed reservations, calling such suggestions premature. Russia's unequivocal rejection highlights the profound geopolitical chasm and the formidable challenges in establishing future security frameworks for Ukraine, signaling a significant hurdle for any potential resolution to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has dismissed the continuing Jeffrey Epstein controversy as "irrelevant" and a "Democrat hoax," even as a bipartisan push in Congress gains momentum to compel the Justice Department to release all related files. His remarks were made on the same day that Epstein survivors held an emotional news conference on Capitol Hill, where one accuser directly challenged his "hoax" characterization. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie's discharge petition, which aims to force a House vote on the full release of documents, is accumulating signatures, setting up a direct confrontation with House leadership and the White House, which favors a more controlled committee investigation. This ongoing political and legal battle underscores the persistent demands for transparency and accountability surrounding Epstein's criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>Chinese smart electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, including prominent players like Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr, are facing intense pressure to substantially increase their deliveries in the coming months to achieve their ambitious 2025 break-even goals. Although these companies reported reduced losses in the second quarter, largely due to aggressive discounting that spurred sales, the fierce price war in the world's largest vehicle market continues unabated. Financial consultants warn that prolonged heavy losses could jeopardize the existence of some EV makers, as raising new capital becomes challenging amidst concerns of market overcapacity. For instance, Nio's CEO has set a target of 50,000 monthly deliveries, a significant increase, to reach profitability by the fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration justifies these actions by designating certain criminal gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, yet legal experts and former officials raise serious constitutional concerns regarding the military's involvement in civilian law enforcement and the absence of congressional notification.

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a ruling blocking the Trump administration's controversial use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, explicitly finding "no invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had previously invoked this obscure wartime law to remove hundreds of individuals accused of being Tren de Aragua gang members, some of whom were subsequently sent to a supermax prison in El Salvador. The court firmly rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" met the legal definition of an invasion, stating the act applies to armed, organized forces. This decision represents a significant legal challenge to the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, with the ACLU hailing it as a crucial victory against executive overreach in declaring emergencies without proper judicial oversight.</p>
