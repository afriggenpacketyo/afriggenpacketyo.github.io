          <p>Musician Billy Joel has publicly refuted persistent rumors that he has a history of DUI charges, stating in a new documentary that he has never had one. He attributes his past car accidents to a "mental fog" and deep depression following the 9/11 attacks, not alcohol. The article also covers his recent diagnosis with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder that affects balance, vision, and hearing, which has led him to cancel tour dates to focus on recovery.</p>

          <p>Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have ordered an all-out response to severe flooding and landslides that have caused "heavy casualties" in Beijing's suburbs and other provinces. Heavy downpours since Saturday have battered regions like Miyun, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents from numerous villages. While official casualty numbers have not been released, authorities are emphasizing the urgent need for search and rescue operations and disaster relief to minimize further loss of life and property.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase alleges that fintech middlemen like Plaid are "massively taxing" its computer systems with an excessive number of data requests, most of which are not initiated by customers. According to an internal memo, only 13% of 1.89 billion data pulls in June were for active customer transactions. As a result, the bank is preparing to charge these aggregators new fees for data access to cover the costs of maintaining its infrastructure and managing increased fraud risks.

The company, valued at around £11 billion, believes a U.S. listing will increase its visibility in its largest market and provide access to deeper capital pools. The vote was controversial because it was bundled with an extension of a dual-class share structure that enhances the voting power of its co-founder and CEO, a move some investors opposed.

Her lawyers contend that the 2008 deal granted immunity to any potential co-conspirators, including Maxwell, and that the government is obligated to honor it nationwide. Federal prosecutors have maintained the agreement was only valid in Florida and does not apply to the New York case where she was convicted.</p>
