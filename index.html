        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals that 60% of workers in Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities, are living paycheck to paycheck, a figure higher than the Asia-Pacific average. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of high inflation, soaring housing costs, and a cultural shift among younger generations who prioritize lifestyle experiences over long-term savings. This financial precarity is exacerbated by real median income falling since 2019, even as the cost of living continues to climb, challenging the nation's reputation for financial prudence.</p>

          <p>The trial concerning President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles has concluded, with the presiding federal judge expressing significant concerns about the potential for an unchecked "national police force." Lawyers for California argued the deployment for immigration enforcement support violates the Posse Comitatus Act, while the Justice Department claimed the law is irrelevant. Judge Charles Breyer questioned the government's assertion of limitless authority, highlighting the core constitutional debate over federal power and military use within U.S. borders.</p>

          <p>Newly released body camera footage from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office shows the arrest of a recent Kentucky Powerball winner, James Farthing. The video captures the moment Farthing, 50, allegedly kicked a deputy in the face while officers were responding to a fight at a resort in St. Pete Beach, Florida. Farthing, who had a lengthy criminal history and was on parole, was charged with felony battery on a law enforcement officer shortly after he and his mother had won a $167.3 million jackpot.</p>

          <p>A federal lawsuit filed by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe against an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," has concluded its hearing. The plaintiffs argue the facility's construction violated federal law by failing to conduct an environmental impact assessment, threatening endangered species like the Florida panther and contaminating the fragile ecosystem's water supply. A key point of contention in court was determining whether the state or federal government is ultimately in control of the facility.</p>

          <p>A coalition of more than 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières, has publicly called on Israel to cease the "weaponization of aid" as starvation deepens in Gaza. The groups state that new Israeli regulations are effectively blocking the delivery of lifesaving supplies by requiring compliance with rules that could compromise their independence, such as not "delegitimizing" the state of Israel.

          <p>According to a new Gallup poll, the percentage of American adults who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low not seen since 1958. This decline is particularly pronounced among young adults, with a growing number of them viewing even moderate drinking as unhealthy. Experts suggest this shift is driven by increased health awareness, the rising popularity of non-alcoholic alternatives, and changing social norms. The data also reveals a significant drop in consumption among women compared to men over the past year.</p>

          <h2>Trump Signs Executive Order to Expedite and Relax Regulations on Commercial Rocket Launches</h2>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing environmental regulations for the commercial spaceflight industry to bolster U.S. competitiveness. The order directs the Department of Transportation to streamline or eliminate environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. Environmental groups have condemned the move as reckless, arguing it puts wildlife and local communities at risk from rocket launches that can cause significant devastation, as seen in a 2023 SpaceX incident in Texas.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Rules Trump Administration Can Withhold Billions in Foreign Aid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 20:41:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can legally continue to freeze or terminate billions of dollars in congressionally-approved foreign aid. The 2-to-1 decision reverses a lower court's injunction, stating that the international aid groups who sued did not have legal standing to bring the case. The ruling is a victory for the administration's policy of cutting funds for global health and development programs it deems "wasteful," affecting nearly $4 billion for global health and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS programs.</p>

          <p>Authorities in San Bernardino County have arrested a man for allegedly operating an illegal psychedelic mushroom business out of the Jah Healing Cannabis Church in Big Bear Lake. Deputies executed a search warrant at the location following citizen complaints and arrested 48-year-old Christopher Tindall on suspicion of felony illegal sales of psilocybin. The same church, which considers cannabis its sacrament, had previously been shut down by the county in 2022 for functioning as an illegal dispensary, a case it has vowed to appeal.</p>

          <p>Viral photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like facial growths have been identified by state wildlife officials as a result of Shope Papilloma Virus. The disease, which is not new and is thought to have inspired the myth of the "jackalope," is spread by fleas and ticks and is generally harmless to the rabbits unless the growths interfere with eating. While the images sparked alarm online, Colorado Parks and Wildlife clarified that the virus cannot spread to humans or other species, but advised the public not to touch infected animals.</p>

          <p>New Mexico's governor has declared a state of emergency for the city of Española and surrounding areas in Rio Arriba County due to a significant surge in violent crime and drug trafficking. The order authorizes $750,000 in emergency funds to provide additional resources to local law enforcement and communities. The governor's office cited that police calls in the area have more than doubled in two years and the county suffers from the highest overdose death rate in the state, largely driven by fentanyl.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, low-income Americans face a growing challenge in affording to stay cool, an issue exacerbated by President Trump's proposal to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Research indicates that climate change has significantly increased wholesale electricity costs, which are passed on to consumers. The potential elimination of LIHEAP, which serves over six million Americans, would remove a critical lifeline for vulnerable populations who already struggle to pay their utility bills during extreme heat.</p>

          <p>Following their $8 billion takeover, David Ellison and the new leadership team at Paramount have detailed their plan to revitalize the media company. The strategy involves a strong focus on theatrical releases, aiming to nearly double the studio's annual film output to 15-20 movies. Key priorities include developing major franchises like 'Top Gun 3' and 'Star Trek,' attracting top filmmakers, and creating content for a broad, non-politicized audience. The new team, backed by Skydance Media and RedBird Capital, intends to restore Paramount's status as a premier Hollywood studio.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Imperial College London are warning that UK cities face a growing threat from "firewaves," a term describing multiple urban wildfires triggered by prolonged periods of hot, dry weather. The phenomenon occurs when vegetation becomes dangerously desiccated, increasing the likelihood of simultaneous, fast-spreading fires that could overwhelm emergency services. This warning comes as recent heatwaves have caused several fires in London and Edinburgh, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of urban green spaces to a risk once considered primarily rural.</p>

          <p>An outburst flood from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier caused record-high water levels in Juneau, Alaska, before receding, resulting in minimal damage. The Mendenhall River crested at 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record, but newly installed temporary barriers successfully protected hundreds of homes from what could have been a catastrophic event. This annual flooding, a consequence of a warming climate, occurs when meltwater builds pressure and escapes the ice dam, releasing billions of gallons of water into the nearby river system.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has announced a $5.5 billion plan to support the country's exporters who have been hit by high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The measures include providing credit and postponing tax charges for affected businesses. President Trump had justified the tariffs of up to 50% by linking them to the legal situation of his ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro. President Lula has called the grounds for the tariffs nonexistent but stated he prefers negotiation over escalating a trade conflict.</p>
