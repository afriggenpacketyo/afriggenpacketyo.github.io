          <p>Spirit Airlines announced it is making "massive progress" in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, according to its restructuring lawyer. The budget carrier has secured agreements for up to $475 million in new financing and an additional $150 million from a major aircraft lessor to aid its revitalization efforts. This development follows Spirit's second bankruptcy filing in under a year, prompted by over $250 million in losses due to high costs and weaker demand. The airline is actively cutting costs, including reducing routes and furloughing flight attendants, while also negotiating concessions with its pilots' union. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that four people were killed and eight others were injured after a suspect drove his vehicle into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, and opened fire. The suspect, identified as a 40-year-old Iraq war veteran, is also deceased. The FBI is investigating the incident as an "act of targeted violence," with the White House noting the individual reportedly harbored hatred for people of the Mormon faith. This tragic event occurred just one day after the church's global leader, Russell M. Nelson, passed away at the age of 101.</p>

          <p>Recent developments indicate a strong rebound in Wall Street's dealmaking activities, which is seen as a positive sign for Goldman Sachs. The investment bank was selected as a financial advisor in the historic $55 billion leveraged buyout of video game publisher Electronic Arts. This trend is further supported by investment bank Jefferies reporting its best-ever third-quarter revenue, driven by a surge in advisory fees. These events reinforce a bullish outlook on Goldman's investment banking division, which has been recovering after a slowdown caused by higher interest rates and economic uncertainty.

          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown is hinging on the extension of enhanced premium tax credits that help 22 million Americans afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. These subsidies, which have nearly doubled ACA enrollment since 2021, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Democratic lawmakers are making their extension a condition for any government funding deal, while Republicans are resisting. If the credits expire, premiums could more than double for many households, potentially causing about 4 million people to lose their insurance coverage due to affordability issues.

          <p>California-based startup Aetherflux is developing satellite technology to create mini solar farms in low-Earth orbit, which will collect solar power and beam it to Earth using infrared lasers. Co-founded by Robinhood's Baiju Bhatt and backed by investors like Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the company plans its first launch on a SpaceX rocket next year. The system will transmit energy to a network of small ground stations, with the U.S. Department of Defense as an initial key customer.

          <p>Starbucks has launched new Protein Lattes and Protein Cold Foam, aiming to cater to the growing trend of increased protein consumption. The beverages contain between 15 and 36 grams of whey protein, which some dietitians say could benefit individuals who often skip breakfast or need higher protein intake, like athletes. However, experts caution against using these drinks as meal replacements, as they lack essential nutrients like fiber and antioxidants found in whole foods. They also highlight the high sugar content in some drinks and advise that most people can meet their protein needs through a balanced diet.</p>

This move underscores Colombia's strategic pivot away from the United States and toward China, which was solidified by its formal entry into China's Belt and Road Initiative in May.

The author, a member of the church, contrasts the immediate politicization of the violence with what he believes would have been Nelson's response. He posits that Nelson, who spent his final years advocating for peacemaking and rejecting contention, would have urged followers to love their enemies rather than engage in partisan blame. The piece laments the rush to fit the tragedy into convenient political narratives while highlighting stories of heroism from within the congregation.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that nearly half of all Americans now identify as independents, surpassing those who align with either the Republican or Democratic parties. This article argues that the term "independent" has become an "empty signifier," as it describes a rejection of party labels rather than a coherent ideology. The author attributes this trend to "institutional isomorphism," where both major parties and their associated media and activist ecosystems have become ideologically monolithic and conformist. This process, driven by the primary system, leaves many general election voters feeling alienated and choosing to identify outside the two-party structure.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. Currently, the monthly payment on an $80,000 HELOC with a 10-year repayment period is approximately $966, down from over $1,010 a year ago. HELOCs offer variable interest rates, meaning borrowers could see further reductions in their payments if the Fed continues to cut rates. While HELOCs are currently cheaper than fixed-rate home equity loans and personal loans, homeowners must carefully consider the variable nature of the payments to ensure long-term affordability.

          <p>An internal email suggests that the U.S. Department of Energy has directed employees in its renewable energy office to avoid using terms like "climate change," "emissions," and "decarbonization." The directive, which the agency's press secretary denies, is seen as part of a broader Trump administration effort to downplay the climate crisis. This follows the administration's recent cancellation of $13 billion in funding for renewable energy projects and a speech by the president calling the crisis a "con job." One agency staffer expressed concern that banning such words silences key elements of the department's mission.</p>

          <p>In a key conference speech, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer aimed to counter the political threat posed by Reform UK's Nigel Farage and reassure critics within his own Labour party. The address focused on drawing a clear dividing line between his party and Reform, positioning himself as the leader best equipped to fight back against Farage's agenda. While the speech offered little new policy, its primary goal was to project strength and defiance after a difficult period for the government. With a challenging budget and local elections ahead, the performance is seen as critical to determining Starmer's future leadership.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles LGBT Center is hosting its third annual "Queerceañera," an event that reclaims the traditional quinceañera celebration for the queer Latine community. Historically centered on girls, the event provides a belated rite of passage for those who were excluded, particularly queer and gay boys. This year's celebration honors drag artist Lushious Massacr and community organizer Oliver Alpuche, with a theme of "Mariposas Sin Fronteras" (Butterflies Without Borders) to uplift stories of migration and joy. The event serves not only as a party but also as a space for empowerment, offering free legal resources for immigrants.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "7-year rule" for credit card debt primarily refers to the maximum time most negative information, such as late payments or charge-offs, can legally remain on a credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This seven-year clock typically begins from the date of the first missed payment. Additionally, states have statutes of limitations, often around seven years, after which a creditor can no longer sue to collect the debt. However, the debt itself does not disappear and collectors may still attempt to contact you, making it crucial for consumers to understand their rights and the nuances of these timelines.

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda has intensified into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm will move away from the Bahamas and the U.S. East Coast, taking a path toward Bermuda, where a hurricane warning is now in effect. While not expected to make landfall in the U.S., swells generated by Imelda are spreading along the East Coast, creating the potential for life-threatening surf and rip currents. Some coastal areas of North Carolina may also experience isolated flash flooding from the storm's outer rain bands.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley anticipates that the market share of electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S. will be cut in half, dropping from a record of around 10% to 5%, following the expiration of federal tax credits. The $7,500 consumer incentive ended as part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Farley noted that while consumers find EVs interesting, their high cost remains a significant barrier, and that hybrid vehicles represent an easier transition for many customers. The policy change will force automakers like Ford to reassess their EV production capacity and battery plant strategies. (not investment advice)</p>
