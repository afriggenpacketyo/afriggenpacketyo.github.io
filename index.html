        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has granted a third 90-day extension to the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States, as a deal to separate the app from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, remains elusive. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the extension will allow the administration to continue working towards a deal that ensures the safety and security of American users' data. The orders have directed the Justice Department not to penalize companies like Apple and Google for not removing TikTok from their platforms, with the current extension set to expire on Thursday. This decision reflects the administration's ongoing efforts to address national security concerns related to the app while avoiding a complete shutdown. The delay provides more time for negotiations and potential resolutions to safeguard user data, allowing Americans to continue using the popular video-sharing platform. </p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a significant bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars with government approval. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, mandates full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, granting substantial authority to the Treasury Secretary. While the bill now moves to the House, where a different version called STABLE exists, its passage in the Senate marks a major milestone for the crypto industry and President Trump's digital asset initiatives. The legislation aims to protect consumers, promote innovation, and maintain the U.S. dollar's dominance in the digital economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents outside a federal immigration court in New York City but was released after about four hours. Lander's wife stated that he was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of the courthouse, and video footage shows officers handcuffing him after he requested a judicial warrant. The Department of Homeland Security claimed that Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, but federal prosecutors are still investigating the incident, and as of 5 p.m. ET, no charges had been filed. New York Governor Kathy Hochul criticized the arrest as federal overreach, expressing concern over the detention of elected officials without cause.</p>

This chip, developed by Amazon's Annapurna Labs, underscores the company's successful custom chip strategy, challenging traditional semiconductor players like Intel and AMD. The primary focus is competing with Nvidia in the artificial intelligence infrastructure space, as highlighted by AWS's Project Rainier, an AI supercomputer built for Anthropic, backed by an $8 billion investment. AWS aims to reduce AI training costs and offer an alternative to Nvidia's expensive GPUs, with Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model already utilizing Trainium2 GPUs, indicating a shift in traditional order patterns.</p>

He recounted being dragged into a hallway, handcuffed, and brought to his knees, expressing concern over the implications for American democracy and the silencing of dissent. The White House dismissed Padilla‚Äôs speech as a ‚Äútemper tantrum,‚Äù while Padilla urged his colleagues to consider the broader implications of the incident, particularly for immigrants and the state of democratic norms.</p>

          <p>High-ranking officials from the United States and China recently concluded trade talks in London, leaving observers with little official information and sparking speculation about the discussions' content. The silence from both sides suggests potential tensions, a shift in power dynamics, and the fragile state of global trade relations. Some analysts suggest that China's assertive stance on export controls of rare earth elements, a key focus of the talks, may have surprised the U.S. delegation, adding complexity to the negotiations. This perceived standoff deepens uncertainty about the economic relationship between the two nations, with implications for supply chains and global stability.</p>

This consideration follows allegations from Israel that Iran is rapidly advancing toward building nuclear weapons, though a recent U.S. intelligence assessment stated that Iran is not currently building such weapons. The issue was discussed in a meeting with Trump's national security team, but there is not full agreement among his advisors on how to proceed.

While grassroots movements have organized significant demonstrations against the president, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has been grappling with internal conflicts and a perceived lack of leadership. Key figures within the party are consumed with relitigating past elections rather than focusing on future strategies, and the DNC's efforts to manage internal disputes have been criticized as ineffective. This internal strife, combined with reports of labor union dissatisfaction, raises concerns about the party's ability to capitalize on anti-Trump sentiment and effectively challenge the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy envisions a future where AI agents replace human workers in the company's offices, expecting a reduction in the corporate workforce within the next few years. Jassy stated that as Amazon rolls out more generative AI tools, fewer people will be needed for certain tasks, while more will be required for other types of jobs. This shift towards AI is intended to allow human workers to focus on more creative and strategic roles, though some employees have expressed concerns about an intensified and less thoughtful work environment. Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications in development or already built, with plans to expand this further.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer quickly picked up papers dropped by US President Donald Trump at the G7 Summit, citing concerns about White House security protocols. Starmer explained that he feared potential intervention from the security team if anyone else had attempted to assist, emphasizing the strict rules surrounding proximity to the president. The incident occurred during discussions about a newly signed UK-US trade deal, which Starmer hailed as a significant relief for Jaguar Land Rover workers and their supply chain, averting potential job losses. The deal removes tariffs on the aerospace sector and reduces levies on car exports from the UK to the US, though negotiations on steel import charges are ongoing.</p>

          <p>The mid-festival cancellation of Bonnaroo due to severe weather and flooded site conditions has triggered a wave of criticism on social media, with many attendees expressing dissatisfaction over the refund policy and overall handling of the situation. A petition has been launched on Change.org, urging Live Nation, the festival's promoter, to issue 100% refunds instead of the promised 75%. Signatories cite issues ranging from poor organization and subpar facilities to the lack of support from festival staff after the announcement. The petition highlights the financial burden on festival-goers, who incurred significant expenses for food, supplies, and travel, while criticizing Live Nation's response to the storm.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing the highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with over 1,100 confirmed infections across at least 32 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A significant outbreak in West Texas, primarily affecting unvaccinated children and teenagers, has resulted in two deaths. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to lower vaccination rates, with CDC data showing a decline in measles vaccination coverage among kindergarteners.

          <p>The growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and data storage is projected to significantly increase electricity consumption, potentially leading to higher electricity bills for consumers. Experts anticipate a 16% increase in electricity demand by 2029, primarily driven by the proliferation of data centers, which require substantial power for computing and cooling. As utilities invest in new infrastructure to meet this demand, they are likely to raise rates, affecting everyday households. The heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to a recent report by the North American Electric Reliability Corp (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Two Illinois-based toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, have petitioned the Supreme Court to swiftly review President Trump's tariffs, arguing that their widespread impact on businesses and consumers warrants immediate intervention. The companies are challenging the president's authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, claiming it exceeds his constitutional powers. This lawsuit is separate from another challenge to Trump's tariffs that was filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade, which blocked Trump's 10% tariff on virtually every U.S. trading partner. The companies emphasize the urgency of the matter, citing the ongoing financial strain caused by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Smugglers are increasingly using "taxi boats" to collect migrants from the French coast, adapting to increased police patrols by launching boats from hidden locations and picking up customers waiting in the sea. This tactic allows smugglers to maintain control over the process and avoid direct confrontations with law enforcement. French police, bound by operational rules, are hesitant to intervene at sea due to safety concerns, focusing instead on intercepting boats before launch. The BBC reports that while interception rates are rising, smugglers are adapting quickly, with some boats launching from as far as 100 kilometers away, highlighting the ongoing challenges in preventing Channel crossings.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is reviewing President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities, with judges expressing skepticism about California's arguments against the mobilization. The Justice Department argues that the president's decision to call the National Guard into federal service is not subject to judicial review, while California contends that the deployment circumvented Governor Gavin Newsom and could escalate tensions. The legal battle centers on whether the president exceeded his authority under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which outlines the circumstances under which the National Guard can be federalized.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament (MPs) have voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a majority of 242 votes, meaning women who terminate their pregnancies outside the current legal framework will no longer be at risk of criminal investigation. While the law will still penalize those who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion outside the legal framework, the new clause does not alter existing regulations regarding abortion services within healthcare settings. Campaigners and medical organizations have welcomed the decision as a victory for women's rights and autonomy.</p>
