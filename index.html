          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), a dominant provider of cloud infrastructure, experienced a significant outage originating from its US-East-1 region, impacting a vast number of major websites and online services globally. The issue was attributed to DNS problems with its DynamoDB database service, which underpins many other AWS applications and client platforms. Companies including Disney+, Reddit, and United Airlines reported disruptions, highlighting the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers. AWS later confirmed it was seeing signs of recovery and had mitigated the issue, though some services faced backlogs.</p>

          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week. He indicated that moderate Democrats might soon vote to reopen the government, allowing for policy negotiations to resume through the regular process. However, Hassett also warned that if an agreement is not reached, the Trump administration is considering stronger measures to compel Democrats to cooperate and end the partisan stalemate over federal funding priorities. The conflict centers on Republican desires for a short-term resolution versus Democratic demands for additional healthcare spending.</p>

          <p>Experts confirm that the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks even if the U.S. government shuts down, as the program is funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires congressional approval, meaning a shutdown could disrupt other key services. With a significant portion of its workforce potentially furloughed, activities such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and issuing replacement Medicare cards could be temporarily halted until a funding agreement is reached.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a government shutdown forces hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without pay or be furloughed, members of Congress and the president will continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is authorized by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal. In contrast, most federal workers and contractors face significant financial uncertainty, with paychecks delayed until Congress approves new spending. This disparity often draws public criticism during funding impasses, highlighting a system where lawmakers are insulated from the direct consequences of a shutdown.</p>

          <p>The article investigates the narrative of a "Christian genocide" in Nigeria, which has gained traction among some international figures and organizations. It contrasts these claims with analyses from experts and testimonies from survivors, which suggest the violence is driven by a complex mix of factors including land disputes, climate change, poverty, and weak governance, rather than religion alone. The long-standing and deadly conflict between predominantly Christian farmers and mostly Muslim Fulani herders is a central element, with both communities suffering significant losses in a crisis that transcends a simple religious explanation.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, Republican lawmakers and conservative groups are pushing to erect statues and other memorials in his honor across the United States. Proposals in states like Florida and Oklahoma would require public universities to create these memorials, with threats of financial penalties for non-compliance. Critics argue that this movement is a politically motivated attempt to capitalize on his death to further a culture war, questioning the appropriateness of memorializing a figure known for his highly controversial and divisive views.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's military has implemented new rules of engagement for its troops to counter the increasing threat of drone incursions from mainland China. The recently released National Defence Report details a four-step standard operating procedure: identification and monitoring, followed by an alert and notification, a safety confirmation, and finally, defensive firing. This updated protocol is designed to improve readiness and provide clear guidelines for soldiers facing frequent drone activity near Taiwan's main island and its outlying territories like Kinmen and Matsu.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking international trial has yielded "astounding" results for a new microchip implant that restores vision to patients with an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Surgeons at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London successfully fitted patients with the tiny 2mm-square implant under the retina. The device works in conjunction with special glasses equipped with a video camera, allowing patients who were previously blind to read and see fine details again, offering hope for a condition that affects millions worldwide and previously had no treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews a new book on the 1929 stock market crash, arguing that a significant parallel with the current economic climate is the phenomenon of "regulatory capture." In both eras, Wall Street and powerful business interests managed to co-opt other centers of power, including government and the press, creating a clubby consensus that favored deregulation and ignored warning signs. This alignment of elites weakened the systemic checks and balances, allowing market excesses to grow unchecked and posing both financial and moral dangers to society. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new documentary "Listers" provides a humorous and insightful look into the subculture of extreme bird-watching by following two brothers attempting a "big year"—a quest to identify as many bird species as possible in 12 months. Beyond the comedic journey, the film serves as a critical examination of how social apps like eBird are transforming hobbies. It explores the corrosive side of gamification, where the joy of the activity itself can be overshadowed by the competitive drive to accumulate stats and climb digital leaderboards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into why bread from countries like France is often perceived as superior to American bread, attributing the difference to legal standards. A 1993 French law mandates that traditional bread sold in a "boulangerie" must be made fresh daily using only four ingredients: flour, water, a leavening agent, and salt. In contrast, mass-produced bread common in the U.S. often contains dozens of ingredients, including dough conditioners and preservatives, prioritizing shelf life and production speed over the development of complex flavors that come from time and simpler recipes.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that the Trump administration's economic policies, often justified as a battle against "woke" culture, are effectively imposing a hidden tax on all Americans by increasing the cost of living. The article points to tariffs driving up prices on goods, mass deportation policies threatening food production and stability, and the promotion of fossil fuels over cheaper renewable energy sources. These actions, framed as culturally necessary, result in higher costs for consumers while benefiting politically connected allies. (not investment advice)</p>

The highly organized thieves used a truck with a mechanical lift to access a second-floor gallery, executed the robbery in just seven minutes, and fled on motorbikes. The incident has triggered a major investigation by a specialized police unit and has been condemned by French President Emmanuel Macron as an "attack on our history."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly advocated for an end to the war in Ukraine by freezing the current battle lines, a proposal that would effectively cede Russian-occupied territory in the Donbas region to Moscow. This statement followed a reportedly tense White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump also denied Ukraine's request for long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. The move signals a significant pivot in the U.S. stance on the conflict, shifting away from unequivocal support for Ukraine's territorial integrity.</p>

Australia's defense ministry lodged a complaint about the "unsafe and unprofessional" actions of a Chinese PLA jet that released flares in close proximity to an Australian patrol aircraft. In response, China's military accused the Australian plane of being an intruder in airspace over the Paracel Islands, which China claims, and stated its forces took necessary measures to warn and drive it away, demanding an end to such "provocations."</p>
