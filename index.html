          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant increase after Israel launched airstrikes against Iran, raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies in the Middle East. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate contract rose by 7.61% to $73.22 per barrel, while the global benchmark Brent futures contract increased by 7.22% to $74.37 per barrel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation, targeting Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program, would continue until the threat is removed. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarified that the U.S. was not involved in the strikes but warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests in the region. Optimism surrounding global economic stability remains tempered by geopolitical uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Archer Aviation's stock experienced a decline after the air taxi maker announced the sale of $850 million worth of shares. The company plans to use the financing to support new infrastructure, roll out an AI-based aviation software platform, and support its Launch Edition program, including providing air taxi services during the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. This stock offering comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a pilot program to support the development and deployment of electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) in the U.S. Archer has partnered with United Airlines to roll out an airport air taxi service, with the United Arab Emirates as its first launch market.</p>

          <p>Melissa Febos' new memoir, "The Dry Season," explores the benefits of refusal and abstinence, focusing on a year she spent voluntarily celibate. Febos examines six books that celebrate refusal, revealing how it can lead to unexpected delights and open one's eyes to new possibilities. She argues that saying no to one thing allows one to say yes to something else, widening the aperture of one's heart. Febos' book suggests that spirituality can be found in smaller phenomena and stiller moments, encouraging readers to consider what narrow portals they might be looking through in their own lives.</p>

Critics argue that this event glorifies gas-guzzling equipment used for war and planetary destruction while critical services are being slashed.

          <p>Following Israel's strikes against Iran's military leadership and nuclear program, questions arise about the potential for escalation and the role of the United States. While President Donald Trump initially opposed the strike, he has since expressed enthusiasm and hopes the operation will force Iran to make concessions. The article examines how the U.S. might become more involved, Iran's possible responses, and the potential for Iran to attack American interests. It also considers the implications of the conflict for regional stability and the future of U.S.-Iran relations, and the degree to which Trump's administration has changed.</p>

          <p>The Israeli attacks on Iran have exposed the Iranian regime's incompetence, with major nuclear and military sites hit across the country. Despite the attacks, many Iranians were unaware due to a lack of sirens and warnings. The regime's ineptitude is contrasted with its belligerent rhetoric and actions, such as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's support for Hamas's October 7 attacks. The attacks have raised questions about Iran's leadership, its ability to defend its people, and the future direction of the country.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu lost to Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals at Queen's Club, despite showing confidence and making progress in her earlier matches. Zheng broke through at the seventh attempt in the first set, silencing the crowd with a blistering backhand, and Raducanu left the court for a medical timeout on her back. Raducanu initially took a 3-0 lead in the second set, but Zheng rallied, winning four games in a row to close out the match. Raducanu can still be confident in her ability to perform well on grass, but will need to close the gap when challenging the very best.</p>

          <p>The October 7 Hamas attack on Israel has led to a shift in Israel's approach to Iran, culminating in recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military leaders. The article argues that several factors, including Israel's successful campaign against Hezbollah and President Trump's foreign-policy approach, have removed constraints on Netanyahu, enabling him to take decisive action. The author contends that the events following October 7 have altered Israel's military, diplomatic, and political standing, making the country more willing to confront Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

The pair will resume on day four with 69 runs required to wrap up the win, potentially ending South Africa's long wait for a victory in a major men's final.
