          <p>China's box office is experiencing a subdued Dragon Boat Festival, with revenue lower than previous holidays as the industry grapples with underwhelming performances. Despite a Hollywood film, "Mission: Impossible â€“ The Final Reckoning," leading ticket presales, overall box office income for the first day of the festival was estimated at 122 million yuan, lower than the May 1 holiday. This decline comes as China's economy struggles to stimulate domestic consumption, with box office revenue decreasing significantly last year. Despite these challenges, observers remain optimistic about the long-term resilience of China's film market, citing improved domestic productions. </p>
