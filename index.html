          <p>As the government shutdown continues, Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated he offered Democrats a procedural vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies in exchange for reopening the government. However, he could not guarantee the outcome of such a vote. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer disputed this, claiming no formal proposal was made, leaving the two parties at a public impasse. Democrats are insisting on a firm agreement to address healthcare premium costs before they will support a government funding bill, ensuring the shutdown will persist.</p>

          <p>In a significant military demonstration, three U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers conducted a flight near the coast of Venezuela. The long-range, heavy bombers, which are capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons, originated from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. This maneuver is being interpreted as a deliberate show of force by the Trump administration amid ongoing tensions with the South American nation. The flight's path was monitored through publicly available tracking data, highlighting the overt nature of the military signal being sent to the Venezuelan government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of regional banks, including Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance, experienced a sharp decline following revelations of significant bad loans. The concerns were amplified by recent bankruptcies in the auto-parts sector, which have exposed potential loose lending practices within the opaque private credit market. Investors are now worried that these isolated incidents could be indicative of a wider, systemic issue, drawing comparisons to the 2023 banking crisis. This market anxiety has led to a sell-off, reflecting fears of more instability in the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has cautioned that a protracted government shutdown could negatively impact the airline's future bookings. While the carrier has not yet seen a significant effect, Kirby believes that diminishing public confidence in the government's ability to resolve the impasse will eventually deter travel plans. The shutdown forces essential aviation personnel like TSA officers and air traffic controllers to work without pay, raising concerns about staffing shortages that have previously caused flight disruptions. Kirby expressed hope that an "unforced error" for the U.S. economy could be avoided.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly preparing to seek a grand jury indictment against John Bolton, who served as National Security Advisor in the first Trump administration. The move follows an FBI search of Bolton's home and office as part of an investigation into his handling of classified documents. The Justice Department under President Trump had previously opened a criminal inquiry related to the publication of Bolton's memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," alleging it contained classified information, though the Biden administration later closed that investigation. Bolton has consistently denied any wrongdoing.</p>

          <h2>Senate Majority Leader Signals Intent to Advance Bipartisan Russia Sanctions Bill</h2>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has announced his intention to move forward with a long-stalled bill to impose new, stringent sanctions on Russia. He stated that "the time has come" for a vote, particularly after President Trump's recent call with Vladimir Putin. The legislation, which has broad bipartisan support, would impose heavy tariffs on countries that purchase Russian energy exports and aims to increase economic pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine. The bill had been previously delayed due to other foreign policy crises and White House requests for more flexibility.</p>

          <p>Following a BBC investigation that exposed misogyny and racism at a London police station, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has promised to be "ruthless" in removing rogue officers from the force. He described the uncovered behavior as "vile and shocking" and stated that the Met is undergoing the "biggest clear-out" in its history, having already removed over 1,500 officers and staff since 2022. The commissioner acknowledged the profound negative impact such conduct could have on public trust, particularly among women and victims of sexual assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine is actively seeking U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles, a weapon system that military experts believe could significantly alter the dynamics of its war with Russia. The long-range (up to 1,600 km) and low-altitude flight capabilities of the Tomahawk make it difficult for Russian air defense systems to intercept. If supplied, these missiles would enable Ukraine to strike key military and industrial targets deep inside Russian territory. While Russia has downplayed the threat, the potential delivery is seen as a major point of leverage in pushing Moscow toward peace negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Guardian editorial critiques the Trump administration's increasingly aggressive posture towards Venezuela, framed as a "war on drugs." The article points to recent extrajudicial killings at sea, a buildup of U.S. troops in the region, and President Trump's confirmation of covert CIA operations as evidence of a growing military threat. The piece suggests this hawkish approach is designed to pressure Nicolás Maduro's regime, but it questions the effectiveness and legality of these actions. It concludes that the strategy is part of a long and inglorious history of U.S. intervention in Latin America.</p>

          <p>Family members have identified two men from Trinidad and Tobago as being among the six individuals killed in a recent U.S. airstrike on a boat in international waters near Venezuela. The Trump administration claimed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, though the family of one victim denies his involvement in illicit activities. The incident is part of a series of deadly U.S. attacks in the Caribbean, which have killed at least 27 people and raised concerns among local fishing communities. While Trinidad's prime minister supported the strike, other Caribbean leaders have condemned the U.S. military activity.</p>

          <p>The article profiles Colorado's Democratic Governor, Jared Polis, as a unique political figure who aligns with some tenets of the Trump administration's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement. Polis has collaborated with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on policies like banning soda purchases with food stamps, citing a desire for "moral integrity" in nutrition programs. However, he staunchly opposes Kennedy's anti-vaccine stances, recently acting to ensure vaccine access in his state. This eclectic mix of libertarian, progressive, and populist ideas makes Polis a complex and politically savvy operator.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, experienced a fall in a hallway of the U.S. Capitol on Thursday. The incident occurred as he was approached by two environmental advocates while on his way to a series of votes related to the government shutdown. Assisted by his security detail, McConnell was able to get up and continue walking to the Senate floor, where he proceeded to vote. This event has renewed concerns about the senator's health, following a more serious fall in 2023 that led to a prolonged absence from his duties.</p>

          <p>With credit card delinquencies on the rise, more consumers are facing lawsuits from creditors. This article outlines the options available to individuals in this situation, noting that hiring a lawyer is not always necessary, especially for smaller, undisputed debts. The most crucial step is to respond to the lawsuit to avoid a default judgment, which can lead to wage garnishment. Alternatives to court include negotiating a settlement or payment plan directly with the creditor, seeking help from a debt relief company, or, in severe cases, filing for bankruptcy to halt legal action.</p>
