          <h2>China's Producer Prices See Largest Decline in Nearly Two Years Amid Deflationary Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 21:42:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) dropped by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the most significant fall in almost two years and extending a long deflationary trend. This decline, worse than economists' forecasts, reflects a deepening price war as the economy struggles with weak consumer demand. Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) showed a slight 0.1% increase, a small sign of recovery. Analysts suggest that without strong government stimulus, China may struggle to escape this deflationary spiral, especially as policymakers criticize aggressive price-cutting by companies.

          <p>A Texas nurse captured poignant video footage of young girls from Camp Mystic being evacuated from severe floodwaters in Kerr County. The videos, posted on TikTok, show the campers singing worship songs on a bus as they drive past the devastation, an effort to calm themselves and others. The footage provides a chilling contrast to earlier videos showing the girls enjoying camp activities before the catastrophic flood, which claimed the lives of at least 27 campers and counselors. The incident highlights the human response to tragedy amidst a natural disaster of historic proportions.</p>

          <p>A new report from Airports Council International World reveals that Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport remains the world's busiest, handling over 108 million passengers in 2024. Global passenger traffic reached a record 9.4 billion, exceeding 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic. The report lists the top 15 busiest airports for both total and international passengers, with Dubai International leading in the latter category. While many airports like Dallas/Fort Worth and Istanbul have seen significant growth, others, including Atlanta and Los Angeles, have yet to fully recover their pre-COVID passenger numbers.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely situated to fill a void in global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. The piece contrasts the dismantling of USAID as an independent agency under a more isolationist US policy with China's proactive initiatives, such as the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) launched in Hong Kong. The author suggests that as the center of global cooperation shifts eastward, Hong Kong's cosmopolitan status can make it a key hub for international development, benefiting from China's increasing engagement with the Global South.</p>

          <p>NBA star Kevin Durant, recently traded to the Houston Rockets, reflected on his tenure with the Brooklyn Nets in a podcast discussion with his former coach, Steve Nash. Durant described his time in Brooklyn as "weird," citing numerous off-court distractions and instability within the organization that prevented the team from reaching its full potential. He felt that Nash's hands were tied and that he didn't get to experience the "full Steve Nash" as a coach due to the surrounding turmoil. Despite the issues, Durant recalled his first year with the team as some of the most fun he has had playing basketball in his career.</p>

The area is particularly vulnerable due to burn scars from recent wildfires that have reduced the soil's ability to absorb water.

The ICC stated the regime has severely deprived women and girls of fundamental rights to education, movement, and expression.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move aimed at protecting national security and boosting domestic industry. The decision follows an investigation into the effects of copper imports, with the new tax expected to take effect by the end of the month. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction, and the U.S. imports about half of what it consumes. The high tariff rate, matching recent levies on steel, has caused US copper prices to jump and raised concerns among industries that rely on the metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas has renewed focus on the Trump administration's staffing cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service (NWS). Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, raising concerns about the government's ability to respond to weather disasters. While experts note the NWS issued timely warnings for the recent floods, they caution that continued cuts could compromise future forecasting and public safety. The disaster highlights the potential real-world consequences of reducing funding and personnel at key scientific and safety agencies.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, local officials in Kerr County have been unable to provide clear answers about their emergency response timeline. During a press conference, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha could not specify when the county's emergency manager was notified or took action after the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning at 1:14 a.m. The sheriff stated that his priority remains search and rescue, deflecting repeated questions about preparedness and the initial response. This lack of transparency has raised questions about whether local authorities acted swiftly enough to warn residents.</p>

A new report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will install at least 9GW this year, accounting for more than half of the global total. This surge is driven by strong government support, as President Xi Jinping has identified offshore wind as a key sector for the high-quality development of the country's marine economy.

          <p>To combat a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in UK criminal courts, former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended fundamental reforms, including judge-only trials for certain offenses. The proposals suggest that cases like fraud and bribery could be decided by judges alone to speed up the justice process and prevent what he calls a risk of "total system collapse." The plan would also see less serious offenses handled by a panel of a judge and two magistrates. While the Magistrates' Association supports the move, some barristers argue it undermines the essential right to a trial by one's peers.</p>

          <p>The conviction of Sean "Diddy" Combs has sparked a conversation about why the hip-hop industry has struggled to have a "MeToo" moment comparable to Hollywood's. This analysis explores the complex factors that contribute to a culture of silence around sexual abuse and misogyny within the genre. Insiders and experts point to the misuse of NDAs, the risk of being blacklisted, and a phenomenon of "black protectionism," where there is a reluctance to criticize successful Black figures. While the Diddy case has brought some issues to light, many believe a true cultural reset is needed to address systemic problems.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the rush to assign blame for the deadly Texas floods oversimplifies a complex tragedy and distracts from the real issues.

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has issued a stark warning that urgent action is needed to stop the exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange. The group reports that 213 firms have left since 2016 due to a combination of listing elsewhere, private takeovers, and investors avoiding UK shares. The CBI is calling for lighter regulations, better marketing, and tax incentives to encourage investment in British companies. The report highlights widespread concern that the outflow of major companies threatens the UK's financial services industry, a crucial source of tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, is set to be the "most climate-damaging" ever, according to a new report by the environmental group Scientists for Global Responsibility. The study calculates that the expanded 48-team tournament will generate over nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This massive carbon footprint, nearly double the average of the last four World Cups, is attributed to the high reliance on air travel between host cities and the increased number of matches. The projected emissions are equivalent to the annual pollution of nearly 6.5 million cars.</p>
