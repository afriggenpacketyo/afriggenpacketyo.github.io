        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a plan to significantly boost defense spending, aiming to reach an annual budget of €64 billion by 2027, three years ahead of schedule. He cited growing threats from Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and global instability as key drivers for the increase. Macron stressed the need for France to be powerful and feared in order to maintain its freedom, framing the decision as crucial for peace on the continent. The Prime Minister is expected to provide further details on the budget soon.</p>

          <p>A 12-meter aircraft crashed and caught fire at London Southend Airport, prompting a major emergency response and the cancellation of all remaining flights for the day. Eyewitnesses described seeing the plane bank sharply immediately after takeoff before inverting and hitting the ground in a "huge fireball." Emergency services, including police and fire crews, secured the scene and asked the public to avoid the area while the investigation begins. The airport confirmed a "serious incident" occurred and will provide more information as it becomes available.</p>

          <p>Italy's Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon championship, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a high-quality, four-set final. The victory marks a significant moment for the 23-year-old world number one, who avenged a recent, painful loss to Alcaraz at the French Open. Sinner demonstrated remarkable composure and clinical play to end Alcaraz's 24-match winning streak on grass. The match is being hailed as another classic encounter in the burgeoning rivalry between the two dominant new forces in men's tennis.</p>

          <p>A rapidly expanding wildfire in the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The fire also damaged a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that forced firefighters to temporarily evacuate and hindered containment efforts.

The fires come as smoke from separate Canadian wildfires creates unhealthy air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing the final day of a significant heatwave, which saw record temperatures and led to several tragic incidents. At least four people died in separate incidents in Scotland after getting into trouble in rivers and lochs, and police in England are searching for a man missing in the River Thames. The heat has also led to an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland and hosepipe bans in parts of England. A cooler change with heavy rain is forecast, which is expected to bring relief but also new weather challenges.</p>

          <p>Iranian state media, close to the Revolutionary Guard, has reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained minor leg injuries during an Israeli airstrike on a secret underground facility in Tehran last month. The report claims that on June 16, multiple bombs targeted the facility where Iran's top leaders were holding an emergency meeting, trapping them until they escaped through a shaft. This Fars news agency report has not been independently verified, and Israel has not commented. The claim emerges amid ongoing tensions and questions about how Israel has gathered critical intelligence on Iranian officials and facilities.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend retaliatory tariffs against the United States that were set to take effect, hoping to negotiate a trade deal by an August 1 deadline. The move came after President Trump announced new 30% tariffs on EU goods would begin on that date, citing a need to move away from "persistent Trade Deficits." European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will continue to prepare countermeasures in case a deal is not reached. The decision provides a brief window to de-escalate the trade dispute.</p>

          <h2>Government Data Contradicts White House Rhetoric on Deporting 'Worst of the Worst'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of government data reveals a significant disconnect between the Trump administration's rhetoric and its actual immigration enforcement actions. While the White House claims to be targeting "dangerous criminals," the majority of individuals currently detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. According to the latest statistics, over 71% of ICE detainees have no criminal record, and of those who do, most convictions are for nonviolent offenses. This data, highlighted by policy centers, challenges the narrative that the administration's large-scale deportation program is primarily focused on removing violent offenders from the country.</p>

          <p>Following criticism over the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that President Trump intends to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) rather than eliminate it. Noem defended the administration's handling of the disaster as the "best response... in many, many years," despite reports of thousands of unanswered calls to FEMA's assistance line. Critics argue that FEMA's capacity has been eroded under Trump, with thousands of staff departures and cuts to grant programs, raising concerns about its ability to handle future disasters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte as the administration signals a new strategy to arm Ukraine. The plan involves selling U.S. weapons to NATO allies, who can then transfer their existing, compatible equipment to Ukraine more quickly. This approach comes as the White House and a bipartisan group of senators are also pushing for heavy sanctions against Russia and its economic partners. The meeting and policy shift suggest a significant turning point in the U.S. approach to the war, moving toward more aggressive military and economic pressure on Moscow.</p>

The strike comes amid an escalation of Israeli attacks across Gaza and reports from the Red Cross of an overwhelming number of mass casualty cases.

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the administration's proposed 50% tariff on Brazil, even while acknowledging the U.S. has a trade surplus with the country. Hassett framed the move as part of a broader global strategy to onshore production and reduce the overall U.S. trade deficit, which he described as a national security risk. When pressed on how a criminal case against Brazil's former president constitutes a security threat, Hassett pivoted to the administration's overall strategy. The defense highlights the administration's unconventional and often politically-driven approach to international trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>
