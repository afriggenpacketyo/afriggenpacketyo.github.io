          <p>London Stansted Airport faced significant delays on Sunday morning due to an IT issue that affected check-in, baggage handling, and security systems. Passengers reported long queues stretching outside the terminal building, with some missing their flights as a result. The airport acknowledged the problem on X, stating that engineers were working to resolve the issue and advising passengers to stay in contact with their airlines for updates. While the IT problem was eventually resolved, residual delays continued to affect both arrivals and departures throughout the morning. The incident caused considerable disruption and frustration for travelers at the Essex airport.</p>

          <p>The United States and Mexico are nearing a potential agreement to permanently resolve the decades-long sewage crisis affecting waters off the coast of San Diego. EPA chief Lee Zeldin announced that a proposed '100% solution' has been transmitted to Mexico, with technical groups from both nations scheduled to meet and work out the details. The sewage problem, exacerbated by Tijuana's growing population and outdated infrastructure, has threatened San Diego's tourism industry, posed a national security risk to Navy SEAL training, and caused illnesses among residents. The proposed solution aims to update infrastructure and water management facilities to stop the flow of sewage into U.S. waters and clean up existing contamination.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States held a fourth round of negotiations in Muscat, Oman, regarding Iran's nuclear program, aiming to make progress toward a diplomatic resolution. Both countries have expressed a desire to resolve their long-standing dispute, with Iran seeking the lifting of U.S. sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear activities. However, significant disagreements persist on critical issues, including the dismantling of Iran's nuclear facilities, which Iran has stated is non-negotiable. The negotiations are mediated by Omani officials and involve high-level representatives from both countries, taking place as President Trump prepares to travel to the Middle East and has threatened military action if talks fail.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan shares his thoughts on Mother's Day, expressing his love for his own mother and honoring his wife, but humorously suggests the creation of "Father's Day Month." Gaffigan envisions a 35-day celebration of fathers, starting after Mother's Day, with alternating days of presents and communication fasts from Dad. He acknowledges the impracticality of the idea but emphasizes the importance of celebrating fathers, encouraging Dad jokes and lighthearted appreciation.

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy intends to reduce flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport for the next several weeks due to ongoing issues including radar outages and air traffic controller shortages. Duffy plans to meet with airlines to determine the extent of the reduction, with international arrival times experiencing larger reductions. The goal is to ensure that passengers can be confident their flights will depart as scheduled, minimizing delays and cancellations. The Trump administration is also proposing a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the air traffic control system and considering raising the retirement age for air traffic controllers to address staffing shortages.</p>

Prior to the conclave, Cardinal Jean-Paul Vesco did not mention any names when asked about potential candidates. Papal biographer Austen Ivereigh predicted Prevost's election, citing his ability to combine evangelization, statesmanship, and governance.

          <p>Britain is experiencing a surge in wildfires due to an unusually dry spring, with blazes erupting across Scotland, Wales, and England. A large forest fire near Fauldhouse, Scotland, required a significant firefighting effort, while wildfires also broke out near Maerdy in southwest Wales and in Dartmoor, Devon, England. The UK has seen more land burned by wildfires by the end of April than in any full year over the past decade, amplified by the driest start to spring since 1956. The European Union's Copernicus climate service has issued drought warnings for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, with England's Environment Agency warning of a medium risk of drought this summer.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release on bail, citing concerns that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated. Ozturk's lawyers argued that the Trump administration detained her based on an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Supporters, including Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, celebrated Ozturk's release and emphasized the importance of protecting free speech and due process rights.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the 10% baseline tariff rate on imports is expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future, aligning with President Trump's previous statements. Lutnick rejected concerns that consumers would bear the increased costs, asserting that businesses and foreign countries would ultimately pay. However, data suggests that businesses are already attempting to pass costs onto consumers, and consumer confidence has declined since the tariff announcement. Lutnick maintains that domestically produced products without tariffs will allow American consumers to finally have fair competition in the market.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have seemingly de-escalated after a four-day conflict, but new military technology and entrenched religious nationalism could signal more frequent battles ahead. The recent clash involved airstrikes, antiaircraft volleys, and weaponized drones, marking a new level of military engagement between the two nations. International diplomacy played a crucial role in averting further escalation, but the political realities in both countries remain unchanged, with strong nationalist sentiments driving an uncompromising approach to the conflict. The crisis was triggered by a terror attack in Kashmir, leading to retaliatory actions and heightened military alert.</p>

          <h2>AI's Impact on Job Replacement Still Distant, Experts Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite growing interest in artificial intelligence, experts caution that AI is not yet capable of replacing human workers in most industries. A recent survey revealed that many business leaders who laid off employees in anticipation of AI taking over their jobs now regret the decision. While AI platforms enhance search capabilities, they are not reliable enough to handle core business operations without human oversight. Small and mid-sized businesses face challenges in implementing AI due to technology limitations, data security concerns, and high costs, making widespread job replacement unlikely in the near future.</p>
