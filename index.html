          <p>Elon Musk took to his social media platform X to denounce President Trump's tax-and-spending-cut bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" that will significantly increase the federal budget deficit. Musk, who previously led the Trump administration's efforts to reduce government spending, expressed his dismay and criticized those who voted in favor of the bill. The White House dismissed Musk's criticism, while Representative Thomas Massie, a fiscal hawk, supported Musk's stance, with Trump defending the bill by asserting it would spur growth, highlighting the ongoing debate over fiscal policy and its potential impact on the national debt. The article underscores the tension between economic growth and fiscal responsibility in current political discourse. Optimism for the future of economic stability based on this article is not high. </p>

          <p>Senator Jim Banks is introducing legislation to classify visa overstays as "illegal entry" in response to the Boulder, Colorado terror attack allegedly committed by an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa.

Banks cites the Boulder attack and the 9/11 hijackers as examples of the dangers posed by visa overstays. The proposed legislation seeks to address concerns about national security and immigration enforcement, potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of individuals who overstay their visas annually. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is considering renaming several naval ships, including the USNS Harvey Milk, named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. Documents obtained by CBS News reveal that ships named after Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Harriet Tubman, and others are also on the renaming list. The proposal to rename the ships is reportedly aimed at realigning the U.S. military with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture." The potential name change has sparked controversy, with critics accusing the administration of erasing the legacies of those who fought for equality and justice. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially reversing decades-old U.S. immigration policy. The proposal would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS can decide all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a goal considered difficult to achieve given current backlogs. This move is seen as an effort to deter migrants from exploiting the asylum system for employment purposes. Advocates worry that this would prevent migrants from supporting themselves and push them into the underground economy. </p>

          <p>German customs officials have reported a significant increase in online deliveries from China, with e-commerce driving a surge in the number of items processed. In 2024, customs dealt with 235 million online deliveries, with 90% originating from China. The rise in cheap goods and counterfeit products has prompted discussions about abolishing the existing tariff limit on imports. The customs office has also seized a substantial amount of weapons and drugs, including cocaine and marijuana. </p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook expressed concerns that President Trump's trade policies could increase inflation and negatively impact the labor market. Cook noted that while inflation has shown progress, tariffs could make further progress difficult. She also stated that recent experience with high inflation could make firms more willing to raise prices. Cook's comments come ahead of the Fed's upcoming policy meeting, where interest rates are expected to remain unchanged. </p>

In related news, the head of the UN's nuclear safety watchdog said that the conditions for restarting Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant do not currently exist due to a lack of water for cooling and an absence of a stable power supply. Grossi said the Russians have "never hidden the fact" that they want to restart the plant, and before the plant's machinery, which has been inoperable for three years, can be restarted, it must undergo a thorough inspection. The nuclear plant, located in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, was occupied by Russia in March 2022 shortly after the country launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </p>

          <h2>OECD Warns Public Debt and Trade Tensions Weaken UK Economic Growth</h2>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has cut its expectations for UK economic growth this year, citing US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt. The OECD lowered its forecast to 1.3% from 1.4%, attributing the slowdown to trade tensions and the UK's "very thin" buffer in public finances. The think tank urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to boost tax take and cut spending to strengthen public finances. While the OECD highlighted better-than-expected UK economic growth between January and March, it cautioned that "momentum is weakening" due to "deteriorating" business sentiment.

          <p>Holidaymakers in Fuengirola, Spain, were left "frightened" following a gangland double murder in a busy bar. Despite the severity of the crime, there was little visible police presence at the scene, contrasting with typical responses in Scotland. The victims, Ross Monaghan and Eddie Lyons Jnr, were shot dead in Monaghans Bar, prompting concerns from local officials about the need for more resources to combat organized crime. British tourists who had been in the bar described the surreal and unsettling atmosphere in the aftermath of the shooting. </p>
