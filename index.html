          <p>Critics contend that numerous global companies are strategically employing artificial intelligence as a convenient justification for recent job cuts, rather than AI solely driving efficiency gains. Experts from the Oxford Internet Institute suggest that many firms, some of which significantly overhired during the COVID-19 pandemic, might be "scapegoating" the technology to mask deeper business challenges and avoid accountability for past miscalculations. While AI integration is undoubtedly occurring, research from Yale University and the New York Fed indicates that widespread job displacement due to AI has not yet materialized on a mass scale, with many companies actually utilizing AI for employee retraining and creating new roles. This article explores the growing skepticism surrounding corporate narratives about AI-driven layoffs and the broader implications for employee trust and the future of work.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will repatriate two survivors from Ecuador and Colombia after a strike on what he termed a "drug-carrying submarine" in the Caribbean Sea. Trump stated that two others were killed in the incident, which he claimed involved a vessel laden with fentanyl and other narcotics. Colombian President Gustavo Petro condemned the strike as a "murder" and a violation of sovereignty, denying any drug ties and asserting the boat was adrift with engine failure. This incident marks at least the sixth U.S. strike in the region recently, drawing criticism from UN human rights experts who label them "extrajudicial executions."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A royal biographer asserts that Buckingham Palace's decision to allow Prince Andrew to renounce his remaining titles is merely "window dressing," failing to address the true gravity of his situation. Andrew Lownie, author of a critical book on the Yorks, argues that King Charles should have acted more decisively and sooner, including fully stripping his brother of all titles and removing him from Royal Lodge. Lownie emphasizes that Andrew continues to deny allegations related to Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting the Palace's actions are a PR move under government pressure rather than a genuine pursuit of accountability. The article suggests more damaging revelations are anticipated from the US.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many individuals in long-term relationships experience a decline in sexual desire and frequency after the initial passionate phase, a phenomenon psychologists attribute to shifting hormone levels. While early relationships are fueled by hormones that boost sex drive, later stages see an increase in bonding hormones like oxytocin, which can dampen libido. Experts emphasize that open communication about sexual preferences and understanding one's own sexuality are crucial for couples to navigate these changes effectively. The article also highlights gender differences in arousal and the importance of affection beyond just sex for relationship satisfaction, especially for women.</p>

          <p>Police in downtown Los Angeles declared an "unlawful assembly" and issued a dispersal order during a "No Kings Day" protest near the Metropolitan Detention Center.

          <p>Hamas has transferred the bodies of two more possible hostages to Israel, bringing the total of confirmed and potential remains returned to 12 since the Gaza peace plan took effect. The transfer occurs amidst ongoing tensions, particularly Israel's decision to keep the Rafah border crossing closed until Hamas fully complies with returning all abductees. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by the U.S. and signed by President Trump, stipulated the release of all living and deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees. This article highlights the fragile nature of the ceasefire and the complex, emotional process of recovering remains.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the commutation of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos' prison sentence for fraud, leading to his immediate release. Trump stated on Truth Social that Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison, where he was serving an 87-month sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. The commutation means Santos will no longer be required to pay restitution to his victims, a decision his attorney praised as showing "humanity." This controversial move has drawn criticism from figures like Congressman Nick LaLota, who argued Santos' crimes warranted a longer sentence and continued restitution.</p>

          <p>China has gained a significant strategic advantage in its trade relations with the West by establishing a "potassium railway" through landlocked Laos, securing a vital resource for its agricultural production.

This development highlights a shift in global resource control, as North America potentially loses a key "trump card" in its economic interactions with China.
