          <p>A tragic shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, with seventeen others, including fourteen children, injured during a morning Mass. The gunman, in his early 20s and armed with multiple weapons, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Police Chief Brian O’Hara described it as a "deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping," as law enforcement investigates a possible motive and social media accounts linked to the shooter. The community and officials expressed profound grief over the incomprehensible act.</p>

Toni gained viral fame after her birth video, and her name was chosen by her high-profile sponsor, footballer Antonio Rüdiger. This move is part of conservation efforts for pygmy hippos, an endangered species with fewer than 2,500 remaining in the wild.</p>

Draper expressed his commitment to prioritizing his health, writing on X, "I have to do what is right and look after myself."

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook faces allegations of mortgage fraud from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who claims she declared homes in two states as primary residences. President Trump announced her removal, but Cook's attorney plans a lawsuit, asserting Trump lacks authority. Experts highlight the difficulty in proving owner-occupancy mortgage fraud, which offers financial incentives like lower interest rates and tax benefits. Legal professionals note that proving intent to deceive, rather than mere mistake, is a significant challenge in court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite anticipation for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, credit card interest rates are not expected to fall significantly in the near future. The average APR on credit cards is currently near 22%, contributing to record-high consumer debt exceeding $1.2 trillion. Experts explain that Fed rate cuts take time to impact credit card rates, and issuers are hesitant to lower them due to rising delinquencies and persistent inflation. Consumers are advised to explore alternative strategies like balance transfers or debt management plans to reduce their interest costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store reversed its decision to introduce a new logo, returning to its original design after significant public outcry and a nearly $100 million dip in market value. The backlash stemmed from the removal of the "Uncle Herschel" character and the namesake barrel, which loyalists felt severed the brand from its folksy, homestyle image. President Trump publicly urged the company to revert, and Cracker Barrel acknowledged its misstep, stating it "could've done a better job sharing who we are." This incident highlights the challenges legacy brands face when attempting modern rebrands while maintaining customer connection.</p>

          <p>Sting is facing a lawsuit from his former Police bandmates, guitarist Andy Summers and drummer Stewart Copeland, who claim unpaid songwriting royalties for the hit song "Every Breath You Take."

The Police, known for their chart-topping success before disbanding in 1984, reunited for a lucrative tour in 2007 despite a history of internal acrimony. This legal challenge follows Sting's recent sale of his entire songwriting catalog for an estimated $300 million.</p>

          <p>Recent studies on basic income initiatives, which gained traction as a solution for economic justice, have found that unrestricted cash transfers to the poor did not consistently produce lasting improvements in mental health, stress, or financial well-being. This has sparked renewed debate on the policy's merit, with critics on the right questioning its efficacy and advocates on the left emphasizing its role in poverty reduction and basic security, not as a cure-all. While some optimism for cash transfers has waned, ongoing experiments and broader research still highlight their importance in providing material support, keeping families housed, and improving health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Recent changes to the federal student loan system, including the passage of President Trump's "big beautiful bill," have made it challenging for borrowers to obtain accurate information and assistance. Many borrowers report conflicting guidance and long wait times when attempting to contact the Department of Education or loan servicers. Experts recommend calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center early on weekdays or using its live chat, or contacting specific loan servicers directly for account-related inquiries. Nonprofits like The Institute of Student Loan Advisors also offer free advice, as borrowers are urged to monitor official websites for updates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced an increase in the bonus for staff who identify passengers with oversized cabin bags, raising it from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag starting in November. O'Leary stated the measure aims to deter a minority of passengers from exceeding size limits, emphasizing that the airline is "not trying to catch people out." The airline also removed an €80 monthly cap on these earnings. This policy change, along with a slight increase in allowed bag dimensions due to new EU rules, seeks to ensure compliance, improve boarding times, and reduce flight delays.</p>

The discovery at the long-abandoned oasis city of Mamshit offers a tangible connection to a vanished civilization and speaks to the constant evolution of societies.
