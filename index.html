          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' expectations of 1.9%, despite a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. Manufacturing and construction sectors saw softened growth, though global AI investment is projected to support manufacturing, and infrastructure spending will benefit construction and financial services. The central bank, while maintaining current policy, forecasts a moderation to a near-trend pace in 2026 due to external developments. Non-oil domestic exports declined significantly in August, particularly to the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

Negotiations for subsequent phases will address these thornier topics, with proposals for an international body overseeing Palestinian technocrats and an Arab-led security force.

The process, often criticized as gerrymandering, is legal unless racially motivated, but its explicit partisan intent is unusual.

          <p>Donna Adelson, the 75-year-old matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, has been sentenced to life in prison for the 2014 murder-for-hire of her former son-in-law, Daniel Markel. Markel, a Florida State University law professor, was gunned down amid a bitter custody dispute with Adelson's daughter. Adelson, convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation, maintained her innocence in an emotional courtroom statement, claiming a miscarriage of justice. Circuit Judge Stephen Everett noted her "utter lack of remorse" while handing down the life sentence, with additional consecutive years for other counts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 495, significantly easing the process for fire victims to claim personal property losses. Under the new law, survivors whose residences are totally destroyed can receive 60% of their personal property coverage, up to $350,000, without submitting an itemized list. This streamlines relief, extending the claim filing period to at least 100 days. Newsom also signed SB 429, funding the nation's first public wildfire catastrophe model, which will provide a transparent benchmark for insurance companies' proprietary models used in rate setting, addressing concerns about climate change and equitable outcomes.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans fear significant increases in their healthcare costs as Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) premium tax credits are set to expire at year-end, becoming a central point in the US government shutdown battle. Families like Shana Verstegen's, who save hundreds monthly, face unaffordable premiums if subsidies end, potentially leading to widespread loss of health insurance. Health policy experts warn that inaction before November 1st could cause average prices to double, particularly impacting working-class individuals in Republican-leaning states that haven't expanded Medicaid. Some Republicans are now advocating for their extension.</p>

          <p>Several prominent news organizations, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and CNN, have formally refused to sign a new Pentagon policy that demands journalists pledge not to obtain unauthorized material and restricts access. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's policy, criticized as undermining First Amendment protections, requires media outlets to agree by Tuesday or lose credentials. News outlets argue the rules stifle a free press and intimidate sources, while Hegseth dismisses their concerns as a "meltdown." The Pentagon Press Association warned the policy could expose journalists to prosecution for doing their jobs.</p>

          <p>A UK minister has stated that National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell did not make decisions regarding evidence in the collapsed spy case against two men accused of spying for China. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry were unexpectedly dropped after prosecutors cited the inability to define China as a "national security threat" at the time of alleged offenses. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of deliberately collapsing the case to "curry favour" with China. The government maintains the decision rested with the Crown Prosecution Service, hindered by antiquated legislation, now updated by the 2023 National Security Act.</p>
