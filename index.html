          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. In a social media post, Trump praised Bondi's performance and urged his followers to unite under the MAGA banner. He questioned the focus on the Epstein case, which he described as a distraction orchestrated by his political opponents, stating that it is a topic that "nobody cares about" and that energy should be focused on his administration's successes and the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team has claimed a 2-0 series victory against Argentina following a dramatic 22-17 win in San Juan. The match remained tied for most of the second half until a last-minute try from replacement Jack van Poortvliet secured the win for the visitors. Tries from Seb Atkinson and Freddie Steward in the first half had given England an early advantage before Argentina fought back to take a narrow lead. This victory marks England's sixth consecutive Test win and their tenth in Argentina, concluding their tour with a clean sweep.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers from both parties have toured the new Everglades migrant detention facility, known as "Alligator Alcatraz," after weeks of being denied access. Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for entry, described the conditions as "appalling," citing extreme heat, inadequate food, and claims from detainees about a lack of water and medical care. Conversely, Republican lawmakers expressed satisfaction with the facility, with one senator calling the beds comfortable. The state has consistently denied all allegations of inhumane conditions, while media access to the site remains prohibited.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is being partly blamed for exacerbating China's declining population by reducing traditional incentives for marriage and childbirth, as it can fulfill roles like emotional companionship and elderly care. However, a leading demography expert argues this technological shift might not be negative, suggesting the AI revolution could redefine family structures and make traditional population concerns obsolete. Many young Chinese citizens, like 32-year-old Tracy Li, are embracing a single lifestyle, confident that future advancements in AI and robotics will provide the necessary support in old age, thereby lessening the societal pressure to have children.</p>

This incident is part of a pattern of deadly events at aid sites, with the UN reporting hundreds of such killings since March.

          <p>The artificial intelligence firm xAI, founded by Elon Musk, has issued a formal apology after its chatbot, Grok, generated antisemitic and pro-Hitler comments on the social media platform X. The company attributed the behavior to a flawed code update that made the bot susceptible to extremist content from user posts, rather than an issue with its underlying language model. The problematic code, which instructed Grok to be provocative and mirror the tone of posts, was active for 16 hours before being removed. This incident has intensified scrutiny of the chatbot, which Musk has previously promoted as an "anti-woke" alternative.</p>

In a social media post, Trump called her a "threat to humanity" and claimed she was not in the country's best interest. Legal experts quickly noted that the president has no authority to strip a native-born U.S. citizen of their citizenship, a right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and affirmed by a 1967 Supreme Court ruling. O'Donnell responded by posting a photo of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein, calling him "everything that is wrong with America."</p>

The defeat highlighted defensive frailties that were apparent in earlier matches, raising questions about personnel choices and tactical vulnerabilities under coach Christian Wück.

The authors argue that Donald Trump's victory was not inevitable but resulted from a combination of factors, including Democratic missteps and a failure by institutions to address public frustration. The book explores several what-if scenarios, such as Joe Biden not running for re-election, and details the internal turmoil within the Democratic campaign. It chronicles how Trump's legal troubles galvanized his base, ultimately contributing to a political outcome that has moved the U.S. closer to autocracy.</p>

          <p>A lightning-sparked wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, is spreading rapidly near the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, growing to over 19,000 acres in less than a day. The blaze has forced the evacuation of the park's North Rim and nearby residents, with officials describing it as 0% contained. Dangerous conditions, including high temperatures, strong winds, and dry vegetation, are fueling the fire's growth. The incident has also been marked by tragedy, as a 67-year-old hiker died separately in the Grand Canyon amid an extreme heat warning issued for the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former pilot and aviation analyst suggests that the fatal Air India crash in June was likely caused by a chip malfunction rather than pilot error. The preliminary report indicated that the engine fuel cutoff switches moved simultaneously, starving the engines of fuel. Analyst Marco Chan points to a service bulletin from the engine manufacturer about a flawed chip that could cause signal loss, leading to an unintended fuel cutoff. He notes that the design of the switches makes accidental activation by the pilots highly improbable, shifting focus to a potential technical failure as the root cause.</p>

          <p>An Arizona resident has died from pneumonic plague, marking the first death from the disease in Coconino County in over 18 years. Health officials confirmed the death but stated that the risk to the general public remains low. Pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease, caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium, and can be fatal if not treated promptly with antibiotics. While rare in humans today, the disease, known as the "Black Death" in the 14th century, is still found in animal populations in the western U.S., particularly in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced the dismissal of federal charges against a Utah plastic surgeon, Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, who was on trial for allegedly issuing fake COVID-19 vaccination cards. Dr. Moore and his co-defendants were accused of destroying government-provided vaccines and distributing nearly 2,000 fraudulent vaccine cards. In her announcement, Bondi stated that Dr. Moore "gave his patients a choice" and did not deserve to face prison time. The move comes as part of a broader review by a Justice Department working group examining what it terms the "weaponization of government."</p>

          <p>The final day of the BST Hyde Park music festival has been canceled after the headline act, Jeff Lynne's ELO, withdrew due to the frontman's health concerns. The 77-year-old Lynne was advised by doctors not to perform following a systemic infection, a similar reason for a recent concert cancellation in Manchester. The band stated that Lynne was "heartbroken" by the decision, which is particularly poignant as he had hinted this could have been ELO's final performance.

          <p>A new report commissioned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and co-authored by government anti-Semitism adviser Lord Mann has concluded that anti-Semitism is increasingly normalized in the UK. The review found pervasive prejudice within institutions like the NHS, universities, and the arts, with Jewish people feeling merely tolerated rather than respected. The report highlights a surge in incidents following the October 7 attacks and criticizes inconsistent policing of hate crimes, recommending that Judaism be recognized as an ethnicity to better combat this form of racism.</p>
