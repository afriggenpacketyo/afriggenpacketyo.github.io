          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees in several divisions, including Search, Ads, Commerce, Marketing, Research, Communications, and Central Engineering, as part of ongoing efforts to reduce headcount since the 2023 layoffs. The "voluntary exit program" is available to U.S.-based employees, and some teams are requiring remote workers near offices to adopt hybrid work schedules. This move follows CFO Anat Ashkenazi's October announcement prioritizing cost-cutting measures as Google increases spending on AI infrastructure for 2025, while also overhauling internal learning platforms to focus on AI tool training. Google's Knowledge and Information unit, housing search and ads, has about 20,000 employees and underwent reorganization in October. Optimism in the company's strategy may determine whether or not employees take the buyout. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McDonald's shares experienced a drop after Redburn Atlantic downgraded the stock due to the increasing popularity of weight-loss drugs like GLP-1s, which could significantly impact the fast-food chain's earnings. The analysis suggests that McDonald's could potentially lose up to 28 million customer visits, resulting in a revenue loss of $482 million annually, primarily affecting lower-income consumers who are more sensitive to changes in eating habits influenced by these drugs. Inflationary pressures and strained consumer budgets further exacerbate challenges for McDonald's, as consumers show signs of pricing fatigue, but BTIG analysts argue that McDonald's core customer base is unlikely to afford GLP-1 drugs, minimizing the near-term impact. Wider adoption of these drugs could reverse the trend of increased caloric intake at restaurants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the ongoing protests in Los Angeles during a speech at Fort Bragg, celebrating the Army's 250th birthday, where he criticized the demonstrations as "anarchy" and claimed, without providing evidence, that paid "insurrectionists" and "criminal invaders" were responsible for the unrest. Trump defended his administration's response, including the deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines, despite objections from California Governor Gavin Newsom, asserting that he would not allow the country to be destroyed by invasion and lawlessness. He described the protests as an assault on peace and national sovereignty carried out by rioters bearing foreign flags, aiming to continue a foreign invasion of the country. His remarks underscore the administration's stance on immigration and the use of federal force to quell domestic unrest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that "any" protesters at the military parade in Washington, D.C., would be "met with heavy force," coinciding with the Army's 250th anniversary and his own birthday celebrations. This statement followed his decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, while military vehicles were being prepared near the National Mall for the parade. Despite concerns over potential clashes, Army spokesman Steve Warren affirmed the service's commitment to upholding democratic values and peaceful protests, clarifying that they would not engage in crowd control, while the Secret Service and Washington officials monitored nine planned small protests, emphasizing that any violence or law-breaking would trigger intervention from law enforcement agencies. The parade will feature a display of military might, including tanks, aircraft, and thousands of soldiers, meant to showcase the U.S. military's strength and historical victories.</p>

          <p>Labor leader David Huerta, president of SEIU California and SEIU-USWW, was arrested for allegedly obstructing federal officers while protesting an immigration raid in Los Angeles and was later released on bond after spending three days in custody. The arrest occurred during demonstrations against immigration raids, prompting the Trump administration to deploy thousands of National Guardsmen and Marines to the area, with Huerta charged with conspiracy to impede an officer, a felony carrying a potential six-year prison sentence. Critics, including union leaders and Democratic U.S. House members, have condemned the arrest as an attempt to suppress protesters and criminalize peaceful demonstrations, while Huerta maintains his focus remains on immigrants detained in LA, emphasizing the impact of the protests on those in custody. Huerta's history includes decades of advocacy for workers and immigrants, including leading organizing campaigns and promoting immigrant worker integration.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton faced criticism for describing the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles as "peaceful demonstrations" in an X post, while blaming President Donald Trump for sowing "chaos" in Southern California, prompting mockery from conservative commentators. Critics pointed out that Clinton restricted comments on her post to accounts she follows, accompanied by footage of the destruction in LA, with popular conservative X account Libs of TikTok highlighting the perceived disconnect between her words and the reality of the situation. The message was in response to Clinton posting her first and only comment as of Tuesday morning regarding the Los Angeles riots, describing them as "peaceful demonstrations" before Trump mobilized the National Guard over the weekend. This incident underscores the ongoing debate over the portrayal of protests and the role of political figures in shaping public perception.</p>

          <p>The rise of AI and generative-AI tools is flooding the world with content, making the ability to discern meaningful and resonant variations increasingly valuable. Taste, described as judgment with style, is the instinct that guides decisions on what should be done, shaping culture and reinforcing organizational aspirations. Unlike AI, which mimics styles from vast datasets, taste is cultivated through exposure, curation, and reflection, representing the human fingerprint on decision-making. As AI takes over mechanical and intellectual labor, the skill of knowing which option to choose becomes crucial, with good taste demanding integrity and ethical awareness, recognizing the difference between edginess and offensiveness.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has refuted allegations made by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who claimed Sheinbaum encouraged protests in Los Angeles. Noem's comments followed a question to President Trump about Sheinbaum's reaction to the unrest, with Noem asserting that Sheinbaum supported more protests. Sheinbaum responded on X, calling the accusation "Absolutely false" and sharing a clip from her news conference where she condemned violence and called on the Mexican community to act peacefully. Sheinbaum also reiterated her support for Mexican immigrants in the United States, emphasizing dialogue and respect as the best path forward.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to promptly block President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration raids. State Attorney General Rob Bonta argued that a temporary restraining order is necessary to prevent immediate harm to the state's sovereignty and escalating tensions. Newsom asserts that Trump's actions are unwarranted and stoking more fear and civil unrest, while Trump defends the deployments by claiming Los Angeles would be burning without federal intervention. The lawsuit highlights the conflict between state and federal authority, with Newsom arguing that Trump federalized the California National Guard without his consent, in violation of the law.</p>

After recovering from these experiences, Joel realized he could channel his emotions into music, which helped him cope with his struggles. He reconnected with Elizabeth Weber, the woman at the center of the affair, wrote about her in "Piano Man," and married her, underscoring his transformation of personal pain into creative expression.</p>

Huckabee suggested that any future Palestinian entity could be carved out of a Muslim country rather than requiring Israel to cede territory, indicating a departure from the long-standing two-state solution. Analysts suggest that Huckabee's comments reflect the Trump administration's support for Israeli settlement expansion and a broader commitment to Palestinian erasure, both physical and political. This shift creates diplomatic complications for U.S. allies and underscores the changing dynamics of U.S.-Israel relations.</p>

          <p>A major international study involving nearly 300,000 children has revealed a two-way relationship between screen time and emotional well-being, indicating that increased use of devices like TVs, tablets, and gaming consoles is associated with a higher risk of aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Conversely, children with existing social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens, with gaming consoles showing stronger links to emotional problems compared to other screen activities. While moderate screen time for educational purposes poses a lower risk, exceeding recommended limits is linked to socioemotional issues, emphasizing the importance of balancing screen time with physical activity and social interaction. The study advocates for setting limits on screen time to prevent interference with sleep and other essential activities.</p>

Psychologists distinguish between passionate love, the initial rush of infatuation, and compassionate love, which develops over time, noting that quick connections do not guarantee lasting relationships. Despite the potential for unrealistic expectations, the survey suggests that singles remain optimistic about finding lasting love, with many holding onto destiny beliefs and a desire for extraordinary partnerships.</p>
