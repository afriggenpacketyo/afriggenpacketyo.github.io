          <h2>Trump Announces Direct Talks with Iran to Commence Soon</h2>

          <p>President Trump, during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, declared that the United States would begin direct talks with Iran starting this coming Saturday. Trump emphasized that reaching a deal would be preferable to military action, though he acknowledged the situation was becoming increasingly dangerous. The announcement marks the first direct engagement between the U.S. and Iran since the 2015 nuclear deal, a move that comes after Iran previously rejected an offer for direct talks. Trump has previously threatened military action to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, signaling the high stakes of these upcoming negotiations.</p>

          <p>An 80-year-old man, John Lee, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and negligent discharge of a firearm after allegedly shooting and killing a fellow turkey hunter in Northern California.

          <p>Karen Read has filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court to halt her retrial for the murder of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, arguing it violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.

The first trial ended in a mistrial after the jury deadlocked, and Read has maintained her innocence, denying allegations that she hit O'Keefe with her vehicle and left him to die in a blizzard.</p>

          <p>UBS analysts estimate that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a significant price hike for Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max in the U.S., potentially reaching $350. The increase, nearly 30% of the retail price, would affect units manufactured in China. Shares of Apple have already declined sharply amid concerns that tariffs will force the company to raise prices as consumers lose buying power. Other analysts predict that Apple may raise prices globally or face a substantial cut to earnings per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Long-term care insurance can help cover the costs associated with extended care services that are typically not covered by regular health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. This insurance addresses the costs associated with assistance for daily living activities, such as bathing, dressing, eating, and mobility, when individuals can no longer perform these tasks independently due to aging, chronic illness, disability, or cognitive impairment. The decision on whether long-term care insurance is worth it hinges largely on your financial situation and personal risk factors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bonds are serving their traditional role as a lower-risk option for investors amidst a market crash driven by concerns over President Trump's tariffs. Actively managed bond ETFs have outperformed indexed bond funds more consistently than active stock managers historically, possibly justifying higher management fees for increased return potential. This shift towards active bond management reflects investors' desire for strategies that can navigate the complexities of the current market environment, as swift changes in treasury bond yields amid the Fed's inflation fight were part of the reason that a more active hand in bonds worked well in 2024.

The meeting is the first effort by a foreign leader to negotiate a deal after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs, including a 17% tariff on Israeli goods. Netanyahu emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship during this time. During Netanyahu’s last visit in February, Trump shocked the world by proposing to take over the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>The US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) is ending its long-standing partnerships with the federal government to serve refugees and children due to funding cuts. This decision follows the Trump administration's halt of funding for refugee resettlement, which the bishops describe as a "heartbreaking" development. The move will likely result in reduced services for those in need, and the bishops are seeking alternative means of support. The bishops had previously sued the Trump administration over the funding halt, but a federal judge ruled against them.</p>

          <p>U.S. oil prices fell by approximately 2% on Monday, extending last week's losses due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. U.S. crude oil closed at $60.70 per barrel, while Brent settled at $64.21. JPMorgan has raised its odds of a recession this year to 60% following the tariff rollout. Trump has touted the fall in oil prices, but worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, which could lead to a slowdown in economic activity that would ultimately hurt demand for oil.</p>
