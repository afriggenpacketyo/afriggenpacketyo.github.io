          <p>A new NPR series, "The World, Reordering," examines the fracturing of the post-WWII liberal international order, which was long defined by globalization and U.S. leadership. The article notes that as authoritarian powers resurge and U.S. influence appears to wane under policies like tariffs and skepticism toward alliances, many countries are forging new paths. This series curates reporting from international correspondents to understand the complex dynamics at play, suggesting that current global disorder may be the foundation for a new system of international relations.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz defended his government's decision to suspend exporting offensive arms to Israel that could be used in its war in Gaza, citing concerns over civilian casualties. The move, which comes as Israel plans to take over Gaza City, has been met with sharp criticism from within Merz's own conservative CDU/CSU bloc, though it is supported by his coalition partners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Merz of buckling to media pressure, highlighting a significant policy shift for one of Israel's staunchest allies.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb, despite sitting out the team's first preseason game, was penalized for sideline interference after a bizarre collision. While celebrating a play, Lamb inadvertently ran into a sideline official who was focused on the game. According to the referee, Lamb was standing in the restricted white border area designated for officials, resulting in an automatic foul. Neither individual was injured in the unexpected encounter, which provided a strange moment in the Cowboys' loss to the Los Angeles Rams.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pro-Israel demonstrators marched through central London, led by the UK's chief rabbi, to demand the release of hostages held in Gaza and show support for the country. Many protesters expressed anger at the UK government's conditional plan to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a concession to Hamas. The event, which featured Israeli flags and placards with hostages' faces, was largely peaceful, although the Metropolitan Police made one arrest and managed minor scuffles with a few counter-protesters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is in turmoil over its accelerated approval of a costly gene therapy from Sarepta Therapeutics for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The $3.2 million treatment was approved by an FDA director despite internal reviewers' concerns about limited clinical data. Following the recent deaths of three patients from acute liver failure, the FDA has requested the company to suspend the drug's distribution, causing Sarepta's stock to lose nearly half its value and raising serious questions about the agency's approval process.</p>

The blaze occurred during a busy weekend with the Edinburgh festivals in full swing, prompting the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service to respond and police to urge the public to stay away. This event is part of a recent spate of wildfires in Scotland, which has experienced an unusually warm and dry summer, leading to multiple water scarcity and fire warnings across the country.</p>

          <p>The Canyon Fire, which burned nearly 5,400 acres along the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, has been brought to 62% containment. The blaze, which was fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, prompted thousands of evacuations and resulted in a major injury to a Kern County firefighter whose truck rolled down a steep hillside. Favorable weather conditions have since allowed the 1,100 deployed firefighters to make significant progress in suppressing the fire, leading to the lifting of all evacuation orders.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark: The Enigma of Dame Muriel," re-examines the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her identity as one of modern Britain's most important religious writers is often obscured by her reputation for wit. The article explores how Spark, a Roman Catholic convert, used narrative devices like an omniscient, god-like authorial voice to explore themes of faith, divine judgment, and free will. Her signature use of prolepsis, or revealing a character's fate early on, forced readers to focus on causality and meaning.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond have forcefully dismissed claims in Nicola Sturgeon's upcoming memoir that he may have leaked details of the sexual misconduct investigation against him. Members of the Alba party, which Salmond founded, labeled the suggestion a "fabrication" and "hypocrisy." The explosive claim reignites the bitter feud that destroyed the once-dominant political partnership at the heart of the Scottish National Party and has led to renewed calls for a public inquiry into the government's handling of the case.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued a public apology after a shoe he created with Adidas Originals drew widespread criticism for cultural appropriation. The "Oaxaca Slip-On" was inspired by traditional Mexican leather sandals known as huaraches but was reportedly produced without consulting or crediting the Indigenous communities who originated the design. The backlash, which included comments from Mexico's president, prompted Chavarria to express deep regret for not developing the shoe in a "meaningful partnership" with the Oaxacan community.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old man and his family from Columbus, Ohio, quit their jobs to take a 13-month sabbatical in Taiwan after methodically saving $60,000 over five years. The primary motivation for the move was to allow their young son to build a strong bond with his paternal grandparents. The experience proved transformative, giving the couple time to re-evaluate their career paths and realize they could live a happier, more fulfilled life with less income and more flexibility, prioritizing family and well-being over corporate pressures.</p>

          <p>As generative AI empowers attackers with sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly drafting autonomous AI agents into their cybersecurity defense forces. These AI "teammates" can automate routine and time-consuming tasks like detection, analysis, and initial response, freeing up human professionals to focus on more complex threats. This trend is seen as an essential evolution to counter the speed and scale of AI-driven attacks and helps address the persistent talent shortage in the cybersecurity industry, augmenting rather than replacing human workers.</p>
