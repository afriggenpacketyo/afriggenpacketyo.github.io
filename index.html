        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over the past year, more than a third of Manhattan condo resales resulted in losses for owners, with median prices per square foot remaining flat over a decade. When factoring in inflation and high transaction costs, the actual share of losses is likely even higher, contrasting sharply with national home price increases seen elsewhere. This "lost decade" is attributed to factors like state and local tax deduction caps and new rent laws. Despite some current market upswings and bullish outlooks, many potential buyers are opting to rent due to high prices and political uncertainty, leading to a notable increase in high-income renters.

          <p>A new art exhibit in Los Angeles, "Monuments," featuring removed Confederate statues, is drawing strong criticism for its "barbaric desecration" of historical monuments. The exhibit, which includes a statue mutilated by an artist, is seen by some as an act of retribution targeting those who believe historical artifacts should be protected. Critics argue this approach mirrors past acts of cultural suppression and is directed against anyone who values the preservation of historical symbols. The article posits that this debate is less about the Confederacy's lingering presence and more about contemporary cultural battles over how history should be represented and respected in public spaces.</p>

          <p>Catherine Connolly, an independent candidate backed by Ireland's left-wing opposition, secured a landslide victory in the presidential election with over 64.7% of the vote. Her campaign focused on themes of "peace," "unity," and "neutrality." Connolly, a 68-year-old lawmaker from Galway, has been critical of the United States and the European Union, particularly regarding increased military spending and their roles in international conflicts. The election saw low voter turnout and a high number of spoiled ballots, reflecting widespread anger and dissatisfaction with all major parties, especially concerning issues like immigration and crime.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced for the New York City mayoral and New Jersey gubernatorial races, serving as potential indicators for the Democratic party's future strategy against Donald Trump's agenda. New York's mayoral contest features progressive Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Andrew Cuomo, with incumbent Eric Adams endorsing Cuomo after withdrawing. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli faces Democrat Mikie Sherrill. Both elections highlight issues of affordability, cost of living, and internal Democratic party divisions, with candidates clashing over policy proposals and controversial statements, including Mamdani's criticism of Israel.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media reports that President Xi Jinping personally led the team responsible for drafting the outline of the upcoming 15th five-year plan, pouring "a great deal of heart and blood into it." This direct involvement underscores Xi's personal stamp on China's future economic and social development strategies. The plan's formulation was informed by extensive fact-finding investigations conducted during Xi's tours across the country this year. The Politburo Standing Committee made multiple revisions before presenting the framework to the Central Committee for deliberation, signaling a highly centralized approach to national policy.</p>

          <p>A large piece of charred space debris, likely a rocket propellant tank, was discovered in a remote Australian desert, still burning. This incident underscores the increasing issue of space junk re-entering Earth's atmosphere, with experts speculating it originated from a Chinese Jielong rocket. While large pieces are rare, a surge in rocket launches and orbiting satellites means at least one piece of space debris falls daily. Past incidents, like debris crashing through a Florida home and onto a Canadian farm, suggest an underestimation of the threat, as modern composite materials behave unexpectedly during re-entry, posing a growing concern for safety and environmental pollution.</p>

          <p>Russian missile and drone attacks overnight into Saturday killed at least four people and wounded 20 in Ukraine, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew calls for additional Western air defense systems. In Kyiv, two fatalities and 13 injuries resulted from a ballistic missile strike, causing fires and damage to buildings. Another two people died and seven were wounded in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukraine's air force intercepted some of the nine missiles and 62 drones launched. Zelenskyy emphasized the critical need for more U.S. Patriot systems to protect Ukrainian cities from such ongoing "horror" and prevent further loss of life.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes President Donald Trump's unpermitted demolition of the White House's 123-year-old East Wing to make way for a $300 million ballroom. The author argues that Trump acts without regard for norms or laws, driven by personal desire and ego, and that the project, funded by private donors including major tech and defense companies, raises concerns about potential corruption. The article questions the timing of such a massive project given Trump's limited remaining term and speculates on his repeated teasing of a potential third term, suggesting a disregard for constitutional limits and democratic processes.</p>

          <p>Despite a dramatic 80% decline in active serial killers since the 1970s, America's fascination with them persists, often creating "monsters" where they don't exist, as seen in recent scares in Austin, New York, and Boston. Texas State University researchers found no evidence of a serial killer in Austin's lake drownings, attributing them to alcohol and drugs. Criminologists point to factors like reduced hitchhiking, increased cellphone use, and DNA technology as reasons for the decline in real-world serial killings. However, popular entertainment continues to fuel this obsession, highlighting society's need to understand the motivations behind extreme violence, even as mass shootings pose a more prevalent threat.</p>

This statement is viewed as a move by Beijing to assert its sovereignty over the self-ruled island, reinforcing the Chinese Communist Party's "unwavering determination" to achieve complete reunification.

With gold prices up over 50% in the past year, financial experts like Ray Dalio and Jeffrey Gundlach are advocating for gold as a portfolio diversifier and inflation hedge.

This marks another instance of Trump urging action against perceived political adversaries, following previous indictments of James Comey and Letitia James.
