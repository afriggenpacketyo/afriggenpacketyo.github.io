Despite economic challenges, Beijing continues to prioritize cultural initiatives, contrasting with Western countries that are cutting funding for cultural heritage.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to assess Russia's intentions in the ongoing peace talks with Ukraine. The call followed direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv, which resulted in a prisoner swap agreement but no ceasefire. Rubio expressed the need to determine if Russia is genuinely seeking peace or merely buying time, emphasizing that the U.S. is trying to achieve peace and end a costly war but cannot afford to waste time. He believes a face-to-face meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin is essential to move the talks forward, with the Vatican offering to host such discussions. </p>

While Democrats previously vouched for Biden's sharpness, the audio recording presents a contrasting portrayal of a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." The audio recording puts party leaders in the uncomfortable position of having to reconcile the man heard in Mr. Hurâ€™s interview with the forceful president they described in response to their votersâ€™ insistent questions. </p>
