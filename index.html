          <p>Russian airstrikes across Ukraine have resulted in at least 25 fatalities, targeting civilian infrastructure including a prison and a hospital. The deadliest attack occurred at the Bilenke penitentiary in the Zaporizhzhia region, where 16 inmates were killed. Other strikes hit people waiting for humanitarian aid in Kharkiv and a hospital in Dnipropetrovsk, killing a pregnant woman among others. Ukrainian President Zelensky has urged for tougher sanctions to compel Russia to cease the attacks, while U.S. President Trump issued a short deadline for a ceasefire, a warning that has so far not deterred Moscow's continued assaults.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group has issued a 2025 financial outlook that is significantly below Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to fall. The company cited persistently high medical costs, particularly within its Medicare Advantage plans, as a primary reason for the revised forecast. More seniors are undergoing procedures delayed during the pandemic, and outpatient and emergency care usage has accelerated faster than anticipated. The company now projects adjusted earnings of at least $16 per share for 2025, a substantial reduction from previous guidance, but expects to return to earnings growth in 2026.

          <h2>Understanding Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Amid Claims by NYC Shooting Suspect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:36:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head trauma, commonly found in athletes and military veterans. The suspect in the recent Manhattan office shooting, Shane Tamura, claimed in a note to have the condition, though there is no confirmation he was diagnosed. CTE can only be definitively diagnosed through a post-mortem autopsy, which involves examining brain tissue for specific changes in tau proteins. Symptoms, which appear years after the injuries, include memory loss, confusion, and mood changes, providing context for the gunman's alleged motive.</p>

          <p>The gunman responsible for a deadly shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building was reportedly targeting the National Football League's offices, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. A note found on the shooter, Shane Tamura, indicated he believed he suffered from CTE, a brain injury linked to contact sports, and blamed the NFL for his condition. Tamura, who had a history of mental health issues, mistakenly took the wrong elevator and opened fire in a different company's office, killing four people, including an NYPD officer, before taking his own life.</p>

          <p>A new study of a 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement in Turkey, Catalhoyuk, provides strong evidence of a society centered around women. Researchers analyzed DNA from skeletons buried under homes and discovered that related individuals were often connected through their mother's side, indicating a matrilineal and matrilocal system where men moved in with their female partner's family. This genetic evidence supports earlier theories based on female figurines found at the site. The findings, published in the journal Science, also revealed more grave goods with female bodies, further suggesting an elevated societal status for women.</p>

Soriot highlighted the U.S. as a key growth driver, projecting it will account for half of the company's revenue by 2030, and noted a $50 billion investment to bolster its American manufacturing and research. The statement came as the Anglo-Swedish firm reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, driven by strong demand for its cancer and biopharmaceutical drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage experts predict that interest rates are likely to remain relatively stable through August, as the Federal Reserve continues its cautious approach to managing inflation. The central bank is hesitant to lower its benchmark rate due to concerns that President Trump's tariff policies could fuel inflation, and a strong job market reduces the urgency for a cut. While a rate reduction is not anticipated this month, many analysts believe a cut could come at the Fed's September meeting. For homebuyers, this means that waiting for lower rates is uncertain, and doing so could lead to increased competition and prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research from hundreds of companies that have successfully transitioned to a four-day, 32-hour workweek reveals three common strategies for maintaining productivity. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, these companies focused on cutting down on inefficient meetings, re-engineering work processes to be more efficient, and eliminating low-impact tasks. By implementing these changes, businesses reported higher employee engagement and less burnout, along with increased profits and lower turnover. The findings suggest that a shorter workweek is achievable when companies intentionally redesign how work gets done.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece for The Guardian, columnist Arwa Mahdawi critiques recent efforts by some commentators to reframe Ghislaine Maxwell as a victim who received an unjust sentence. The author suggests this narrative shift may be a prelude to a potential presidential pardon by Donald Trump, possibly in exchange for information from Maxwell that benefits him. Mahdawi asserts that Maxwell was a key participant in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of underage girls, as her accusers have repeatedly stated, and not a victim herself. The article concludes that any pardon would be a political maneuver rather than an act of justice.</p>
