          <h2>Psychiatrist Offers Five Simple Parenting Rules for Raising Successful Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 11:46:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist with extensive experience working with young adults, shares five fundamental parenting principles aimed at simplifying the often-complex landscape of child-rearing. These rules emphasize trusting parental instincts over influencer trends, embracing cultural traditions instead of clickbait, and focusing on a child's individual interests rather than conforming to crowds. The advice also underscores the importance of prioritizing enjoyment over strict developmental milestones and being authentic rather than striving for perfection, all of which contributes to raising well-adjusted children. By following these guidelines, parents can reduce anxiety and create a nurturing environment for their children's growth. The main point is to be yourself, not your ideal self.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, edging out his McLaren teammate Lando Norris, suggesting that recent rule changes aimed at limiting front wing flexing have had little impact on McLaren's performance. Despite Red Bull's hopes that the changes would hinder McLaren, Piastri's performance demonstrated the car's strength, with the gap between pole position and Verstappen being larger than in previous races. Norris acknowledged errors on his final run, while Piastri credited the car's performance throughout the weekend, and Verstappen cited issues with tire preparation. The rule change had limited impact on McLaren and the way they prepared their car for the race.</p>

          <p>The European Union has criticized President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%, stating that it undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson announced that the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures in response to the tariff increase, which is set to take effect on June 4. The United Steelworkers union also criticized Trump's move, calling it a direct attack on Canadian industries and workers. The EU had previously paused countermeasures against the U.S. to allow time for negotiations, but those measures will automatically take effect on July 14 if no mutually acceptable solution is reached.</p>

While Euroclear and some EU governments express concerns about undermining Europe's reputation as a safe haven for investors, proponents argue that the extreme circumstances justify the action.

Tragically, at least 31 lightning-related deaths and 58 injuries have been reported in the past decade among fungus collectors.

          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog reported that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, urging Tehran to cooperate with the agency's probe. As of May 17, Iran has amassed 408.6 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 60%, a nearly 50% increase since February. The IAEA raised concerns, noting Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material. Israel responded that the report is a clear warning that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program, and the IAEA reiterated its call for Iran to fully cooperate with its investigation into uranium traces discovered at undeclared sites.</p>

A study found that wildfire smoke likely caused over 52,000 premature deaths in California from 2008 to 2018, resulting in an economic impact of over $430 billion. Wildfire smoke contains fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) and other chemicals that can cause both short-term and long-term health problems. Recommendations for staying safe include staying indoors, using air purifiers, wearing protective masks, and avoiding outdoor exercise on smoky days.</p>

          <p>Hailstones can grow to extreme sizes, causing significant damage to property and agriculture, and this article explores the science behind this weather phenomenon. Hail forms as ice crystals are swept into thunderstorm updrafts, colliding with supercooled water that freezes around them. Supercell thunderstorms, with their rotating and long-lived nature, are particularly prone to producing large hail. Climate change may be contributing to more frequent and intense hailstorms by increasing warm, humid air and unstable air masses, potentially leading to larger hail and reduced small hail.</p>
