          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to hold a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine. The meeting, anticipated to last several hours, will include one-on-one talks, delegation negotiations, and a joint press conference. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope for a peaceful resolution, Trump indicated that discussions about business deals with Russia would only occur if progress is made toward ending the conflict. The choice of Alaska is historically significant, as the territory was purchased from Russia by the U.S. in 1867.</p>

          <p>The Attorney General for Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit to challenge President Donald Trump's executive order placing the city's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. The suit argues the move is an unlawful overreach of presidential authority and infringes upon the District's right to self-governance. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing to consider the city's request for a temporary restraining order, which would pause the directive installing the DEA Administrator as the head of the D.C. police. The White House defended the action as necessary due to an alleged public safety emergency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Zillow analysis indicates that while the median price for a mansion in the U.S. has risen to $1.4 million, several cities still offer large homes for under $1 million. Metro areas such as Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; and Memphis, Tennessee, have median mansion prices below this threshold. This affordability contrasts sharply with coastal markets like San Jose, where the median mansion costs $6.5 million. The report notes that in 2021, nearly half of U.S. mansions were valued below $1 million, a figure that has now dropped to just three in ten.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has issued a temporary order preventing The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, from accepting new asylum seekers following a legal challenge by the local council. Epping Forest District Council argued that housing asylum seekers at the hotel created an "unacceptable" risk and led to significant community tension, including large protests. The legal action was prompted by an incident where a resident was charged with sexual assault. The hotel's owners contend that the injunction would cause hardship and that they have housed asylum seekers previously without issue.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Labour councillor Ricky Jones not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he made inflammatory remarks at an anti-racism rally. During the event, Jones was filmed calling for far-right activists' throats to be cut, a comment he claimed was not meant to be taken literally. He stated his remarks were directed at activists who had allegedly placed razor blades behind stickers on a train. The verdict has drawn criticism from some political figures who argue it represents an inconsistency in the justice system compared to other cases involving inciting language.</p>

The Justice Department has declined to comment on the matter, and the enforceability of the nearly century-old law in court remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee has indicated a sense of unease regarding potential interest rate cuts due to mixed inflation data and uncertainty over tariffs. While previously optimistic about a "golden path" of moderating inflation and a stable labor market, Goolsbee stated he needs more convincing data before the next policy meeting. Recent reports showed a slight increase in core consumer prices and a surprisingly high jump in producer prices, raising concerns about persistent inflation in the services sector. He emphasized that future rate decisions will depend heavily on upcoming economic reports clarifying the inflation outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

The investment from Berkshire, along with new positions from other notable investors like Michael Burry and David Tepper, is being interpreted as a significant vote of confidence in the company's future.

However, the football team will avoid a playoff ban. The investigation found that a former staffer orchestrated an extensive in-person scouting operation to film and decode opponents' signals over three seasons. In addition to the fine, the program faces sanctions including scholarship reductions, recruiting restrictions, and a four-year probation period.

The controversy arose after Boyne wrote an article celebrating J.K. Rowling and using controversial language regarding transgender issues, which Okundaye found abhorrent. He argues that the prize, which claims to support the entire LGBTQ+ community, contradicted its values by including a writer with trans-exclusionary views. The withdrawal, part of a larger boycott by over 16 authors and two judges, is a protest against the institution's principles rather than a personal attack on Boyne.</p>

The Idaho Department of Correction has acknowledged Kohberger's complaints but stated that communication between inmates is common.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing a record $1.21 trillion, many households are struggling to manage their balances amid high interest rates and inflation. For a typical $3,000 balance, the minimum monthly payment can range from $60 to $85, depending on the issuer's calculation method. Paying only the minimum can trap consumers in a long-term debt cycle, costing thousands in interest. To escape this, financial experts recommend strategies such as paying more than the minimum, utilizing balance transfer cards with 0% introductory APRs, or considering debt consolidation loans to secure a lower, fixed interest rate.

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials dropped over 13% after the company issued a weak financial forecast, citing reduced demand from China. The company's guidance for the current quarter fell short of analyst expectations, with CEO Gary Dickerson pointing to macroeconomic and trade-related uncertainties. Applied Materials noted that Chinese clients are slowing their spending after a period of rapid expansion, and the company is also experiencing weakness from leading-edge customers. Despite the poor outlook, the company's third-quarter earnings and revenue exceeded estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains have triggered devastating flash floods and landslides across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, leading to the deaths of at least 194 people in a 24-hour period. The majority of fatalities occurred in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where numerous homes were destroyed and a rescue helicopter crashed, killing five crew members. Authorities have declared disaster zones in several areas as forecasters predict continued heavy rainfall.

The decision aims to develop his leadership skills on the international stage. Meanwhile, Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker has received his first call-up for the preceding series against South Africa, while fast bowler Mark Wood remains sidelined with a knee injury.</p>

          <p>Vivergo Fuels, the largest bioethanol plant in the UK, will begin shutting down its operations after the government declined to provide a rescue package for the sector. The company, along with the UK's second-largest plant, had warned that a recent trade deal allowing tariff-free imports of U.S. ethanol had made their businesses unviable. The government stated that providing taxpayer funds was not in the national interest and would not solve the industry's long-term problems.

          <p>While the European Union and its member states officially adhere to the one-China policy, recognizing Beijing as the sole government of China, their evolving relationship with Taiwan is causing concern for mainland China. In recent years, several European nations have expanded ties with Taipei and are actively reinterpreting their one-China policy to distinguish it from Beijing's more rigid one-China principle. This shift is occurring as Brussels simultaneously pursues a "de-risking" strategy in its broader relationship with mainland China, making the Taiwan issue a critical test of the EU's strategic autonomy.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) should act proactively to secure favorable returns. Financial experts advise shopping around for the best available rates, as some online banks may still offer competitive yields. It is also a good time to re-evaluate one's budget to determine if a larger amount can be locked into a new long-term CD to maximize earnings in a declining rate environment. Communicating plans with the current bank is crucial to avoid automatic rollover into a new account with a lower rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit in Alaska between President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will highlight their complex and evolving relationship. In his first term, Trump often expressed admiration for Putin, but his tone has shifted recently amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, with Trump expressing frustration and calling the Russian leader "crazy." Despite this, Trump has pursued the one-on-one meeting, believing direct negotiation is key, while also maintaining some pressure on Moscow through secondary tariffs. Analysts suggest the meeting is a "feel-out" exercise, with Putin aiming to restore his relationship with the U.S. president.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that when liberal politicians and journalists downplay the seriousness of crime in Washington, D.C., they create a political opportunity for President Trump. While overall violent crime is at a 30-year low, the city's homicide rate remains disproportionately high, particularly in majority-Black, lower-income neighborhoods. The author contends that dismissing legitimate fears of residents in these areas as mere political rhetoric is a mistake. This denial allows Trump's message, however cynical, to resonate with voters who feel their safety concerns are being ignored by the progressive establishment.</p>
