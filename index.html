          <p>A Florida court has ordered Genaro Garcia Luna, a former Mexican security official convicted of drug trafficking, and his wife to pay over $2.4 billion to Mexico for taking bribes from the Sinaloa Cartel. Garcia Luna, once known as Mexico's "supercop," was found guilty in a U.S. court of accepting millions in bribes to facilitate the cartel's cocaine smuggling operations. The awarded money is triple the amount sought by the Mexican government, with Garcia Luna owing nearly $749 million and his wife, Linda Cristina Pereyra, owing $1.74 billion. The article details Garcia Luna's rise to power and his subsequent arrest in Dallas, Texas, highlighting the deep-seated corruption within Mexican security forces.</p>

          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed a fall in the energy price cap, resulting in a typical household saving Â£11 a month starting in July. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate energy deals, potentially saving up to Â£200 annually. While the price cap is decreasing, fixed deals could offer better value, providing certainty in monthly payments. The article notes that despite the decrease, energy prices remain high, and many households are struggling with debt to suppliers, emphasizing the need for targeted government support and energy efficiency measures.</p>

Malware variants like Bumblebee, Qakbot, and Trickbot were disrupted, damaging the cybercrime-as-a-service ecosystem.

The initiative is part of the central government's broader efforts to bolster economic recovery, focusing on issues such as unlawful enforcement, inconsistent standards, and abuse of power.
