          <p>The U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia has initiated a criminal investigation into the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The probe centers on allegations that the department systematically falsified crime statistics to portray the city as safer than it is. This investigation follows the suspension of a commander for similar accusations and escalates tensions between the Trump administration and local D.C. officials over the control of policing. Mayor Muriel Bowser has consistently used the disputed data to argue against federal oversight of the city's law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Actor David Boreanaz recently shared a humorous anecdote about his first meeting with the late Betty White on the set of the TV show "Bones." He recalled how White, after greeting his co-star Emily Deschanel politely, turned to him and made a surprisingly explicit and funny proposition. The story highlights White's well-known "potty mouth" and penchant for comedic shock value, which co-stars confirmed was a legendary part of her personality. White, a beloved icon, passed away in 2021 just shy of her 100th birthday.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests President Trump's recent summits with Ukrainian and European leaders have increased the possibility of ending the war with Russia, despite significant challenges. The author notes that while the diplomatic atmosphere was positive, Russia continues its daily attacks, signaling disrespect for the peace process. The article highlights that Russia's supposed concessions, like security guarantees, are complex and may be a tactic to buy time. For the peace effort to succeed, the author argues Trump must reinforce U.S. support for Ukraine and leverage strategic ambiguity to pressure Moscow.</p>

          <p>Major food chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are heavily investing in new beverage offerings to drive sales, particularly among Gen Z consumers. These younger customers show a strong preference for customized, cold, and flavorful drinks, shifting beverage purchases from a meal add-on to a primary reason for visiting. In response, companies are expanding menus with items like protein-infused cold foam, cereal-flavored lattes, and "dirty sodas." This strategy is seen as crucial for reversing sales slumps in a challenging economic environment where consumers are becoming more price-sensitive.</p>

Trump acknowledged the difficulty of the situation, conceding that Putin may not genuinely want a deal to end the war.

          <p>Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak has publicly stated that the club has "broken promises," escalating a standoff over his future after a £110m bid from Liverpool was rejected. In a social media post, Isak claimed the club knew his position for a long time and that trust has been lost, making a change necessary for all parties. The Swedish international believes he had an agreement to be allowed to leave if a major club made a suitable offer. The situation leaves both Isak and Newcastle in a difficult position as the transfer window deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>General David Allvin, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, has announced he will retire in November, only two years into his four-year term.

While rail ridership saw a slight recovery in July, bus boardings decreased by nearly 2%.

          <p>An investigation has been opened in France following the death of Raphaël Graven, a 46-year-old streamer known as Jeanpormanove who was famous for performing extreme challenges. Graven was reportedly found dead in his sleep during a live broadcast after being subjected to violence and sleep deprivation as part of his streams. A French government minister described the circumstances as an "absolute horror," stating the streamer had been humiliated for months. The live-streaming platform Kick, where he had a large following, said it was urgently reviewing the situation and extended condolences to his family.</p>

          <p>Israel is demanding the release of all 50 remaining hostages in Gaza, a stance that casts doubt on its acceptance of a new 60-day ceasefire proposal that Hamas has reportedly agreed to. An Israeli government spokesperson stated that the country is not interested in "partial deals," even though the new proposal is said to be nearly identical to a previous U.S. plan that Israel had accepted. The proposal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, would involve the release of about half the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners while a permanent ceasefire is negotiated.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ credit rating for U.S. sovereign debt, citing an expectation that revenue from President Trump's tariffs will largely offset weaker revenue from his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The rating agency anticipates "meaningful" income from the broad tariffs, which will help balance the fiscal impact of the new law that is projected to increase the federal deficit. However, S&P warned it could lower the rating in the future if deficits increase due to political inability to control spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, is prompting evacuations on North Carolina's barrier islands, including Hatteras and Ocracoke, as it threatens the coast with dangerous surf and tropical storm conditions. Although the hurricane is expected to remain offshore, authorities have issued warnings for severe rip currents from Florida to New England, leading to beach closures in multiple states. The evacuations in the Outer Banks come during peak tourist season, with concerns that high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway, potentially leaving areas inaccessible.</p>

          <p>The final remaining sugar beet processing factory in California, located in Brawley, is set to shut down after 78 years of operation. The closure by the Southern Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative will eliminate approximately 700 local jobs and likely end sugar beet farming in the state, a major loss for the agriculturally-driven Imperial Valley. The company cited escalating operational costs and broader economic challenges facing the U.S. sugar industry as reasons for the decision to consolidate resources at a more profitable plant in Minnesota. The factory will phase out production over the next year.</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has updated its immunization schedule, now urging that children as young as six months receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This recommendation directly contrasts with current guidance from the Trump administration's CDC, which advises the decision be left to "shared clinical decision-making" for most children. The AAP stated its guidance is necessary in an "environment of misinformation," alluding to the recent overhaul of the CDC's advisory panel. This divergence creates potential confusion for parents and could affect insurance coverage for the vaccine if not endorsed by the federal committee.</p>

Under these deals, the U.S. can send asylum-seekers to these countries even if they are not citizens there. Uganda has reportedly agreed to accept non-criminal deportees from other African nations, while Honduras will receive a limited number of migrants from other Spanish-speaking countries.
