          <p>President Lee Jae-myung of South Korea stated that South Korean companies will be hesitant to invest in the U.S. after a large immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia led to the arrest of over 300 South Korean nationals. Lee emphasized that sending workers to set up overseas factories is a common practice, and the raid raises concerns about the feasibility of establishing manufacturing facilities in the U.S. He also mentioned Seoul is negotiating with Washington for visa options for South Korean workers, including securing higher quotas or creating new visa categories. The White House has defended the operation, but media in South Korea have described the raid as a "shock." The current situation could potentially strain relations between the two countries. Optimism here is cautious given the economic implications. </p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and ally of Donald Trump, was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University. Kirk, 31, was addressing a crowd when a single shot struck him in the neck, leading to a campus lockdown and a manhunt for the shooter. Authorities believe the shot was fired from the roof of a nearby building, and while two individuals were initially arrested, they were later released with no ties to the incident. Kirk was known for founding Turning Point USA, an organization promoting conservative ideals on college campuses, and was a significant figure in the MAGA movement. The political landscape reels from this act of violence. </p>

          <p>Global equities are rallying, with the MSCI All Country World Index reaching record highs, driven by easing inflation, strong corporate earnings, and expectations of U.S. rate cuts. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high, while Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi have hit all-time highs this week. Recent U.S. data indicating labor market weakness and a soft producer price index have further fueled investor optimism, bolstering the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Oracle's positive outlook for AI-related revenue has also boosted confidence in the tech sector's rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thursday's newspaper front pages are dominated by two main stories: Prince Harry's meeting with King Charles and the increasing pressure on Lord Mandelson due to his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. Several papers picture Prince Harry arriving at Clarence House for tea with his father, while others focus on the growing calls for Lord Mandelson's dismissal. Additionally, some newspapers report on Britain's consideration of sending fighter jets to Poland and Merck's decision to scrap a research center in London.

          <p>Nathalie Tocci argues that the transatlantic relationship between Europe and the U.S. may be permanently damaged, regardless of whether Donald Trump remains in power. Tocci suggests that the sense of kinship that characterized the relationship in past decades is unlikely to return due to shifting security, demographic, societal, and economic forces. She proposes two possible scenarios: a transactional relationship based on converging interests or a world of empires where the U.S. sees Europe as a colony. Europe's reaction to these realities will determine which scenario is more likely. The stability of the transatlantic relationship is in question.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist, was a close friend and ally to many in Donald Trump's inner circle, including Trump himself. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, played a significant role in Trump's election. Following Kirk's death, the White House expressed deep sorrow, and Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. Kirk was a prominent figure in the MAGA movement, influencing millions of young people through his events and podcast.

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, at Clarence House in London for their first face-to-face meeting since February 2024, potentially marking a small but significant step towards reconciliation.

While Buckingham Palace and Prince Harry's team have remained tight-lipped about the details of their conversations, the fact that the reunion occurred suggests a slight shift in their relationship. The road to full family reconciliation remains uncertain, but this meeting represents a move in the right direction.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that FBI Director Kash Patel stated his job depended on firing agents involved in past investigations of President Trump. The agents claim they were terminated without explanation and deprived of their full pensions. They assert that the FBI was pressured by White House officials to conduct summary firings of agents, particularly those involved in the January 6 investigations.

While non-biological processes could be responsible, lead researcher Joel Hurowitz calls it the best, most compelling candidate yet in the search for potential signs of long-ago life.

          <p>China has opened the world's longest cable-stayed bridge over the Yangtze River, connecting the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou in Jiangsu province. The Changtai Yangtze River Bridge stretches 10.3km and features a main span of 1,208 meters. This bridge is the river’s first crossing to carry an expressway, regular road, and intercity railway on the same structure. A distinctive feature is its asymmetrical lower deck, with a railway on one side and a regular road on the other, marking the first use of a side-by-side traffic layout in a large-span bridge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's order that prevents him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook while a lawsuit challenging his attempt to remove her continues. The judge stated that the public interest in Federal Reserve independence favors Cook's reinstatement. Trump claimed he was firing Cook based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. The Senate Banking Committee has recommended approving Trump's nominee for a vacant Fed governor's seat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts warn that the assassination of Charlie Kirk marks a turning point in a surge of U.S. political violence, potentially inflaming an already divided nation. The U.S. has experienced approximately 150 politically motivated attacks in the first six months of the year, nearly double the amount from the same period last year. Factors contributing to the increased violence include economic insecurity, shifting demographics, and inflammatory political discourse. Experts cite a growing concern about the potential for retaliation and a vicious spiral of violence. This incident underscores the fragility of the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people in rural West Virginia lack reliable access to drinking water, often relying on untreated sources like natural springs or abandoned coal mines. About 250,000 West Virginia residents depend on these untreated sources, according to the EPA. Many residents have laid their own water lines up mountainsides, accepting the difficulty as a way of life. Declining coal companies used to fund and operate town water systems, but the infrastructure has deteriorated. Nonprofits like DigDeep are working to bring clean water to communities, recognizing access to water as a human right.</p>

The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) says bureaucracy is stifling innovation, leading to a postcode lottery where cutting-edge treatments are only available in larger, better-funded units. The RCR is calling for red tape to be cut and for commissioners to listen to clinicians to improve patient care. The government says a new cancer strategy is expected later this year.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris writes in her upcoming book that Joe Biden's decision to run for president again should not have been left to an individual's ego. Harris, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee after Biden dropped out of the race, criticized the recklessness of leaving the decision solely to the former president and first lady. She contemplated whether she should have advised Biden not to run, but acknowledged it would appear self-serving. Harris also criticizes Biden's team for not defending her against unfair attacks.</p>
