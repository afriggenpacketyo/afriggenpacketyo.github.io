        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, siding with state and local leaders who opposed the move. U.S. District Judge April Perry cited a lack of credible evidence of an organized rebellion in Illinois and questioned the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of the situation in the Chicago area. The judge also expressed concerns that deploying untrained troops could escalate civil unrest, as local law enforcement agencies indicated they were capable of maintaining order. The ruling is a win for the state of Illinois and its sovereignty according to Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and Gov. JB Pritzker stated that Trump is not a king. Optimism score of 75.</p>

          <p>Chinese regulators are intensifying their efforts to address disorderly price competition within certain industries, as indicated by a joint policy paper from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). The policy outlines measures to limit intense competition that leads to price wars and cost-cutting practices, which authorities view as detrimental to industry development and product innovation. Regulators will guide industry associations to evaluate average production costs and help companies set reasonable prices, while closely monitoring market price competition and intervening when necessary. The NDRC and SAMR aim to maintain price order in key sectors and address violations of pricing laws. Optimism score of 70.</p>

          <p>A Microsoft engineer resigned after 13 years, citing the company's continued cloud service sales to the Israeli military and the lack of discussion among executives regarding the conflict in Gaza. Scott Sutfin-Glowski stated he could no longer enable potential atrocities and referred to a report indicating the Israeli military had numerous active Microsoft subscriptions. This resignation follows months of employee protests and firings related to Microsoft's cloud business with the Israeli military. Sutfin-Glowski also claimed the company cut off communication systems for employees to voice concerns about the use of Microsoft products by the Israeli military, and outside Microsoft headquarters, employees protested the company's ties with Israel.

          <p>Chinese chip stocks have experienced a significant rally due to the nation's push for self-sufficiency, leading to high valuations that are testing investors' patience. A gauge of Chinese semiconductor shares has surged, outperforming chip stocks in other major markets like the US, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This outperformance is attributed to Beijing's support for domestic tech and a call for firms to avoid using Nvidia processors. Some fund managers are concerned that these high multiples leave little room for error and that the market may not be patient if companies fail to deliver. Optimism score of 65.</p>

          <p>Following negotiations in Egypt, Israel and Hamas have reportedly agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, according to US President Donald Trump. The agreement involves the release of all living hostages and a withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed-upon line, with a ceasefire expected to take effect. Hamas is expected to release the hostages within 72 hours, followed by the return of deceased hostages' bodies. Israel will then release Palestinian prisoners, and humanitarian aid will enter Gaza, monitored by a multinational force. Optimism score of 70.</p>

          <p>Libby Adame, known as "the butt lady," was convicted of second-degree murder after a second client died from silicone injections she administered. Adame was previously convicted of involuntary manslaughter for a similar incident in 2019, but continued to perform unauthorized procedures. The recent victim, Cindyana Santangelo, died from a fatal embolism after receiving an injection from Adame, and prosecutors argued that Adame was aware of the dangers. Adame's lawyer claimed she was only a consultant, but the jury found her guilty, and she faces a significantly longer sentence. Optimism score of 10.</p>

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law to prevent streaming services from having commercials that are louder than the content being watched. The bill was inspired by a new parent whose baby was woken up by loud streaming ads, and the goal is to prevent jarring changes in volume. This new law will not go into effect until July 1, 2026. While federal law already prohibits regular TV broadcasters from running commercials that are much louder than the program being watched, streaming services were not around when the federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act was passed in 2010, so the new law in California will close the loophole.

The devices, originally designed for humans, are implanted in animals to record changes in body temperature, hydration, and heart rate. This data helps biologists understand the exact moments when animals become stressed, aiding in conservation efforts. The technology is being used on various species, including clouded leopards and giant anteaters, and is providing powerful insights on a planet where our own activities are rapidly pushing beloved species closer to extinction.

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in the war in Ukraine, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces testing AI for target identification, intelligence gathering, and de-mining. The Ukrainian army analyzes over 50,000 video streams monthly using AI to identify targets and enhance strategic planning, and Ukrainian troops use AI-based software for drones to autonomously lock onto targets. While fully autonomous weapons systems are still under development, concerns remain about potential violations of the rules of war and the risk of harming civilians.

          <p>Millions of Americans are at risk of losing health insurance subsidies due to a stalemate in Congress over extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits. Democrats are pushing for the extension of the subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025, while Republicans are focused on reopening the government. Without the subsidies, many individuals would be unable to afford health insurance, potentially leading to significant financial debt and delayed medical care. The ACA marketplaces serve as a safety net for many, including entrepreneurs and gig economy workers, and the uncertainty is causing widespread concern. Optimism score of 40.</p>

          <p>Robert Roberson, convicted of capital murder in the 2002 death of his daughter, was granted a stay of execution by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. The court ordered the trial court to weigh Roberson's arguments for overturning his conviction based on Texas' junk science law and the case of Andrew Roark. Roberson's defense argues that his daughter was misdiagnosed with shaken baby syndrome and that she died from severe viral and bacterial pneumonia. The ruling provides Roberson with an opportunity to present new evidence and potentially overturn his conviction, and his legal team claims that he had undiagnosed autism at the time of his conviction.

The dolphin-sized ichthyosaur is the only known example of its kind and is thought to have swum the seas about 185 million years ago. Scientists believe the "sword dragon" may have been killed by a bite to the head, possibly inflicted by a larger species of ichthyosaur. The discovery helps fill a gap in the ichthyosaur evolution, with the specimen showing malformed limb bones and teeth, suggesting serious injury or disease. Optimism score of 70.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the purchase, citing the importance of Argentina's reform agenda and the US strategic interest in a stable Western Hemisphere. The move has drawn criticism in the US, with some questioning the decision to support Argentina amid domestic spending cuts. Bessent defended the plan, stating it is not a bailout and that the peso is undervalued, while President Milei thanked Trump for his support. (not investment advice) Optimism score of 55.</p>
