          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations convened in Istanbul for another round of U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at resolving the three-year-long conflict. These discussions occurred shortly after Ukraine launched a surprise drone attack on Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Ukraine is advocating for a full 30-day ceasefire to facilitate negotiations, while Russia insists on maximalist war goals, including the annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the retention of Crimea, Ukrainian demilitarization, and a permanent block on Ukraine's accession to NATO. Despite Trump's administration's pressure, previous talks have failed to yield a peace deal or sustained ceasefire, with both sides accusing the other of sabotaging the process.</p>

The procedure took place at the University of Michigan during a neurosurgery to treat epilepsy, with the device being implanted and removed in approximately 20 minutes. The procedure demonstrated the safety and ability of the system to record neural activity. Paradromics plans to initiate a clinical trial later this year to study the long-term safety and efficacy of its Connexus Brain-Computer Interface in humans, aiming to assist patients with severe motor impairments to communicate through computers.</p>

          <p>The current economic structure in the United States increasingly works against fertility, particularly for women, by demanding more years in education and longer hours at work during their prime reproductive years. This has resulted in American schools and workplaces becoming ill-suited for supporting those who wish to start families earlier. While discussions about reproductive timelines are often fraught, it's essential to address the barriers to early parenthood to ensure people can make less constrained choices. The article suggests reforms in education, labor regulations, and social policies to make parenthood more compatible with economic security.</p>

          <p>A suspect is in custody after what the FBI is calling a "targeted act of violence" during a peaceful march in support of Israeli hostages at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday. Witnesses said the suspect used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims, police and the FBI said. The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. The victims of the attack included four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, police said.</p>

Tensions have risen after a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, with the U.S. imposing export restrictions on semiconductor software and chemicals. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson said these steps "seriously undermine" the deal reached in Geneva. China also emphasized its control over rare earths exports, contrary to Washington's expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While self-knowledge is often encouraged, the pursuit of perfect self-understanding is unattainable due to limitations in human perception and unconscious biases. Overly intense introspection can lead to rumination and negative thought spirals. Instead of seeking a fixed true self, individuals should focus on building a flexible sense of self that allows for change and surprise. Embracing a changeable self is linked to positive outcomes, including lower stress and better physical health.</p>
