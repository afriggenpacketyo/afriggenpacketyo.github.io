          <p>The Kimi K2 AI model, developed by Alibaba-backed Moonshot AI, has seen a surge in user adoption following its recent launch. Experts praise its mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which significantly reduces training and inference costs compared to competitors like OpenAI. The model, which is currently free to use, highlights a potential shift in AI development strategy toward more resource-efficient approaches. This development underscores China's growing innovation in the competitive artificial intelligence landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials in China's Zhejiang province have accused popular online stand-up comedy shows of fostering "gender antagonism." An article from the provincial publicity department argued that some content simplifies gender topics into a conflict between men and women to attract viewers. While not naming specific shows, the critique follows viral performances by female comedians on platforms like iQIYI and Tencent Video. The statement called for more rational and profound comedy that bridges divides rather than magnifying them.</p>

Tariffs, which are taxes on imports, allow for direct, unilateral control without congressional approval and generate revenue, aligning with the "America First" agenda. This approach, however, blurs the lines between trade policy and punitive measures, as tariffs are used to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration. This strategy creates significant uncertainty in global markets and has been criticized for potentially destabilizing international relations. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House Correspondents' Association condemned the decision as government retaliation against a news outlet, raising concerns about press freedom and access.</p>

          <p>National Archives documents show that former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothes while at 10 Downing Street.

The files reveal that Downing Street officials were concerned the large discounts could be perceived negatively and might need to be declared under a new ministerial code.

          <p>A new analysis from property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly cost of renting a new tenancy in the UK has surged by £221 over the past three years. This 21% increase has brought the average monthly rent to £1,283, putting significant financial pressure on tenants. The sharp rise is attributed to high demand and an insufficient supply of rental properties. While the rate of increase is now slowing, particularly in major cities, the high costs are forcing some to make career and life decisions based on affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

The author suggests the tariffs expose the hypocrisy of other countries and trading blocs, like Canada, China, and the EU, which maintain their own self-defeating internal trade barriers. The economic pressure from U.S. tariffs is forcing these nations to confront and potentially dismantle long-standing domestic regulations and protectionist policies. This could lead to a net positive outcome by spurring them to free up their own economies. (not investment advice)</p>
