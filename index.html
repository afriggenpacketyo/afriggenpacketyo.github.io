          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv, who are increasingly desperate as the war nears its 22nd month. The families urged for a deal, their fears heightened by recent Hamas propaganda videos showing hostages looking emaciated and unwell. Witkoff reportedly gave a personal commitment from President Trump to work towards the hostages' release. The article also notes the deadly violence occurring near humanitarian aid distribution sites in Gaza, where dozens of Palestinians seeking food have been killed.</p>

          <p>An annual mountain cleanup event at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado resulted in the collection of 780 pounds of trash and some unusual discoveries. Staff members found a variety of items dropped from ski lifts, including an iPod Nano, vape cartridges, and inexplicably, a hamburger flipper. The strangest find was a message in a bottle, which turned out to contain an old COVID-19 vaccination card. The resort noted that the effort is a favorite among staff, as it allows them to care for the natural environment they call home.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was sent from Australia in 1943 but died just days before arriving in England. For decades, it was rumored that the animal died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, recent archival research by students and historians revealed that logbooks show no record of an explosion, but do show dangerously high water and air temperatures as the ship crossed the equator, suggesting the platypus was essentially cooked alive.</p>

          <p>In a recent discussion, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute explored the potential for conservatives to challenge and influence President Trump's foreign policy. The conversation, based on her article in Foreign Affairs, delves into the evolving dynamics within the conservative movement regarding America's role in the world. It examines whether a faction of conservatives can effectively advocate for a different approach to international relations than the one pursued by the administration. The piece considers the future of conservative foreign policy thought in what some describe as a "post-American world."</p>

According to the Home Office, around 80% of migrants arriving via small boats have used social media to contact people-smuggling gangs.

The arrests were part of "Operation Vala Umgodi," a week-long effort to crack down on illegal mining, known locally as "zama-zama." Those arrested, who came primarily from neighboring countries like Eswatini and Mozambique, will face charges for immigration violations and possibly illegal mining. The issue is widespread in South Africa, which has thousands of abandoned mines that have become hotspots for such dangerous and illicit activities.</p>

          <p>According to Gaza's Health Ministry, at least 325 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces over the past week while attempting to access food aid. These events occurred despite Israeli assurances of a humanitarian pause, with the military stating its troops only fired warning shots. The crisis has been exacerbated by aid restrictions, leading the U.N. to warn that a famine is unfolding. A recent visit by a U.S. envoy to an aid site has drawn criticism, as a U.N. report documented hundreds of deaths near these locations.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris’s announcement that she will not run for governor of California has reset the race, leaving no clear front-runner among the remaining candidates. For months, potential contenders had their campaigns stalled by the possibility of her entry, but now figures like former Rep. Katie Porter and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra are vying for the top spot. However, political strategists note that none of the current candidates possess statewide name recognition, making fundraising and endorsements critical.

          <p>The average monthly cost for a nursing home in Germany has surged to €3,248, a sum that is increasingly unaffordable for many German retirees. With the average pension being significantly lower, nearly one-third of nursing home residents now rely on welfare payments. The rising costs are attributed to long-overdue wage increases for care workers and higher staffing levels. German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the country's long-term care insurance system, which is struggling to cover the widening financial gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England is facing a monumental task in the final Test against India, needing to chase a target of 374 runs to win the series. The team's bowling attack was severely depleted, with key all-rounder Ben Stokes injured and other fast bowlers showing signs of fatigue from a condensed schedule. Bowlers Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue delivered a lion-hearted effort, but dropped catches and a weary squad have backed England into a corner. The article suggests England's management of its bowling resources and recurring fielding errors are concerning signs ahead of the upcoming Ashes series in Australia.</p>

          <p>Romania is making significant strides in officially recognizing its role in the Holocaust and the genocide of its Sinti and Roma populations during World War II. At a recent commemoration event, the country's new president emphasized the need to grapple with this history, which was long ignored in public discourse and education. During the war, Romania's pro-Nazi regime deported over 25,000 Roma to Transnistria, where most died from starvation, disease, or violence. The new government focus and educational initiatives signal a crucial shift towards confronting this dark chapter of the nation's past.</p>

The Home Secretary described the raise as a "clear signal of our gratitude," noting it is marginally above the current inflation rate. However, the Police Federation, representing over 145,000 officers, derided the award as "barely treading water," arguing it does little to reverse years of real-terms pay cuts or address crises in retention and mental health.
