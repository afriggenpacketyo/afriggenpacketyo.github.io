          <p>Hamas has responded to the latest U.S.-led ceasefire proposal, reiterating demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal from Gaza, and continuous humanitarian aid. Their hostage exchange proposal involves releasing 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff deemed Hamas's response "completely unacceptable," urging them to agree to the U.S. framework for proximity talks. Israel's defense minister warned Hamas to accept the deal or face destruction, as the IDF continues operations in Gaza.

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), aimed at reforestation, is under scrutiny due to satellite data and field reports indicating deforestation and unsustainable practices. An analysis suggests that some NGP sites experienced deforestation, with native trees cleared for cash crops. Communities often have short-term land access and are required to grow single cash crops, undermining sustainable livelihoods. The program also faces issues including poor site selection, limited community support, and weak long-term sustainability planning, raising concerns about greenwashing.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts missed a game against the New York Yankees due to a fractured toe sustained while walking to the bathroom in the dark. Manager Dave Roberts expects Betts to miss additional games but does not anticipate him going on the injured list. This is not the first unusual injury for the Dodgers this season, as Freddie Freeman previously missed games after slipping in the shower. Betts is currently having a down year compared to his career averages, batting .254 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs.</p>

China responded by accusing the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace.

Kennedy has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to identify environmental culprits, dismissing genetic research as a "dead end." Scientists argue that the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, increased awareness, and better screening. They have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism and fear that Kennedy's focus will distract from genetic research that could lead to new therapies.</p>
