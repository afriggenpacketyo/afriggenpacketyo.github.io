          <h2>Eligibility of "Buy Now, Pay Later" Debt for Forgiveness Programs Examined</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 16:46:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Buy now, pay later" services have surged in popularity, but rising consumer defaults are creating new financial challenges. This article explores whether this type of unsecured debt qualifies for debt forgiveness programs, concluding that while it is technically possible, eligibility varies widely. The newness of these services means debt relief companies often lack established relationships with providers, and individual debts may not meet the minimum thresholds required for negotiation. The report also outlines alternatives for consumers, such as direct negotiation with lenders, debt consolidation, or professional credit counseling.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders met with President Donald Trump to discuss a potential path to ending the war with Russia. During the talks, Trump pledged "very good protection" for Ukraine through security guarantees but emphasized that Europe would need to shoulder most of the responsibility. He also reversed his previous demand for a ceasefire as a precondition for further negotiations, a stance that drew pushback from European leaders. Trump stated his goal is to organize a trilateral meeting with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to finalize a peace agreement.</p>

          <p>During his return to the White House for talks with President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy adopted a notably collegial and charming demeanor. This approach contrasted with a previous, more acrimonious visit, and included a lighthearted exchange with a reporter about his decision to wear a suit instead of his usual military attire. The article highlights Zelenskyy's efforts to build rapport, such as delivering a personal letter from his wife to Melania Trump. It also covers President Trump's hints at providing security guarantees for Ukraine, a key demand from Kyiv in any potential peace deal with Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, President Donald Trump stated that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for a peace deal with Russia. This marks a reversal from his position just a week prior and drew immediate concern from European allies like Germany and France, who insisted a ceasefire is critical for credible negotiations. While Trump offered vague assurances of U.S. involvement in security guarantees for Ukraine, he reiterated that European nations must take the lead. The meeting highlighted a significant diplomatic gap between the U.S. and its European partners on the strategy for ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, restoring the quorum needed for the legislature to conduct business. Their departure was a protest against a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps mid-decade, a move that could grant the GOP up to five new seats in the U.S. House. Democrats stated they are returning to build a legal case against what they call a "discriminatory map" and have drawn national attention to the issue. The situation in Texas has prompted Democratic-led states like California to consider their own redistricting measures in response, setting the stage for a broader national battle over electoral maps.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has vowed to issue an executive order to eliminate mail-in voting and voting machines, but legal experts assert he has no constitutional power to do so. The U.S. Constitution grants states the authority to determine the "time, place and manner" of elections, with Congress having the power to alter rules for federal elections, not the President. Trump's claims of massive fraud associated with these voting methods are unsubstantiated, as widespread fraud is exceptionally rare in U.S. elections. This article explains that any attempt to enforce such changes via executive order would be immediately challenged and blocked by the courts, as previous efforts have been.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn, with Bitcoin's price falling to approximately $115,000 after reaching a new all-time high last week. The drop was attributed to macroeconomic concerns, particularly higher-than-expected wholesale inflation data, which sparked a wave of liquidations totaling over $500 million. Comments from the Treasury Secretary clarifying the limited scope of the U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve also contributed to the negative sentiment. Despite the pullback, many analysts view it as a healthy correction, with significant inflows into crypto ETFs continuing to provide underlying market support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As new tariffs affect imported goods, a specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM) could temporarily distort the reported profitability of major U.S. retailers. This method uses an average cost-to-retail ratio across broad categories, which can initially overstate profits when product costs rise suddenly, as they do with tariffs. This article explains that while the effect normalizes over time, it creates a short-term disconnect between a company's operational efforts to mitigate costs and its financial statements. Nearly a quarter of U.S. retailers, including Walmart and Target, use this method, potentially masking the immediate financial impact of trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article addresses the common question of whether age limits exist for purchasing annuities as a retirement planning tool. While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, individual insurance companies typically impose their own limits, often around 80 to 85 years old, based on risk assessment. The piece explains that the best age to buy an annuity depends on individual financial strategy rather than a specific number. Purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s allows for growth in deferred annuities, while buying an immediate annuity closer to retirement age can provide a stable income stream to supplement Social Security.</p>

          <p>Hollie Strano, a former meteorologist for WKYC in Cleveland for over 22 years, has taken a new position providing morning weather forecasts for Mix 94.1, a radio station in Stark County, Ohio. Strano's employment with WKYC was terminated in 2024, an action she claims in a lawsuit was related to her publicly sharing her journey of recovery from alcoholism. In addition to her new radio role, Strano hosts a podcast titled "Abruptly Authentic" and also provides forecasts for radio stations in Georgia and Alabama. She announced her new position in Canton with enthusiasm, expressing gratitude for the opportunity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has recently emphasized enforcing the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act against wind energy projects, a move critics view as a pretext to undermine the renewable energy industry rather than a genuine conservation effort. While wind turbines do pose a threat to eagles, the article notes that far greater dangers to bird populations include climate change, habitat loss, and cats. The administration's focus on this single issue is seen as hypocritical, as it has simultaneously worked to weaken broader environmental regulations, such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and open protected habitats to oil and gas drilling.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms' stock experienced a downturn following a report that the company is planning another significant restructuring of its artificial intelligence team, its fourth in six months. This news has raised questions about the stability and direction of Meta's AI strategy despite heavy investment in talent. In other market news, shares of Eli Lilly remained stable after its main competitor, Novo Nordisk, announced a price cut for its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic. The move is not seen as a major threat to Lilly because the cash-pay market for diabetes treatments is less critical than for obesity drugs, where Lilly's Zepbound maintains a competitive edge.

          <p>A reserve police officer in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, who was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has agreed to voluntarily leave the country. The officer, Jon Luke Evans from Jamaica, was arrested in July as part of increased immigration enforcement actions. The arrest created a dispute between local officials and federal authorities, as the police department stated it had used the federal E-Verify system and was told Evans was legally authorized to work. An ICE representative confirmed that a judge granted the voluntary departure, allowing Evans to leave the U.S. as soon as arrangements could be made.</p>

          <p>Reflecting the influence of internet culture and social media, the Cambridge Dictionary has added thousands of new words to its lexicon, including terms popularized by Gen Z like "skibidi" and "delulu." "Skibidi," originating from a YouTube series, is a versatile slang term, while "delulu" is a playful shortening of "delusional." Other new entries include "tradwife," referring to a trend of embracing traditional gender roles, and "broligarchy," a term for the powerful elite of male tech leaders. The dictionary's editors noted that they only add words that demonstrate significant usage and are likely to have lasting power in the English language.</p>

He initially studied pre-med in college, inspired by a character on "Grey's Anatomy," before realizing his true passion was for performance. Yang discussed how pop culture, and SNL in particular, was a crucial tool for him to assimilate after moving from French Canada to Colorado as a child. He also shared anecdotes from his youth, including hiding his interest in the book "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants," which he considered "cultural contraband" for a teenage boy.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that despite wage growth, the average American worker's pay has lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years, eroding purchasing power. This persistent gap helps explain ongoing public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many households feel their income is not keeping up with the rising cost of living. The study found that educators have experienced the largest deficit between pay raises and inflation, while workers in sectors like leisure and hospitality have seen wages outpace it due to high demand. The findings align with survey data showing low satisfaction with current wages across the workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The conservative media outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The suit alleged that Newsmax knowingly aired false conspiracy theories claiming the company's machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. This settlement follows a similar, much larger agreement between Dominion and Fox News in 2023. Despite the payment, Newsmax did not apologize and maintained in a statement that its coverage was fair and balanced. A judge had previously ruled that Newsmax did defame Dominion, leaving a jury to decide only on the question of malice and damages.</p>

According to the Kiel Institute, a German research group, the U.S. has committed a total of $130.6 billion in military, financial, and humanitarian support. While the U.S. is the largest single-country donor, the combined aid from European nations and EU institutions is greater, totaling $165.7 billion over the same period. The report clarifies that aid from both the U.S. and Europe has consisted of a mixture of grants and loans, addressing claims made about the nature of the support.</p>

Doak has signed a five-year contract, seeking more regular first-team football than he was afforded at Liverpool. The move is part of a significant summer of sales for Liverpool, which has generated approximately £200 million to offset its spending on new players. For Bournemouth, Doak represents their fourth major summer acquisition as they rebuild their squad after several high-profile departures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued an urgent safety warning about counterfeit Labubu dolls, which pose a serious choking risk to young children. These knockoff products, sometimes called "Lafufus," are often poorly made and can break into small pieces or are small enough to be swallowed whole, potentially blocking a child's airway. The popular collectible dolls, created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, have inspired a wave of fakes sold at deep discounts. The CPSC advises consumers on how to spot a counterfeit, noting differences in teeth count and the absence of authentic holographic stickers.</p>

The second story details how an Arkansas hairstylist, Elizabeth Hoyt, saved her client's life by noticing a mark on her scalp during a routine appointment and insisting she see a dermatologist. The mark was diagnosed as skin cancer and successfully removed, underscoring the important role that observant professionals can play in community health.</p>
