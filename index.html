          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 student visas, citing a range of legal violations and overstays. According to an official, two-thirds of the revocations were due to lawbreaking, with alleged offenses including assault, burglary, and driving under the influence. A smaller subset of between 200 and 300 visas were pulled over accusations related to "support for terrorism." This action occurs as the Trump administration intensifies its scrutiny of foreign students, implementing stricter screening of social media for visa applicants.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that President Trump's foreign policy is defined by chaos rather than a coherent doctrine, exemplified by his recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The author argues that despite efforts from European allies to present a unified front, Trump appeared to capitulate to Putin's demands, offering significant economic concessions related to Alaskan resources and Ukrainian territories. The piece criticizes Trump's negotiating team as incompetent and suggests his actions are driven by self-aggrandizement and a desire to emulate authoritarian leaders, rather than strategic diplomacy.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ long-term credit rating for the United States, stating that it expects "meaningful" revenue from President Trump's tariff policies to help offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The agency noted that the Congressional Budget Office projects the new law will increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. However, S&P warned it could lower the rating in the future if deficits increase due to political inability to control spending or if political developments weaken American institutions.

          <p>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu publicly challenged Attorney General Pam Bondi's threats of federal action against cities with sanctuary policies for immigrants. During a press conference, Wu accused the Trump administration of failing to follow the law and using threats to distract from its own failures. She asserted that Boston complies with the law and will not bow to what she termed "tyranny." Leaders from other targeted jurisdictions, including Washington state and Connecticut, have issued similar statements defending their policies and vowing to resist federal overreach.</p>

          <p>The integration of artificial intelligence in education is presenting both opportunities and challenges for teachers. Proponents highlight AI's potential as a time-saving tool for lesson planning, with one survey indicating teachers save nearly six hours per week. Tech companies are investing in training programs to help educators harness AI, but critics raise concerns about student cheating and a potential decline in critical thinking skills. As school districts update their policies, many educators are focusing on teaching students how to use AI responsibly while understanding its limitations.</p>

          <p>A United Nations report released on World Humanitarian Day reveals a record number of aid workers were killed in 2024, with conflicts in Gaza and Sudan being the primary drivers. So far this year, 265 humanitarians have been killed, a significant increase from the previous year, with 181 deaths occurring in Gaza alone. U.N. officials have described the scale of the attacks and the lack of accountability as a "shameful indictment of international inaction." Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasized that humanitarians must be protected under international law and called for perpetrators to face justice.</p>

          <p>Epping Forest District Council in Essex has won a temporary High Court injunction to stop a local hotel from being used to house asylum seekers. The ruling requires all asylum seekers to be moved from The Bell Hotel by September 12th, following weeks of protests and heightened community tensions. The demonstrations began after an asylum seeker residing at the hotel was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage girl. The council argued the hotel's use had changed without planning approval and that the situation was causing irreparable harm to the community.</p>

          <p>Despite accumulating over a million reservations, sales of Tesla's Cybertruck have fallen significantly short, with just over 52,000 units sold in the U.S. since its launch. Analysts suggest the vehicle's futuristic, unconventional design has limited its appeal among traditional truck buyers, who prioritize functionality and brand loyalty. Furthermore, the Cybertruck's final specifications, including towing capacity and battery range, did not meet the initial advertised promises. Production issues and eight voluntary recalls have also contributed to buyer hesitancy in a competitive and conservative market segment. (not investment advice)</p>

Amid these tensions, Apple is said to be ramping up manufacturing at five Indian factories for its upcoming iPhone 17 models. This move aligns with Apple's broader strategy to diversify its supply chain away from China while navigating complex geopolitical and trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>
