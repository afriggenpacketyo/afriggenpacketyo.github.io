          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, citing the criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro as a politically motivated "Witch Hunt." This move is notably punitive, as the U.S. currently runs a trade surplus with Brazil. The official letter also criticized Brazil for its policies regarding the social media platform X and its alignment with the BRICS group of nations. This action is part of President Trump's broader strategy of using tariffs to influence the political and economic policies of other countries.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly floods in Kerr County, Texas, several faith-based organizations have mobilized to provide crucial support to the devastated community. Groups like the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team are offering spiritual and emotional counseling, serving as a listening ear for survivors and victims' families grappling with the tragedy. These organizations emphasize that faith is helping the community cope with the long recovery process, providing not just material donations but also a sense of hope and reassurance during a time of immense loss and grief.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service has suspended six of its personnel without pay for periods ranging from 10 to 42 days following the security failures during the 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump. An agency official stated that they are focused on addressing the root causes of the operational failure, such as improving equipment and inter-agency coordination, rather than simply firing staff. This disciplinary action comes in response to intense scrutiny and a critical bipartisan House report that found the security lapses were preventable and unacceptable.</p>

As copper is a vital material for electrical wiring, appliances, cars, and infrastructure, experts warn that the tariff would lead to higher costs for both industries and consumers. While the administration claims the policy will boost domestic production, the U.S. is heavily reliant on imports from countries like Chile and Canada, and increasing domestic output would be a lengthy process.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a federal lawsuit against the state of California, arguing that its policy allowing transgender girls to compete in girls' school sports is a violation of Title IX, the law prohibiting sex-based discrimination. Attorney General Pam Bondi called the state's policy illegal and unfair to female athletes, vowing that the Department of Justice would fight to protect their opportunities. This legal action marks another significant clash between the Trump administration and California and is a key part of a broader federal effort to restrict transgender rights.</p>
