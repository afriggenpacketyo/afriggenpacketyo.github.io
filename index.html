          <p>European markets opened with a slight uptick in the Stoxx 600 index, reflecting varied corporate performances across the continent. Nvidia reported robust sales growth, driven by the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, though its data center revenue fell slightly short of analyst estimates, causing a minor dip in its shares. French spirits giant Pernod Ricard experienced a sales decline due to weak consumer sentiment in China, while British renewable energy firm Drax saw an 11% drop following a regulatory investigation into its biomass sourcing statements. Concurrently, new car registrations in the EU rose by 7.4%, with a significant 39.1% increase in battery-electric vehicles, notably a substantial surge for Chinese brand BYD, contrasting with a decline in Tesla's European registrations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British-made car sales to the US rose by 6.8% in July, marking an increase after three consecutive months of decline. This surge follows the implementation of a UK-US tariff deal, which reduced the import tax on British cars from 25% to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) highlighted the US as the largest single national market for British-built cars, underscoring the deal's importance despite overall struggles in UK car manufacturing. Experts attribute the broader slump to higher labor costs, increased overseas competition, and Brexit, but July's figures offer a positive, albeit localized, development for the industry.

          <p>Tesla's new car registrations in Europe plummeted by 40% in July, marking the seventh consecutive month of decline for the company, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). In stark contrast, Chinese rival BYD recorded a 225% annual surge in registrations during the same period, intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market. Challenges for Tesla include a lack of major model refreshes, reputational damage from Elon Musk's rhetoric, and aggressive expansion by Chinese manufacturers like BYD. This trend highlights a broader shift, with other major automakers also experiencing declines in European registrations due to increased competition from Chinese brands. (not investment advice)</p>

Having grown up watching the rivalry and played as a Kangaroo, Walters sees this as a significant challenge and a unique experience for his squad on foreign soil. He aims to lead Australia to victory in the three-Test series, with matches scheduled at Wembley, Everton's new stadium, and Headingley. Walters believes the series holds genuine interest for Australians and will strengthen the global profile of rugby league, despite some players opting for heritage nations.</p>

Internal emails show the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) staff questioned why the MoD was not fined, despite the body having guidance against such data sharing. The ICO ultimately decided against a fine to avoid imposing additional costs on taxpayers, while the MoD claims to have improved data security.</p>

          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia reported a 56% surge in revenue to $46.7 billion for the second quarter, primarily driven by the booming demand for artificial intelligence capabilities from major tech firms. Despite navigating US-China trade tensions and fast-changing Trump administration policies regarding AI chip sales to China, demand for Nvidia's products remains strong. CEO Jensen Huang noted a significant increase in spending from big tech companies on AI infrastructure. However, the company's shares slipped after data center revenue slightly missed expectations, and the firm continues to lobby the US government for sales approvals amidst China's efforts to cultivate its domestic chipmaking industry.

          <p>The Trump administration announced a proposed rule to limit the duration of stay for international students in the U.S. to four years, aiming to curb "visa abuse" and enhance oversight. This change would replace the current "duration of status" policy, which allows students to remain as long as they are enrolled full-time. The Department of Homeland Security claims some foreign students exploit the system, while critics warn the measure could deter international enrollment and negatively impact U.S. colleges financially. The proposal also includes limits for foreign journalists, with the administration asserting it will ease the burden on federal oversight and reduce visa holders.</p>

The shooter, who had no extensive criminal history, fired dozens of shots from outside the church using three firearms.

          <p>The news of Taylor Swift's engagement has sparked widespread emotional reactions among her dedicated fanbase, bringing the academic concept of "parasocial relationships" into sharp focus. These one-sided connections, where individuals develop feelings of intimacy or friendship with celebrities who are unaware of their existence, are significantly amplified by the continuous stream of personal information shared across social media platforms. While such relationships can indeed foster a sense of community and provide emotional comfort, particularly during periods of social isolation, experts like psychologist Sonia Jaeger caution that they fundamentally cannot replace reciprocal, genuine, and real-life friendships. Jaeger aptly describes this phenomenon as "my friend who doesn't know me," underscoring that these interactions lack the mutual support and direct engagement essential for authentic human connection.</p>

The governor recounted a February Oval Office meeting where Trump pointed to a portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the only president to serve more than two terms, and discussed the possibility of a third term.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot is rapidly approaching the significant $1 billion mark, now estimated at a staggering $950 million for the upcoming Saturday night's drawing, after no tickets successfully matched the winning numbers for Wednesday's roughly $850 million grand prize. The estimated cash value for this monumental pot of gold is $428.9 million, positioning it as potentially the game's sixth-largest jackpot ever recorded. Powerball officials have noted a considerable surge in ticket sales, which have doubled in the past week, thereby contributing to the continuously growing prize pool and simultaneously benefiting various community causes. A single jackpot winner retains the choice of either taking a lump sum payment or opting for an annuity paid out over 29 annual installments.</p>

          <p>Microsoft announced the immediate termination of two employees who gained unauthorized entry into President Brad Smith's office earlier this week during a protest against the Israeli military's alleged use of the company's software. The employees, affiliated with the activist group "No Azure for Apartheid," had demanded that Microsoft completely cease its direct and indirect support for Israel. Microsoft explicitly stated that these terminations were a direct consequence of "serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct," which included unlawful break-ins and allegations of planting listening devices. The company is currently cooperating fully with law enforcement, and Smith has committed to launching an investigation into claims regarding the use of Microsoft's technology in surveillance, following earlier campus protests that resulted in multiple arrests.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed performance following the Bank of Korea's decision to maintain its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting. South Korea's Kospi registered a slight gain, while the small-cap Kosdaq experienced a modest decline. Japan's Nikkei 225 also climbed, and Australia's Qantas shares reached a record high after reporting robust full-year earnings. Conversely, India's Nifty 50 opened lower, primarily due to the imposition of secondary U.S. tariffs of 25% on Indian shipments, which has intensified concerns regarding the country's economic growth prospects. Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings initially provided a boost to Asian chip stocks, though a slight shortfall in data center revenue caused a minor dip in extended trading.

          <p>The Bank of Korea maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, opting to further assess the dynamics of housing prices in Seoul and the broader household debt situation, despite indications of improving economic growth. The central bank notably upgraded its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% and its GDP growth forecast to 0.9%, anticipating a modest recovery in domestic demand, partly due to a supplementary budget and enhanced consumer sentiment. This decision also follows recent trade and investment agreements between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump, including substantial investment pledges and reduced tariffs, which are expected to provide support for exports. However, the BOK issued a warning that the expanding impacts of U.S. tariffs could gradually slow exports, indicating a continued cautious outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commemorative train ride from Chicago to Mississippi marked 70 years since the brutal lynching of Emmett Till in 1955, an event that ignited the modern Civil Rights Movement. The journey, organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, included Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till, 14, was abducted and killed after allegedly whistling at a white woman; his mother's decision for an open-casket funeral exposed the horror to the nation. Parker emphasized the importance of remembering Till's sacrifice, stating, "He didn't die in vain," while acknowledging America's ongoing need for healing despite progress.</p>

          <p>The South Florida Water Management District has deployed 120 robot rabbits in the Everglades as a novel approach to lure and eliminate invasive Burmese pythons, which are decimating native wildlife. These solar-powered robotic decoys mimic real rabbits by emitting heat, smell, and movement, and are monitored by cameras to alert contractors when a python is nearby for removal. Pythons, non-native to Florida and capable of laying up to 100 eggs, have few natural predators and are notoriously difficult to find due to their camouflage. While the project is in its early stages, officials are optimistic about its potential to aid in the ongoing effort to control the estimated tens to hundreds of thousands of snakes.</p>

This incident signals a concerning return to heightened tensions after a period of what was described as "peaceful coexistence."

          <p>USC has offered Notre Dame a multi-year extension to continue their century-old football rivalry, following public concern over its potential end. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed hope for a swift agreement, acknowledging the series' importance for both programs and fans. Previously, USC was hesitant due to College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands, initially offering only a short extension. While Notre Dame preferred a long-term deal, the biggest remaining issue for USC is the game's date, as playing a cross-country non-conference game in mid-October complicates their Big Ten schedule. Despite past comments from Coach Lincoln Riley prioritizing national championship aspirations, the desire to maintain the rivalry remains strong.</p>

          <p>Europe is enduring its worst wildfire season on record, with one million hectares burned across the EU so far this year, equivalent to half the land area of Wales. Spain and Portugal are particularly affected, with roughly 1% of the Iberian Peninsula scorched, a figure six times their average. Experts link the worsening fire season directly to climate change, which creates more extreme heat and dries out vegetation, increasing flammability. These fires also contribute to a vicious cycle by releasing record amounts of CO2, further exacerbating climate change. The intensity and frequency of modern wildfires pose a threat to long-term ecosystem stability and challenge traditional fire management techniques.</p>

Vasquez, who was nonverbal, had been reported missing two weeks prior after he reportedly escaped from his home through a bedroom window. The Orleans Parish Coroner's office determined the official cause of death as drowning, accompanied by blunt trauma consistent with an alligator attack, subsequently transitioning the case to an unclassified death investigation. Criticism has arisen concerning the New Orleans Police Department's delayed response, with a nearly five-hour gap between the initial report and an officer's arrival.
