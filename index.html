          <p>A senior White House official has clarified the terms of the preliminary deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States, stating the federal government will not take an equity stake or a 'golden share.' The agreement will establish TikTok's U.S. operations as a new joint venture with a majority-American board of directors. Tech giant Oracle is set to oversee the platform's security operations, a key component in addressing the national security concerns that prompted the initial divest-or-ban order against TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p>

While advocates acknowledge the technology is still a work in progress with limitations like battery life, they praise it as a significant step forward.

          <p>A raid against a Pakistani Taliban (TTP) compound in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has resulted in the deaths of over 20 people, including at least 10 civilians. Security officials stated the compound was used to store bomb-making materials, which allegedly exploded during the operation and destroyed several nearby homes. The high number of civilian casualties, which included women and children, has sparked a protest of around 2,000 people and drawn condemnation from local politicians who described the raid as an attack on unarmed civilians.</p>

A large-scale search was initiated after their vehicle was located with camping gear still inside, raising concerns due to recent bad weather. The search involved more than 50 personnel using drones, dogs, and a helicopter. The two men were eventually discovered deceased by Colorado Search and Rescue, concluding the multi-day effort.</p>

          <p>While national household incomes remained relatively stable, seven of the 50 largest U.S. cities experienced a decline in median income between 2023 and 2024, according to a SmartAsset analysis of Census Bureau data. Minneapolis saw the largest drop at just over 4%, with a particularly sharp 19% decline for households with children in the city. The article notes that some of the affected cities, like Denver and Seattle, still maintain incomes well above the national median, and demographic shifts could be a contributing factor.

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Reduces Monthly Payments on Large Mortgages</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate down to 6.13%, its lowest point in nearly three years. This reduction offers significant relief to borrowers, particularly those with large loans. For example, a new $1 million mortgage at today's rate would have a monthly principal and interest payment about $600 lower than it would have at the start of the year, potentially saving a homeowner over $200,000 in interest over the life of the loan.

          <p>St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem has expressed support for last week's quarter-point interest rate cut but cautioned against significant further easing. In a speech, he described the cut as a "precautionary move" and stated that he believes there is now "limited room" for more reductions without making monetary policy overly accommodative. As a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Musalem's cautious stance suggests he is still concerned about inflation and prefers to tread carefully on future policy decisions.

          <p>A significant cyberattack has targeted MUSE, a widely-used airport software system operated by Collins Aerospace, causing major disruptions at airports including Berlin, Brussels, and London Heathrow. The ransomware attack on check-in and boarding systems forced staff to revert to manual processes, leading to widespread flight cancellations and delays. Cybersecurity experts suggest the incident may have been a "proof of concept" attack, raising concerns that the hackers could be leveraging the disruption to extort the software provider or cause further chaos.</p>

          <p>A recent anti-corruption rebellion led by Nepal's urban youth, which successfully ousted the government, has significant geopolitical implications for India, China, and the United States. The Himalayan nation has long maintained a delicate diplomatic balance between these competing global powers, all of whom have strategic interests in its stability. The political upheaval, described as a "revolution of mass frustration," could lead to shifts in Nepal's foreign policy and its alignment with major international development projects like China's Belt and Road Initiative or the US-backed Millennium Challenge Corporation grant.</p>

          <p>The number of "solopreneurs," or businesses with no paid employees, is booming in the United States, now contributing $1.7 trillion to the national economy. Experts attribute this rapid growth to significantly lower barriers to entry, driven by AI tools that serve as virtual assistants and social media platforms that enable instant customer engagement. This trend also reflects a major cultural shift in the workforce, with more individuals prioritizing the flexibility, autonomy, and sense of purpose that come with running their own one-person venture.</p>

Press freedom advocates have condemned the "ex parte" order, which was issued without hearing from the defendants, as a form of pre-publication censorship that sets a dangerous precedent. The ruling also applies to unnamed "John Doe" defendants, creating a chilling effect that could discourage investigative reporting on powerful corporations and their relationship with the government in India.</p>

          <p>China's imports of crude oil from Russia fell by 15.2% in August compared to the previous year, according to official customs data. However, this decrease was offset by a sharp rise in purchases from other countries, including Brazil and Indonesia, keeping China's total crude import volume stable. Analysts are mixed on the cause, with some suggesting the dip from Russia may be a temporary fluctuation due to maintenance at key production sites rather than a signal of a broader trend. Meanwhile, China's imports of U.S. crude remained at zero for a third straight month.</p>

The article posits that his tendency to break or undermine agreements, even those he negotiated himself, has taught allies and adversaries alike that the U.S. cannot be trusted to keep its word. This lack of reliability encourages other nations to "de-risk" from their dependence on America, thereby weakening the U.S. position and creating strategic opportunities for rivals like China and Russia.</p>

Despite a slick, retro-futuristic design, the restaurant is criticized for operational issues, such as a poorly designed staircase, and a menu of mediocre, overpriced food. The author argues that instead of reinventing American dining, the diner serves primarily as a social media backdrop, embodying a superficial and ultimately uninspired vision of the future.</p>

The selections span different eras and contexts, from Tom Holland's account of the Roman Republic's fall in "Rubicon" to Jane Mayer's modern investigation of campaign finance in "Dark Money." Together, the books aim to provide a deeper understanding of how corrupt practices become normalized, how they are justified, and their devastating long-term consequences on governance and society.</p>
