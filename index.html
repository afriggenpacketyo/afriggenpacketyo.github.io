          <p>Starbucks is exploring the sale of a stake in its China business, its second-largest market, due to macroeconomic and competitive pressures. The company has contacted private equity firms and technology companies to gauge interest in the business, which could be valued at several billion dollars. This move comes as Starbucks faces increasing competition from domestic players like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee, which have significantly impacted its market share. Starbucks had over 7,750 stores in China as of March, generating approximately $740 million in net revenue during the quarter.</p>

          <p>A couple in Gloucester Township, New Jersey, has been arrested and charged with multiple offenses, including kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault, after allegedly abusing and confining a child in their home for years. The victim, now 18, escaped with the help of a neighbor and reported the abuse, which began around 2018. The victim was forced to live in a dog crate for about a year, later chained in a bathroom, and also sexually abused by the stepfather. Authorities are also investigating how homeschooling regulations may have contributed to the prolonged abuse, as the child was removed from school in seventh grade.</p>

          <p>The House is progressing on President Trump's "one, big beautiful bill," with three committees voting to advance key parts of the budget package addressing defense, energy, and tax priorities. The Ways and Means Committee, responsible for tax portions, advanced its section after nearly 18 hours of debate, though a conflict over the state and local tax deduction (SALT) remains. The Energy and Commerce Committee focused on Medicaid cuts, while the Agriculture Committee addressed food stamp changes. The House aims for a vote next week, but the Senate's input is still needed, and some Senate Republicans have expressed concerns about the House's legislation.</p>

Conservative lawmakers argue the Medicaid cuts do not go far enough, while Republicans from high-tax states are furious about the state and local tax deduction provision.

A deckhand's delay in waking the captain, compounded by the yacht's single, tall mast, increased its vulnerability.

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled that his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. Suri, an Indian national, was arrested by immigration agents in March, with authorities accusing him of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist." The judge refuted the government's claims that he had ties to Hamas through his wife's family, and the Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri in separate proceedings. Several students and academics have been investigated by US immigration officials in recent weeks, accusing them of advocating for "violence and terrorism".</p>

          <p>China-Philippine ties face uncertainty after President Marcos failed to eliminate the Duterte political dynasty's grip on power. Vice-President Duterte is likely to receive enough backing to avoid impeachment and is poised to become a formidable candidate in the 2028 presidential election. Her "pragmatic" stance on China could usher in better China-Philippines ties if she succeeds in the race. With Marcos failing to secure a majority of Senate seats in the midterms, Duterte's allies are poised to claim five, potentially shielding her from conviction and preserving her eligibility for the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's hostile approach to South Africa has culminated in welcoming white South African refugees while suspending the refugee program for everyone else. This decision is rooted in Trump's long-held views about white farmers in South Africa, influenced by Afrikaner activists and advisors. The administration halted foreign aid to South Africa, claiming "race-based discrimination," and expelled the South African ambassador. The move is part of a broader effort to eradicate diversity and inclusion programs and prioritize white victimhood. This shift has fueled a diplomatic spiral between the two nations and underscores the administration's focus on issues of racial grievance.</p>

          <p>Following the US offer of refugee status to white South African Afrikaners, opinions within the community are divided. While some, like Ilse Steenkamp, see themselves as a persecuted minority and have applied for the program, others, such as Ulrich Janse van Vuuren, express pride in their South African identity and criticize those who leave as "opportunists." The US government has clarified that applicants need to be of South African nationality, Afrikaner or from a racial minority, and able to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution. The arrival of the first group of 59 Afrikaners in the US has drawn mixed reactions in South Africa.</p>

Security concerns and the potential cost of retrofitting the Qatari aircraft to meet American military standards have also been raised.

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived long-dormant thrusters on Voyager 1, the farthest spacecraft from Earth, before a planned communications blackout. The probe uses thrusters to keep its antenna pointed at Earth, and the thrusters had been out of action since 2004. The fix was implemented to avoid the risk of clogging in backup thrusters, which could have threatened the mission. This effort was completed just before a giant Earth-based antenna went offline for upgrades, making communication with Voyager 1 impossible until 2026. The team's success was considered a "miracle save" for the historic mission.</p>

          <p>Missouri Republicans are seeking to reinstate a near-total abortion ban through a ballot question in November 2026, after voters overturned a previous ban through a citizen-sponsored ballot measure. The measure would amend the state Constitution to ban abortion except in medical emergencies, or in cases of rape or incest if reported to police within 48 hours. This move bucks the trend on abortion-related ballot measures, where voters have largely sided with abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The coalition of abortion rights groups behind the ballot question passed in November called the legislature’s move “a direct assault on voters.”</p>
