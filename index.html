          <h2>National Security Advisor Waltz Expected to Depart Amid Signal Chat Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 12:16:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is expected to leave his position following controversy over a Signal messaging group incident. The group, which included high-level Trump administration officials, inadvertently included a journalist who reported details of U.S. military plans. Waltz's departure would mark the first major personnel change in the Trump administration's second term, and it follows public scrutiny and reported frustration from the President. The Signal group mishap involved discussions of military strikes on Houthi forces in Yemen, raising concerns about security protocols and the use of the messaging app. Optimism is low given the security breach and the potential for future incidents, which reflects the disruption and uncertainty within the administration.</p>

          <h2>Automakers See April Sales Surge Amid Tariff Concerns, Future Uncertain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 12:13:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant sales increases in April, driven by consumers rushing to buy vehicles ahead of anticipated tariff-related price hikes. This "tariff fear-buying" was further incentivized by automakers offering special discounts or price guarantees. However, analysts caution that this surge may not last, as demand slowed in late April due to tightening inventories and rising prices. The implementation of Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts is expected to impact the market, potentially leading to higher costs and lower sales in the future. This article discusses the immediate effects of the tariffs and the potential long-term consequences for the auto industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is discontinuing $1 billion in Biden-era grants aimed at bolstering mental health services in schools, citing concerns that the programs were not advancing administration priorities and were being used to implement race-based actions. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that the grants were being used for recruiting quotas unrelated to mental health, potentially harming students. Critics, such as the American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, have condemned the decision as a direct attack on the safety and well-being of children, especially in light of the ongoing gun violence epidemic. Dr. Tish Brookins, a certified social worker, warned that the decision could result in missed opportunities and diminished futures for students.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to detain or remove Venezuelan migrants being held in southern Texas. Judge Fernando Rodriguez stated that the president's invocation of the AEA exceeded the scope of the statute. While the ruling prevents the administration from using the AEA to detain or remove these migrants, it does not prohibit removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act. This decision marks a setback for the president's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, specifically targeting Venezuelan migrants allegedly associated with the gang Tren de Aragua.</p>

          <p>Chris Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), has had his Global Entry membership revoked following a memorandum from President Trump. The memo targeted Krebs for defending the integrity of the 2020 election, which Trump continues to claim was fraudulent. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Krebs is under active investigation by law enforcement agencies, disqualifying him from the program. Krebs was fired by Trump in 2020 after CISA refuted claims of widespread voter fraud, and this action is seen as further retaliation against Trump's political adversaries.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has questioned the $2.5 billion price tag for the Federal Reserve building renovation, calling it an "eyebrow-raiser." Musk, who initiated the Department of Government Efficiency, suggested the cost overruns should be examined as part of a broader effort to curtail wasteful government spending. The Fed began the project in 2021 with an initial budget of $1.9 billion, but costs have risen due to material expenses, construction delays, and design changes. The Fed maintains that the renovation will save money in the long run by consolidating staff and improving energy efficiency.</p>

Under the RAP plan, monthly bills would be a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10% based on earnings.

          <p>American consumers are beginning to see the effects of President Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese imports, with disruptions expected to intensify in the coming weeks. High tariffs have led to a decline in container ships leaving China for the U.S., potentially causing empty shelves and layoffs. The elimination of the de minimis treatment for Chinese goods will further raise prices. Economists warn that the U.S. could slip into a recession if the tariffs remain in place, with the full impact becoming apparent in the summer of 2025.</p>
