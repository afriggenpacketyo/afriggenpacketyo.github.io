          <p>The body of a teenage boy was discovered in Powell's Pool at Sutton Park in Birmingham after he was reported missing in the water. Emergency services conducted an extensive search, but the boy was already deceased when found. West Midlands Police are not treating the death as suspicious and are providing support to the family during this tragic time. The incident has prompted renewed warnings about the dangers of swimming in open water, with local community groups and a parkrun event expressing their condolences and cancelling activities out of respect.</p>

          <h2>UK Economy Experiences Unexpected Contraction for Second Consecutive Month</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in May, marking the second straight month of decline and defying analysts' expectations of slight growth. The Office for National Statistics attributed the shrinkage primarily to a drop in manufacturing, particularly in car-making and pharmaceuticals, alongside weak retail sales. Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed disappointment but affirmed her determination to stimulate economic growth. The figures highlight the fragile state of the economy, with experts noting that recent government spending decisions have reduced the financial buffer to handle such shocks.

          <p>The FBI has announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of a person who appeared to fire a weapon at federal law enforcement officers. The incident occurred in Camarillo, California, during clashes between protesters and agents over immigration raids. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli released a photo and video of the suspect, who was wearing a black t-shirt and a white medical mask. Federal authorities have condemned the act, stating that anyone targeting law enforcement agents will face the full force of federal prosecution.</p>

          <p>China's "instant commerce" sector is embroiled in a fierce price war, with major players like JD.com, Alibaba, and Meituan offering massive subsidies and deep discounts to capture market share. This competition has resulted in extremely low prices for consumers, such as coffee for under thirty cents, but has negatively impacted the companies' stock values and earnings outlooks. Despite regulatory scrutiny and concerns about anti-competitive practices, these tech giants continue to invest billions in subsidies. The long-term financial impact of this strategy remains uncertain as companies burn through profits to gain users. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has been declared fit to resume playing on the second day of the third Test against India at Lord's. Stokes had experienced a right groin issue on the first day of the match, causing concern about his ability to continue batting and bowling. However, after bowling before play on Friday, he was cleared to rejoin his partner Joe Root at the crease. The news is a significant relief for the England team, which relies heavily on the all-rounder's contributions, though his deputy acknowledged the need to manage his workload carefully.</p>

Many citizens are pointing to numerous, long-standing water leaks in public streets that they say waste thousands of gallons daily.

Djokovic, who fell awkwardly during his quarter-final victory, cancelled a scheduled practice session on Thursday, casting some doubt on his physical condition. His opponent, Sinner, is also managing an elbow injury but has stated he will be 100% fit for the highly anticipated match. Given his age and a recent injury-related retirement at the Australian Open, Djokovic's decision to skip practice is being closely watched as he prepares to face the world number one.</p>

          <p>The recent OPEC seminar, held at Vienna's historic Hofburg palace, brought together top energy ministers, CEOs, and global analysts to discuss the oil market, investment, and the green transition. The high-profile event, led by Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, served as a major gathering for the world's most influential energy players. However, the conference was also met with protests outside the palace, with demonstrators calling for an oil embargo in response to the conflict in Gaza. The article highlights the contrast between the opulent, high-stakes discussions inside and the political activism occurring just outside its gates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration escalated global trade tensions this week by issuing letters to numerous countries, threatening new tariffs if agreements are not reached by August 1. Major economies like Japan and South Korea, along with developing nations in Southeast Asia, face potential tariffs ranging from 25% to 40%. The U.S. also announced a 35% tariff on Canada and a 50% tariff on Brazil, while a letter to the European Union is forthcoming. Despite the sweeping threats, the U.S. has only secured two new trade deals, and global stock markets have remained largely stable, with traders seemingly expecting further delays or negotiated resolutions.

          <p>The global pharmaceutical industry is in a state of uncertainty as it prepares for a potential 200% tariff on foreign-made drugs proposed by the Trump administration. While President Trump has suggested a grace period of about a year and a half, analysts warn that such a high tariff would severely inflate production costs, compress profits, and likely lead to drug shortages and higher prices for U.S. consumers. In response, major firms like Roche, Bayer, and Novartis are monitoring the situation closely and have made commitments to increase investment in U.S. manufacturing, though they note the timeline is insufficient to fully relocate supply chains.

In a significant development, a U.S. delegation, including President Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg and bipartisan senators, attended the group's meeting in Rome for the first time. The force, known as the Multinational Force Ukraine, aims to help reconstitute Ukraine's military and secure its skies and seas after the war. While no U.S. troops are planned for deployment, Washington's presence was hailed as a fundamental sign of Western unity in supporting Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a celebrated professor and pioneer of IVF treatment, has resigned his long-standing membership from the British Medical Association (BMA) over planned strikes by resident doctors. The Labour peer argued that the five-day walkout, planned over a pay dispute, is ill-timed and could damage public trust in the medical profession. Lord Winston, a BMA member since 1964, emphasized that doctors have a serious responsibility to their vulnerable patients. His public departure adds a high-profile voice to the debate surrounding the strikes, as the BMA and the government remain deadlocked over pay negotiations.</p>
