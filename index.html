          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed at least 15 Palestinians, including eight children, who were waiting for nutritional supplements outside a clinic. The aid group Project Hope, which operates the clinic, condemned the attack as a violation of international law. The Israeli military stated it targeted a Hamas militant and expressed regret for any civilian harm. This incident occurred amidst ongoing, but difficult, ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, with both sides reporting significant gaps in their positions.</p>

          <p>A former Houston official, Sade Perkins, is facing significant public criticism after making comments on social media describing a summer camp devastated by recent Texas floods as a "Whites-only Christian camp." She suggested the tragedy would receive less media coverage if the victims were minorities. A crowdfunding campaign has been launched to support her amid the backlash, which organizers term "racialized violence," while her own boyfriend has publicly disavowed her statements. The fundraiser has attracted both small donations and numerous critical, hostile messages.</p>

          <p>Job search platforms Indeed and Glassdoor are laying off approximately 1,300 employees, about 6% of the workforce of their parent company, Recruit Holdings. The CEO attributed the restructuring to the need to adapt to the changes brought by artificial intelligence, aiming to simplify the hiring process and reduce manual work. As part of the changes, Glassdoor's operations will be integrated into Indeed, and its CEO will be stepping down. The move reflects a broader corporate trend of investing in AI, which some leaders believe could replace a significant portion of white-collar jobs.</p>

          <p>As the only nation to have suffered a nuclear attack, Japan has long championed global disarmament, a position deeply rooted in the memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, this identity is being challenged by the current geopolitical climate, particularly the rapid nuclear buildups in neighboring China and North Korea. According to an analysis by The Atlantic, the prospect of South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons could be the tipping point that compels Japan to abandon its non-nuclear taboo. This potential proliferation cascade highlights the fragility of long-standing nonproliferation efforts in the face of new security threats.</p>

The rule had long been criticized as "security theater," and bypassing it was a perk for those who paid for services like TSA PreCheck.

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, just a year after failing to even qualify for the tournament. She secured her spot by stunning world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the semi-finals. This achievement marks a significant comeback for the 23-year-old, who took a lengthy break from the sport in 2023 to address burnout and mental health struggles. Anisimova's journey back to the top of the game, which also involved overcoming the sudden death of her father and coach in 2019, has been an inspiration.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are in a significant slump, having lost six consecutive games and being swept in back-to-back series. This downturn, fueled by lackluster offense and a tired pitching staff, mirrors a similar pre-All-Star break skid from last season. While manager Dave Roberts attributes the slump to the natural ebbs and flows of baseball, the team's struggles without key injured players are raising concerns. With the trade deadline approaching, the losing streak is intensifying questions about whether the first-place team needs to acquire reinforcements, particularly for its bullpen and potentially another impact bat.</p>

This upward movement follows a period of consolidation and comes as billions of dollars continue to flow into Bitcoin ETFs and as public companies increase their holdings.
