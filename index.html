          <p>Yemen's Houthi movement has officially confirmed the death of its self-proclaimed Prime Minister, Ahmed Ghaleb Nasser al-Rahawi, in an Israeli airstrike on the capital, Sanaa. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a gathering of senior Houthi officials, resulting in the "elimination" of Rahawi and several ministers. This attack is part of the ongoing conflict where Houthis have been targeting Israel and commercial shipping in solidarity with Palestinians, prompting retaliatory Israeli airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. The group has appointed a deputy to assume the late prime minister's duties.</p>

          <p>Decades after the fact, new evidence suggests that famed Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. Investigators, using modern forensic techniques on her exhumed remains, found inconsistencies with Pusser's original account of an ambush, including evidence that the crime scene was staged and his own gunshot wound was likely self-inflicted. The district attorney stated that if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, there would be enough probable cause for a murder indictment. The findings aim to bring closure to Pauline's family.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has unexpectedly revoked permission for striker Nicolas Jackson to complete a loan move to Bayern Munich, instructing him to return to London after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision was prompted by a serious hamstring injury to fellow Chelsea striker Liam Delap during a match against Fulham, which left the team with only one fit striker. The last-minute collapse of the deal has reportedly angered Jackson, but Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca indicated the club needed to reassess its squad depth following the injury. The situation highlights the precarious nature of transfer window dealings.</p>

          <p>The No. 3 Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the top-ranked Texas Longhorns 14-7 in a highly anticipated college football matchup, repeating their victory from last season's Cotton Bowl. Texas quarterback Arch Manning struggled in his first career road start against Ohio State's formidable defense, throwing for 170 yards, most of which came in the fourth quarter. The Longhorns' offense was repeatedly stalled, failing on three critical fourth-down conversion attempts. Ohio State's defense dominated the game, holding Texas scoreless until the final minutes and solidifying the Buckeyes' position as a national championship contender.</p>

          <p>Manchester United narrowly defeated Burnley 3-2, thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a crucial win for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the victory was overshadowed by persistent goalkeeping errors, with goalkeeper Altay Bayindir's mistake leading to Burnley's second goal.

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights in anticipation of a potential deployment of federal agents by the Trump administration. The order seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks, require them to display identifying information, and prohibit city departments from participating in federal actions that violate rights to peaceful protest. Citing "highly credible reports" of an imminent deployment, the mayor's action is largely symbolic but underscores the escalating tensions between the city and the federal government over law enforcement tactics. The White House dismissed the order as a "publicity stunt."</p>

          <p>A shooter opened fire at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, killing two children, 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski, and injuring 18 others.

Authorities revealed the shooter, a former student at the attached school, had legally purchased three firearms recently and had an obsession with past mass shootings, leaving behind anti-Catholic writings.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most countries are illegal, stating he overstepped his authority. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used to justify the levies, does not grant the president the power to impose tariffs, a power that resides with Congress. The ruling puts tariffs affecting a majority of U.S. goods imports on uncertain ground, though sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum are unaffected. The administration is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While no uniform international rules exist for children's screen time, a consensus among experts suggests a cautious approach based on developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is "screen-free until three," as they need to explore the physical world and develop self-control. For preschool-aged children, excessive screen time can hinder the development of social skills and imagination, with a maximum of 30 minutes suggested. As children grow, the focus shifts from time limits to content and context, with experts advising supervised use and open communication to mitigate risks and ensure digital engagement doesn't replace crucial real-world interactions.</p>

While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she believes the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy.

The call for resignation follows the recent firing of the CDC director and the subsequent protest resignations of four other top officials.

VOA, established during World War II to provide objective news in regions with limited press freedom, has been a target of the administration.

          <p>President Trump has indicated that a direct bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is unlikely to happen soon. However, he stated that a trilateral meeting involving the U.S. "will happen," without providing a specific timeline. In the same interview, Trump also suggested he would be open to using U.S. air power as part of a security guarantee to help end the war in Ukraine. His comments come as a federal judge blocked his administration's expanded use of expedited removal for immigrants, dealing a setback to his deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. Investigators traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Afghans who fled the Taliban takeover and were promised entry into Germany are now living in fear of deportation from Pakistan. These individuals, many of whom worked for Western organizations, have been waiting for years for their German visas to be processed. As Pakistan prepares to resume deportations, many families are in hiding, unable to work or send children to school. After a months-long freeze, the German government has announced it will resume processing applications, following pressure from human rights groups and German court rulings that affirmed the legally binding nature of the visa promises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. Researchers from Imperial College London conducted a study across over 200 GP surgeries, finding the device significantly improved detection rates compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope analyzes subtle sounds in heartbeat and blood flow that are undetectable by the human ear and compares them to a vast patient database. Experts believe this innovation could be a "game-changer" for early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive treatment sooner.</p>

          <p>As Labor Day approaches, U.S. unions are grappling with significant challenges from the Trump administration, including increased immigration raids, proposed cuts to Medicaid, and a weakened National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Labor groups report scrambling to support members affected by deportations and fear that administrative changes, such as ending collective bargaining for some federal unions and cutting the NLRB's budget, are systematically rolling back worker protections. While some national unions have found common ground with the administration on trade, many local organizations describe a feeling of being "under attack" and fighting for survival.</p>

          <p>The term "red pill," originating from the 1999 film "The Matrix," has evolved from an internet metaphor into a cornerstone of a widespread, anti-feminist political ideology. Initially used in online forums for "pick-up artists" and men's rights activists, the "manosphere" now encompasses a range of misogynistic and conspiracy-minded beliefs. This ideology has become a global phenomenon, with influencers like Andrew Tate popularizing its tenets and its language seeping into mainstream conservative discourse. Researchers note that its concepts have influenced real-world extremist violence and are adapting to different cultural and religious contexts worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Pickett fire, the largest wildfire in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, has caused an estimated $65 million in agricultural losses, primarily affecting Napa Valley's wine grape growers. Wineries like the Robert Craig Winery have lost entire crops due to direct fire damage, controlled burns, and the lingering threat of smoke taint, which can ruin the taste of grapes. This event compounds the financial devastation from previous wildfires in 2020 and 2018, with some vintners facing skyrocketing insurance costs. The recurring threat of wildfires poses a significant and ongoing challenge to California's iconic wine industry.</p>

          <p>After a two-year, $1 million study identified agricultural pollution as a primary cause of Iowa's severe water quality problems, funding for public outreach has been quietly withdrawn by public officials. The report, which links contaminants from the state's powerful farm industry to health risks like high cancer rates, was intended to be widely shared with the public. However, over $400,000 remaining in the budget, partly earmarked for promoting the findings, was "zeroed out" without explanation. This move has raised concerns that political interests are suppressing the report's conclusions and hindering efforts to address the state's water crisis.</p>
