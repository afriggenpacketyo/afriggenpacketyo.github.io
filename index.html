          <p>Max Verstappen of Red Bull secured a dominant victory at the United States Grand Prix, increasing pressure on McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in the championship race. Norris finished second after overcoming Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, while Piastri struggled, finishing fifth. The race, held in Austin, saw Verstappen convert his pole position into a commanding lead, marking his record seventh win at the event. This victory further solidifies Verstappen's position, as Norris cut Piastri's championship lead to 14 points with five races remaining, while Verstappen reduced his deficit to the Australian to 40 points. With F1 announcing a deal to keep the Austin race on the calendar until 2034, the grand prix was relatively uneventful. The race highlighted McLaren's relative loss of form and Leclerc's strong performance.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries campaigned for California's Proposition 50 at Black churches in Los Angeles, advocating for redistricting efforts that could increase Democratic representation. Jeffries criticized Republicans for refusing to negotiate during the government shutdown and attempting to gerrymander congressional maps. Proposition 50 seeks to temporarily remove the independent redistricting commission to redraw the state's maps and add five Democratic seats. Jeffries emphasized the importance of voting yes on Proposition 50 and the significance of the African American church community in the political process. California Republicans, including former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, have criticized the initiative as hypocritical and a power grab by politicians. The current government shutdown is impacting federal employees and various programs, including healthcare and food assistance.</p>

Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire scored the goals, with Maguire's winner coming from a Bruno Fernandes cross. Amorim described the win as the biggest during his time at Manchester United, admitting his side had some luck. Former United skipper Roy Keane emphasized the need for the team to use this victory as a springboard for further success. Despite the euphoria, Amorim cautioned against complacency, highlighting the importance of maintaining the same spirit in training and upcoming games. The victory provides Amorim with a foundation to build upon after a challenging tenure.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area used by Air Force One when President Trump travels to Florida. The agency found "items of interest" during a sweep prior to Trump's arrival, including what appeared to be a platform or hunting stand high in a tree. The stand had reportedly been there for months but was only discovered recently due to construction that had previously prevented Secret Service sweeps of the area. The airport is located near Trump's Mar-A-Lago club, the site of an attempted assassination against the president last year. There was no impact to any movements and no individuals were present or involved at the location.</p>

          <p>Christine Baumgartner, who finalized her divorce from Kevin Costner in February 2024, married family friend Joshua Connor at a private vineyard in Santa Barbara, California. The outdoor ceremony was attended by 100 close family and friends, including their children. Baumgartner shares three children with Costner, while Connor has three children with his ex-wife. Romance rumors between Baumgartner and Connor began in July 2023, and they confirmed their relationship shortly after her divorce was finalized. Baumgartner filed for divorce in May 2023, citing irreconcilable differences, and later took Costner to court over child support and their prenuptial agreement. The former couple eventually agreed to joint legal and physical custody of their children.</p>

          <p>Former US congressman George Santos, recently released from prison after Donald Trump commuted his sentence, claimed his sentence was "disproportionate" but acknowledged receiving "a very large slice of humble pie". Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, had served less than three months of his seven-year sentence. He expressed surprise at Trump's decision and called for his former campaign staffer, Sam Miele, to also receive a commutation. Santos also stated that he would pay back the restitution if required by law. He defended Trump's decision, stating that even if Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ, he would have had critics.</p>

The soldier, who crossed the central portion of the land border, expressed a desire to resettle in South Korea. This marks the first reported defection by a North Korean soldier since August 2024. Defections across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) are uncommon due to heavy fortifications. Relations between the two Koreas remain strained, with North Korea rejecting outreach from South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung.

Mohamed Salah's substitution symbolized the team's current issues, with Liverpool now fourth in the Premier League, four points behind leaders Arsenal. Manager Arne Slot acknowledged the need for concern, noting the impact of consecutive losses on the team. Despite spending almost £450m on new players, key signings like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak have underperformed. Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock suggested tactical changes to improve the team's performance, while captain Virgil van Dijk emphasized the need for unity and hard work.</p>

          <p>President Trump accused Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, of being an “illegal drug dealer” and threatened to cut US funding to the country. The Defense Secretary confirmed an attack on a vessel associated with a Colombian leftist rebel group, resulting in three deaths. Trump blamed Petro for encouraging drug production and failing to stop it despite US payments. Petro responded by saying the US committed “murder” in a strike on an alleged drug boat in Colombian waters. This marks escalating tensions between the two nations, despite Colombia historically being a close US ally. The US is building up a military presence in the Caribbean and bordering coastlines.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to accept Russia's terms for ending the war during a White House meeting, warning of potential destruction if Ukraine didn't comply, according to the Financial Times. Trump reportedly insisted Zelenskiy surrender the Donbas region to Russia, echoing Putin's talking points. Ukraine managed to shift Trump to endorsing a freeze of current front lines. Putin offered small areas of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in exchange for larger parts of Donbas. Trump and Putin agreed to hold a second summit on the war in Ukraine within the next two weeks.

          <p>Kenya held a state funeral for longtime opposition leader Raila Odinga, who died in India while receiving medical treatment. Odinga was honored with full military honors, including a 17-gun salute. He was revered for his fight against autocratic rule and was jailed and exiled for his activism. Thousands traveled to his rural home in Bondo for the ceremony, following days of mass events marred by security incidents. President William Ruto, who signed a political pact with Odinga in March, vowed to honor the deal, though the party's intentions are unclear.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police in London are investigating a report that Prince Andrew asked an officer to dig up "dirt" on Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexual assault. The report alleges that Andrew provided Giuffre's personal information to the officer in 2011. This follows Buckingham Palace's announcement that Andrew would relinquish his royal title and honors after emails emerged showing continued contact with Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging he forced her to engage in sexual acts when she was 17. Andrew has denied the allegations, and the two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Ed Miliband, British Energy Secretary, stated that a police officer should not be enlisted in a smear campaign.</p>

          <p>Sabrina Carpenter used her appearance on Saturday Night Live to address criticism of her pop persona and recent album, Man’s Best Friend. A QVC spoof about a pillow resembling female genitalia served as a metaphor for reactions to Carpenter’s suggestive performances and visuals. Carpenter’s character maintained an innocent demeanor, highlighting the problem of how people interpret her work. Her opening monologue and other sketches also challenged the idea that she conforms to a misogynist male fantasy. Carpenter's performance doubled as a provocative question, asking why her sexuality is a big deal.</p>

          <p>George Santos, the disgraced former US Representative, announced his mission to dedicate his life to prison reform after being released from prison following a commuted sentence by President Trump. Santos described his experience in federal prison as "dehumanizing" and "humbling," detailing poor conditions such as rotting facilities and broken air conditioning. He said he spoke with Trump about his mission and offered to help the administration with prison reform. Santos has previously described the prison system as "broken" in columns published on The South Shore Press' website. Santos has stated that he's not interested in running for office again just yet, at least for the next decade.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration conducted a seventh strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel, resulting in three deaths, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The strike targeted a boat linked to a Colombian guerrilla group in international waters. The administration argues it is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, justifying the attacks. Senator Mark Kelly expressed concerns about the legal justification for the strikes, calling it "very convoluted". At least 32 people have been killed in U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats, raising questions about the legality and necessity of these actions.</p>
