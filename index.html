          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after experiencing mild leg swelling. His physician described the condition as benign and common for his age group, ruling out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. Chronic venous insufficiency is a circulatory condition where veins struggle to return blood from the legs to the heart, often managed with compression, exercise, and lifestyle adjustments. The announcement followed public speculation after photos showed swelling and bruising on the president's hand.</p>

          <p>An exclusive report alleges that the Climate Judiciary Project (CJP), an initiative by the Environmental Law Institute, engaged in a multi-year effort to influence judges on climate-related litigation. The group, which describes its mission as providing objective education on climate science, hosted an online forum with jurists that shared information and litigation updates. Critics, including Senator Ted Cruz, claim the CJP is funded by left-wing activists to promote a specific legal agenda, raising questions about judicial impartiality. The group chat was reportedly made private after inquiries were made.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Air travel this summer has been marked by a significant increase in flight cancellations compared to last year, with the national rate rising by about 29%. East Coast hubs like Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport have been hit hardest, with DCA seeing a 274% higher cancellation rate. Data analysis reveals that while the number of scheduled flights decreased, the absolute number of cancellations grew, and delay times have also increased. In contrast, some airports, including Miami and San Francisco, have seen improved performance with lower cancellation rates.</p>

          <p>The chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has formally warned Panama about potential Chinese influence over the Panama Canal. The warning comes amid reports that Chinese state-owned companies are bidding for control of two major ports currently operated by a Hong Kong-based firm. In a letter to Panama's Minister of Maritime Affairs, Representative John Moolenaar expressed alarm over China's "malign influence" on the vital global shipping route. The letter urged Panamanian authorities to ensure any new port operator is not beholden to Beijing.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has sued the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA, challenging the Trump administration's termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The lawsuit argues that the executive branch unlawfully shut down the congressionally funded program, which provided federal money for natural disaster mitigation projects. The states contend that eliminating the program jeopardizes critical infrastructure projects and leaves communities more vulnerable to harm from natural disasters. A FEMA spokesperson defended the cuts, calling the program wasteful and politicized.</p>

This practice has been particularly notable in cases involving the Trump administration, where the Court has frequently granted emergency relief, allowing contentious policies to take effect while litigation proceeds. Critics argue this approach undermines transparency and the normal judicial process, making it appear as though the conservative majority is making politically motivated decisions without offering legal reasoning.

          <p>Netflix reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating analyst expectations with a 16% year-over-year revenue increase to $11.08 billion. The company's net income also grew significantly to $3.1 billion, driven by a combination of subscriber growth, higher prices, and expanding ad revenue. Citing healthy performance and favorable currency exchange rates, Netflix raised its full-year revenue forecast. This marks the second quarter the company has not released specific subscriber numbers, instead focusing on financial metrics like revenue and operating margin to demonstrate growth.</p>

          <p>In response to rising anti-Semitism and pressure from the Trump administration, universities like Columbia and Harvard are implementing new administrative measures, including new coordinators and official definitions of anti-Semitism. This approach mirrors the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) frameworks established in recent years to combat other forms of discrimination. Critics express concern that this bureaucratic solution may prove ineffective or lead to speech policing, similar to criticisms leveled against some DEI initiatives. The situation is ironic, as the Trump administration is simultaneously pushing to eliminate DEI programs elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, a former personal attorney for President Trump, for a lifetime appointment to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. The vote occurred along party lines after all Democratic members walked out in protest. Bove's nomination has drawn significant opposition from former DOJ lawyers and retired judges, who express concern that his loyalty to the president would compromise his judicial impartiality. The nomination has also been clouded by whistleblower allegations that Bove encouraged government lawyers to disobey court orders.</p>

This information was previously protected by a court injunction, which has now been partially lifted.

California leaders, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and San Francisco's mayor, have fiercely criticized the plan as "lunacy" and a logistical and financial impossibility.
