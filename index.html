          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new investment in UnitedHealth, acquiring a stake worth approximately $1.6 billion amid the insurer's recent struggles. This move is notable given UnitedHealth is facing a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices, which had caused its stock to decline significantly this year. The investment, possibly made by one of Buffett's lieutenants, aligns with Berkshire's history of value investing and caused UnitedHealth's shares to surge in after-hours trading.

The 24-year-old winger had announced in early 2024 that he was leaving rugby to join the NFL's international player pathway program, signing with the Kansas City Chiefs and later the Jacksonville Jaguars. After failing to secure a spot, he has opted to return to rugby, stating Bristol was the "obvious choice" for his ambition to create exciting moments for fans.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Viability of Including Multiple Annuities in a Retirement Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 16:32:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, retirees are increasingly considering annuities for guaranteed income, raising the question of whether owning multiple annuities is a sound strategy. While holding various types like fixed and variable annuities can help diversify risk and balance stable income with growth potential, it also introduces complexity and additional fees. This approach requires careful planning around liquidity, as each contract has different surrender periods and withdrawal rules, and nuanced tax management to avoid higher tax burdens. A multi-annuity strategy is most suitable for those with substantial assets who can manage the increased administrative load. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A House Republican is introducing a resolution to remove the 30-day time limit on President Trump's federal takeover of the Washington, D.C. police force. The proposal by Rep. Andy Ogles would amend the Home Rule Act, allowing the president to extend control indefinitely by simply notifying congressional committees, a move that would require Congress to pass a joint resolution to end it. This legislative effort aims to give Trump the authority he needs to address what he terms a crime emergency, though it faces strong opposition from Democrats.</p>

Putin seeks international recognition and aims to solidify Russia's territorial claims, using the summit to argue that Western efforts to isolate him have failed. Conversely, Trump, who has vacillated in his stance on Russia, is driven by a desire to be seen as a global peacemaker and may be open to a deal.

          <p>The history between President Trump and Vladimir Putin creates a complex backdrop for their upcoming summit in Anchorage, where Trump hopes to broker an end to the Ukraine war. Past meetings have been marked by Trump's deference to Putin, notably at the 2018 Helsinki summit where he appeared to accept Putin's denial of election interference. However, Trump has recently expressed frustration with Putin's actions in Ukraine, creating uncertainty about whether he will maintain a firm stance or be swayed by Putin's transactional approach to diplomacy.</p>

          <p>A Justice Department employee has been fired and charged with a felony after admitting to throwing a sandwich at a federal law enforcement officer in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions following the federal takeover of the city's police, with the employee allegedly yelling profanities at officers before the assault. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the termination on social media, stating the individual's actions were disrespectful to law enforcement and an example of the 'Deep State' the administration is working to refocus.</p>

          <p>Target and Ulta Beauty have announced the end of their partnership, which placed Ulta beauty shops inside hundreds of Target stores and on its website. The deal, which began in 2021, will conclude in August 2026. The loss of the popular beauty brand could be another challenge for Target, which has faced flat sales, declining store traffic, and a significant drop in its stock value. Analysts suggest issues with in-store operations and staffing at Target may have contributed to the decision to end the collaboration.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Los Angeles County attempted to force the wife of City Councilman Curren Price to testify before a grand jury investigating him for corruption, according to new sources and court filings. Price faces charges of embezzlement, perjury, and conflict of interest for allegedly voting on measures that financially benefited his wife's real estate consulting firm. His wife, Del Richardson, was reportedly considered a suspect in the investigation but was not charged and ultimately did not testify, as Price's legal team questions the legality of the grand jury proceedings.</p>

          <p>German soccer champion Bayern Munich has ended its controversial "Visit Rwanda" branding deal, shifting to a partnership focused on youth football development in the country. The original sponsorship drew heavy criticism from fans and human rights activists due to Rwanda's alleged role in the conflict in DR Congo. While the club cited a "strategic evolution" for the change, experts believe the move was forced by external pressure, reflecting the influence of Germany's fan-centric club culture and the negative publicity surrounding deals with nations that have questionable human rights records.</p>

          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700% since its 2020 public debut, driven by strong retail investor interest and major government contracts. The company recently surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, yet its market valuation now dwarfs that of tech behemoths with far greater earnings, trading at over 280 times forward earnings. This high premium reflects immense investor confidence in Palantir's AI-powered software and its growing role with the U.S. military and other government agencies. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys have surpassed girls in achieving the top A-level grades in the UK, with 28.4% of their entries marked A* or A compared to 28.2% for girls. This narrow but significant shift is likely influenced by the growing popularity of STEM subjects, particularly maths, which are taken by a higher proportion of boys and tend to yield more top grades. While humanities subjects have seen a decline in popularity, the overall number of girls achieving top grades remains higher due to more female students taking A-levels in general.</p>
