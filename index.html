          <p>US President Donald Trump has issued a threat to disarm Hamas, citing the group's recent moves to reassert control in Gaza by targeting alleged "collaborators." Footage verified by BBC Verify shows public executions and displays of force by Hamas fighters since the US-brokered ceasefire began. Analysts suggest these actions are intended to counter armed clans that have challenged Hamas's authority, with some clans reportedly receiving Israeli support. The US administration indicates that Hamas's policing efforts do not violate the ceasefire, emphasizing the need for security to deliver aid and maintain stability in the devastated region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's competition watchdog has proposed that veterinary practices be required to publish price lists to increase transparency for pet owners. An investigation revealed that vet prices have surged at nearly double the inflation rate, with many owners unaware of potential costs or not receiving estimates for expensive treatments. Other recommendations include disclosing practice ownership, capping prescription fees, and banning bonuses for specific treatments. While the British Veterinary Association supports transparency, it cautions that poorly implemented price lists could lead to greater confusion for consumers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has charged Cambodian tycoon Chen Zhu, chairman of Prince Holding Group, with wire fraud and money laundering, seizing nearly $15 billion in Bitcoin. Prosecutors allege Chen and co-conspirators exploited forced labor at cyber scam centers in Cambodia, using 'pig butchering' scams to defraud investors globally. U.S. and British authorities have imposed sanctions on Chen's company, declaring it a transnational criminal organization. While this action marks a significant strike against such groups, analysts caution that these criminal organizations have historically shown adaptability to enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>Automotive industry groups are expressing significant concern over China's tightened export restrictions on rare earths and related technologies, fearing widespread supply chain disruption. Beijing asserts these measures are to prevent mineral misuse in sensitive sectors, despite earlier agreements aimed at facilitating shipments. German and Italian auto lobbies warn of severe consequences for European deliveries, with existing reserves at risk of depletion. Analysts highlight China's near-monopoly on global refinery capacity, making any supply restrictions a critical bottleneck for battery and semiconductor industries, impacting the automotive sector significantly.</p>

          <p>Humanitarian organizations are struggling to deliver crucial aid into Gaza, facing significant obstacles despite the ongoing ceasefire. Israeli authorities have limited aid volume, while destroyed infrastructure and rubble make distribution difficult. Winter's approach adds urgency, as essential supplies like food, water, and medicine are critically low for hundreds of thousands of displaced families. Restrictions on border crossings, including the Rafah crossing, have further hampered efforts, with aid workers describing current deliveries as a mere "trickle" compared to the immense needs for survival and rebuilding.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown enters its third week, the Trump administration is exploring alternative funding mechanisms to ensure federal law enforcement officers are paid. Essential personnel, including FBI and Border Patrol agents, are still required to work without pay, prompting the search for solutions. Military personnel are being paid using previously allocated Pentagon funds, and the administration is also trying to fund the WIC food program. However, these measures are temporary, and a prolonged shutdown continues to raise concerns about widespread layoffs and the impact on vital public services.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is leveraging the ongoing government shutdown to initiate a permanent restructuring of federal agencies, a move unprecedented in modern U.S. history. Rather than a mere negotiation tactic, this shutdown is being used as an audit to cut what Trump deems "bloated, Democrat-run bureaucracies." Layoffs have begun across several departments, and billions in earmarks for blue-state projects have been withheld. Critics argue this is an unconstitutional circumvention of Congress's power, while supporters view it as a necessary cleanup of the "deep-state swamp."</p>

The word's modern media application emerged in the early 1920s with the advent of commercial radio, notably Frank Conrad's broadcast of presidential election results.

          <p>Two hikers were hospitalized in British Columbia after a grizzly bear, accompanied by two cubs, attacked them on the Farm Cabin Trail near Pass Lake. The British Columbia Conservation Officer Service (COS) reported that both individuals are in stable condition and recovering. Following an investigation, the COS determined the bear's actions were defensive, and no action will be taken against the animals. The trail remains closed, and authorities are urging the public to respect the closure and practice bear safety by staying alert, making noise, traveling in groups, and carrying bear spray.</p>

          <p>Several very large crude carriers (VLCCs) have diverted from China's port of Rizhao after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned the facility for handling Iranian crude. The sanctions target the Rizhao Shihua Crude Oil Terminal, which is partly owned by Chinese state major Sinopec and crucial to China's refining industry. While some vessels are rerouting to other Chinese ports, the long-term impact on China's overall oil imports remains uncertain. This move escalates U.S. efforts to curb Iran's energy exports and highlights the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Independent climate advisers have warned the UK government to prepare for at least 2C of global warming by 2050, emphasizing that the country is currently ill-equipped for escalating weather extremes.

Their previous report criticized the UK's slow progress in climate preparations, highlighting the urgency of the situation. The CCC's advice underscores the need for robust strategies to mitigate the impacts of increased heatwaves, droughts, flooding, and extended wildfire seasons.</p>

          <p>A massive fire at a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, has resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people, with officials warning the toll could rise. The blaze, which spread to an adjacent chemical warehouse, was intensified by stored materials like bleaching powder and hydrogen peroxide. Most victims died from inhaling highly toxic gas, exacerbated by a locked roof door. Distraught relatives gathered outside the charred building, seeking missing loved ones. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about lax safety standards and poor infrastructure in Bangladesh's densely populated industrial areas.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent trip to Israel and Egypt cemented his decisive role in brokering the Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. However, this agreement is not seen as a peace process roadmap, with significant work still needed on its detailed implementation, including the demilitarization of Gaza. The ceasefire's fragility is evident, with cracks appearing over the return of deceased hostage bodies and renewed internal clashes by Hamas against rival clans. The article suggests that true peace requires sustained diplomatic effort and painful compromises, which remain elusive despite Trump's declarations.</p>

This decision reinforces accountability for the Infowars host, who was found in default for repeatedly failing to comply with court orders.
