          <p>This BBC article introduces an interactive tool allowing users to compare their local weather forecasts with cities worldwide, challenging the perception of Britain's famously damp climate. It invites users to explore if the sun truly shines brighter elsewhere or if their region is a "green and pleasant land." The tool aims to engage the public with meteorology, offering a fun way to analyze global weather patterns. This initiative highlights public fascination with climate comparisons and local conditions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a disappointing 5-1 walk-off loss to the San Francisco Giants, despite a stellar seven-inning, one-run performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. The Giants, surprisingly surging back into playoff contention, secured the win with a grand slam in the 10th inning. The Dodgers' offense struggled to provide support, failing to capitalize on scoring opportunities throughout the crucial game. This defeat marked a return to inconsistent hitting for the Dodgers after a recent winning streak.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New CCTV footage, exclusively released to the BBC, shows the last recorded sighting of British woman Sarm Heslop before her disappearance from a luxury yacht in the US Virgin Islands in 2021. Her boyfriend, Ryan Bane, reported her missing six hours later, suggesting she fell overboard, but has never been formally questioned by police and invoked constitutional rights to block a yacht search. An inconsistency in the timeline, with a missing hour, has raised further suspicions for investigators. Bane's past domestic violence conviction against an ex-wife adds a troubling layer to the ongoing mystery.</p>

          <p>NATO countries, including Denmark, France, and Germany, are deploying troops and fighter jets to bolster the alliance's eastern flank after 19 Russian drones reportedly violated Polish airspace. This unprecedented incursion, which saw some drones shot down and others crashing, has heightened political tensions across Europe. While Russia denies targeting Poland, European leaders believe the incident was deliberate, leading to strong condemnation at the UN Security Council. The new mission underscores NATO's commitment to defending its territory amidst ongoing conflict in Ukraine and increased Russian assertiveness.</p>

          <p>The far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) is expected to make significant gains in local elections in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, a traditional Social Democrat stronghold. The party's campaign has focused on issues like crime and labor migration, resonating with residents disillusioned by urban decay and social welfare challenges. Social workers express fear that an AfD victory could lead to funding cuts for integration projects and support centers for vulnerable children. Despite the potential for an AfD mayoral candidate to reach a runoff, a final victory is unlikely as other parties would unite against them.</p>

          <p>An analysis highlights Charlie Kirk's significant influence in mobilizing younger voters, particularly young men, which contributed to Donald Trump's 2024 election victory. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, focused on social media outreach and community engagement, persuading an older generation of Republicans to invest in youth voter initiatives. Experts note Kirk's ability to project strength and masculinity resonated with young men, even among those who disagreed with his politics. This strategic outreach helped Trump improve his performance with the under-30 demographic, a group traditionally dominated by Democrats, especially in key swing states.</p>

          <p>Nasser Faratawi, a Palestinian businessman in Tulkarm, West Bank, alleges that Israeli forces occupied his family's home and party shop for three and a half months, using it as a military base, before setting it on fire. He returned to find his property charred, vandalized with graffiti, and expensive items destroyed, estimating losses up to $700,000. The Israeli military stated it was "not aware of any arson" but confirmed a complaint is under review, adding that destruction of civilian property is against IDF values. This incident highlights heightened tensions and military operations in the West Bank since October 2023.</p>

          <p>New analysis by Policy in Practice reveals that seven million households in England, Scotland, and Wales are missing out on an estimated £24 billion in unclaimed benefits and social tariffs. The primary barriers to claiming this financial help are identified as lack of awareness, the complexity of application processes, and the stigma associated with receiving welfare. While progress is noted in some areas, such as increased pension credit claims, the report emphasizes that simplifying the system and promoting awareness are crucial. The government states it runs public campaigns and offers a "Help to Claim" service.</p>

          <p>Two devastating boat accidents in the Democratic Republic of Congo this week have resulted in at least 193 deaths and scores missing. One vessel, carrying nearly 500 passengers, capsized after catching fire on the Congo River, with 146 people still unaccounted for. A separate incident saw a motorized boat capsize, killing 86, mostly students. These frequent accidents are attributed to old, overloaded, and poorly maintained vessels, coupled with night navigation despite prohibitions. Limited resources and remote locations further hinder rescue efforts, highlighting a persistent and tragic issue in the region's transport.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, grew up in a close-knit, religious community in Utah, described as quiet and bright by neighbors. His family, registered Republicans, were instrumental in his surrender after he confessed to them. While having no prior criminal record, Robinson reportedly became more political recently, expressing dislike for Kirk. Investigators are examining bullet casing inscriptions, which include anti-fascist lyrics and online memes, suggesting a complex, potentially nihilistic motive rather than a clear political affiliation. Experts caution against premature conclusions on his ideology.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, 22, has been arrested in connection with the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, after a 33-hour manhunt concluded with his father persuading him to surrender. Robinson confessed to his father, stating he preferred suicide over capture. Surveillance footage placed him at Utah Valley University hours before the shooting. Investigators recovered a rifle with inscribed bullet casings, including "hey fascist! CATCH!" and lyrics from an Italian anti-fascist song. Utah Governor Spencer Cox emphasized Robinson's increased political engagement and dislike for Kirk, while stressing that one person is responsible for the act.</p>

          <p>The aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination exposed a troubling online landscape, where an information vacuum was quickly filled with "rage bait, conspiracy theorizing, doomerism, and vitriol." This article analyzes how social media algorithms amplify extreme narratives, with initial blame often cast before facts emerge. It highlights the "nihilistic hubris" of some online communities, where violence is seen as a form of "trolling," and perpetrators seek an audience for their acts. The piece argues that gun violence, political polarization, and digital platforms combine to create an environment where meaningful discourse is stifled.</p>
