          <h2>Speculation Mounts Over Nick Saban's Potential Return to Coaching</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 19:13:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rumors surrounding legendary coach Nick Saban's return to football intensified during SEC Media Days, fueled by comments from prominent figures in the sport. Former Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy shared that an 'in-the-know' source believes Saban is not finished with coaching. Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin and LSU's Brian Kelly also publicly stated they think Saban will eventually return to the sidelines. Saban, who retired citing the challenges of the new NIL and transfer portal era, has not commented on the speculation.</p>

          <p>Veteran center Brook Lopez, a Southern California native, has signed a two-year, $18 million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, citing the team's winning culture and talent. Lopez expressed excitement about playing alongside stars like Kawhi Leonard and reuniting with former teammate Ivica Zubac. He suggested that despite both being centers, he and Zubac could effectively play together, with his floor-spacing ability complementing Zubac's interior dominance. Lopez is prepared to accept a role coming off the bench to help the team pursue a championship.</p>

          <p>Australia defeated the West Indies by 176 runs to complete a series sweep after bowling them out for just 27, the second-lowest total in Test cricket history. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was instrumental, taking a remarkable 6 wickets for 9 runs, including the fastest five-wicket haul in Test history. This performance also saw Starc surpass 400 career Test wickets. The catastrophic batting display from the West Indies came as they were chasing a seemingly achievable target of 204 for victory.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Whitney Hermandorfer as a judge for the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, marking the first judicial confirmation of President Trump's second term. The vote proceeded along party lines, 46-42. Hermandorfer, who previously worked for Tennessee's attorney general, faced criticism from Democrats for her defense of controversial Trump policies and her limited courtroom experience. With 49 federal judicial vacancies, the administration is expected to continue its focus on reshaping the judiciary, though with fewer open seats than in the first term.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball's annual Home Run Derby is proceeding without its two biggest stars, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, prompting questions about the event's relevance. Ohtani cited the physical toll of the contest, based on his 2021 experience, while Judge stated he would only participate if it were held in New York. The article argues that the league should be more flexible with the rules to accommodate its superstars, suggesting Ohtani's ideas for format changes could be a solution. Their participation would significantly boost viewership and elevate the profiles of other players in the event.</p>

The government has issued new guidance for officials, stating that a breakdown in law and order does not inherently justify an asylum claim, and each case will be assessed individually. The decision affects over 7,000 Syrians who were left in limbo.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has fired Joseph Tirrell, the Justice Department's chief ethics adviser since 2023. Tirrell, who oversaw a team ensuring the department's ethical guidelines were followed, revealed his termination on LinkedIn, sharing a letter that did not provide a reason for the dismissal. This move is the latest in a series of firings of career civil servants within the agency. It comes as the Trump administration takes steps to investigate what it terms the 'weaponization' of officials who previously investigated the president.</p>

          <p>A farmer in Jones, Oklahoma, was fatally attacked by a pair of water buffalo he had recently purchased at a livestock auction. The victim, Bradley McMichael, suffered deep lacerations in the attack. According to police, the animals were so aggressive that they initially prevented first responders from reaching McMichael. Both water buffalo were subsequently euthanized. His former wife described McMichael as an experienced cattle handler and farmer, for whom caring for livestock was his lifelong passion.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to defend Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files appears to have backfired, fueling further outrage among his base. In a social media post, Trump urged his supporters to stop attacking Bondi, but the post was 'ratioed,' indicating widespread disapproval. Prominent conservative voices like Laura Loomer and Megyn Kelly have continued their criticism, warning the issue could harm the GOP in the midterms. The controversy stems from a Justice Department announcement that no 'client list' was found and no further charges are expected.</p>

The incident occurred when a Model S using Autopilot struck a parked vehicle, killing 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs allege that design defects in the Autopilot system failed to detect the obstacle. Tesla argues the crash was caused by a distracted driver who was speeding and had overridden the car's system, and that no technology could have prevented the accident.</p>

          <p>This article critiques President Trump's recent social media post considering the revocation of comedian Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship as a dangerous attack on the First Amendment. The author argues that despite the low probability of such an action being successful, the threat itself normalizes the idea that the president can punish citizens for political speech. This is presented as part of a broader pattern of behavior from the administration, which includes pressuring news organizations and targeting political opponents. The piece concludes that Trump's actions contradict his own past rhetoric about defending free speech.</p>

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has defended the project, stating that many sensational claims are exaggerated and that he has asked the Fed's inspector general to review the costs.
