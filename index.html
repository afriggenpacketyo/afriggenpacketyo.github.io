        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index experienced a significant increase in May, rising to 98.0, a 12.3-point jump from April. This surge in optimism is largely attributed to positive developments in U.S.-China trade relations, particularly President Trump's decision to halt the most severe tariffs on May 12. The rebound in consumer sentiment follows five consecutive months of declines amid intensifying trade tensions. The strongest improvements came from Republicans, and other sentiment indicators also increased, including expectations for the labor market and stock market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

In an interview, Emanuel argued that the party needs to return to basics and focus on fighting for America rather than getting caught up in unpopular cultural debates. He emphasized the need for U.S. education to prioritize high standards over social doctrine. Several other Democrats, including Governors Tim Walz and Andy Beshear, and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have also been mentioned as potential 2028 candidates.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is attempting to revitalize its shipbuilding industry to compete with China, the world's largest ship producer, with President Trump issuing an executive order and Congress considering subsidies. However, U.S. shipbuilding costs nearly five times as much and takes significantly longer than in Asia. Hanwha, a South Korean conglomerate, acquired a Philadelphia shipyard and aims to improve efficiency through automation, but faces challenges in securing orders and finding skilled workers. Critics argue that previous government efforts have largely failed and that subsidies would perpetuate high costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Doxo's 2025 Cost of Bills Index analyzes comparative household costs across the United States, focusing on 13 essential bill categories. The index uses 100 to represent the national average, with states ranked above or below this number based on their median costs. The average U.S. household spends $24,695 annually on these bills, with the median mortgage at $1,775 and rent at $1,453. Founder Steve Shivers notes that changing economic conditions, particularly rising interest rates, have significantly impacted the cost of mobility and consumer debt.</p>

The scenarios include gold prices stabilizing, dropping, or rebounding, depending on factors such as Federal Reserve policy, geopolitical conditions, and trade negotiations. A rate hike by the Federal Reserve or resolution of trade wars could cause prices to drop, while weaker economic data or increased geopolitical risk could cause prices to rebound.

          <p>NPR has filed a lawsuit against President Trump and administration officials, challenging an executive order aimed at cutting federal funding to the news organization and PBS. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., argues that the executive order violates the First Amendment and the Public Broadcasting Act. NPR claims that the order is retaliatory and discriminates based on viewpoint.

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on films produced in foreign lands has ignited debate about the state of Hollywood. While some claim the industry is declining due to incentives to shoot in foreign locations, others argue that the industry is still dominant globally, despite a slight trade deficit.
