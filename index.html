          <p>According to law professor Angela Zhang, U.S. tariffs are pushing China to innovate in technology by cutting costs and scaling up, as seen with open-sourcing AI models in response to chip embargos. Zhang anticipates similar strategies in electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable energy. Chinese companies are also expected to aggressively target markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and deepen trade with Europe, potentially offering technology transfers for market access. Despite uncertainties, Zhang asserts that Chinese firms will face significant challenges under the current U.S. administration.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating an incident at Boulder's Pearl Street Mall in Colorado as a "targeted terror attack" after multiple people were injured. Witnesses reported that a suspect attacked people with Molotov cocktails during a walk organized to remember Israeli hostages in Gaza. The FBI is involved, and police evacuated several blocks around the area. Colorado Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack as a "heinous act of terror," emphasizing that hate-filled acts are unacceptable, as the state collaborates with local and federal law enforcement to support the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Exit polls from the Polish presidential election suggest a very tight race between Warsaw's liberal Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki. Early polls initially indicated Trzaskowski winning, but later polls showed Nawrocki in the lead; the official result is expected to be published on Monday morning. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but differ on EU approaches. Trzaskowski supports Poland's integration into the European mainstream, while Nawrocki favors a strong sovereign Poland with reservations about further EU powers.</p>

          <p>The UK government will announce a major defense review, including plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines to replace the current fleet from the late 2030s.

The review aims to move the armed forces to "warfighting readiness" and will include commitments to munitions production, long-range weapons, cyber capabilities, and military housing repairs. Building the new submarines is expected to support 30,000 jobs into the 2030s, along with apprenticeships and graduate roles.</p>

          <p>According to exit polls, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, is projected to narrowly win Poland’s presidential election, dealing a blow to populist movements in Europe backed by Donald Trump. Trzaskowski campaigned on completing democratic reforms aimed at repairing an erosion of checks and balances under the previous nationalist government. The election outcome is closely watched in neighboring Ukraine, Russia, the US, and the EU, as the president can veto legislation. While both candidates agree on defense spending and supporting Ukraine, they differ on Ukraine's NATO membership.</p>
