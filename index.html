          <p>The largest rail workers' union in the U.S., SMART-TD, has announced its formal opposition to the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The union cites significant concerns regarding Union Pacific's safety record, which it claims is the worst in the industry, and alleges a corporate culture of harassment and retaliation against employees. SMART-TD intends to present its case to the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that must approve the deal. The merger would create the nation's first coast-to-coast freight rail network, but unions fear it could compromise worker safety and service quality.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has declared it will recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September unless Israel meets several key conditions. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated these conditions include establishing a ceasefire in Gaza, halting any annexation of West Bank territory, and committing to a two-state peace process. This diplomatic shift, which follows a similar announcement by France, aims to preserve the possibility of a lasting peace. Israeli officials criticized the move, asserting that it rewards Hamas and undermines efforts to secure the release of hostages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments in a case that challenges President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs without explicit congressional approval. The lawsuit, brought by small businesses and twelve states, contends that the president exceeded his legal power by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the import taxes. A lower court previously ruled against the administration, but that decision was stayed on appeal. The outcome of this case could significantly curtail the executive branch's power to unilaterally set trade policy.</p>

          <p>The median price for an existing home in the United States hit a new record of $435,300 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors. This increase comes despite home sales falling to their lowest sustained levels in over a decade, driven by high mortgage rates and a reluctance among current homeowners to sell. Experts attribute the rising prices to a persistent undersupply of housing and continued demand from affluent buyers. The combination of record prices and mortgage rates above 6.5% continues to challenge affordability for many prospective homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>

However, a judge dismissed their request for a summary judgment, ruling that the complex dispute over the historic rights of seat holders requires a full trial. The case highlights the unique ownership structure of the iconic venue, where some seats have been privately owned since its construction in 1871.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 state attorneys general has filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration from collecting personal data of recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The states argue the demand is an overreach and fear the information, including immigration status and addresses, will be used for mass deportations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) claims the data is needed to combat fraud, but critics point to the administration's history of using similar justifications to obtain data for immigration enforcement. The states are seeking an injunction, arguing the data transfer would violate privacy laws.</p>

          <p>Actor Paul Wesley, who plays a younger version of James T. Kirk in "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds," has spoken about his approach to the iconic role. Wesley said he made a conscious choice not to imitate William Shatner's original portrayal, instead opting to develop his own interpretation of the character before he became captain of the USS Enterprise. He mentioned that he received Shatner's blessing for the role, who told him to take care of his ship and crew. Wesley described the show as optimistic and inclusive, calling it an "escapist playground" for viewers.</p>

Trump also used the visit to criticize high taxes on North Sea oil and gas. The president described his discussions with Swinney as positive before returning to Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific basis that legally compels the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the move as a major deregulatory action intended to save Americans over a trillion dollars by lifting restrictions on vehicles and industries. The original finding, which has survived previous legal challenges, has been the foundation for major climate policies, including vehicle emissions standards. Environmental groups have vowed to challenge the reversal in court, calling it a dangerous rejection of established science.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's job approval rating among young Americans (ages 18-29) has fallen from 55% after his inauguration to 28% six months into his second term, a much steeper drop than in any other age group. A CBS News analysis suggests this decline is most pronounced among less partisan and politically unengaged young people. Factors contributing to the souring sentiment include a perception that the president is not fulfilling campaign promises and growing dissatisfaction with the economy. Majorities of young people now feel his policies are making them financially worse off and that he is focusing on the wrong priorities.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs, which is seeking to exit the partnership. If finalized, the deal would transfer Apple's massive credit card business to the nation's largest card issuer, further solidifying JPMorgan's dominance in the sector. For Goldman Sachs, offloading the venture would mark the end of a challenging foray into consumer credit that faced high growth costs and regulatory scrutiny. The move would provide Apple with a more experienced and stable partner for its signature financial product. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crews aboard NATO's E-3 Sentry surveillance aircraft, which have been monitoring the war in Ukraine since 2022, have observed a significant change in Russia's air tactics. In the early stages of the invasion, Russian jets frequently flew bombing runs deep into Ukrainian territory. However, as both sides fortified their air defenses, the air war has shifted to long-range standoff strikes with missiles and drones, with aircraft rarely crossing into contested airspace. This evolution reflects a battlefield defined by mutual denial of air dominance rather than control of the skies by either side.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a law that permits citizens over the age of 60 to voluntarily enlist for military service during wartime. The measure aims to expand the recruitment pool as Ukraine faces ongoing manpower shortages in its war against Russia. Under the new law, older volunteers who pass a medical exam can sign one-year contracts to serve, with a two-month trial period. This change will enable experienced older citizens to contribute to the war effort, potentially in non-combat or specialized roles, for the duration of martial law.</p>
