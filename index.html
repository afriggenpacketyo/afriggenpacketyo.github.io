            <p>Japan's Prime Minister has committed to reviewing non-tariff barriers affecting automotive trade with the United States during upcoming discussions. This announcement signals a potential shift in trade relations between the two countries, as the U.S. has long sought greater access to the Japanese auto market. The review aims to address concerns about fairness and reciprocity in trade, potentially leading to reduced barriers and increased opportunities for U.S. auto manufacturers.

Opponents call the surcharges an industry bailout, and the lawsuit seeks to address what they claim is cartel-like behavior. (not investment advice)</p>
