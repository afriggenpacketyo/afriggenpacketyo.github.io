        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent "No Kings" protests in Washington, D.C., and across the country, aimed at denouncing President Trump's perceived authoritarianism, were predominantly attended by educated White women in their 40s, according to American University researchers. Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert described these rallies as a form of "group therapy," where participants seek belonging and validation, often projecting personal anxieties onto political figures. While offering emotional catharsis and a sense of community, Alpert suggests this doesn't necessarily lead to substantive political change. The use of inflatable costumes, a tactic originating from earlier protests in Portland, Oregon, is noted as a way to draw attention non-violently. This article highlights the psychological underpinnings and demographic composition of these unique protest movements.</p>

          <p>Catherine Connolly has been elected the 10th President of Ireland, securing a landslide victory with 63% of first preference votes, the largest amount in Irish presidential election history. An independent candidate backed by major left-wing parties, Connolly pledged to be an inclusive president, focusing on peace, neutrality, climate change, and recognizing community work. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two terms, and is set to be inaugurated on November 11. This outcome represents a significant win for anti-establishment politics, garnering a clear mandate from the people and uniting opposition parties.</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, heir to a Gilded Age banking family and a significant Trump donor, has been identified as the individual who contributed $130 million to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown. This donation, announced by President Trump, amounts to approximately $100 per service member, falling far short of the nearly $6.4 billion required bi-weekly. Experts suggest the use of private funds for federal agency operations could violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending funds not appropriated by Congress. Senator Chris Coons raised concerns about anonymous donors funding government spending, fearing potential risks of foreign powers influencing the military.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins football team experienced a significant setback, losing 56-6 to No. 2 Indiana, a performance reminiscent of their early-season struggles. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava faced immediate pressure, leading to a sack and an interception returned for a touchdown on the first two plays, setting a bleak tone for the game. The team was plagued by missed tackles, repeated penalties, and an ineffective run game, failing to generate meaningful offense throughout the afternoon. This drubbing comes after a brief three-game winning streak, leaving the Bruins at 3-5 overall and highlighting a major regression in their performance.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's support among Hispanic adults has sharply declined since the start of his second term, with only 25% now holding a favorable view, down from 44% in March, according to an AP-NORC poll. This significant shift indicates growing unease within a demographic crucial to his 2024 re-election, as nearly half of Hispanic voters backed him. Hispanic adults also expressed less confidence in his handling of the economy and immigration, with a rising majority believing the nation is headed in the wrong direction. The decline is attributed to hardline immigration enforcement and increasing financial strain within Hispanic households.</p>

          <p>One year after the historic removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, ecological restoration is rapidly progressing, inspiring similar efforts worldwide. Threatened coho salmon and Chinook salmon have returned to upstream habitats for the first time in decades, and diverse wildlife and vegetation are flourishing. A group of Indigenous youth, who were the first to kayak the entire river post-removal, are now advocating globally against dams. This project serves as a powerful testament to collective action and the possibility of significant environmental recovery, offering a hopeful model for other river systems.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which proposes amending the state constitution to suspend the independent redistricting commission and create five additional safe Democratic congressional seats, is gaining traction by leveraging anti-Donald Trump sentiment. Democrats are framing the measure as a response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in other states, particularly Texas. Despite mixed feelings about abandoning non-partisan maps, polls suggest a strong "yes" vote, with many voters motivated by a desire to oppose Trump. This strategy aims to counteract Republican advantages in congressional races nationwide.</p>

          <p>A four-year study in Southern California found that nearly one in five urinary tract infections (UTIs) were linked to E. coli strains originating from contaminated meat, particularly turkey and chicken. Researchers used genomic attribution to trace the bacteria, noting higher contamination rates in lower-income areas and "value packs." This finding reframes contaminated meat as a significant public health concern beyond food safety nuisances.
