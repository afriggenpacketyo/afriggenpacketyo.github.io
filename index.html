          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, severely emaciated, has died in a hospital in Pisa, Italy, less than 48 hours after being evacuated for medical treatment. Her death underscores the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and an impending famine. The woman was brought to Italy as part of a government program that has evacuated over 180 Palestinians for care. This incident highlights the dire health conditions in the region, where the local healthcare system has been decimated by the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>West Virginia is sending 300 to 400 National Guard members to Washington D.C. as part of the Trump administration's initiative to overhaul policing in the capital. This move follows an executive order federalizing local police forces to address what the administration calls a crisis of crime and homelessness. The deployment has sparked protests and criticism from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who described the federal intervention as a significant test for the city's limited self-governance and a potential military occupation.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market surged from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, largely driven by the growing popularity and innovation of its foldable phones. While Apple still leads with a 49% market share, its recent decline points to renewed competition centered on screen technology and form factors. Analysts note that Samsung's wider range of price points and experimental designs, like the Z Fold 7, are challenging Apple's dominance, with Apple expected to release its own foldable phone in the coming years.

          <p>This opinion article argues that key environmental laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act are under threat from the Trump administration, despite their past successes. The author refutes the idea that recovering populations of some species, like elephant seals, justify weakening regulations. Citing the struggles of North Atlantic right whales and the recent crash in gray whale numbers due to climate change, the piece contends that stronger protections are more critical than ever to preserve marine ecosystems and, ultimately, ourselves.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has forced an end to a strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants, ordering both the airline and the union into binding arbitration less than 12 hours after the work stoppage began. The strike, which had already begun to ground flights and strand thousands of travelers, was over disputes on pay and unpaid work. The government cited economic risks for its intervention, while the union accused officials of violating their constitutional right to strike and rewarding the airline's refusal to negotiate fairly.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last surviving British recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has died at the age of 105. He was awarded the nation's highest honor for valor for his actions in 1944, when as a flight lieutenant he attacked and sank a German U-boat despite sustaining 72 separate injuries. After the war, he worked in banking and was known for his humility, rarely speaking of his wartime heroism and considering his actions simply a matter of duty.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United fans are voicing their anger toward star striker Alexander Isak, who is seeking a transfer to Liverpool and has not played for the club since May. During the team's season-opening draw, supporters unveiled new chants calling the player "greedy," marking a significant souring of his relationship with the fanbase. The situation has created a major challenge for the club, as Isak was a key player in their recent success, and finding a suitable replacement has proven difficult.</p>

          <p>In the southern Syrian city of Sweida, hundreds from the Druze minority community held demonstrations demanding self-determination. The protests were sparked by deadly sectarian clashes in July with Bedouin Sunni tribes, during which Druze groups accused the Syrian government of siding with their opponents and committing atrocities. Reflecting a complex regional dynamic, some protesters waved Israeli flags to thank Israel for its military intervention during the July violence, which it stated was to protect the Druze.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued new guidance that will intensify the scrutiny of the "good moral character" requirement for immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers are now instructed to conduct a "holistic assessment" that looks beyond the standard criminal disqualifications. This includes considering minor offenses like traffic infractions and other acts deemed "inconsistent with civic responsibility," a move critics say is designed to arbitrarily increase denials and deter applicants.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, an architect is tackling the affordable housing crisis by converting old shipping containers into shelters for the unhoused. The project, called "X-WING," uses four containers to create units with five individual, air-conditioned rooms each, all powered by solar panels. This innovative and environmentally friendly approach allows for rapid construction—taking only a week per unit—and provides safe, private spaces that help residents stabilize their lives and find a path out of homelessness.</p>
