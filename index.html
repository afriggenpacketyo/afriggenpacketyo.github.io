          <p>Wisconsin's Attorney General appealed to the state Supreme Court to prevent Elon Musk from donating $1 million to two individuals at a political rally, arguing it violates state election laws.  Musk, a supporter of the Republican candidate, maintains the donations are to spokespeople for a petition against activist judges. This highlights the increasing influence of big money in state-level elections and the potential for legal challenges to such donations; the Fox News source may exhibit a slight right-leaning bias in its reporting.</p>

          <p>Advertising giant WPP removed references to "diversity, equity, and inclusion" from its annual report, following similar moves by other U.S. companies in response to the Trump administration's policies.  The change reflects the increasingly contentious political environment surrounding DEI initiatives. The Guardian's reporting appears relatively neutral, but the framing might subtly highlight the impact of political pressure on corporate practices.</p>
