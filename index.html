          <p>Despite government initiatives to revive American manufacturing, companies are struggling to fill nearly half a million open jobs. Factors contributing to this shortfall include a tight labor market, a need for specific skills (including college degrees for many positions), and an aging workforce expecting retirements. The Biden administration's $2 trillion investment aims to construct new factories, further increasing demand for manufacturing workers. Solutions involve higher pay, better apprenticeship programs, and improved public perception of manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>The Chinese navy has successfully integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into an exercise for warship degaussing, resulting in a 60% increase in efficiency. This enhancement potentially boosts the stealth capacity and survivability of Chinaâ€™s submarine fleet. The AI-assisted decision-making system was deployed during a combat-readiness exercise at a PLA Northern Theatre Command naval base. The exercise simulated realistic conditions, using acoustic and electromagnetic modeling to test the process.</p>
