            <h2>GOP Aims to Make Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts Permanent Amidst Democratic Opposition</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-19 02:42:24 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Congressional Republicans are pushing to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, arguing that allowing them to expire would dramatically increase taxes on vulnerable populations and potentially trigger a recession. The non-partisan Tax Foundation estimates that a married couple with two children earning $165,000 could face an additional $2,400 in taxes if the cuts are not renewed. Democrats, however, criticize the cuts as disproportionately benefiting the wealthy, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling them a "disgrace." Some Republicans are exploring raising rates on the wealthy or corporations to offset the cost, though top GOP leaders have dismissed the idea. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary halt to the deportation of Venezuelan nationals held in a detention center in North Texas. This order comes in response to an emergency appeal from the ACLU, which argued that the Trump administration was attempting to deport these individuals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 without due process. The court's decision directs the administration to cease removals pending further review, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. The ACLU expressed relief, emphasizing the imminent danger these individuals faced, potentially spending their lives in a Salvadoran prison without proper legal recourse.</p>

            <p>Economists are raising concerns that President Trump's escalating trade war and imposition of tariffs could lead to corporate profiteering, as companies use tariffs as an excuse to raise prices beyond the actual cost increases. Senator Elizabeth Warren has warned that corporations may use the tariffs as a "new set of excuses to price-gouge American consumers." A study of Trump's previous tariffs on washing machines found that prices of domestic machines also rose, indicating that manufacturers may follow the crowd and raise prices across the board. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that US consumers could face an overall average effective tariff rate of 28%, potentially leading to a 3% rise in consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>BBC Verify has investigated the allegations against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man deported to El Salvador, to determine the validity of claims that he is a member of MS-13. While police reports suggest he was identified as a gang member based on clothing and a confidential source, his lawyers argue that he has never been convicted of any crime and has a protective order based on fear of persecution by a rival gang. The case has raised questions about the evidence used to justify his deportation.</p>

            <p>President Trump has stated that the U.S. will "take a pass" on brokering further peace talks between Russia and Ukraine if no progress is made soon. This announcement follows a warning from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who indicated that the U.S. would abandon talks unless there were clear signs of progress within days. Trump's direct diplomacy with Putin and criticism of Zelensky have raised concerns among NATO allies. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Ukraine are moving forward with a minerals deal aimed at supporting Ukraine's reconstruction.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has pardoned Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation, as part of a series of Easter clemency actions. Bin, a former gang member, was sentenced in 2008 for shooting at a home, but has since rehabilitated himself in prison and became a minister. Newsom's pardon reflects his criticism of the Trump administration's immigration policies and his efforts to use clemency to help immigrants targeted for deportation.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around deportation flights. The court order provides a deadline for petitioners to reply to the government and a deadline for the government to file their own reply. The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely watching the US bond market due to concerns about the impact of President Trump's trade tariffs on the economy. A recent rise in bond yields, while bond prices fell, suggests investors are losing confidence in the US economy. This volatility could affect public spending, household finances, and business lending rates. Trump's decision to pause higher tariffs on most countries except China reflects the pressure from potential economic fallout. (not investment advice)</p>
