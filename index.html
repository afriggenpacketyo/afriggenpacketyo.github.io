          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks saw their stocks increase after announcing a A$14 billion merger. The new Sydney-listed company will acquire all outstanding shares of both entities, creating a combined entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow stated that the merger simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company. This deal unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership intended to prevent hostile takeovers, which critics argued suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico held its first judicial elections, becoming the only nation in the world to select judges and magistrates by popular vote. Supporters believe this will overhaul the judicial system, which is known for corruption and inefficiency, while critics argue it will politicize the judiciary. Voters were tasked with electing around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates. Turnout appeared to be low, with many voters struggling to choose from hundreds of largely unknown candidates, with some expressing concerns about a lack of information or feeling pressured to vote.</p>

The MLS Players Association (MLSPA) expressed solidarity with the players, stating that the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of the prize money to the players. FIFA will pay MLS teams large amounts to participate, but the current collective bargaining agreement limits players to earning 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team.

          <p>María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, expressed concerns that Nicolás Maduro's regime may unleash a new wave of repression following the U.S. decision to restrict Chevron's operations in the country. Machado, who is in hiding, believes Maduro's government is increasingly isolated internationally and faces an unsustainable economic crisis. She views the partial revocation of the U.S. government's license to Chevron as a positive step. Machado also stated that the recent legislative elections were a monumental defeat for Maduro due to low voter turnout.</p>

Universities UK found that universities were reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it wanted to support collaboration where possible. The government is conducting a review of higher education funding, and university budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and rising costs.

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs, following widespread displacement of families. The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. There are currently over 164,000 homeless children living in temporary accommodation across England, and families are being displaced due to a lack of permanent affordable housing. The government says it is investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to help families in temporary accommodation.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation for owners, sparking controversy. The law aims to increase black ownership of land, but critics argue it threatens property rights. The government says compensation will be paid in most cases, and expropriation without compensation will occur only in rare circumstances, such as when land is unused or held for speculative purposes. The law has drawn criticism from the U.S. President Donald Trump, and center-right political parties in South Africa.</p>

Veterans advocates view the move as part of a pattern of censorship by the Trump administration.
