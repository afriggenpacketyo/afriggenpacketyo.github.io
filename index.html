          <h2>Trump Urges Fed to Lower Rates Following Positive Jobs Report</h2>

          <p>President Trump has once again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates after a better-than-expected April jobs report. Trump expressed his desire for lower rates to stimulate economic growth and lower consumer prices, asserting that there is no inflation to warrant keeping rates high. Despite his past criticisms of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump has recently softened his stance, although he maintains that he knows more about interest rates than Powell. The jobs report indicated a seasonally adjusted increase of 177,000 nonfarm payrolls in April, surpassing estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his legal challenge against the UK government's decision to downgrade his security after he and Meghan stepped back from royal duties and moved to the US. Harry argued that the reduced security levels endangered him and his family during visits to the UK. The court upheld the government's decision, stating that there was nothing unlawful in how it was reached. While Harry is still eligible for police protection in the UK, it is not automatic and requires advance notice of visits, a system that Harry's legal team argued was insufficient.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April, exceeding expectations despite concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%.

          <p>President Trump is proposing $163 billion in cuts to non-defense discretionary spending for the 2026 fiscal year, representing a 22.6% reduction in projected spending. These cuts target spending Congress authorizes each year and exclude safety nets like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The proposal is outlined in a "skinny budget," a summary of budget proposals often released early in a president's term.</p>

          <p>Germany's Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party has been designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution.

AfD leaders have criticized the decision as politically motivated. The intelligence agency had already placed the AfD under observation for suspected extremism and classified it as right-wing extremist in three states.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will rescind Harvard University's tax-exempt status. The move follows the freezing of $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts after Harvard rejected demands to discontinue its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The decision is likely to prompt further legal action. A Harvard spokesperson stated that there is no legal basis for revoking the tax-exempt status, which supports the university's educational mission.</p>
