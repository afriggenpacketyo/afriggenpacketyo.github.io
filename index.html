          <p>Intense search and rescue operations are underway in central Texas for over 160 missing people following flash floods that have claimed more than 100 lives. New before-and-after satellite images vividly illustrate the devastation along the Guadalupe River, showing extensive debris and damaged homes. Governor Greg Abbott has affirmed that search efforts, bolstered by volunteer teams from across the U.S. and Mexico, will persist until all missing individuals are accounted for. The imagery provides a stark perspective on the scale of the natural disaster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent regional conflicts involving Israel and the United States, analysts predict China may strengthen its support for Iran to safeguard its strategic interests in the Middle East. This move, however, requires a delicate balancing act for Beijing to avoid damaging its relationships with Arab nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The international community is closely observing how the shifting geopolitics will impact regional stability, especially amid concerns over Iran's internal political situation. The assessment highlights the complex diplomatic landscape China navigates in the region.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 04:56:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's postal regulator, Ofcom, has approved Royal Mail's plan to stop delivering second-class letters on Saturdays and move to an every-other-weekday schedule to cut costs. This reform comes as the volume of sent letters continues to decline annually, making the universal six-day service financially unsustainable. While Royal Mail welcomed the change, which also includes relaxed delivery targets, the decision has drawn criticism from consumer groups and MPs who fear a decline in service reliability. First-class mail will continue to be delivered six days a week.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with African leaders, former U.S. President Donald Trump complimented Liberian President Joseph Boakai on his command of English, asking where he was educated. President Boakai confirmed he learned the language in Liberia, where it has been the official language since the country's founding in the 19th century for freed Black Americans. The exchange drew attention due to the historical context of Liberia and past criticisms of Trump's remarks regarding African nations. English is widely spoken in Liberia alongside multiple Indigenous languages.</p>

They proposed that combat robots should be programmed to obey, respect, and protect humans in accordance with the laws of war.

          <p>The Trump administration has issued sanctions against Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza, for her work investigating human rights abuses in the Palestinian territories. The State Department's action follows a U.S. campaign to have her removed from her post due to her vocal criticism of Israel's actions, which she has described as genocide. The sanctions represent a significant escalation in the U.S. effort to punish critics of Israel's war in Gaza and have been condemned by human rights groups as an attempt to silence a UN expert.</p>

          <p>An infant has died in Bakersfield, California, after being left in a car with his 2-year-old brother on a day with 101-degree heat. The mother, Maya Hernandez, allegedly left the children in the vehicle for about 90 minutes while she received a lip filler procedure at a medical spa. Police reports indicate the car's engine, which was left running for air conditioning, automatically shut off after an hour. The mother has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and murder, and the surviving 2-year-old has been placed in protective custody.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector, Choi Min-kyung, is preparing to file an unprecedented lawsuit in Seoul against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other officials for abuse she suffered while detained. After fleeing to China, she was forcibly repatriated in 2008 and says she was tortured and sexually abused before escaping again in 2012. Aided by a human rights group, this will be the first time a North Korean-born defector has taken direct legal action against the regime. While largely symbolic, advocates say such cases provide crucial acknowledgment for victims.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness found that some of the world's poorest countries, including Somalia, Haiti, and Yemen, are paying millions to lobbying firms with ties to Donald Trump. This spending comes as these nations face severe cuts in U.S. foreign aid, forcing them to seek influence in Washington to offset the losses. The report reveals that many countries are bartering access to crucial natural resources, like minerals, in exchange for humanitarian or military support. The dynamic raises concerns about the potential for exploitative deals that are unfavorable to these vulnerable nations.</p>

          <p>The UK's political dynamics are shifting as Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and cabinet minister, has defected to Reform UK. This follows several other former Tory MPs joining Nigel Farage's party, indicating a growing trend of conservative figures moving to the right. The article suggests that Reform UK is gaining significant momentum, forcing the ruling Labour party to adjust its strategy and focus more on this rising insurgency. The defection is seen as a significant blow to the Conservatives and a sign of the political weather changing.</p>

          <p>Poland has reinstated spot checks at its border with Germany, mirroring a German policy and creating significant difficulties for residents in the integrated border cities of Slubice and Frankfurt an der Oder. The move is a response to Germany's toughened migration policies, but locals report that it disrupts daily life, commerce, and cross-border commuting. While officials cite migration control, residents express frustration over the political maneuvering that impacts their intertwined communities. The situation highlights the growing strain on the Schengen Agreement's principle of borderless travel within the EU.</p>

The police force has promised a review of its processes, as questions arise about why these online activities were not used to track him down.

          <p>To combat persistent labor market pressures, the Chinese government has introduced a one-time subsidy for companies that hire unemployed young people aged 16 to 24. Employers who sign formal contracts and make social insurance contributions can receive up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) per new hire. This measure, effective until the end of the year, is part of a broader effort to stabilize employment amid sluggish economic growth and intense domestic competition. Additionally, China's top economic planner has allocated more funds to its "work-for-relief" public works program to generate more jobs. (not investment advice)</p>
