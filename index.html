          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, has secured $2 million to develop Bloom Money, a fintech app tailored for immigrant communities in the U.K. The app supports collaborative saving methods, such as "money circles," addressing the lack of understanding from mainstream banks regarding immigrant financial practices. Bloom Money aims to provide a regulated digital platform for these traditional savings methods, which often face issues like lack of regulation and suspicion from mainstream banks. The app allows users to create savings circles, invite participants, and manage funds collectively, reducing the risk of fraud and promoting financial inclusion for immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in under two weeks, resulting in significant flight delays and cancellations. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed that a backup air traffic control system briefly failed, necessitating a 45-minute ground stop to restore functionality. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to reduce the number of flights in the coming weeks to address the ongoing issues. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer emphasized the need for the FAA to prioritize resolving the problems at Newark to prevent similar incidents nationwide, as passengers express their frustration with the airport's reliability.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley from Missouri argues against proposed Medicaid cuts in the upcoming Republican bill, emphasizing the program's importance to working-class Americans. Hawley points out that Medicaid serves over 70 million Americans, including many in his state, and that Missouri voters mandated Medicaid expansion in 2020. He contends that cutting Medicaid would harm working families, lead to hospital closures, and contradict President Trump's promise to protect social insurance programs. Hawley urges Republicans to focus on policies that support working families, such as capping prescription drug costs and providing tax cuts, rather than eliminating healthcare.</p>

Research on these chemicals is often narrow, focusing on immediate health effects rather than long-term risks or interactions between multiple additives. The article emphasizes the need for regulators to re-examine existing chemicals and adopt a more cautious approach to ensure food safety.</p>

Trump's threats to revoke the tax-exempt status of universities and the IRS's data-sharing agreement with immigration officials raise concerns about political targeting. Congress enacted laws after Watergate to safeguard the IRS from White House interference, but these protections are being tested by the current administration. Critics argue that the administration's actions undermine the IRS's independence and increase the risk of political abuse.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are proposing a significant overhaul of the federal student loan program, introducing a binary system for future borrowers: a standard repayment plan or an income-based Repayment Assistance Plan. The standard plan offers repayment windows between 10 and 25 years based on debt size, while the Repayment Assistance Plan ties payments to adjusted gross income. This plan includes a minimum $10 monthly payment and waives unpaid interest, with potential monthly principal reductions. The proposal would eliminate the SAVE Plan, and borrowers would be unable to switch plans once enrolled, sparking debate among experts and borrower advocates about its potential impact on different income groups.</p>

Ocalan, who has been in solitary confinement since 1999, has recently been visited by lawmakers from the pro-Kurdish opposition DEM party, indicating a potential shift in attitudes towards the Kurdish issue.

The U.S. Constitution prohibits government officials from accepting gifts from foreign states, but the White House argues the gift is legal because it will be passed to the Air Force and then the presidential library.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is set to face trial on charges including racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, with jury selection commencing this week. The 55-year-old music mogul has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which could result in a life sentence if convicted. In addition to the federal criminal case, Combs faces numerous civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault, drug use, and intimidation. The trial is expected to last around eight weeks, and the proceedings will not be televised, but the BBC will provide live updates from the courtroom.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other in an attempt to defuse the trade war that has been threatening the world's two largest economies. The countries will suspend their respective tariffs for 90 days while they negotiate, with the United States reducing the tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent, and China lowering its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that both sides have a shared interest and that neither side wants a decoupling. The agreement has caused global markets to jump.</p>

          <p>The PKK, an outlawed Kurdish group that has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding. The move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for the organization to dissolve itself, citing the pursuit of Kurdish rights through democratic politics. While the implications of this decision remain unclear, it is speculated that Ocalan may be paroled, and Kurdish politicians are hoping for a new political dialogue leading to greater Kurdish rights. This decision is seen as an important step towards a "terror-free Turkey," but requires a major democratic transition by Turkey to accommodate Kurdish demands.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party (PKK), a Kurdish militia group that has waged a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state for four decades, announced on Monday that it would lay down its arms and disband. The announcement came a few months after its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, urged the group to disarm and disband, saying the groupâ€™s armed struggle had outlived its initial purpose. The PKK began as a secessionist group that sought to create an independent state for Turkeyâ€™s Kurdish minority, but more recently, it has said that it sought greater rights for Kurds inside Turkey. The move could end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.</p>
