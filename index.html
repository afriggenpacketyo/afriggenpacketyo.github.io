        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A vote on a major bill aimed at advancing President Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners, despite Trump's and Speaker Johnson's calls for unity. Representatives Clyde, Brecheen, Smucker, Norman, and Roy voted against the bill, citing concerns that the savings would not take effect until after Trump leaves office. Norman expressed frustration with the lack of immediate changes to Medicaid work requirements, and the House Freedom Caucus indicated continued negotiations over the weekend. The White House urged Republicans to pass the bill, while Republicans acknowledged the challenges of navigating a diverse conference with a tight margin.</p>

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary on President Trump's birthday, June 14, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade will include over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the FAA. Abrams tanks will also be featured, with metal plates laid down to protect the pavement, and White House officials said the cost will be shared by the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. While Trump claims the event is not tied to his birthday, some Democrats have criticized the cost as wasteful.</p>

Kam Buckner, requires law enforcement agencies to review all prior employment records before making a job offer, including fitness-for-duty examinations and records of investigations. Massey's father hopes the legislation will serve as a model for other states, and the bill now heads to Gov. Pritzker's desk after unanimous passage in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its efforts to penalize states that offer benefits to undocumented immigrants, challenging the long-held belief that states have autonomy over such programs. Actions include targeting in-state tuition laws and investigating state programs, potentially costing states billions and forcing difficult choices about healthcare services. This has sparked division among Democrats, with some advocating for continued support for immigrants while others propose scaling back benefits due to budgetary constraints and political pressures.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, are causing concern among recipients who fear losing coverage. An analysis suggests that Medicaid cuts could leave millions without health insurance, impacting vulnerable groups disproportionately. While some Republicans argue the cuts aim to eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, those relying on Medicaid worry about reduced access to care and having to choose between healthcare and necessities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. tourism industry is facing a downbeat season due to policy decisions, economic uncertainty, and anti-American sentiment, leading to a projected $12.5 billion loss. Canadian travel has declined significantly, and airlines and hotel chains are experiencing slower growth. Concerns over device searches at the border and the risk of deportation are deterring international travelers, while domestic travelers are cutting back due to recession fears.</p>

          <h2>Key Takeaways from Trump's Middle East Trip</h2>

          <p>President Trump's first major foreign trip to the Middle East focused on securing deals and money for the U.S., while downplaying democracy and human rights concerns. The trip, marked by lavish displays of wealth and fealty, resulted in significant financial agreements and a controversial gift of a 747 from Qatar. Trump's approach signals a shift away from American moral leadership and towards prioritizing transactions over principles.</p>

          <h2>Army to Use Metal Plates on DC Streets for Parade</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 14:33:06 EDT</div>

          <p>The Army will place metal plates on Washington, D.C., streets to protect them during the upcoming parade featuring M1 Abrams tanks. The parade, honoring the Army's 250th birthday and coinciding with President Trump's birthday, will involve thousands of troops and vehicles. The metal plates are intended to prevent damage to the pavement from the tanks' heavy weight, a concern that previously prevented their use in a parade during Trump's first term.</p>
