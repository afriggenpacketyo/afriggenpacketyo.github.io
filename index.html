          <p>Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic indicated he is currently leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year, balancing inflation concerns with recession worries. Speaking to CNBC, Bostic mentioned that tariffs have been larger than initially anticipated, potentially pushing inflation higher. He emphasized his concern about inflation expectations moving in a troublesome way, which could complicate the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Bostic is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy, but his views offer insight into the central bank's thinking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached a new agreement aimed at resetting their relationship after Brexit, covering areas such as fishing rights, trade, and security. The deal aims to reduce red tape for businesses, allowing easier import and export of British food and drink, including the return of British sausages to EU markets. A new partnership will also allow the UK defense industry to participate in the EU's proposed defense fund, and British travelers will benefit from increased access to eGates at EU airports. The agreement extends fishing rights for EU trawlers in UK waters until 2038.</p>

          <p>China's central government has directed state institutions to increase purchases of domestic electric vehicles (EVs) to promote environmentally friendly automobiles for official use. While no specific target was mentioned, the move signals government support for home-made EVs. Official procurement accounts for a relatively small share of the national market, around 10% of auto sales. Beijing has promoted the purchase of electric vehicles by state institutions since 2017, and EVs must account for at least 30% of total annual vehicle purchases by ministry-level authorities and affiliated units nationwide.</p>

In Romania, Bucharest's centrist mayor, Nicusor Dan, defeated a hard-line nationalist aligned with Trump. Poland's presidential race saw a liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, secure a spot in a runoff against a nationalist historian backed by the previous governing party, with hard-right candidates showing strong support.

The sharpest policy difference between the candidates is on housing, with Gainey advocating for 10 percent of all new housing to be set aside for low-income residents, while O’Connor prefers a neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach.</p>

          <p>China is implementing stricter austerity measures aimed at curbing wasteful spending among party and government bodies. The revised regulations target white elephant projects, the use of official vehicles, lavish meals, and meeting venue decor. Officials are urged to prioritize saving and oppose extravagance, reflecting Beijing’s concern over mounting debts and wasteful spending. The move is described as the most detailed and stringent since the austerity campaign began 12 years ago.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, a statement from his office said on Sunday.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to fall in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year. Analysts predict that the bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by £129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%. The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost £1,720, down from the current level of £1,849. While this is a welcome development, prices remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade.</p>
