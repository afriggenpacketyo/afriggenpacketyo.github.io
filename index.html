          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has challenged President Trump's executive order aimed at defunding NPR and PBS, asserting that Congress, not the president, controls its funding. CPB's president, Patricia Harrison, emphasized that the corporation is a private nonprofit, independent of the federal government, as mandated by Congress. The executive order seeks to eliminate direct and indirect funding to NPR and PBS, alleging partisan bias, however the heads of PBS and NPR testified at a House hearing in March about their funding. Congressional members have responded along party lines, with Republicans supporting the defunding and Democrats denouncing it as authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>A ship carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, named Conscience, was reportedly attacked by armed drones in international waters near Malta, causing a fire and damage to the hull. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which operates the ship, suspects Israel was behind the attack, though they cannot confirm it, with Greta Thunberg meant to board the ship. The Maltese government dispatched a tugboat to control the fire, and no injuries were reported, but the UN reports that food supplies in Gaza have mainly run out. The attack occurred amidst renewed Israeli strikes on Gaza and a reestablished aid blockade, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as his top foreign policy advisor, following the ousting of Mike Waltz, who held more hawkish views on Russia. This move consolidates foreign policy power, but also raises concerns about potential loss of diverse perspectives, as Steve Witkoff remains the chief negotiator. Rubio's new role is likely to limit his ability to travel as America's top diplomat, creating more space for Witkoff to continue his negotiations. Rubio has echoed Trump's stance on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as on China, demonstrating loyalty to the president's agenda.</p>

Israel has conducted numerous strikes in Syria to prevent weapons and territory from falling into hostile hands, particularly near its borders. The Israeli defense minister called it a clear warning to the new Syrian president, emphasizing Israel's commitment to preventing harm to the Druse in Syria.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities are a cornerstone of retirement planning, providing a reliable income stream, and in 2025, a good annuity rate depends on the type of annuity considered. Fixed annuities currently offer rates between 5.25% and 6.80%, while immediate annuities for retirees in their mid-60s to mid-80s can secure payout rates between 6.5% and 10.5%. Variable and indexed annuities do not have a guaranteed fixed rate, but may include income riders to ensure a minimum income floor. When choosing an annuity, it's important to consider your timeline, compare multiple insurers, evaluate fees and riders, understand the surrender period, factor in inflation, and align with your overall retirement plan (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Red Bull's expansion plans in the drought-ridden region around Berlin are facing criticism over environmental sustainability and transparency. The energy drinks maker and its partner Rauch acquired rights to millions of cubic meters of groundwater annually, and plan to more than double their uptake. Environmentalists and local citizens are concerned about the impact on groundwater levels, especially given Brandenburg's vulnerability to climate change. While the local mayor assures there is enough water, environmental groups argue that water-intensive industries should not expand in such a dry region.</p>

          <p>London's FTSE 100 has achieved a record-breaking winning streak, marking fifteen consecutive days of gains, fueled by the UK's unique position away from new US tariffs. The index's defensive giants, including healthcare, energy, and consumer staples, have attracted investors seeking refuge from volatility, supported by a high dividend yield. Robust corporate results and a resilient UK economy growing at an annualized rate of 1.5% have also contributed to the rally. While technical indicators suggest a potential pullback, undervaluation relative to global peers and expectations of interest rate cuts could push the index higher.</p>

However, these proposals are expected to be narrower than the blanket tax exemptions Trump has advertised, with limitations to control costs. Republicans are trying to limit the bill's impact on the deficit, necessitating negotiations over cuts to spending on Medicaid and other programs. The leading proposal for not taxing tips, for example, would exclude higher-income individuals and limit the tax break to specific industries.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy made an appearance on the Jimmy Fallon Show to discuss his recent Masters victory. McIlroy, who had faced questions for years about completing the career Grand Slam, admitted to wondering if he had missed his opportunity. He emphasized the importance of never giving up and staying resilient. McIlroy said he had learned lessons from his 2011 collapse, and focused on making everything else irrelevant, and setting a target for himself to shoot four-under-par.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order calling for all federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) to be blocked. Trump alleged that both organisations have engaged with "biased and partisan news coverage". The order instructs the board of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB), who distributes funding to PBS and NPR stations, to "cease direct funding" to the "maximum extent allowed by law". NPR director Katherine Maher estimated in March that the radio station would receive about $120m (Â£90m) from the CPB in 2025, "less than 5% of its budget."</p>

The allegations against Brand stem back to 2023, when The Times, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 published a joint investigation speaking with four women who accused Brand of sexual assault between 2006 and 2013. In April 2025, the Metropolitan Police announced they had conducted an investigation and were charging Brand with multiple counts of sexual assault.</p>

Scientists have used antibodies from his blood to create the most broadly protective antivenom to date, which could revolutionise the treatment of snake bites. The cocktail, which combines two protective antibodies from Friedeâ€™s blood and a small molecule venom inhibitor, opens a path towards a universal antivenom, according to research published in the journal Cell.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially eliminated a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs, a move aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers. The de minimis rule, which allowed products up to $800 to avoid tariffs, has resulted in higher prices for Americans who shop online. The decision was partly related to concerns about the loophole's use as a conduit for fentanyl into the United States. The change is expected to weigh on airlines and private carriers, as well as small retailers.</p>
