          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has voiced strong criticism regarding the club's performance under manager Ruben Amorim, stating the team has "got worse" since his appointment. Despite significant investment in new signings and a tactical revamp to a 3-4-3 system, United's results and overall play have deteriorated, marked by a dismal 36% win rate across all competitions. Rooney highlighted the team's struggles in midfield and a lack of clear progression, leading to visible frustration among supporters. The article suggests that Amorim's tenure, now over 10 months, has yet to revive the team's fortunes, raising questions about its continuation.</p>

          <p>The UK and US governments have unveiled a landmark agreement to accelerate the development and deployment of modular nuclear reactors in Britain, promising thousands of jobs and enhanced energy security. This "Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy" aims to halve the licensing time for nuclear projects to about two years by accepting each other's safety checks. Key commercial deals include Centrica partnering with X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, generating power for 1.5 million homes and creating 2,500 jobs. The initiative also seeks to eliminate reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028, positioning both nations at the forefront of nuclear innovation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's foreign policy actions are causing significant global realignments, with allies like Qatar and India seeking new partnerships after experiencing what is described as "humiliation." The article highlights Israel's strike in Doha and Trump's imposition of tariffs on India, despite prior close ties, as catalysts for these shifts. Nations are increasingly viewing Trump's regime as unreliable and dangerous, leading to hastily convened summits and public shows of solidarity among previously feuding states. This growing distrust is prompting countries to explore new blocs of power to shore up their sovereignty, even as they navigate carefully to avoid antagonizing the US president.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confronts a series of high-stakes challenges as parliament resumes, including a trade war with the US, a faltering economy, and numerous unfulfilled election promises. Public impatience is growing for tangible progress on issues like housing, healthcare, and affordability, despite initial steps on infrastructure projects and trade diversification. Recent polling indicates declining panic over Trump's policies but increasing worry about Canada's economy, with rising unemployment and contracting growth. Carney also faces a re-energized opposition leader, Pierre Poilievre, who is poised to scrutinize the Liberal government's record and upcoming "austerity and investment" budget.</p>

          <p>China's economic slowdown deepened in August, with key indicators like retail sales and industrial output falling below expectations, signaling persistent weak domestic demand and impacts from industrial overcapacity. Retail sales grew 3.4% year-on-year, missing estimates, while industrial output growth slowed to 5.2%, its weakest since August 2024. Fixed-asset investment expanded by only 0.5% year-to-date, with real estate investment contracting further. The article notes that despite some momentum in service consumption, the statistics bureau acknowledges "unstable and uncertain factors" in the external environment, suggesting that while fiscal policy may become more supportive, a large stimulus package is unlikely unless growth targets are jeopardized.

          <p>A growing number of car owners are "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicle's worth, which is significantly impacting new car purchases. Approximately 26.6% of trade-ins had negative equity in Q2 2025, the highest in four years, with an average amount owed of $6,754. This situation often arises from cars being depreciating assets, exacerbated by longer loan terms and smaller down payments. The article advises consumers to research credit scores, seek pre-approvals, and consider Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance to cover the difference between a car's value and the loan balance in case of an accident.

          <p>Tens of thousands of people gathered in Ankara, Turkey, to protest against the government's crackdown on the opposition, ahead of a crucial court ruling that could remove the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Ozgur Ozel. Ozel denounced the hearing as a "judicial coup" and accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime of governing through oppression rather than democracy. The protests highlight widespread discontent over a year-long legal campaign against CHP members, including the jailing of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. Critics view the case as politically motivated, aiming to undermine the CHP after its significant victory in the 2024 local elections.</p>

          <p>Following the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump has asserted that "a lot of people that you would traditionally say are on the left" are already under investigation. This statement comes amidst ongoing inquiries into the motives of suspect Tyler Robinson, and as Republicans accuse liberals of fostering anti-conservative sentiment that could incite violence. Trump, however, declined to call for national unity, instead framing "vicious and horrible" radicals on the left as the sole source of the country's divisions. The article underscores a highly polarized political climate and Trump's divisive rhetoric in the wake of a violent incident, further exacerbating national tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a disease that is a leading cause of death and infertility for the marsupials. Researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast spent over a decade developing the vaccine, which has shown to reduce infection, prevent disease progression, and even reverse existing symptoms in wild and captive koalas. Chlamydia can cause blindness and starvation in koalas, and current antibiotic treatments are not always effective. This approval by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority offers significant hope for the conservation of koala populations, particularly in areas with high infection rates.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are entering the final two weeks of the MLB regular season with critical implications for their playoff seeding, particularly regarding securing a first-round bye. Currently holding the third-best record among division champions, the Dodgers face a significant challenge from the Philadelphia Phillies for a top-two spot, which would grant them five crucial days off before the Division Series. President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman emphasizes the strategic advantage of a bye for player recovery and optimal rotation alignment. The article also notes the San Diego Padres are close behind in the NL West, potentially forcing the Dodgers into a wild-card round and raising questions about home-field advantage and game location.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, has refused an interview request from the Metropolitan Police, despite his imminent release from prison for an unrelated sexual offence.

The Met Police confirmed the refusal of their international letter of request, stating they will continue to pursue viable lines of inquiry. This development underscores the ongoing challenges in one of the world's most high-profile unsolved missing person cases, with investigations continuing almost two decades later.</p>

          <h2>US Farmers' Loyalty to Trump Tested Amidst Economic Squeeze from Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US farmers are experiencing significant economic hardship due to President Trump's tariffs, particularly those imposed on China, which have led to a sharp decline in American crop orders. Despite a rise in small business bankruptcies among farmers, many in rural America, a loyal Trump voting bloc, maintain their support, believing tariffs will yield long-term benefits. The article highlights that while some farmers express patience, others, like Jon Tester, warn of a "trade and financial precipice" and potential widespread bankruptcies. This situation tests the adage that people "vote with their pocketbooks," as rural voters' support for Trump remains strong, rooted in a shared identity and perceived alienation from urban liberals.

          <p>Florida's surgeon general's plan to end childhood vaccine mandates is causing alarm among parents and medical experts, who fear a new era of infectious disease outbreaks. Immunocompromised children, like 4-year-old Mason, face heightened risks if vaccination rates decline, potentially leading to a resurgence of preventable illnesses. The article highlights strong opposition from leading medical organizations and concerns from former state health officials about "pockets of outbreaks." While some parents support the policy as a matter of choice, a recent survey indicates most Florida parents favor vaccine requirements. This controversial move follows Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s efforts to reshape US vaccine policy, causing confusion and resignations within health agencies.</p>
