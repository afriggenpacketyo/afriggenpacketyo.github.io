          <p>Police in London have arrested numerous protesters who gathered in Parliament Square to demonstrate against the UK government's recent proscription of the activist group Palestine Action. The government designated the group as a terrorist organization, making any show of support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The Metropolitan Police had warned that arrests would be made, and footage showed officers detaining individuals who displayed placards supporting the group. This event occurs amid a tense weekend with multiple planned demonstrations related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>A Jewish student at Columbia University has voiced apprehension regarding New York City Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, suggesting his potential victory would be "scary" for the city's Jewish student population. The student, TJ Katz, clarified that the fear is not of direct antagonism from the mayor, but rather that a weak approach to condemning hate could embolden others to commit harmful acts. The article notes that Mamdani's rise coincides with a broader political shift among some young Jewish voters. It also contextualizes the race, with Mamdani facing former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams in the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not surrender any territory, responding to reports of a potential meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war. Trump suggested a deal could involve "swapping of territories," a proposal that would reportedly be discussed at a meeting in Alaska. Zelenskyy emphasized that any peace decisions made without Ukraine's involvement would be counterproductive and against peace itself. The potential summit has raised concerns that Ukraine might be excluded from negotiations about its own future.</p>

          <p>The owner of a Donald Trump-themed hamburger chain in Texas, Roland Mehrez Beainy, is facing deportation after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Beainy, a Lebanese national, allegedly overstayed his non-immigrant visitor visa and is also accused of entering into a fraudulent marriage to obtain legal status, a claim he denies. ICE stated its enforcement actions are applied regardless of an individual's political beliefs or business affiliations. The case highlights the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement, which has affected some of the former president's own supporters.</p>

He will remain in a hospital overnight for observation. The coaches from both teams mutually agreed to end the game early out of respect for the player's well-being, a decision supported by players who were visibly concerned by the gravity of the situation.</p>

Conservation groups and Alaska Native organizations have condemned the move as an "erasure of years of work" to protect the region. The rollback is part of a broader push to industrialize the Alaskan Arctic, which critics argue will lock in fossil fuel production for decades.</p>

          <p>Amid rising ticket prices for major music tours, a significant number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans to afford concert tickets. A LendingTree survey found that 37% of Gen Z and 35% of millennials have used these services for such purchases. While BNPL offers interest-free installment payments, financial analysts caution that these loans may lack the consumer protections of credit cards, such as recourse if an event is canceled. Instead, experts recommend proactively budgeting for entertainment by creating dedicated savings accounts, humorously dubbed a "Beyoncé fund" or "Taylor Swift fund."</p>

          <p>A high school football player, Logan Coleridge, experienced debilitating concussion symptoms for months, which ultimately led doctors to diagnose a rare, underlying brain condition. After a helmet-to-helmet hit, he suffered from severe dizziness, headaches, and memory issues that did not improve with standard therapy. A concussion specialist finally ordered an MRI, which revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain that was likely the true cause of his symptoms. Logan successfully underwent surgery to remove the AVM and is now recovering well, with his family advocating for earlier, more thorough diagnostic testing.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold by repurposing neutrons produced during nuclear fusion. The theory suggests that this process could transmute common metals like mercury into gold, creating a valuable byproduct to help subsidize the high cost of developing fusion energy. While scientists have created minuscule amounts of gold in labs before at exorbitant costs, Marathon's idea is to integrate this process into future commercial fusion reactors. The concept, though speculative and dependent on the advent of viable fusion power, has intrigued physicists as a clever potential revenue stream.</p>

Her meticulous investigation, which involved scrutinizing financial records and activity logs, led directly to her colleague, Aldrich Ames. Ames was arrested in 1994 and convicted of espionage, having received millions from the Soviet Union for information that led to the execution of multiple U.S. assets.</p>

          <p>Yarmouk, a sprawling refugee camp on the edge of Damascus, once considered the de facto capital of the Palestinian diaspora, is now a wasteland struggling to recover from Syria's civil war. The conflict reduced its population from over a million to just a few thousand and left 40% of the camp destroyed. Volunteer engineers are assessing the damage to facilitate reconstruction, but the return of residents is slow. The article explores the profound sense of loss among former and current residents, who feel the war has shattered not only their homes but also the powerful sense of Palestinian identity that once defined the community.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is planning to increase its rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base to nearly 100 per year, a proposal meeting strong resistance from the California Coastal Commission. The state agency has raised concerns about the environmental impact on wildlife and the effect of sonic booms on residents. The commission argues that since most launches support SpaceX's private Starlink network, the company should be subject to state permitting, not just federal oversight. SpaceX has sued the commission, alleging overreach, while military officials argue all launches serve national security interests, creating a tense standoff between the private company, the military, and state regulators.</p>

          <p>The ancient archaeological site of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, dating back nearly 12,000 years, has become a focal point for conspiracy theories popularized by figures like Graham Hancock and on platforms like Joe Rogan's podcast. These theories often suggest the site was built by a lost advanced civilization and accuse archaeologists of hiding discoveries. Lead archaeologist Lee Clare refutes these claims, explaining that the slow pace of excavation is necessary to preserve the site for future generations and properly decode its layers. He emphasizes that while the true purpose of the mysterious T-shaped pillars remains unknown, they are a testament to humanity's ancient storytelling traditions.</p>

          <p>In a tangible sign of easing tensions, North Korea has started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the heavily fortified border with South Korea. This move follows a similar action by Seoul, which halted its own broadcasts of K-pop music and news reports in a goodwill gesture under the new administration of President Lee Jae Myung. The reciprocal de-escalation marks a shift from the hard-line policies of the previous South Korean government. These cross-border loudspeaker campaigns have been a recurring feature during periods of heightened animosity between the two nations, which technically remain at war.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 22-year-old Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. Sesko, who joins on a five-year contract, is the club's third major attacking acquisition under manager Ruben Amorim, following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Known for his electrifying pace and physical presence, Sesko was a top young goalscorer in Europe's major leagues. His arrival at Old Trafford raises questions about the future of Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund, whom the club is reportedly prepared to sell.</p>

          <p>Over 260 firefighters are battling a major wildfire near Athens that has already claimed one life and destroyed homes and farmland. The blaze, which broke out in the rural Keratea area, was stoked by gale-force winds, prompting evacuations of homes and an elderly care center. Strong winds across Greece also contributed to the deaths of two tourists on the island of Milos and disrupted ferry travel. This event is part of a pattern of more destructive summer wildfires across the Mediterranean, which scientists attribute to climate change, increasing pressure on authorities to improve fire prevention and cross-border collaboration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As conflict-driven famines unfold in places like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are highlighting the dangers of "refeeding syndrome," a potentially fatal condition that can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume eating too quickly. A sudden influx of nutrients can cause rapid electrolyte shifts, leading to critical organ failure, particularly cardiac arrest. Aid organizations use specially formulated, low-nutrient therapeutic foods like Plumpy'Nut to stabilize patients and reintroduce nutrition slowly. Experts stress that preventing this syndrome requires not just food, but safe access for aid workers to administer care properly, which is currently being denied in several crisis zones.</p>

Fearing detention and forced deportation under the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, Kangethe opted to leave on his own terms to avoid being incarcerated. His immigration case stems from a prior marriage that was deemed fraudulent, leaving him without a path to legal status despite having no criminal record. His story illustrates the profound personal and familial impact of current U.S. immigration enforcement policies on long-term residents.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to build the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland. The proposed structure would be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge, costing an estimated €13.5 billion, with construction slated to begin in 2026. Proponents believe the bridge will bring economic prosperity to southern Italy, creating jobs and improving infrastructure. However, the project faces significant challenges, including its location in a seismically active zone and opposition from local residents who argue the funds should be used for existing infrastructure needs.</p>
