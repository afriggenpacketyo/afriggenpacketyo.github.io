          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba championed the importance of maintaining the global economic order and reducing trade barriers at the G7 summit in Canada, amidst rising concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and unilateral approach to trade. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the need for cooperation and economic prosperity in a divided world. Trump reiterated his discontent with Russia's exclusion from the group and suggested the inclusion of China. The summit was also impacted by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, prompting Trump to leave early, while G7 leaders called for de-escalation and affirmed support for Israel's security. The article reflects the challenges in achieving consensus on global issues due to differing agendas among G7 nations.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts indicate a resurgence in China's private sector as regulatory restrictions are relaxed to encourage technological advancements and international expansion. Investment patterns signal a renewed focus on capital expenditure, overseas growth, research, and fundraising. The report highlights the private sector's significant contribution to China's GDP, urban employment, and tax revenue, despite receiving a smaller share of bank loans. Beijing's support for the private sector is seen as crucial for economic momentum amid growing competition with the United States. The sustainability of this rebound depends on predictable policies, macro stimulus, and stable US-China relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Russian strike on Kyiv has resulted in at least 15 fatalities and numerous injuries, marking one of the most significant bombardments on the capital since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion.

The strikes lasted over nine hours, forcing residents to seek shelter, with a ballistic missile hitting a nine-story apartment building.

          <p>Following last week's plane crash in India involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, investigators are analyzing the aircraft's black boxes to determine the cause of the disaster, which claimed the lives of at least 270 people. The black boxes contain crucial cockpit conversations and flight data, which will help investigators piece together the events leading up to the crash. The Air India aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing 241 people on board and 29 on the ground, with only one survivor. Experts from India, the U.K., the U.S., and Boeing are collaborating in the investigation, focusing on CCTV footage, witness testimonies, pilot training records, and the aircraft's maintenance history.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump departed the Group of Seven summit earlier than planned, citing the need to address pressing matters beyond ceasefire planning between Israel and Iran, following his call for the immediate evacuation of Tehran. G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel's right to defend itself while condemning Iran as a source of regional instability and emphasizing that Iran must not possess nuclear weapons. Trump's departure followed French President Emmanuel Macron's remarks about a potential ceasefire offer, which Trump refuted. The G7 also addressed Trump's tariff policies and the need for consensus on global economic and geopolitical challenges, while Trump expressed his view that Russia's expulsion from the group in 2014 was a mistake.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order implementing parts of a trade agreement with the UK, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The deal allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the previously imposed 25% import tax. While the order addresses car tariffs and aerospace products, it does not include the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The UK government aims to further reduce tariffs on core steel products, but technical details are still being worked out due to Tata Steel's import of steel from overseas during its transition to electric furnace operations.</p>

          <p>Explosions were reported across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, amid a "rain of missiles" from Iran. The Israeli military issued and later lifted instructions for the population to remain in shelters, while the air force worked to intercept and strike incoming threats. Israeli police reported that missiles and shrapnel caused material damage in the Tel Aviv area, but no injuries. Simultaneously, Israel claimed to have killed an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general, further escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Fans attending a Club World Cup match at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, described conditions as "dangerous" due to high heat, lack of water, and tightly packed crowds. Attendees reported that they had to dispose of full water bottles before entering the stadium, faced long lines for water, and experienced overcrowded misting stations. The Rose Bowl typically allows sealed water bottles, but FIFA regulations prohibited this, contributing to the issues. Some attendees expressed reluctance to attend future events at the venue due to the poorly managed experience, with many citing sunburns and other heat-related problems.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a missile defense system for the United States, modeled after Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles designed to protect against missile attacks, having successfully intercepted thousands of rockets in Israel. However, experts note that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's size and the types of missiles it would need to defend against. The scale of the project is considered far more challenging than the Iron Dome.</p>

          <p>An op-ed argues that Israel's recent attacks are undermining Iran's progress towards liberty and prosperity, which had been slowly improving due to the efforts of the Iranian people. Despite a sclerotic and oppressive government, Iran had been experiencing modest improvements in its political, economic, and social conditions. The election of President Masoud Pezeshkian aimed to repair Iran's social contract, and the country had been engaging in negotiations with the U.S. on a nuclear deal. The author contends that Israel's actions disregard the aspirations of the Iranian people, who were pushing their leaders to avoid war.</p>

          <p>President Trump faces several options regarding the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, ranging from escalating involvement to pulling back. He could bow to pressure from Netanyahu and escalate attacks, maintain a middle ground by reiterating the U.S. is not involved, or listen to MAGA voices and pull back due to concerns about risking involvement in a Middle East war. The decision is complicated by factors such as domestic support, pressure from hawkish Republicans, and the potential impact on negotiations with Iran. The Israeli prime minister has said that the attacks were "fully coordinated" with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his first major league pitching appearance since August 2023, allowing one run in one inning and driving in two runs in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 6-3 win over the San Diego Padres. Ohtani's fastball reached 100 miles per hour, and he expressed gratitude for being back on the mound healthy. The three-time MVP went 2-for-4 at the plate, contributing to the Dodgers' offensive performance. Ohtani's return to pitching came sooner than expected due to the team's injured pitchers.</p>
          <p>85/100</p>
