          <p>A recent analysis examines the growing difficulty for newly promoted teams to survive in the English Premier League, noting that for the past two seasons, all three promoted clubs were immediately relegated. The article explores the shifting points benchmark for survival, which has trended lower than the traditional 40-point mark. It also highlights the financial disparity created by Profit and Sustainability Rules, which gives established clubs a significant budget advantage over newcomers like Burnley, Leeds, and Sunderland.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced that his country will formally recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September, aligning with several other Western nations. The recognition is predicated on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including the demilitarization of Gaza and ensuring no governmental role for Hamas. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who labeled the move as shameful amid the ongoing regional conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stargazers anticipating the peak of the annual Perseids meteor shower this week are likely to face disappointment, as a bright waning gibbous moon is predicted to significantly hinder visibility. According to the American Meteor Society, the intense moonlight will wash out most of the fainter meteors, potentially reducing the observable rate by 75% or more. Experts advise that the best viewing conditions may occur about a week after the peak, when the moon's brightness is less of a factor.</p>

The association, representing major domestic producers, claims these cheap imports are causing substantial harm to the local industry. This legal action follows a temporary tariff that India had already imposed in April as an earlier measure to curb the surge in Chinese steel shipments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese state media outlet has publicly denounced Nvidia's H20 AI chips as unsafe, calling for a boycott by Chinese companies and consumers. The commentary alleges that these chips, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market, could contain hidden "back doors" enabling surveillance by the U.S. government. This move signals escalating technological distrust and economic nationalism, despite Nvidia's firm denials of any such vulnerabilities in its products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck the Balikesir province in northwestern Turkey, leading to at least one death and numerous injuries. An 81-year-old woman was killed after being rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Sindirgi, the town at the quake's epicenter. The tremor destroyed at least 16 buildings, serving as a tragic reminder of the nation's high seismic risk, especially following the catastrophic earthquakes that devastated the region in February 2023.</p>

          <p>NASCAR rookie Connor Zilisch, 19, suffered a broken collarbone in an unusual accident after winning a race at Watkins Glen. During his victory celebration, he climbed onto the roof of his car to pose for photos, lost his balance, and fell to the ground.
