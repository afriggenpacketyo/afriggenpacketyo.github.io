          <p>The world tour for musical artist d4vd has been canceled amid a police investigation into the death of a 15-year-old girl, Celeste Rivas. Her body was discovered in the trunk of a Tesla registered to the singer, David Anthony Burke, after the vehicle was impounded from a Hollywood Hills street. Rivas had been reported missing from Lake Elsinore over a year prior. While police have stated there is currently no indication of a crime and no arrests have been made, the 20-year-old artist is cooperating with the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Several European countries, including France and the United Kingdom, are preparing to formally recognize a Palestinian state, joining over 145 UN members in a move aimed at reviving the two-state solution. This diplomatic push comes as the war in Gaza continues, with a recent UN report concluding that Israel is committing genocide, a claim Israel and the U.S. reject. While supporters see recognition as a symbolic affirmation of Palestinian rights that could strengthen their negotiating position, critics argue it may be a performative gesture without tangible actions like sanctions or boycotts to halt the conflict.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is urging the communications regulator Ofcom to take action against Elon Musk, alleging that "crimes" are being committed on the social media platform X. Davey claims the platform has hosted harmful content, including advertisements related to child sexual abuse material and self-harm, in violation of the new Online Safety Act. This call for an investigation follows Musk's recent criticism of the act as a threat to free speech and his appearance at a far-right rally, where he made comments Davey described as inciting violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians are welcoming the impending statehood recognition by the UK, France, and others as a significant, though largely symbolic, political affirmation of their rights. However, this diplomatic move is set against a backdrop of increasing Israeli military control, settlement expansion, and fears that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government may respond by formally annexing parts of the territory. Residents and local leaders, like Jenin's mayor, believe that while recognition won't immediately change the harsh realities on the ground, it strengthens their future legal and international standing.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced the appointment of his former lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, a move that follows the resignation of the previous prosecutor, Erik Siebert. The appointment comes as Trump publicly pressures Attorney General Pam Bondi to more aggressively pursue investigations into his political adversaries, including New York Attorney General Letitia James. Critics view this as a significant challenge to the independence of the Justice Department, as the president is installing a loyalist in a key position to target his opponents.</p>

A key piece of legislation, the "No Secret Police Act," will prohibit on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers, including ICE agents, from wearing face coverings and require them to be identifiable by name and badge. Other new laws aim to protect students by restricting agents' access to schools without a warrant and requiring that families be notified of their presence. These measures are framed by state officials as a form of resistance against what they term the "authoritarian tendencies" of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point has unexpectedly been followed by a rise in long-term rates, including those for mortgages. While the stock market reacted positively, bond traders sold off long-term bonds, driving their yields higher. Analysts suggest this reaction indicates the bond market's concern that the Fed may be easing its focus on inflation too soon, especially while it remains above the 2% target. This divergence highlights a potential conflict between the central bank's monetary policy and market sentiment regarding inflation risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from MSNBC alleges that Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, was recorded by undercover FBI agents accepting $50,000 in cash in September 2024. The agents were posing as contractors, and Homan allegedly promised to help them secure government contracts in a second Trump term. According to sources cited in the article, the investigation was initiated under the previous administration but was recently closed by Trump-appointed officials at the Justice Department, who deemed it a "deep state" operation with no credible evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative influencer who was recently shot and killed, rose to prominence as a key voice for young supporters of Donald Trump. He co-founded the student organization Turning Point USA at age 18, building a massive social media following by engaging in combative debates on college campuses. Known for his right-wing Christian worldview and controversial stances on race, immigration, and social issues, Kirk was praised by Trump for creating an "army of young patriots." His death has been framed as a martyrdom by his supporters, and his wife has taken over as CEO of his organization.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a drive-by shooting that targeted the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. Police report that at least three bullets were fired into the building's lobby on Friday afternoon while it was occupied, though no one was injured. The suspect, Anibal Hernandezsantana, was charged with multiple felonies and has since been released on bail. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation, and it is unclear if it is connected to a protest held outside the station a day earlier regarding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show.</p>
