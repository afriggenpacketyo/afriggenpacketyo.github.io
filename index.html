Despite a decorated career at City, the 34-year-old was deemed surplus to requirements but has since demonstrated formidable form for both his new club and the Belgian national team. His performance suggests he could still have been a key player for City, which has had a mixed start to its season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, raising questions about who retains ownership of the property. Homeowners who take out a reverse mortgage remain the legal owners and keep the title to their house; the lender only places a lien on the property to secure the loan. The loan, plus interest, becomes due when the borrower sells the home, moves out, or passes away, at which point the heirs can choose to repay the loan to keep the home or sell it.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has announced his support for suspending President Emmanuel Macron's contentious 2023 pension reforms until the 2027 presidential election. This move is a significant concession aimed at securing the support of Socialist MPs and surviving upcoming no-confidence votes that threaten his newly reappointed government. The reforms, which raised the retirement age to 64, had previously caused widespread protests and were forced through parliament without a final vote.</p>

          <p>The remnants of Typhoon Halong have battered western Alaska, causing widespread flooding and storm surges that have resulted in at least one death and two missing persons. The severe weather swept away homes and necessitated the rescue of over 50 people, with officials describing the devastation in some villages as "absolute." The storm has destroyed homes, power infrastructure, and vital subsistence food stores, creating a dire situation for remote communities as winter approaches.</p>

Rotem Cooper described the experience as a "big rollercoaster" and called on international mediators to pressure Hamas to return all the remaining bodies for proper burial.</p>
