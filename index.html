          <p>The Trump administration threatened to freeze $510 million in grants to Brown University, citing accusations of antisemitism on campus.  Brown administrators negotiated with student protesters instead of forcefully removing pro-Palestinian demonstrations, a decision that drew the administration's ire.  The university president, Christina H. Paxson, pledged to defend academic freedom and freedom of expression against government pressure.

          <p>Canada's increasingly liberal assisted dying laws raise ethical questions, as exemplified by April Hubbard's case.  Hubbard, not terminally ill but suffering from chronic pain, was approved for Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID). Critics argue this demonstrates a "slippery slope", potentially leading to MAID becoming a substitute for adequate care.  While safeguards exist, the rising number of MAID deaths and its expansion to include mental illness raise concerns about its potential misuse and impact on vulnerable populations.</p>
