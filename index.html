            <p>An Israeli military inquiry concluded that an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders" led to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The IDF claimed its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat, but video evidence contradicted initial reports that the vehicles lacked emergency signals. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report, and the IDF investigation found that six of the casualties were Hamas members, though it did not provide evidence for any affiliation to Hamas.</p>

The investigation found that the deputy commander, due to poor visibility, mistakenly assessed the ambulances as belonging to Hamas militants. The Israeli military investigation said the examination found "no evidence to support claims of execution or that any of the deceased were bound before or after the shooting," and that the Palestinians were killed due to an "operational misunderstanding" by Israeli forces.</p>

            <p>The article argues against relying on anecdotal or government data to predict a recession, suggesting instead that focusing on actual data from key companies offers a more reliable insight. The author criticizes metrics like the "lipstick index" and government surveys, emphasizing the value of real-time data from retailers, banks, and payroll companies. Recent reports from Walmart, Amazon, Citibank, JPMorgan, and Paychex suggest a healthy economy, but the author advises monitoring future earnings releases closely. The author argues that these metrics are based on surveys and initial releases are oftentimes significantly revised well after the fact.</p>

            <p>The article provides strategies for those nearing retirement to protect their savings from market volatility caused by tariffs. Financial advisors recommend rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance, building cash reserves, and considering a bond ladder. It's important to avoid selling investments when the stock market is down, especially during the first few years of retirement. Building cash reserves protects from early losses because retirees can tap cash reserves for living expenses while their portfolio recovers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is preparing for the final phase of a landmark antitrust case against Google, which may result in the company's breakup. The DOJ accuses Google of illegally stifling competition by paying browser and phone makers to set Google as their default search engine. The government is seeking to stop these payments and potentially spin off Chrome and Android. Google argues that the proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation. An initial Justice Department proposal for remedies included forcing Google to pull out of its investments in AI, which includes the more than $3 billion it's poured into Anthropic, the AI research company that developed the Claude large language model.</p>
