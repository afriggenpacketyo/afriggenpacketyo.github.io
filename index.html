          <p>While touring the flood-devastated areas of central Texas, former President Donald Trump praised the response efforts and dismissed questions about the adequacy of emergency warning systems. He labeled a reporter's question on the topic as 'evil' and emphasized 'unity and competence' in the local response, a stark contrast to his previous criticisms of disaster management in Democrat-led states. The visit occurred as scrutiny grows over the handling of the crisis, which has claimed over 120 lives, and as his administration faces questions about proposed changes to FEMA and cuts to the National Weather Service.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of infamous drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a Chicago federal court to running a massive drug trafficking operation. As part of a plea deal, he admitted to overseeing a major fentanyl smuggling enterprise for the 'Los Chapitos' faction of the Sinaloa cartel. The agreement requires him to forfeit $80 million and provide 'substantial assistance' to the government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison and potentially involve testifying against his own brother.</p>

          <p>Emil Bove, a former defense attorney for Donald Trump nominated for a lifetime federal judgeship, declined to rule out a third presidential term or denounce the January 6th Capitol attack in his Senate confirmation questionnaire. Bove, who has served as a top Justice Department official in the Trump administration, stated that opining on these politically debated matters would be inappropriate for a judicial nominee. His responses have drawn scrutiny from Democrats, who have also questioned his role in the controversial dismissal of a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price soared to a new record, briefly exceeding $118,000, following the largest single-day inflow into bitcoin ETFs this year, totaling $1.18 billion. This rally is also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and potential fiscal policies that could increase the federal deficit, which some investors see as a positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency. The sharp price increase triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further propelling the momentum as institutional investment continues to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

Cain argued that while the 'American way' is immigrant-friendly, it has rules, and suggested that Gunn's political commentary was a mistake that could negatively impact the film's box office performance amid ongoing national debates on immigration.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is planning to introduce more varied ticket options within its premium cabins, mirroring the segmentation strategy it successfully applied to its main economy cabin with fares like Basic Economy. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, stated that the goal is to offer different levels of service and amenities in first and business class to cater to diverse customer needs. This move comes as revenue from premium seats continues to show strong growth, prompting the airline to focus on enhancing and diversifying its high-end offerings to expand margins further.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned the plea agreements for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other men accused of planning the 9/11 attacks, a decision that deepens the legal stalemate in the long-stalled case. The deals would have allowed the defendants to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, avoiding the death penalty. The ruling sided with the government's argument that the Defense Secretary had the authority to rescind the agreements. This outcome leaves the case without a clear path to trial, frustrating some 9/11 family members who seek resolution after more than two decades.</p>

Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. to face charges in Tennessee and could be taken into ICE custody if released on bond. The judge sharply criticized the government for its handling of the case and its lack of a clear plan to ensure his due process rights, given he was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order barring his removal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant turnaround from May's $316 billion deficit. This unexpected surplus was largely driven by a sharp increase in government receipts, which were bolstered by a 301% year-over-year surge in customs duties following the implementation of widespread tariffs. Despite the monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit stands at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt remain a major challenge, totaling $84 billion for the month alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency and potential benefit reductions, seniors are exploring alternative ways to supplement their retirement income. This article outlines several financial strategies that can provide additional funds. Options include taking out a reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners aged 62 and older to draw payments from their home equity. Another approach is purchasing an annuity, which provides guaranteed monthly payments for life in exchange for a lump-sum investment. Personal loans are also presented as a potential, though less favorable, option for short-term needs. (not investment advice)</p>
