          <p>A sniper attack at the Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office resulted in one detainee killed and two critically wounded, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The alleged shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, with investigators discovering shell casings engraved with anti-ICE messages near his body. Federal officials, including Vice President JD Vance and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, condemned the incident as a targeted assault on law enforcement, attributing it to heightened anti-ICE rhetoric and calling for an end to politically motivated violence. The FBI is investigating the shooting as an act of targeted violence, emphasizing the need for leaders to unite the country during crises and protect those enforcing border laws.</p>

          <p>A former stylist for Sean "Diddy" Combs, Deonte Nash, has filed a comprehensive lawsuit accusing the music mogul of sexual abuse, violence, sexual battery, human trafficking, and false imprisonment during his decade-long employment. Nash, who previously testified against Combs in a federal criminal trial, alleges multiple sexual assaults and instances of physical violence, including a violent strangulation in 2013 or 2014. The lawsuit further claims that Combs continued to threaten Nash even after his resignation in 2018, highlighting a pattern of alleged intimidation. This legal action follows Combs' recent conviction on prostitution-related charges and graphic testimony from his former girlfriend, Cassandra Ventura, intensifying the significant legal challenges against the music executive.</p>

This situation has notably aligned Kimmel with several high-profile conservatives, including Senators Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell, and commentators like Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro. These figures, despite their past criticisms of Kimmel, have voiced strong opposition to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr's suggestions of regulatory action against ABC affiliates. They argue that such government intervention sets a dangerous precedent for censorship, warning it could eventually be used against right-leaning voices, highlighting a rare bipartisan concern for press freedom.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's emotional return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" garnered an unprecedented 6.26 million viewers, marking the program's largest audience ever in its regular time slot, despite significant preemptions across nearly a quarter of US households. The comedian used his extended monologue to address his recent suspension, clarifying his intent regarding controversial remarks about Charlie Kirk's death, and directly challenged FCC Chair Brendan Carr's threats against ABC. Kimmel emphasized the critical importance of free speech in America, notably expressing gratitude to conservative figures who publicly defended his right to express his views. This high-profile return underscores the ongoing tensions between political figures, media outlets, and the fundamental principles of free expression.</p>

          <p>A generic drug called leucovorin, typically used to ease chemotherapy side effects, has shown preliminary promise in helping children with autism improve their speech, with some parents reporting significant breakthroughs. Pediatric neurologist Dr. Richard Frye, who has studied the drug for decades, explains that it may bypass a folic acid transport blockage in the brain linked to some autism spectrum disorders. Despite promising phase 2B studies and five positive blinded controlled trials, larger phase 3 clinical trials are still needed for full FDA approval. Challenges remain, including securing funding for further research and ensuring consistent supply of quality formulations, as leucovorin is an inexpensive, older drug with limited commercial incentive for investment.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring options to provide financial support to companies within Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, following a cyber attack that halted JLR car production in late August. Fears are growing that smaller suppliers, heavily reliant on JLR, could face bankruptcy without intervention, as factories remain suspended. Proposed solutions include the government purchasing component parts to sustain businesses or offering government-backed loans, though the latter is less popular. This situation highlights broader concerns among senior government figures about a pattern of cyber attacks on UK institutions and businesses, prompting urgent consideration of measures to protect the automotive sector and its extensive workforce.</p>

          <p>US retailers are projected to significantly reduce seasonal hiring for the upcoming holidays, with forecasts indicating the lowest levels since 2009, when the economy was recovering from a recession. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes this downturn to increased costs from US tariffs, persistent inflation, and a growing reliance on technology and permanent staff. The firm anticipates fewer than 500,000 seasonal jobs added in the last quarter, a notable decrease from previous years. This cautious approach reflects broader economic concerns, including a faltering job market and consumer pullback on spending due to tariff-driven price hikes, signaling a challenging retail environment.

The article highlights the inconsistency of his "America First" stance, noting his unpredictable positions on the Ukraine war, oscillating between scolding Ukraine and blaming Russia.

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, there's a critical focus on whether this blueprint can effectively boost domestic consumption amidst widespread economic anxieties. Many Chinese citizens, like former analyst Joe Zhang, are experiencing significant shifts in spending habits due to employment uncertainty, stagnant wage growth, investment downturns, and deflationary risks. Zhang's personal story exemplifies a broader trend where individuals are "eating into old savings" and prioritizing frugality over luxury. The upcoming plan is expected to expand on existing initiatives to stimulate spending, but its success hinges on restoring consumer confidence and addressing the underlying economic challenges impacting household finances.

          <p>Veteran talent agent and entertainment executive Bob Broder has passed away at the age of 85 in his Los Angeles home, surrounded by family, after a battle with cancer.

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has officially formed in the central tropical Atlantic and is projected to move northwestward, with steady strengthening expected over the next several days. The storm is currently located about 550 miles northeast of the Leeward Islands, moving west-northwest at 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. The National Hurricane Center notes that Humberto is in a favorable environment for intensification due to warm sea surface temperatures and mid-level relative humidity. While there are currently no coastal watches or warnings in effect, officials are monitoring its potential downstream impacts on parts of the Southeast U.S. coast, from Florida up to North Carolina.</p>

          <p>The deadly shooting at the Dallas ICE field office, which killed one detainee and wounded two others, has triggered starkly different political reactions from Republicans and Democrats. Republican figures, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, quickly framed the incident as an attack on law enforcement by the "radical left," blaming anti-ICE rhetoric. Conversely, Democrats, like Representative Marc Veasey and Congresswoman Summer Lee, focused on the victims being detainees, advocated for gun control, and urged a rejection of xenophobic sentiment. The FBI is investigating the incident as targeted violence, with "anti-ICE messaging" found, but has not confirmed the shooter's motive or ideological background, intensifying the political division surrounding the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump violated federal law by firing eight government inspectors general without notifying Congress or providing justification, as required by the Inspector General Act. However, the judge declined to reinstate the officials, citing their failure to demonstrate irreparable harm and noting that Trump could legally remove them again after a 30-day notice period. The fired watchdogs, who investigated fraud and waste across various federal agencies, were dismissed en masse shortly after Trump returned to the White House in January. This decision underscores concerns about the politicization of independent oversight roles and the president's broader efforts to reshape the federal government.</p>

          <p>Lawyers representing the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, who died after riding a roller coaster at Universal Orlando Resort's Epic Universe, assert that his spinal disability played no role in his death. They believe Zavala, 32, suffered blunt force trauma from hitting his head on a restraint during the ride's downward thrusts, leading to him being unconscious for most of the experience. The medical examiner ruled the cause of death as multiple blunt impact injuries and the manner as an accident. The family's attorneys criticized Universal's quick statement that the ride functioned normally, arguing that proper function does not preclude safety issues, as the coaster remains closed for review.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign a deal brokered by his administration that will allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, declaring it a "qualified divestiture." Under the agreement, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, will have its content recommendation algorithm copied and retrained to operate solely on US user data. Cloud-computing firm Oracle is slated to provide "top to bottom security" by hosting American user data and reviewing the app's code. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will hold a stake in TikTok. While the White House expresses confidence in the deal's compliance with laws, some lawmakers, like Rep. John Moolenaar, voice concerns about potential ongoing Chinese influence, particularly regarding the algorithm.</p>

The development, intended for recording studios, restaurants, and apartments, has yet to receive city approval.

The CDC's advisory committee (ACIP) recently shifted to recommending individual, informed decisions for healthy children, stopping short of a broad recommendation, a change influenced by new members appointed by Robert F.
