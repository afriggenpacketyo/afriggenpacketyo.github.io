          <p>A 12-year-old boy in Sacramento County is in custody after allegedly stealing his parents' pickup truck to drive to his former school. He led sheriff's deputies on a brief chase through a neighborhood before crashing into a patrol car and another parked vehicle. Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident, and the boy was taken into custody. In California, minors as young as 12 can be held criminally responsible in juvenile court.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the airwaves following a suspension for comments the host made about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The company stated the suspension was due to the remarks being "ill-timed and thus insensitive" but decided to reinstate the show after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel. The suspension had sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, with several major affiliate station groups, like Sinclair and Nexstar, pulling the show from their schedules.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has withdrawn from a televised town hall to protest ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. Mamdani stated his decision was not an indictment of the local affiliate but a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over freedom of the press. He argued that such actions contribute to a climate of authoritarianism and send a chilling message about free speech across the country. The move highlights the political fallout from the network's decision to suspend the late-night host.</p>

The contest highlights the natural cycle of the bears, who can gain hundreds of pounds by feasting on salmon in the Brooks River to survive the winter. The event, which began in 2014, uses live webcams to make the remote park accessible and educate the public about the importance of a healthy ecosystem for the animals.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has criticized Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, alleging that local police under his sanctuary jurisdiction failed to assist federal agents during a protest at an ICE facility. The DHS labeled the protesters as "rioters," stating they obstructed law enforcement, assaulted officers, and disrupted an operation targeting convicted criminals. Governor Pritzker's office refuted the claims as "completely false," asserting the state had not received multiple calls for assistance and accusing the Trump administration of failing to coordinate with local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially designating the anti-fascist movement known as antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization." The order directs federal officials to investigate and disrupt any illegal activities attributed to antifa members and their supporters. However, the legal impact of the designation is unclear, as the U.S. lacks a specific statute for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. Critics and legal experts note that antifa is a decentralized movement without a formal leadership structure, which could pose legal challenges to the order's enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, part of a broader push by federal health agencies to phase out research on live animals. This move is supported by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress who question the necessity and cost of such experiments. While proponents celebrate the shift towards alternatives like AI modeling, some scientists and patient advocates express concern. They argue that animal testing has been crucial for developing life-saving treatments and that alternative methods are not yet advanced enough to fully replace it.</p>

          <p>Experts and autism advocacy groups have strongly criticized the Trump administration's claim linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism, calling the announcement dangerous and scientifically unfounded. Organizations like the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) argue that this oversimplification of a complex condition is dehumanizing and promotes stigma. Critics also point out that this rhetoric echoes disproven historical theories that blamed mothers for their children's neurodivergence. Advocates stress that the focus should be on providing support, services, and accommodations for autistic people rather than searching for a single cause or "cure."</p>

Major medical groups have pushed back, stating there is minimal evidence for a causal link and that acetaminophen remains the safest option for pain and fever during pregnancy.

          <p>A report has surfaced that Tom Homan, President Trump's former "border czar," was the subject of a federal bribery investigation after he was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash. The payment was reportedly from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen who were promised help in securing government contracts. The investigation into Homan, who was a private citizen at the time but was boasting of a future role in a second Trump term, was closed earlier this year by the Trump administration. The White House has denied Homan accepted the money and described the investigation as politically motivated entrapment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Viviane Barci de Moraes, the wife of the Brazilian Supreme Court justice who presided over the case against former President Jair Bolsonaro. The sanctions were issued under the Global Magnitsky Act, which targets human rights abusers, with the State Department accusing Justice Alexandre de Moraes of weaponizing the courts and suppressing free expression. The move is the latest in a series of actions by the U.S. against Brazil, which Justice de Moraes condemned as an attack on Brazil's sovereignty and judicial independence.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who was detained by ICE while reporting on a protest in Georgia, is facing possible imminent deportation after an immigration appeals board reopened his case. His lawyers have filed for an emergency hearing to halt the deportation, arguing he should not be in detention and has a clear path to residency through his U.S. citizen son. Guevara's arrest, captured on his own livestream, has drawn condemnation from free press advocates and politicians who see it as part of a broader attempt to stifle critical reporting. The Department of Homeland Security maintains Guevara is in custody because he is in the country illegally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas has created significant confusion and uncertainty, according to immigration attorneys. Lawyers are advising corporate clients to have their H-1B employees avoid international travel until there is more clarity on how the rule will be applied, particularly for renewals or changes of employer. While the White House has stated the one-time fee applies only to new applicants, attorneys point to ambiguous language in the proclamation that could affect current visa holders. The policy is expected to have a "chilling effect" on attracting skilled foreign workers to the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Introduces 'Gold Card' for Wealthy Immigrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 18:09:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration pathway, dubbed the "Trump Gold Card," which offers a fast track to permanent residency for wealthy foreigners. In exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce, applicants can receive an EB-1 or EB-2 employment-based visa, categories historically reserved for individuals with "extraordinary ability." This pay-to-play system essentially equates personal wealth with the substantial benefit an immigrant can offer the United States. Critics argue the program transforms the American dream into a transaction, prioritizing the rich over other qualified applicants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is introducing a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if they present with the same unresolved symptoms three times. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. Her family hopes the "three strikes and rethink" approach will help doctors catch serious illnesses earlier, especially in younger patients whose symptoms may not fit typical profiles. The guidance encourages GPs to consider extra tests, second opinions, or specialist referrals to prevent avoidable deaths.</p>

          <p>China has started the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, which will guide the nation's economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is a core component of Beijing's governance, aimed at achieving its goal of becoming a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare for discussions in October, the plan is being formulated against a backdrop of rising global uncertainty and domestic economic challenges. Experts suggest that to navigate these turbulent times, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets of the past. (not investment advice)</p>
