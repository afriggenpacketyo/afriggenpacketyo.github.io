          <p>A 42-year-old man has been taken into custody after allegedly stabbing eleven people with a folding knife at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The attack, which authorities believe was random, occurred near the checkout area and left six victims in critical condition and five in serious condition. Bystanders in the store reportedly assisted in apprehending the suspect and providing aid to the injured before first responders arrived. The incident has prompted statements of concern from state and federal officials, as well as from Walmart.</p>

          <p>Four individuals, including a married couple, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children. The children, aged 7 to 16, were allegedly subjected to horrific conditions, including being kept in plywood cages, beaten with canes, and sprayed with vinegar. Prosecutors claim the four adopted children were treated more harshly than the biological siblings and were instructed to lie about the abuse. The investigation began after a concerned member of their church reported suspicions, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Official's Call to Reframe Ancient History Stirs Diplomatic Sensitivities with South Korea</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top official in China's Jilin province has called for a reinterpretation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, sparking concerns about potential diplomatic friction with South Korea. The issue centers on the Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae kingdoms, which both nations claim as part of their historical heritage. The Jilin party chief urged scholars to present the history in a way that clearly aligns with China's narrative, particularly in the context of the country's "century of humiliation." This move highlights the ongoing sensitivities surrounding historical claims and national identity in East Asia.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has intensified its efforts to suppress news coverage of mass attacks, such as those involving vehicles or knives, leading to public complaints on social media. Since a particularly deadly incident in November, authorities have shifted from releasing basic details to imposing information blackouts or issuing vague statements. This expanded censorship, part of a broader trend under Xi Jinping, is believed to be aimed at preventing copycat crimes and allowing local officials to conceal failures. However, the lack of transparency has frustrated some citizens, who are demanding the truth and challenging the government's control over information.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that threatens to deepen the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent national division. This development follows a February agreement between paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups aiming to establish a secular "New Sudan." The conflict has already displaced up to 13 million people and pushed large parts of the population toward famine.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. The prosecution argued she killed him to ensure sole custody of their daughter, while the defense maintained she acted in self-defense after years of abuse. The trial featured dramatic testimony from Ashley, who claimed Doug was violent and lunged at her, and evidence from prosecutors suggesting the fatal shot was fired as he turned away. Despite her claims, the jury rejected a second-degree murder charge, opting for the lesser offense of manslaughter, for which she faces up to 30 years in prison.</p>

Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw struggled, giving up a three-run lead in the second inning and ultimately allowing four runs in just over four innings.

The move comes alongside a proposed 24% budget cut for the agency, though Congress is considering maintaining current funding levels.

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed ICE train traveling from Vienna, Austria, to Hamburg, Germany, were trapped inside a tunnel for over six hours following a power failure. The outage, which occurred shortly after departure, also knocked out the air conditioning and lighting, leaving passengers in the dark and heat. The evacuation was delayed when some passengers attempted to walk out of the tunnel on their own, forcing a secondary power-down for safety. Eventually, all passengers were safely evacuated via emergency exits and transported back to Vienna by bus.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded in 1775 with Benjamin Franklin as its first postmaster general, the agency played a crucial role in unifying the nation. The celebration occurs as the USPS faces an uncertain future, with recent discussions within the Trump administration about potential privatization or restructuring. The newly appointed postmaster general, David Steiner, has stated his belief that the Postal Service should not be privatized.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, though an MRI revealed no acute damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. The news came as a relief to the team and fans, who feared a more serious, long-term injury. Judge received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 days to two weeks, initially returning as a designated hitter. The two-time MVP first felt pain during a game on Tuesday after making a strong throw from the outfield.</p>

          <p>Beyond his legendary music career, the late Ozzy Osbourne is being remembered as a groundbreaking reality television icon for his role in the early 2000s MTV show, "The Osbournes." The series, which followed the daily life of his family, pioneered the "reality sitcom" format and offered an unprecedented, mundane look into a rock star's life before the era of the Kardashians. By portraying himself as a lovable, often confused father, Osbourne helped create a new genre of celebrity-driven TV. The show's blend of fame and family frustration resonated with millions, cementing his place in pop culture history.</p>

          <p>As fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions people experience while watching high-stakes sports. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an elevated heart rate, shakiness, and anxiety. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, eating well, and reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience. They suggest that sport provides a healthy outlet for expressing emotions and that even in a loss, the feeling of being part of something larger is beneficial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west than usual over the Pacific. This has allowed a low-pressure system to dominate, leading to persistent cloud cover and increased coastal upwelling of cold ocean water. While some residents enjoy the temperate conditions, the pattern contrasts sharply with oppressive heat and wildfires seen in other parts of California.</p>
