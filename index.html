          <h2>Clownfish Found to Shrink in Response to Ocean Heat Waves</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 10:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that clownfish are shrinking in size as an adaptation to survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures caused by climate change. Scientists measured clownfish off the coast of Papua New Guinea during a severe heat wave in 2023 and discovered that most of the fish got shorter over a period of months. This downsizing may help them cope with higher energy demands in warmer conditions and increase their chances of survival. The study highlights the complex ways in which marine life is adapting to climate change, even as coral reefs face devastating consequences from heat waves.</p>

          <p>Romanian director Erwin Simsensohn has staged an opera titled "Eichmann's Trial" to educate people about the Holocaust and the dangers of right-wing extremism.

Simsensohn emphasizes the importance of remembering Romania's role in the Holocaust, which was long repressed in his native country. Despite the rise of far-right parties in Romania, Simsensohn believes it is the responsibility of artists to continue discussing the Holocaust and warn against the dangers of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plans to sharply cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies. Judge Susan Illston stated that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates. The order pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. This ruling underscores the importance of Congressional oversight in the functioning of federal agencies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an operation to terminate immigration court cases of certain migrants, allowing ICE to arrest and place them in expedited removal proceedings. This process enables officials to deport migrants more quickly, without a court hearing, if they lack proper documents and cannot prove they have been in the U.S. for more than two years. Immigration lawyers are advising clients to attend their hearings despite the risk of arrest, as failure to appear could result in deportation orders. The ICE arrests have been reported in cities with large immigrant populations across the country.</p>

          <p>Democrats are criticizing the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which passed the House, arguing that it benefits the wealthy while harming low-income individuals. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increases military and border security spending, while cutting Medicaid, SNAP, and other assistance programs. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade and negatively impact the resources of the lowest-income Americans. Democrats argue that the bill strips away healthcare, increases poverty, and forces children to go hungry.</p>

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans would repeal key subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs), potentially slowing their sales and production in the United States. The bill eliminates subsidies for battery manufacturing, EV purchase incentives, and funding for charging stations, while imposing a new annual fee on EV owners. Analysts suggest that the rollback could leave the U.S. behind China and Europe in EV adoption, while also leading to higher emissions and dirtier urban air. The bill's future in the Senate remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Championship play-off final is anticipated to increase US investment in English football, driven by financial motives rather than reputational ones. US investors are attracted to the global game due to limited investment opportunities in US pro sports, fueled by factors like NBC's Premier League coverage and popular TV shows. These investors believe that English football has untapped revenue potential in media rights, ticketing, and sponsorship. With valuations differing between American football clubs and English football clubs, the latter provides an attractive opportunity for investment and growth.</p>

States and cities enacted new policies aimed at improving policing, but the data suggests that these changes have had little impact on accountability or the number of killings by police officers. Killings by police officers rose from just over 1,000 in 2019 to around 1,200 in 2024, and racial disparities in police killings are partly caused by officersâ€™ prejudices, but higher crime rates in poorer minority communities also mean these places are more likely to get police attention, both good and bad.</p>

          <p>A proposed Republican bill aims to reverse the progress of Obamacare by restricting access to Medicaid, a program that provides health insurance to lower-income individuals. The bill proposes adding a work requirement, which would strip Medicaid benefits from working-age adults without children unless they can prove they work at least 80 hours a month. Critics argue that this would deprive millions of Americans of health insurance and use the savings for tax cuts for the wealthy. Evidence suggests that work requirements are ineffective and primarily punish people for paperwork issues.</p>
