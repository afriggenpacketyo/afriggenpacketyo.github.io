          <p>Labor Day, celebrated on the first Monday of September, honors the contributions of American workers and marks the unofficial end of summer. Originating from the labor movement in the late 19th century, the federal holiday means that government offices, banks, and the postal service will be closed. Most major retailers and grocery stores are expected to remain open, though some, like Costco, will be closed, and others may have limited hours, so shoppers are advised to check with local establishments beforehand.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued an urgent warning about counterfeit Labubu dolls, stating they pose a serious choking risk to young children. These knockoffs, sometimes called "Lafufus," can be poorly made, breaking into small parts that can block a child's airway. The agency advises consumers to avoid purchasing these fakes and to identify authentic products by looking for a holographic Pop Mart sticker, a scannable QR code, and specific design details like the correct number of teeth.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced the expansion of the NYPD's Quality of Life Division, a program targeting issues like homeless encampments and public drug use. Despite a recent fatal shooting, Adams expressed confidence in the city's ability to manage crime independently, stating the expansion is unrelated to President Trump's federal crackdown in Washington, D.C. While acknowledging the need for federal help to stop the flow of illegal guns, he maintained that NYC's crime statistics demonstrate local success.</p>

In another remarkable account, an Arkansas hairstylist's sharp eye and persistence led to the early detection of skin cancer on her client's scalp, ultimately saving her life. Both narratives underscore the profound impact of shared experiences and the importance of paying close attention to others.</p>

To combat this, the article suggests strategies such as paying more than the minimum, using a 0% APR balance transfer card, or consolidating debt with a lower-interest personal loan.

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by mediators from Egypt and Qatar. The framework is reportedly based on a two-stage plan that includes an initial 60-day truce in exchange for the release of approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has recently stated it would only accept a deal in which all hostages are released simultaneously.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to the state capitol, ending their quorum break and allowing the Republican-led legislature to move forward with a controversial redistricting plan. The Democrats fled the state to block a vote on new congressional maps that could give Republicans up to five additional seats. Having returned, Democratic leaders say their focus will now shift to building a legal case to challenge the proposed maps in court on the grounds of racial discrimination.</p>

          <p>British Member of Parliament Zarah Sultana has stated that former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn "capitulated" when his party adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. Sultana, who recently co-founded a new political party with Corbyn, argued that the definition wrongly equates anti-Zionism with antisemitism and that the Corbyn movement was too conciliatory. Her comments have drawn sharp criticism from Jewish community groups, who defended the IHRA definition as a crucial standard.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best time for seniors to consider a reverse mortgage is typically in their late 60s to early 70s. This financial tool allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly repayments, but waiting allows for access to a larger loan amount. The decision should be based on individual circumstances, including long-term financial goals, other retirement income sources, and a firm commitment to aging in place, as moving triggers loan repayment.

He claimed this decision was influenced by a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who allegedly told him that mail-in voting was the reason for his 2020 election loss. This move renews his attacks on the U.S. electoral process, which have been widely refuted by courts and election officials.</p>

          <p>State health officials have officially declared an end to the measles outbreak in Texas after 42 consecutive days—double the virus's maximum incubation period—without a new reported case. The outbreak, which began in January, resulted in 762 confirmed cases, primarily among children, and led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited the containment to a robust public health response but urged continued vigilance as measles remains a threat nationally.</p>

          <p>After hitting a new all-time high last week, the price of bitcoin dropped, falling below $117,000 in a broader crypto market downturn. The decline was triggered by a wave of liquidations exceeding $500 million, spurred by macroeconomic concerns after wholesale inflation data came in higher than expected. This has tempered investor hopes for a near-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, leading to profit-taking across digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>
