          <p>Intel's shares fell after former President Donald Trump publicly demanded the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. Trump's social media post cited Tan as being "highly CONFLICTED," contributing to a 5% premarket drop in the company's stock value. The call for resignation follows concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's alleged ties to Chinese companies, including some linked to the military. These developments raise questions about Intel's security integrity and its stewardship of U.S. taxpayer funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Burger King and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter financial results, missing earnings-per-share estimates but exceeding revenue expectations. The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and a 3.4% same-store sales growth at Tim Hortons. However, Popeyes experienced a 1.4% decline in same-store sales, marking it as a laggard in the portfolio. CEO Josh Kobza noted a modest improvement in the consumer environment and reiterated the company's full-year forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a planned meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, the prospects for a swift resolution to the Ukraine war appear slim due to the vast differences in their positions. Russia's demands, outlined in a June memorandum, include Ukrainian surrender and recognition of annexed territories, a stance Moscow shows no sign of abandoning. Analysts suggest Putin may be engaging in talks to fend off potential U.S. sanctions or to influence Trump. Ukrainian officials express concern that without their involvement, Trump might concede to Putin's terms, highlighting the deep-seated complexities that diplomacy alone may not overcome.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has narrowly voted to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points, from 4.25% to 4%. The 5-4 decision reflects a deep division among policymakers, who are balancing persistent inflation against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. One policymaker even voted for a larger 50-basis-point cut before a majority was reached in a second round of voting. Governor Andrew Bailey stressed a continued "gradual and careful" approach, suggesting future rate cuts are not guaranteed and will depend on disinflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's government and markets have reacted with calm to the U.S. announcement of a 50% tariff on its goods and threats of sanctions over Russian oil trade. The prevailing view in India is that the move is a pressure tactic for trade negotiations, and it has unexpectedly unified political opposition in support of the government's firm stance. While certain sectors like gems and textiles could be significantly impacted, India's economy is largely driven by domestic consumption. Analysts believe India may wait for the outcome of U.S.-Russia talks before making any major concessions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's vital semiconductor industry is facing immense pressure following former President Trump's threat to impose a 100% tariff on imported chips unless companies establish manufacturing in the U.S. This new threat compounds the impact of a 20% tariff on other Taiwanese goods that recently took effect. The policy appears aimed at compelling firms without a U.S. manufacturing presence to invest in American facilities.

          <p>In a significant development in a racially charged murder case in South Africa, charges have been dropped against Adrian de Wet, one of three men accused of killing two women. De Wet has turned state witness and will testify against the farm owner, Zachariah Johannes Olivier, and another worker. The case involves the 2024 killing of Maria Makgato and Lucia Ndlovu, whose bodies were allegedly fed to pigs. The release of de Wet has caused distress to the victims' families and highlighted ongoing racial tensions in the country's rural, farm-owning communities.</p>

          <p>United Airlines experienced a significant, nationwide ground stop due to a "technology issue," causing extensive delays and disruptions at major hubs like Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco. The airline held departures for several hours to manage gate availability before resolving the underlying problem. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the issue was internal to United and not related to the broader air traffic control system. While operations are being restored, residual delays are expected, and the airline has stated it will cover customer expenses for the preventable delay.</p>

          <p>The well-preserved body of Nasiruddin, a man who went missing in 1997 at the age of 31, has been discovered on a melting glacier in Pakistan's Kohistan region. He reportedly fell into a crevasse while fleeing a village dispute, and his body was found by a local shepherd near the shrinking Lady Meadows glacier. His family, who had searched for years, expressed a sense of relief and closure upon recovering his remains. The discovery is one of several recent instances where receding glaciers, a consequence of climate change, have revealed the bodies of long-lost individuals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has issued a contract request to purchase two Tesla Cybertrucks for use in "live missile fire testing" at White Sands Missile Range. According to procurement documents, the move is prompted by the assessment that adversaries are "likely" to begin using the durable, stainless-steel vehicles on the battlefield. The justification notes that the Cybertruck does not sustain the "normal extent of damage expected upon major impact." This unique military interest highlights the vehicle's unconventional design and the Air Force's need to understand how to effectively neutralize it as a potential threat.</p>

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the detentions are underway and stated the government would robustly defend against legal challenges, asserting that France is a safe country.

          <p>A standoff is brewing between the UK government and Jingye Group, the Chinese owners of British Steel, over the company's future. The government, which took control of the Scunthorpe steelworks in April to prevent its closure, claims Jingye is now demanding hundreds of millions of pounds to complete the transfer of the company. This demand has stalled the search for a new buyer. The two sides have vastly different valuations of the loss-making company, creating a complex negotiation that Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is expected to join in September to find a sustainable solution.</p>

          <p>This cultural analysis explores the history and psychology of survivalism, from its far-right origins in the 1970s to its modern-day "prepper" boom among tech billionaires. The article contrasts the heroic "survivor" archetype, who seeks to rejoin civilization, with the "survivalist," who often craves societal collapse. It examines how fiction, from "Lord of the Flies" to "The Road," has shaped and critiqued this mindset, which often promotes a bleak, Hobbesian view of humanity. The essay argues that while these stories are compelling, they often overlook the powerful human instinct for mutual aid and solidarity that emerges in real-world disasters.</p>
