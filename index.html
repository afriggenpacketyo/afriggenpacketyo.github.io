          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson and his wife are being sued by four women, identified as former housekeepers, who allege sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, and workplace violations, seeking $50 million in damages; the alleged assaults date back to 2007. The women claim Robinson used physical barriers and threats to prevent them from fleeing during the alleged assaults, and that his wife failed to take action to prevent the alleged acts, with prior knowledge of similar cases. The Robinsons' attorney denies the allegations, describing the lawsuit as an extortion attempt and claiming the evidence will show the allegations are false. The attorney states that they will ask the court to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Slovakia and Hungary are strongly opposing the European Union's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by 2027, arguing that such a move would be economically suicidal and detrimental to the region's energy security. While the EU aims for full energy independence from Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, these Eastern European nations, traditionally reliant on cheaper Russian energy, warn of increased consumer prices. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico criticized the plan as building a new Iron Curtain and stated that Slovakia is ready to work on reducing energy dependence but not at the cost of economic stability. The EU's proposal aims to reduce the nearly 19% of gas and LNG imports that still came from Russia in 2024.</p>

While Timpson emphasizes the importance of rehabilitating offenders to reduce re-offending rates, critics have questioned his previous statements about the UK's approach to sentencing and punishment, especially given that over 26% of adult criminals in England and Wales reoffend within a year of release.</p>

          <p>President Trump is anticipated to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, marking the first such deal since imposing tariffs. The specifics of the agreement remain unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as taxes on US technology companies. While UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ruled out reducing food production standards, senior British trade negotiators have been in Washington to expedite the agreement before a UK-EU summit. The announcement could signal a step towards easing trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The British film and TV industry is expressing concerns that potential tariffs imposed by President Trump could severely damage the sector, which is still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes. Trump's suggestion of 100% tariffs on films made in "foreign lands" has caused alarm, given that nearly 90% of film and high-end TV production spending in Britain comes from abroad, mainly the United States. While it is unclear how the tariffs would be enforced, the industry fears that uncertainty could deter investment and lead to studios becoming empty again. The British government is in discussions with the U.S. administration to address these concerns.</p>

          <p>An ongoing Israeli military operation in the West Bank has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, leading to fears of potential annexation of the territory. The operation, targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, has resulted in the longest-running Israeli presence in West Bank cities in decades, undermining the Palestinian Authority's control. Palestinians report that the operation is resulting in home demolitions and expanded roads, and that Israeli forces are patrolling the camps day and night. The Israeli military maintains it is targeting militant infrastructure, but Palestinians fear the actions are paving the way for annexation, a view supported by powerful ministers in Israel's government.</p>

          <p>A new online writing course featuring an AI-reanimated avatar of Agatha Christie is sparking debate about the ethics of using artificial intelligence to resurrect deceased figures. While Christie's estate approved the project and stipulated that only her own words be used, some ethicists question whether it is appropriate to put words in the mouth of someone who cannot consent. The course creators argue that the AI is only used to create Christie's likeness and that the course is based on her own writings and advice, aiming to make her work more accessible.</p>

The defense questioned Hyde's reliability, referencing a past case, but the judge limited the scope of cross-examination.
