Powell, recently dismissed from Sir Keir Starmer's cabinet, urged the party to clearly advocate for scrapping the two-child benefit cap and to adopt a more assertive stance. She also dismissed suggestions that her bid was a proxy for other male politicians, emphasizing her independent political identity and commitment to representing party members.</p>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the UK provides a temporary distraction from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's recent political difficulties, including questions about a controversial ambassadorial appointment. The visit emphasizes pageantry, with the UK showcasing royal and military traditions, which aligns with Trump's preferences. Despite official statements of an "unbreakable friendship," underlying disagreements persist on issues like tariffs, the recognition of a Palestinian state, and the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein controversy, suggesting the visit's political outcomes remain unpredictable.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has denied the Menendez brothers' petition for a new trial, ruling that newly presented evidence alleging Jose Menendez was sexually abusive would not have altered the original verdict. The evidence included a 1988 letter from Erik Menendez and a declaration from their father's former boy bandmate claiming he was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez. Despite their claims of self-defense, the judge found the evidence not "particularly strong" and already considered by the jury. The brothers, who were recently resentenced to 50 years to life, continue to seek clemency.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted by a smaller-than-expected 0.1% year-on-year in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline but showing improvement from July. This better performance was driven by a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp jump to Western Europe, partially offsetting a steeper fall in exports to the US due to tariffs. Despite the overall contraction, the figures were "less impressive than they look" according to economists, who predict a future shrinkage in export volumes due to slower external demand.

          <p>Syria is facing its worst drought in 36 years, severely impacting wheat harvests and pushing millions to the brink of a wider food crisis. Farmers like Maher Haddad have seen yields drop dramatically, making it impossible to cover costs and forcing them to borrow money. The UN's FAO estimates a 2.73 million-tonne wheat shortfall, potentially leading to unprecedented food insecurity for over 14 million Syrians. This crisis exacerbates the challenges of post-conflict rebuilding, with international aid agencies and the government working to provide temporary relief.</p>
