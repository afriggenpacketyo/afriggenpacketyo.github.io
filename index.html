          <p>The Drug Enforcement Administration raided an underground nightclub in Colorado Springs, detaining over 100 undocumented immigrants. The raid, which followed months of surveillance, involved more than a dozen active-duty U.S. military members. Agents found weapons and illicit drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, inside the club, where officials say drug trafficking, prostitution, and crimes of violence were taking place. The DEA special agent in charge stated the club had been under law enforcement surveillance for months due to the illegal activities occurring there.</p>

          <p>The Lakers are on the brink of elimination after losing Game 4 to the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-113, falling behind 3-1 in the series. Despite strong performances from Luka Doncic (38 points) and LeBron James (27 points, 12 rebounds), Anthony Edwards' 43 points led the Timberwolves to victory. Coach JJ Redick's decision to play the starters for the entire second half backfired as the Lakers ran out of gas. The Lakers' lack of a center and inability to contain Edwards and the Timberwolves' rebounding proved costly.</p>

          <p>Japan's population has been declining for 15 years, leading to concerns about the economy, healthcare, and national defense. The declining birth rate is attributed to the success of women in the workforce, a demanding work culture, and a decline in marriages. Solutions being explored include government-sponsored dating apps, a four-day workweek, and promoting rural living. Some believe a shift in mindset is needed to address the crisis, focusing on improving rural areas and providing economic opportunities outside of Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple who are legally in the U.S., criticizing the government's evidence suggesting they are members of a gang. The judge accused the government of declaring them gang members without providing meaningful evidence. The couple, who fled Venezuela and applied for Temporary Protected Status, were arrested and detained multiple times. Another judge previously slammed the government's evidence, stating she would dismiss government lawyers if it were a criminal case.</p>

Some advocate for a shift in mindset, focusing on revitalizing rural areas to attract younger generations and families.

          <p>Proposed budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by the Trump administration are raising concerns about the future of medical research. The cuts, including layoffs and grant cancellations, could slow or halt progress on therapies for diseases like cancer, dementia, and HIV/AIDS. The NIH is the largest supporter of biomedical research globally, and its funding has led to significant medical breakthroughs. Scientists fear the cuts will lead to a "brain drain" as researchers seek opportunities elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The U.S. birth rate is at a historically low level, raising concerns about the long-term economic and social implications.

Proposed solutions include financial incentives for new parents and expanded access to IVF treatments. Experts suggest addressing the high cost of childcare and fostering a more hopeful economic outlook may be more effective.</p>

Previously thought to be pirate ships, the discovery sheds light on Denmark's role in the transatlantic slave trade. The Danish government banned the transatlantic slave trade in 1792, but slavery was not abolished until 1847.</p>
