          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri on his final lap. The qualifying session at Silverstone was highly competitive, with Piastri's teammate Lando Norris finishing third and Mercedes' George Russell fourth, setting the stage for a thrilling race. Verstappen noted the challenging windy conditions and the team's choice of a low-downforce setup, which made the car fast on straights but difficult in high-speed corners. The close margins between the top drivers suggest a competitive fight for the win.</p>

          <p>One year after Labour's election victory, many voters who supported the party are now expressing feelings of disappointment and frustration. A focus group of 2024 Labour voters in Kent revealed a sense that the government has not delivered on its promises, particularly concerning immigration and economic stability. While some voters remain forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of turning the country around in a single year, others feel misled by the party's campaign pledges. The government's recent policy U-turns have also contributed to a perception of a lack of clear direction.</p>

          <p>Recent escalations in President Trump's rhetoric, including threats of deportation, loss of citizenship, or arrest against figures like Elon Musk and political rival Zohran Mamdani, are causing concern among democracy advocates. These actions are seen as part of a broader pattern of using the instruments of state power for retribution against perceived enemies, challenging constitutional norms and freedom of speech. Critics argue that threatening the world's richest person sends a chilling message to all citizens that dissent will not be tolerated. The threats underscore a presidency that has consistently tested the boundaries of executive power.</p>

The men, originally from countries in Asia and Latin America, were the subject of a prolonged legal battle that reached the Supreme Court.

While tipping was once reserved for specific service industries, requests for gratuity are now common in a wide range of settings, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks. Experts note that this trend, accelerated by the pandemic, is driven by point-of-sale technology that defaults to asking for a tip.

          <p>A renter in Scottsdale, Arizona, was fined $4,000 by his property management company for posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included issues like black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in the lease agreement, which penalizes tenants for reviews rated three stars or less. However, such clauses are generally illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act, which protects a consumer's right to share honest feedback. The case highlights a potentially illegal practice used by some businesses to silence criticism and manipulate their online reputations.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has risen to 16, with search and rescue operations continuing for a second day. The building collapsed on Friday, and rescuers have been working with heavy machinery to pull bodies and potential survivors from the rubble, with at least eight more people believed to be trapped. Such incidents are tragically common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards, substandard materials, and a lack of regulatory enforcement frequently lead to structural failures.</p>

          <h2>Doctor Argues New Medicaid Work Requirements Create Bureaucratic Hurdles for the Most Vulnerable</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A doctor working in a public hospital argues that new work requirements for Medicaid will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable patients who should be exempt but cannot navigate the complex bureaucracy. Citing examples of patients who are homeless, disabled, or lack internet access, the article explains how these administrative burdens act as a "time tax" designed to disenroll people from care they are entitled to. The author contends that the policy, projected to cause millions to lose insurance, is engineered to cut costs by making access to benefits impossibly difficult for those who need them most.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the southeastern United States, prompting the National Hurricane Center to issue tropical storm warnings for parts of North and South Carolina. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, is moving slowly northward and is expected to make landfall along the South Carolina coast on Sunday morning. Forecasters anticipate some additional strengthening before it reaches the coast, and residents in the warning areas are being advised to prepare for tropical storm conditions.</p>

          <h2>Happiness Researcher Promotes "90-Second Rule" for Managing Emotional Responses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage negative emotions like anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a rush of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued feeling of anger is a choice made by replaying the negative thought. Gawdat advises using this 90-second buffer to consciously decide how to respond, rather than unconsciously renewing the emotional cycle, thereby gaining control over one's mental state.</p>

          <p>An Emory University professor shares her year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies, inspired by the Danish culture's emphasis on personal pursuits outside of work. She found that dedicating time to activities like tennis, woodworking, and mahjong fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit and feel less lonely. The experience reshaped her definition of self-care from passive appointments to active, skill-building engagement. She argues that hobbies are the secret to achieving balance, forcing individuals to set boundaries and build identities and communities outside of their professional lives.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex-trafficking trial demonstrates the legal system's inability to adequately handle complex cases of intimate partner violence and coercive control. While Combs was found guilty on lesser charges, his acquittal on the most serious counts suggests that existing laws are ill-equipped to address the nuances of abuse by wealthy and powerful individuals. The author notes that prosecutors often turn to trafficking charges due to their longer statutes of limitations and more severe penalties, as domestic violence laws are often outdated.</p>

Following Florida, North Carolina and Arizona were the next most popular destinations. In contrast, California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of nearly 57,000 people in the same age group. (not investment advice)</p>
