          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a second "Kinetic Strike" that killed three people aboard a boat in international waters. The vessel was allegedly operated by "extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels" from Venezuela and was transporting illegal narcotics toward the United States. This action follows a similar strike announced by the president earlier in the month, which resulted in the deaths of eleven individuals. The president characterized the narcotics as a "deadly weapon poisoning Americans" in his social media post about the operation.</p>

          <p>Former MMA fighter Conor McGregor has announced he is no longer seeking to be a candidate in Ireland's upcoming presidential election. After previously stating his intention to run on an anti-immigration platform, McGregor said he made the decision after consulting with his family. In his withdrawal statement, he criticized Ireland's political rules, claiming they prevent a "true democratic presidential election" and favor establishment-approved candidates. McGregor has recently faced legal issues, including losing a civil court case where a woman claimed he had sexually assaulted her in 2018.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth U.S. company to achieve a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. Its stock value increased by more than 4% on Monday, placing it in an exclusive club alongside Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The recent surge in share price was partly fueled by a favorable antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties on the company. Despite facing increased competition in the AI space and ongoing regulatory scrutiny, Alphabet's stock has risen over 30% this year, reflecting strong investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock has made a remarkable comeback, rising 3.6% on Monday to turn positive for the year after a difficult first quarter. The shares have soared 85% from their low point in early April, buoyed by factors including a recent $1 billion stock purchase by CEO Elon Musk. Despite the rally, the company still faces challenges from an aging electric vehicle lineup, increased competition, and some consumer backlash related to Musk's political activities. The company is attempting to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots.</p>

          <p>Shares of Monopar Therapeutics, a biotech firm, experienced a significant surge of nearly 11% on Monday after the company released promising results from studies of its drug for Wilson disease. The treatment, ALXN1840, demonstrated a sustained neurological benefit for patients with the rare genetic disorder, which impairs the body's ability to regulate copper levels. The positive data supports the company's plan to seek FDA approval in the first quarter of next year. The stock broke out of a cup base, a technical pattern watched by traders.

          <p>With U.S. homeowners holding a record $17.8 trillion in collective home equity, many are considering how to tap into this financial resource. The article explores several primary methods for borrowing a significant sum like $50,000. Options include a home equity loan, which offers a fixed rate and predictable payments, or a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which provides a flexible, revolving credit line. Other methods are a cash-out refinance, which replaces an existing mortgage with a larger one, and a reverse mortgage for seniors over 62. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management (OPM) acted illegally by directing the mass firing of over 25,000 probationary federal employees. U.S. District Judge William Alsup found that the OPM overstepped its authority, as the power to hire and fire rests with individual agencies, not a central office. While the judge determined too much time has passed to reinstate the workers, he ordered most agencies to update the employees' personnel files. The letters must clarify they were not terminated for poor performance, correcting the administration's justification for the firings.</p>

Experts advise taxpayers to be careful to avoid underpayment penalties, suggesting they use "safe harbor" rules by paying at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100-110% of the previous year's.

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel announced that DNA evidence and a text message link suspect Tyler Robinson to the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The text allegedly stated Robinson's intent to "take out" Kirk due to a "hatred for what Charlie stood for." This development comes as Patel faces mounting criticism for his public communications during the high-profile investigation, including a premature announcement of a suspect in custody. Robinson has reportedly not been cooperating with authorities, but more details may emerge when charges are filed.</p>

          <p>A private security guard, who was not authorized to be armed, shot and injured a tourist during an altercation on the Las Vegas Strip. The guard, Deangelo Sneed, told police he was attacked by several people and fired his weapon to stop the victim. However, his employer's policy prohibits guards at that location from carrying firearms, and Sneed does not have a concealed carry permit or formal firearms training. Sneed faces charges including battery with a deadly weapon and carrying a concealed weapon without a permit.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel's frequent and sometimes premature social media updates during the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing have drawn sharp criticism. His posts, including one that incorrectly announced a suspect was in custody, represent a significant departure from the typically cautious communication style of the FBI. Critics, including former agents, argue that this "social media influencer" approach could jeopardize investigations and undermine the bureau's credibility. Patel has defended his actions as a commitment to transparency in a new media landscape, though he is expected to face intense questioning from Congress.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has accused the Trump administration of attempting to bypass U.S. legal obligations by deporting a group of African migrants to Ghana. These individuals have legal protections barring their removal to their home countries, where they fear persecution or torture. Attorneys for the migrants argue that Ghana is now preparing to send them to those very nations, violating diplomatic assurances given to the U.S. Judge Tanya Chutkan called the situation a potential "end-run" around the law and ordered the government to explain its actions, questioning how it could "wash their hands of the matter."</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing war in Gaza, Israel is facing deepening international isolation, prompting questions about whether it is approaching a "South Africa moment" of widespread boycotts and sanctions. Several European nations, including Belgium and Spain, have imposed sanctions, while others plan to recognize a Palestinian state. The EU is also considering suspending parts of its trade agreement with Israel. While some former diplomats believe this pressure is necessary to change Israeli policy, others argue that the staunch support of the U.S. means a true tipping point has not yet been reached.</p>

          <p>President Trump has advocated for public companies to report their earnings every six months instead of the current quarterly requirement. He argues this change would save money and encourage executives to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits to please investors. While many corporate leaders support the idea, some financial experts and investor advocates express concern. They warn that less frequent reporting could reduce transparency, increase market volatility, and potentially create more opportunities for insider trading or accounting fraud by allowing companies to withhold crucial information for longer periods.

          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers are experiencing abrupt and confusing transfers of their accounts to new servicing companies, such as Central Research Inc. (CRI). These transfers can happen with little direct warning, often leading to issues like loans being placed in administrative forbearance without the borrower's request. Experts advise borrowers to save money for payments during the transfer period rather than sending it, as payments can get lost in the transition. It is also recommended to download payment histories from the old servicer and carefully monitor the new account and credit reports for any errors.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates, which recently fell to their lowest point in nearly a year, could drop further this week as the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark rate. Lenders often reduce their rates in anticipation of Fed action, meaning potential homebuyers may already be seeing more favorable offers. While a rate cut seems certain, its size remains a question, with a larger cut potentially leading to a more significant drop in mortgage costs. Experts advise that these lower rates are not guaranteed to last, urging prospective buyers to monitor the market closely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) indicates that onshore wind and utility-scale solar remain the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even before accounting for government subsidies. While the Trump administration has enacted policies favoring fossil fuels and imposing tariffs that raise costs for some renewable components, the fundamental economics still favor renewables due to low operating expenses. Experts note that fossil fuels like natural gas are more expensive to generate but are currently essential for providing reliable backup power. A diverse mix of energy sources is considered necessary to meet rising electricity demands.</p>
