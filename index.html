          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer who went missing has been rescued after spending a night on an uninhabited island miles from the coast. The teenager, Darcy Deefholts, had gone surfing off Wooli and was reported missing when he failed to return home. A large-scale search operation located him the next day on North Solitary Island, approximately seven miles offshore. His father described the successful rescue as a "one in a million miracle," and the surfer is now receiving medical attention after his ordeal.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a stark warning that the nation faces a "rising" and unpredictable threat from Iran. The Intelligence and Security Committee's report highlights an increase in Iranian state-sponsored plots, including assassinations and kidnappings, targeting opponents of the regime within the UK. The committee criticized the government for focusing too much on "crisis management" and urged a more strategic, long-term approach to counter the wide-ranging security threats posed by Tehran. This report covers events up to August 2023 and calls for increased resources to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Dispatch audio from Kerr County, Texas, shows that officials waited 90 minutes to issue an emergency flood alert after a firefighter's initial request. The request was made as the Guadalupe River began to flood, but the first CodeRED alert wasn't sent until much later, with some messages arriving after 10 a.m. This delay occurred during a catastrophic flood event that swept away hundreds of people. The Kerr County Sheriff has declined to comment on the delay, stating an "after-action" review will take place after rescue efforts conclude.</p>

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were safely rescued after a partial collapse in a 7-mile-long industrial tunnel being built under Los Angeles. The workers were approximately 400 feet underground when the cave-in occurred, trapping them between the collapse and the tunnel's end. They managed to climb over the debris to a tunnel boring machine and were then transported to safety with no major injuries reported. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the first responders and the workers' composure during the incident, which is now under investigation.</p>

          <p>Political and business leaders are gathering in Rome for a conference focused on the rebuilding and modernization of Ukraine, even as Russia's attacks continue. The event, co-hosted by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aims to foster public-private partnerships in key sectors like defense, energy, and mining. With the estimated cost of recovery at $524 billion over the next decade, the conference seeks to create a platform for investors to connect with Ukrainian counterparts. The meeting also occurs amid growing uncertainty about the long-term commitment of U.S. aid to Kyiv's defense efforts.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's three-day state visit to the UK, filled with royal pomp and pageantry, is taking place under the shadow of U.S. trade policy. A key topic for discussion between Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is how to handle the Trump administration's unpredictable tariff regime, which poses a significant threat to European economies. While the EU has so far been spared from the latest round of announced tariffs, it remains in limbo as it rushes to negotiate a trade deal with Washington. The visit highlights the complex geopolitical landscape where transatlantic allies must navigate both cooperation and economic pressure.</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, is generating political discussion by shifting the hero's focus from American exceptionalism to a "universal morality." Gunn stated the film is about human kindness and protecting the weak globally, which has led some right-wing commentators to accuse the film of being "woke" and call for a boycott. The article explores the historical context of Superman as a character created by Jewish immigrants and his portrayal as a refugee who defends the vulnerable. This modern interpretation aligns with contemporary debates over immigration and national identity, reflecting the ongoing culture wars in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Volkswagen has reportedly stopped delivering its ID.Buzz electric van to the United States, citing multiple factors for the decision. According to German media, the high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on European-built cars are a significant reason for the pause. Additionally, the model is subject to a recall by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration because its third-row seats do not meet federal safety standards. This halt in deliveries comes as VW reports a nearly 7% drop in its total vehicle sales in North America for the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a robot that successfully performed a realistic gallbladder removal surgery with 100% accuracy. The machine, which uses a machine learning architecture similar to ChatGPT, was trained on videos of human surgeries and was able to adapt to unexpected scenarios and voice commands. This represents a significant advance from previous robotic surgeries, moving from pre-programmed tasks to a system that can understand and autonomously execute complex procedures. While the robot was slower than a human, its performance was comparable to an expert surgeon, marking a major step toward clinically viable autonomous surgery.</p>

The original report found that 16% of 70 female Filipino survivors engaged in "survival sex" with landlords, employers, or acquaintances. Noem used the claim to criticize FEMA's "gross mismanagement" under the previous administration, while the report's author stated the findings should call for improved FEMA response for women's needs.</p>

The West African nation was founded in the 19th century with the aim of relocating freed American slaves, and English has been its lingua franca ever since.

He asserted that protecting the border is a fundamental duty of any nation and wished that President Biden had been more vocal about enforcing the law.

          <p>Vienna is often cited as a model for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social-housing stock, which accounts for 43% of its homes. This system, which caters to a wide range of income levels, results in significantly lower rent prices and helps moderate costs in the private market as well. The foundation for this was laid in the 1920s and is maintained today through political commitment and a levy on employee salaries. While not without challenges, such as a complex allocation system, Vienna's approach demonstrates that long-term political will can prioritize housing as a basic need.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that a 50% tariff on all copper imports will take effect on August 1, 2025, following a national security assessment. In a social media post, Trump justified the move by stating that copper is essential for numerous defense and technology applications, including semiconductors, aircraft, and missile defense systems. The U.S. imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, and experts warn the tariff will lead to shortages and significant price increases for American consumers and businesses.
