          <p>Wiltshire Police have arrested two South Western Ambulance Service workers as part of a major investigation into the deaths of six adults. The inquiry, which began in 2023, has led to arrests on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter and ill-treatment by a care worker. The ambulance service stated it initiated an internal investigation upon learning of the concerns and has been fully cooperating with law enforcement. It reassured the public that this is an isolated situation, with both individuals having been immediately relieved of duties upon the start of the investigation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have initiated a crucial call to finalize a deal concerning the future of TikTok in the United States. The conversation follows the establishment of a deal "framework" earlier in the week, aimed at resolving the ultimatum faced by TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. Under a federal law signed by former President Biden, ByteDance must either divest its American operations or face a nationwide ban. President Trump, who has previously extended the deadline, expressed his desire to keep the popular social media platform operational in the U.S., citing its tremendous value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright recently shared his thoughts on the significant rule changes in Major League Baseball, such as the pitch clock. While he praises the now-shorter game times, calling them "perfect," he misses the strategic pauses and mental gamesmanship that built drama in high-stakes moments. Wainwright also discussed the dual-edged sword of analytics, appreciating how data can refine a pitcher's technique but cautioning against over-reliance on computer-generated advice that ignores the human element of the sport. He believes the ideal approach lies in a balance between old-school intuition and new-school data.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations detailing President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which was enacted in July. The new rule allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 to 2028, with the benefit phasing out for those with incomes over $150,000. Officials clarified that workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and legal services, will not qualify for the deduction. Furthermore, automatically added gratuities will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments from customers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed 2026 budget includes the elimination of all funding for the Migrant Education Program (MEP), a nearly 60-year-old federal initiative. This program provides crucial educational and social support to over 250,000 children of seasonal agricultural workers, helping them overcome disruptions from frequent moves. Advocates and past beneficiaries argue the program is vital for academic success, college readiness, and social integration for a vulnerable population.

          <p>The Metropolitan Police are warning that Jonathan Carl, a man recently jailed for sexual assault and the reckless transmission of HIV, may have hundreds of other victims. Carl was apprehended after two of his victims connected their similar experiences and reported him to the authorities. An investigation uncovered over 400 of his contacts on gay dating apps, with message contents suggesting numerous unreported sexual assaults. Police are urging anyone who may have been targeted by Carl to come forward, as they have already identified and fast-tracked 82 men for NHS health screenings.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace has been accompanied by significant issues, including the sale of counterfeit goods and fraudulent sellers using stolen business identities. In its push to compete with Amazon, Walmart reportedly relaxed its seller vetting processes, making it easier for bad actors to join the platform. The investigation uncovered at least 43 vendors operating under stolen identities and confirmed that tested products, such as health supplements and beauty items, were counterfeit. While Walmart has recently tightened some vetting procedures, the report highlights the risks consumers face on the growing platform.</p>

The session was challenging for McLaren, with Lando Norris crashing into a wall at Turn Four, which broke his car's suspension and ended his run prematurely. Norris described the mistake as "costly," as it prevented him from completing important high-fuel race simulations. His teammate, Oscar Piastri, also had a difficult session with an engine issue and a separate brush with the wall, highlighting a messy start for the championship-leading team.</p>

The relationship came to light after a colleague raised concerns, leading to an investigation that found Breen's contact details in the inmate's cell.

          <p>In response to increased tariffs from the ongoing trade war, retailers are adopting a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce costs for consumers. This strategy involves routing online sales through a third-party "merchant of record," which purchases the goods at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value, rather than the full retail price. Companies using this method report significant savings, allowing them to avoid passing the full tariff costs onto customers and maintain competitive pricing. However, some logistics experts warn this "tariff arbitrage" may not be a scalable long-term solution and could attract future regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old high school student, Kendric Curtis, has died after being shot by an agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. The shooting occurred during a joint investigation involving the ATF and FBI, though authorities have not yet released details about what prompted the incident.

          <p>President Trump's announcement to designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is likely to encounter significant legal challenges, according to experts. The primary hurdle is that the U.S. government currently lacks a legal mechanism to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations, a power that exists only for foreign entities. Furthermore, antifa is not a formal, structured organization but a decentralized movement, making a blanket designation problematic. Critics argue such a move would infringe on First and Fourth Amendment rights, as it could criminalize an ideology rather than specific violent acts, which are already prosecutable under existing laws.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop illegal migration across the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle clarified that the UK Border Force is the agency responsible for policing the nation's borders, although it maintains a working relationship with the navy. He emphasized that the military's primary focus must remain on national defense and addressing key global security issues. The statement came as the UK government continues its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France, aimed at deterring small boat crossings.</p>

Similarly, Jimmy Fallon feigned compliance before his critiques were comically dubbed over with flattering remarks about the president. The collective response from the hosts underscores a significant concern within the entertainment industry about free speech and potential government pressure on media companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's authorization of U.S. Navy strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs from Venezuela is facing criticism for acting outside of legal norms. An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the actions treat a law enforcement issue as an act of war, bypassing congressional approval and established international law regarding the use of force. Legal experts, including those from the Bush administration, caution that such strikes blur the line between crime and war and lack the justification of an imminent threat required for military self-defense. The move has also reportedly worried Pentagon lawyers about the legal implications for the military personnel involved.</p>

The move follows recent tensions, including a lawsuit filed by Ben & Jerry's against Unilever over its stance on the Gaza conflict.

The company has been diversifying its supply chain, moving some production to countries like India and Vietnam to circumvent the levies. Despite this, Apple did report an $800 million hit from tariff-related costs in the previous quarter, affecting other areas of its business.</p>
