          <p>In an interview, Rutger Bregman, author of 'Moral Ambition,' discusses the importance of finding meaning in one's career by contributing to solving the world's pressing issues. Bregman critiques the conventional advice of 'following your passion,' suggesting instead that individuals should identify significant problems and determine how they can make a difference. He emphasizes that personal passion can develop from contributing to important causes and that there is a need for more moral ambition in today's world. The author encourages individuals to join or start groups dedicated to changing the world, even if it means being perceived as unconventional, drawing parallels to historical movements like abolitionism and suffragism. </p>

          <p>Hamas has released Edan Alexander, the last living U.S. citizen held in Gaza, in a move praised by Donald Trump as a 'good faith step' towards ending the conflict. Alexander, a dual national serving in the IDF, was held captive for 584 days. The release occurred without a ceasefire, though Israel paused fighting for the handover, amid warnings of severe famine in Gaza due to an Israeli blockade. In other news, Donald Trump has arrived in Saudi Arabia for a four-day Gulf tour focused on economic deals, accompanied by business leaders including Elon Musk, and the trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs has begun with racketeering and sex-trafficking charges.</p>

          <p>Proposed 'baby bonuses' from the Trump administration to incentivize childbirth have been met with criticism, as many women express concerns about the high cost of raising children in the U.S. Social media users have voiced indignation over the inadequacy of the proposed policies, citing unaffordable childcare, housing, and food costs. Critics argue that the administration's focus on incentivizing childbirth does not address the broader issues of supporting families and ensuring affordable access to essential resources.

          <p>The United States has returned 25 rare smuggled artifacts to Egypt, including sarcophagus lids, a Greco-Roman portrait, and parts of Queen Hatshepsut's temple. The artifacts were recovered following a three-year effort involving Egypt's consulate in New York, the New York District Attorney's Office, and U.S. security agencies. The collection spans centuries of Egyptian civilization and includes jewelry, a granite foot fragment, and a gold coin dating back to Ptolemy I's reign. The antiquities were seized in separate investigations and held at Egypt's consulate in New York until their return. </p>

          <p>Economists are raising concerns about the potential for stagflation in the U.S. economy, characterized by higher unemployment, higher inflation, and slower economic growth. Swiftly shifting tariff policies and the resulting uncertainty are the primary drivers of these fears. Consumers can prepare by paying down high-interest debts and boosting emergency savings. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation, with some expecting potential interest rate cuts if stagflation risks materialize. (not investment advice)</p>
