This move could value the company at as much as $9.2 billion. The IPO follows previous delays in 2024 and earlier in 2025 due to market volatility, but the company is now moving forward amid a recent rebound in the IPO market. StubHub, which plans to trade on the NYSE under the symbol "STUB," reported a 10% revenue growth in the first quarter but also a widening net loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed the $83.3 million judgment awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll in her defamation case against Donald Trump. The three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the damages were "fair and reasonable" given the "extraordinary and egregious facts" of the case. The court rejected Trump's arguments, which included claims of presidential immunity and that the awarded damages were excessive. This decision marks another legal setback for Trump in his long-running legal battles with Carroll, who previously won a $5 million verdict for sexual abuse and defamation.</p>

          <p>House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer stated his investigation into President Joe Biden's use of an autopen for pardons is in its final stages, calling it a "historic scandal." The probe was spurred by a report that senior Justice Department officials had raised concerns about the process, which saw thousands of pardons and commutations granted in Biden's final days in office. While Republicans and Donald Trump have strongly criticized the legitimacy of these actions, a former Biden staffer defended the process, asserting that the pardon power ultimately rests with the president, not the DOJ.</p>

          <p>A survey from the New York Federal Reserve reveals that American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to an all-time low. The August report indicated a mere 44.9% probability of securing new employment after a job loss, the lowest figure since the survey began in 2013. This data signals a significant reversal from the "Great Resignation" era, as a cooling labor market with slowing hiring rates has made workers more hesitant to leave their current positions. The findings align with a recent dismal jobs report, which showed only 22,000 new jobs were added in August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The potentially fatal Chagas disease, transmitted by the "kissing bug," may be becoming endemic in the U.S., according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. While traditionally found in Central and South America, locally acquired human cases have now been reported in eight states, with the insect vector present in 32 states. The disease is caused by a parasite in the bug's feces, which can enter the human body through a bite wound or mucous membranes. While many infected individuals show no symptoms, the chronic phase can lead to severe heart and digestive problems if left untreated.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse this week produced a spectacular "blood moon," visible to skywatchers across Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa. This celestial phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow on the lunar surface. The moon takes on a reddish hue because the only sunlight reaching it is filtered through Earth's atmosphere, which scatters blue light. Photos from around the globe captured the stunning event, which serves as a reminder of the awe-inspiring astronomical displays observable from our planet.

The administration argues that the injunction infringes upon the separation of powers and the president's authority.

Other crucial habits include admitting when you are wrong, which builds trust, and making time for brief, informal conversations that humanize interactions. These behaviors signal warmth, attentiveness, and respect, fostering stronger personal and professional relationships.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team faces a key selection decision for their World Cup quarter-final against Scotland, as star full-back Ellie Kildunne is unavailable due to concussion symptoms. Head coach John Mitchell must choose between the less experienced specialist Emma Sing and the versatile, seasoned utility back Helena Rowland. While Sing offers strong goal-kicking, Rowland's polished performance off the bench against Australia and her experience in high-stakes matches may give her the edge. The decision is critical as the Red Roses enter the knockout stage of the tournament with no room for error.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence has caused some disruption, its overall impact on the broader labor market has been relatively small so far, according to an economist from the job site Indeed. Recent job market weakness is attributed more to general economic uncertainty than to the widespread adoption of AI technologies. Although some companies, particularly in the tech sector, have announced layoffs to pursue AI initiatives, these trends have not yet significantly affected other major industries. Experts suggest that employers may be more inclined to retrain existing workers with AI skills rather than implement mass replacements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump took to his social media platform to commend the West Point Association of Graduates for canceling an award ceremony that was set to honor actor Tom Hanks. Trump labeled Hanks a "destructive, WOKE recipient" and called the cancellation an "important move," suggesting other award shows should follow suit. The West Point association stated the event was canceled to allow the institution to focus on its core mission of preparing cadets for military service. Hanks was to be recognized as an outstanding citizen whose social service exemplifies the academy's ideals of "Duty, Honor, Country."</p>

His appearance, which created long security lines and a heavy federal presence, was seen by critics as a move to project a strongman image and distract from other political issues. Unlike past presidents who attended with a lower profile, Trump's presence was highly visible and disruptive. The negative reception from the multicultural East Coast audience was interpreted by some as a moment of defiance against his polarizing political style.</p>

          <p>The position of quarterback in American football has evolved from a simple on-field role into a cultural touchstone, embodying uniquely American ideals of leadership, innovation, and fame. From Johnny Unitas to Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback has become a figure of national fascination, yet the qualities that define greatness remain mysterious even to those who achieve it. Despite the multi-million dollar industry dedicated to scouting and developing talent, predicting success is notoriously difficult. The role demands not just athletic prowess but the ability to manage immense pressure and public scrutiny, making it one of the most demanding and celebrated positions in modern culture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to popular belief among service members, winning a large lottery jackpot like the Powerball does not result in an automatic discharge from the military. Enlistment contracts remain in effect regardless of a soldier's financial status, and while a voluntary separation can be requested, it is not guaranteed and depends on the needs of the service. Other common myths, such as specific sailors or guardsmen being instantly discharged after winning, are largely unfounded. Similarly, the idea that high-ranking officers need special secretary-level approval to leave is also incorrect, as their resignation or retirement follows standard, albeit more complex, procedures.</p>

Foreign policy experts suggest India is pursuing a strategy of "multi-alignment" and strategic autonomy rather than fully pivoting away from Washington. This diplomatic maneuvering aims to navigate competing global pressures and maintain India's ability to make independent policy choices in an increasingly volatile international landscape.</p>

Critics warn that the deal, which is pending approval from the state's public utilities commission, will lead to increased electricity rates for the utility's 150,000 customers as the private equity firm prioritizes profits. While BlackRock has agreed to a one-year rate freeze and investments in green energy, opponents argue these concessions are insufficient and non-binding. An administrative law judge has already recommended that regulators reject the deal, citing the likelihood of significant rate increases. (not investment advice)</p>
