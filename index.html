          <p>Prince Harry's public plea for reconciliation with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced deep divisions within the royal family, overshadowing the monarch's efforts to project unity. Despite undergoing cancer treatment, King Charles has maintained a busy schedule, but the ongoing rift with Harry, who stepped down from royal duties in 2020, continues to define his reign. Some royal watchers warn that Charles' inability to heal this family divide undermines his messages of tolerance and inclusiveness. Meanwhile, Prince William has taken on a more prominent public role, engaging in diplomatic events and championing initiatives like tackling homelessness and addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has united Iranians across political and ideological divides in condemnation. The Persian Gulf has been known by that name since at least 550 B.C., deeply intertwined with Iranian national and cultural identity. Trump's ability to order changes to geographical names is limited to their use within the United States, and other countries are not obligated to follow suit. This proposal has the potential to negatively impact ongoing nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S., fostering mistrust and emboldening hard-liners within Iran, according to a former Iranian diplomat.</p>

          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland, has become a political influencer due to his fervent support for President Trump, even facing hostility at home. His championing of Trump, who has expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, has made him unpopular among many Greenlanders, but has also opened doors to investors and media attention. Boassen now works for a nonprofit promoting closer ties between the U.S. and Greenland, advocating for a security alliance between an independent Greenland and Washington, viewing Denmark as inadequate for defending the island. Despite some criticism, Boassen believes he is part of something bigger and wants Greenland to seize the opportunity while Trump's attention is focused on the region.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after U.S.-led talks aimed at ending a serious military confrontation, but quickly accused each other of violating the agreement. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri reported repeated violations and accused Pakistan of a border intrusion, while Pakistan's Foreign Ministry blamed Indian forces for initiating the violation. President Trump initially announced the truce, which followed weeks of clashes triggered by a tourist massacre. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. engaged with senior officials to facilitate the ceasefire and encourage talks on a broad set of issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese team has developed an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to perform autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing human capabilities in flight missions. This breakthrough, published in Science Robotics, allows drones to execute high-risk maneuvers previously considered unstable, drawing inspiration from the aerial acrobatics of birds and bats. Gao Fei from Zhejiang University emphasizes that transforming 'high-risk maneuvers' into 'high-survival rewards' redefines traditional drone flight paradigms. Aerobatic flight, as the name suggests, involves high-risk manoeuvres that require unstable postures – movements rarely executed in conventional flight operations for most aircraft.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan expressed caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to alleviate inflation, citing potential strain on state finances. Senior officials within his administration have also been dismissive of such a cut, as the government seeks to formulate an economic package before the House of Councillors election. While opposition parties support a consumption tax cut, Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions on alternative ways to support those in need, also noting that Japan will continue to seek a complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>

Trump noted that a "total reset" was negotiated constructively, with the goal of opening China to American business. These talks mark the first face-to-face contact between senior U.S. and Chinese officials since the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods. While no specific details were provided, the United States is seeking to reduce its trade deficit with China and encourage economic reforms, while China opposes U.S. tariffs and seeks clarity on import demands.</p>

The museum, which relies heavily on Canadian customers, can no longer afford to operate in the U.S. due to increased tariffs on its Chinese-made rubber ducks and the weakened Canadian dollar.

The oral medication zongertinib outperformed the standard treatment option for HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by targeting the HER2 protein and blocking tyrosine kinase activity. Unlike existing intravenous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy, zongertinib carries fewer risks of adverse effects. The study, conducted across 82 sites globally, suggests zongertinib could establish a new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC, according to Professor Wang Xin.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers' perfect record against former Cy Young Award winners ended with a 3-0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite a strong pitching performance from Dustin May. Corbin Burnes of the Diamondbacks pitched seven shutout innings, stifling the Dodgers' offense. May made only two mistakes on a couple first-pitch sinkers over the middle of the plate: One that Corbin Carroll hit for a leadoff triple in the third inning, leading to one run; and another that Eugenio Suárez clobbered for a 455-foot homer in the sixth. The loss also highlighted a troubling trend for the Dodgers, who have struggled against teams with winning records since a strong start to the season.</p>

          <p>As a conflict between India and Pakistan escalated, the Trump administration, initially hesitant to intervene, grew concerned about the potential for nuclear escalation. Evidence of intensifying military engagements, including strikes near Pakistan's nuclear command headquarters, prompted U.S. officials to engage directly with both countries. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio contacted Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, respectively, urging de-escalation and offering to facilitate talks. While a cease-fire was eventually declared, tensions remain high, and the long-term stability of the region is uncertain.</p>

          <p>China's car sales increased for the third consecutive month in April, rising 14.8% year-on-year, driven by government-subsidized auto trade-ins that offset the impact of U.S. tariffs on consumer sentiment. Sales of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids grew significantly, comprising over half of total car sales. While exports declined, domestic buyers are showing less interest in automated-driving systems following a government crackdown on misleading marketing terms and a fatal crash involving a Xiaomi SU7 sedan. The government scheme that hands out larger subsides to trade-ins of old cars for NEVs than for gasoline vehicles had covered 2.71 million cars as of April 24.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego encouraged the Democratic Party to return to its roots as a "big tent" party, arguing that recent election losses were due to excluding individuals with differing viewpoints. Gallego cited podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone "kicked out" of the party for not aligning perfectly with its message. Gallego, who represents a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the need for alliances with those who may not agree 100% of the time. He believes the party needs to focus on empathizing with voters and addressing their economic concerns.</p>

Prosecutors argued that Ryan, an experienced doctor, acted with reckless disregard for Harris' life by providing her with dangerous sedatives, leading to her chemical dependency and eventual death. The case hinged on text messages between Ryan and Harris, revealing his willingness to supply her with drugs despite her struggles with mental health and addiction. Harris' sister, Rachel, played a crucial role in gathering evidence from Sarah's computer, which ultimately led to Ryan's arrest and conviction.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its sources of imported food amid global uncertainties, Southeast Asian nations are becoming increasingly important suppliers, facilitated by overseas investment and cooperative farming initiatives. Yunnan, a southwestern Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a key role in this regional agricultural cooperation. The province's involvement dates back to the “alternative crop cultivation programme,” which aimed to reduce opium production by sharing agricultural technology. Given China’s large demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could serve as an effective way to support the country’s food security by diversifying its food supply sources.</p>

While acknowledging potential concerns, Samii emphasizes that her services are fully clothed, platonic, and nurturing, with strict boundaries and consent protocols. Research suggests that touch can improve physical and mental health, though the relationship between individuals involved is important for realizing these benefits.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by focusing on lower-tier cities, despite challenges from sluggish consumption and intense price competition.
