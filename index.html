          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 890 individuals at a demonstration protesting the UK government's ban on the activist group Palestine Action. The majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization under the Terrorism Act, with others detained for offenses including assaulting police officers. The protest turned violent, according to police, though organizers from Defend Our Juries described the police response as excessive against peaceful demonstrators. The government banned Palestine Action in July after activists damaged military aircraft at an RAF base, making support for the group a criminal offense.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will step down, succumbing to pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party. The decision follows a significant defeat in the July parliamentary election, which cost his ruling coalition its majority in the upper house. Ishiba had initially resisted calls to resign, citing the need for political stability amidst economic challenges and regional tensions, but key party figures urged him to step down to prevent further party division. The LDP is now expected to hold a leadership election in early October to choose his successor.</p>

          <p>A bride-to-be has canceled her fiancé's Las Vegas bachelor party after discovering he used the $3,000 she had saved for their wedding venue deposit to book the trip. The woman shared her story on Reddit, explaining that her fiancé used her money, plus some of his own, and justified it by claiming he would "win it back at the tables." After she canceled the booking tied to her credit card, her fiancé and future mother-in-law reacted angrily, but online commenters and a family therapist largely supported her decision, citing it as a major red flag regarding financial trust.</p>

The victory comes after an embarrassing debut loss to TCU the previous week. Following the game, Belichick also confirmed reports that he had banned a scout from his former team, the New England Patriots, from attending UNC practices. He stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, their personnel are not welcome at his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship with his former employer of nearly 25 years.</p>

          <p>London is experiencing significant travel disruptions as London Underground staff, members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, have begun a five-day strike. The industrial action, the first of its kind since March 2023, is over disputes regarding pay and fatigue management, with the union demanding a 32-hour work week. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the shorter week as unaffordable, leading to little or no service on most Tube lines.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests China's Expansion of Coal Power Serves as a Stabilizer for Renewable Energy Growth</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being a leading exporter of green technology, China is continuing to expand its coal power capacity, a move that appears counterintuitive to its climate goals. However, this strategy is not necessarily a reversal of its climate policy but rather a method to ensure grid stability. As China rapidly adds record amounts of solar and wind power, droughts have reduced hydropower output, creating a reliance on coal during peak demand. In this context, coal-fired plants act as a crucial shock absorber, providing backup power that allows for the aggressive integration of renewables without risking blackouts.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for its decision to ask television partners to refrain from showing any disruptions or negative reactions from the crowd when President Donald Trump appears on screen during the US Open final. Critics have labeled the move cowardly and hypocritical, noting the tournament often televises other on-court and off-court disruptions, such as protests. The USTA defended its request as standard policy to avoid showcasing off-court disturbances, but commentators argue it sanitizes the event's authentic atmosphere and shields a political figure from public disapproval, undermining the democratic nature of crowd expression at sporting events.</p>

The platform expanded from Lithuania to Germany and eventually grew into the global app known as Vinted, which now has over 16 million users in the UK alone.

His statement comes as a new state law allows for prayer time in schools, which many view as an effort to promote Christianity. This stance is contrasted with Paxton's actions in 2017, when he expressed "concerns" over a classroom being used by Muslim students for prayer, suggesting it excluded other faiths. This apparent double standard is seen by critics as consistent with a Christian nationalist agenda that seeks to prioritize one religion over others.</p>

Pulte accused Cook of misrepresenting her primary residence on mortgage applications, a claim her lawyers call a "clerical error."

He suggested that the leadership needs to be more inclusive of different viewpoints within the party and that a new deputy leader from the north of England would help counter a "London centricity."

          <p>This article draws parallels between President Donald Trump's economic strategy and the Peronist policies of mid-20th century Argentina, which led to economic decline. Trump's approach, characterized by high tariffs, import substitution, and direct presidential intervention in corporate affairs, mirrors Juan Perón's model of state control over private enterprise. The analysis points to the administration taking government stakes in companies like Intel and demanding a share of revenue from firms like Nvidia as examples of this trend. This centralization of economic decision-making is described as a departure from market capitalism that risks entrenching cronyism and harming the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

With most companies reporting no tangible impact on earnings from AI, some economists warn we may be in an AI bubble, where investor hype has far outpaced the technology's near-term benefits.

While federal taxes claim about 37% of winnings, some states impose their own income tax, which can exceed 10%, while others have no tax on lottery prizes. States like California, Florida, and Texas are among the most favorable for winners, as they do not tax lottery income.

          <h2>Attorneys for Epstein Survivors Report No Contact from Justice Department Despite Trump's Vow to Investigate</h2>

          <p>Despite President Trump's public commitments to a full investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, attorneys representing approximately 50 of Epstein's survivors state they have not been contacted by the Department of Justice. This lack of outreach casts doubt on the administration's claims of transparency and its efforts to uncover Epstein's network of co-conspirators. The revelation comes amid continued political pressure on Trump regarding his own past association with Epstein. Critics argue that ignoring the victims while engaging with figures like Ghislaine Maxwell suggests the government is more interested in controlling the narrative than conducting a thorough investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are using deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of all borrowers now in one of these statuses. While these tools can be crucial for preventing default and its severe credit consequences, they come with significant costs. Interest often continues to accrue during forbearance, which can substantially increase a borrower's total debt over time. Consumer advocates advise that while these pauses offer temporary relief, borrowers should explore income-driven repayment plans first, as they can provide affordable monthly payments while still allowing progress toward eventual loan forgiveness.

          <p>As surveillance technology like drones, camera traps, and environmental DNA sensors becomes ubiquitous, humans are gaining an unprecedented, real-time view of the animal kingdom, raising new ethical questions. While this monitoring aids conservation, it also intrudes upon animals' lives, potentially causing stress, altering behavior, or even leading to harm. Philosophers are now debating whether animals have a right to privacy, pointing to behaviors that suggest a preference for seclusion, such as avoiding cameras or seeking private spaces for mating. The constant observation of animals, particularly pets and those in zoos, forces a reconsideration of the boundaries and respect owed to non-human creatures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's aggressive deportation campaign, combined with historically low U.S. birth rates, could lead to the first recorded annual population decline in American history. With natural increase (births minus deaths) at a slim margin, a significant drop in net immigration due to mass deportations and stricter border policies could tip the balance into negative growth. Economists warn that such a population shrinkage would have severe consequences for key sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, which are heavily reliant on immigrant labor. This could lead to labor shortages, higher prices, and a strain on services for an aging population.</p>

          <p>Known as the "silent killer," hypertension affects over half of Americans by age 40, often without symptoms, significantly increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New recommendations from the American Heart Association advocate for earlier intervention, including lifestyle changes and medication, once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. Experts stress that early treatment can add years of healthy life by protecting small blood vessels in the brain and reducing cardiovascular strain. Lifestyle strategies like a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction are the first line of defense, with medication recommended for those with persistently high readings.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is exploring the use of more military sites to accommodate asylum seekers as part of its strategy to move people out of costly hotels. Defence Secretary John Healey confirmed that officials are assessing both military and other non-military locations for temporary housing. This initiative aims to accelerate the plan to end the reliance on hotels, which has become a source of public and political tension, with over 32,000 asylum seekers currently housed in them. The move comes as the government faces the challenge of a record number of migrant crossings over the English Channel, prompting an "all of government effort" to address the issue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term is marked by a chaotic yet systematic assault on established economic norms, which could leave the U.S. economic model unrecognizable. His administration has combined high tariffs with direct interventions, such as taking government stakes in tech companies like Intel and demanding revenue shares from others like Nvidia, while simultaneously attacking the independence of the Federal Reserve. This approach dismantles the post-2008 "Washington consensus" by blending deregulation with unprecedented state control over corporate America. While the AI-fueled stock market has remained buoyant, the radical uncertainty created by this unpredictable style of economic management poses increasing risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has invalidated the state's Republican-drawn congressional map, ruling that the GOP-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of the voters. In 2018, Utah citizens approved a proposition to create an independent redistricting commission, but lawmakers ignored its work and passed their own heavily gerrymandered map in 2021. This map effectively diluted the votes of the Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County by splitting it among four different districts. The ruling is a significant victory for anti-gerrymandering advocates and a rare pushback against the trend of state legislatures ignoring voter-led initiatives to pursue partisan advantages in redistricting.</p>
