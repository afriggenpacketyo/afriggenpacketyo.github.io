          <p>Snap's stock dropped over 15% following its Q2 earnings report, which revealed that global average revenue per user fell short of analyst expectations. The company cited issues with an advertising platform update, the timing of Ramadan, and trade policy changes as factors impacting its growth. Despite missing on key revenue metrics and reporting a net loss of $262.6 million, Snap's daily active users exceeded forecasts, and the company provided a third-quarter revenue outlook that was ahead of Wall Street estimates. The report also announced the departure of its senior VP of engineering. (not investment advice)</p>

Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, spoke with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for nine hours over two days at her own request. The Trump administration is reportedly considering a public release of the interview transcripts and audio recordings. This development occurs as Maxwell is appealing her conviction to the Supreme Court and the president has not ruled out a potential pardon for her.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker AMD reported second-quarter earnings that slightly missed analyst estimates, causing its stock to dip in after-hours trading. While overall revenue surpassed expectations, driven by strong performance in its Client and Gaming segment, the company's AI business revenue saw a decline due to U.S. export restrictions on sales to China. CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in the competitiveness of AMD's new AI chips against rivals like Nvidia and provided a positive sales forecast for the upcoming quarter.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the goal is to replace the current case-by-case waiver system with a more streamlined regulatory framework to foster innovation. The proposed rules would require commercial drones to meet industry safety standards, include collision avoidance technology, and prohibit flights over large crowds. The move is intended to create a common standard and move away from the current unregulated environment for drone usage.</p>

          <p>A congressional committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case. The bipartisan panel is examining the federal government's handling of the Epstein investigation and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The subpoenas also target former attorneys general and FBI directors.

          <p>California wildlife officials are investigating a disturbing phenomenon where wild pigs in Monterey County have been found with bright blue muscle and fat tissue. The coloration is believed to be caused by the pigs consuming anticoagulant rodenticide, a poison used in agriculture to control pests like squirrels. Officials are warning hunters and the public not to consume meat from any animal showing these signs, as the poison can be transferred through secondary exposure.

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the fatal Titan submersible implosion has concluded that the tragedy was "preventable" and that owner OceanGate used "intimidation tactics" to avoid regulatory oversight. The report found that the vessel's design was inadequate, and the company continued operations despite the hull being compromised in prior incidents. The investigation also described a "toxic" safety culture where employees who raised concerns were threatened with termination. The report states that had CEO Stockton Rush, who was killed in the implosion, survived, a criminal investigation for negligence would have been recommended.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell have filed a motion opposing the Department of Justice's effort to unseal grand jury transcripts from her case. Her lawyers argue that releasing the testimony would violate grand jury secrecy and prejudice her due process rights, especially as her appeal is pending before the Supreme Court. They distinguish her situation from that of the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Maxwell is alive and her legal options are still viable. The DOJ has stated that much of the information in the transcripts was already made public during the trial.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) plans to enter negotiations with the federal government after several agencies froze approximately $339 million in research grants. The administration has accused UCLA of violating civil rights laws related to antisemitism, race in admissions, and transgender athletes. The grant suspensions affect hundreds of projects in fields like neuroscience and cancer research. While UCLA administrators have expressed hope for a resolution through talks, hundreds of faculty members have signed a petition urging the university system to challenge what they call the administration's "illegitimate and bad-faith demands."</p>

Rodriguez allegedly shot and killed Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim outside the Capitol Jewish Museum in May. To secure a hate crime conviction, prosecutors will need to prove the attack was motivated by antisemitism, not just political opposition to Israel. Following the shooting, Rodriguez was recorded shouting pro-Palestinian slogans and reportedly told police he "did it for Palestine."</p>

          <p>Justin Baldoni, the director of the film "It Ends With Us," is suing three of the movie's insurance companies for breach of contract. The lawsuit alleges the insurers have wrongfully refused to cover the legal expenses from a lawsuit filed by his co-star, Blake Lively. Lively's original suit accuses Baldoni and his production company of sexual harassment and retaliation, which he has denied in a countersuit. This new legal action against the insurers adds another layer to the high-profile dispute, as Baldoni seeks to compel them to honor policies that he claims should cover the mounting litigation fees.</p>

Both Hassett, a former economic advisor, and Warsh, a former Fed governor, have advocated for lower interest rates. The comments come as a vacancy on the Fed's Board of Governors opens up, allowing Trump to appoint a new member. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether a $10,000 deposit earns more in a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. While a top high-yield savings account currently offers a slightly higher rate and thus marginally more interest, its rate is variable and could fall. A CD, in contrast, locks in a fixed rate for the term, providing guaranteed returns but sacrificing liquidity. Given potential for future interest rate cuts, the article suggests the security of a locked-in CD rate might be more advantageous than the minimal extra earnings from a variable-rate savings account.
