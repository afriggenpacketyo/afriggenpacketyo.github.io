          <p>A man identified as Fernando Ramirez, 29, was arrested after allegedly intentionally plowing his car into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 people, with seven in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday after a fight broke out. Following the crash, bystanders reportedly attacked the driver, who was found to have been shot by an unknown assailant who then fled the scene. Police are investigating the crash as an assault with a deadly weapon and are searching for the person who shot the driver.</p>

          <p>Violent sectarian clashes in southern Syria's Suweida province have persisted despite a ceasefire announcement, with over 900 reported deaths in the past week. The conflict between Druze fighters and Bedouin gunmen has drawn in government forces and prompted military intervention from Israel in support of the Druze. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for an end to the violence and for accountability for atrocities committed by all sides. The fighting erupted following the abduction of a Druze merchant, escalating long-running tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu suffered a seventh-round technical knockout defeat to American Sebastian Fundora in their world title rematch in Las Vegas. This marks Tszyu's third loss in his last four fights, placing his international career at a crossroads. Fundora dominated early, dropping Tszyu in the first round and opening a cut above his eye in the second. Despite a courageous effort, Tszyu was unable to overcome Fundora's significant height and reach advantage, ultimately informing his corner he could not continue after the seventh round.</p>

          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey, after her first trial ended in a hung jury. Her defense claimed the shooting was an accident that occurred while they were playfully mimicking an Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny cartoon, leading her to believe the gun was unloaded. Prosecutors argued she intentionally shot her sleeping husband twice in the head, with forensics experts challenging the feasibility of her "fan firing" explanation with the double-action revolver used. The second trial resulted in a conviction and a sentence of 40 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>The 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was solved using modern technology after her boyfriend, initially the prime suspect, was exonerated by his Fitbit data. The device's activity log confirmed he was home during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA from the crime scene to identify a new suspect, George Steven Burch. Burch's location data from his phone's Google Dashboard placed him at the crime scene, where the body was found, and near where her clothes were discarded, leading to his conviction for first-degree intentional homicide.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has introduced a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all visitors requiring nonimmigrant visas, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is paid upon visa issuance. While a reimbursement mechanism is included for visitors who comply with their visa terms, such as not overstaying, the process is unclear and expected to be lengthy. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimates the fee will generate nearly $29 billion in revenue over the next decade, as few are expected to seek reimbursement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Use of "Snus" Nicotine Pouches Surges Among UK Youth, Raising Health Concerns</h2>

          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as snus, is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, with use among 16 to 24-year-olds nearly quadrupling since 2022. These discreet pouches, sold without age restrictions, can contain extremely high levels of nicotine, leading to addiction and severe gum damage. Health professionals and Trading Standards officers are expressing alarm over the trend and the lack of regulation. A proposed Tobacco and Vapes Bill aims to make it illegal to sell these products to individuals under 18 to combat the growing public health issue.</p>

          <h2>UK Government's "Great British Energy" School Solar Panels Were Manufactured in China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initiative by the UK government to install "Great British Energy solar panels" on schools has sourced its first batch of panels from two Chinese firms, Aiko and Longi. This has drawn criticism from some MPs due to concerns about potential links to forced labor in China's solar panel supply chains, particularly in the Xinjiang region. While the government claims the scheme complies with modern slavery rules, critics argue that taxpayer money should support domestic or ethically-sourced manufacturing. The Chinese firms involved state they forbid forced labor in their supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of drivers at UK airports, such as Edinburgh, are parking in nearby lay-bys and side streets to avoid paying increasingly high "kiss-and-fly" drop-off fees. Research shows that over half of the UK's busiest airports have increased these charges, with some now costing £6 or more for a brief 10-minute stay. This practice forces drivers to coordinate pick-ups via phone and have passengers walk to meet them, all to circumvent fees that many consider exorbitant. The industry body notes that free drop-off zones are available, but they are often located much further from the terminals.</p>

          <p>Russia is conducting a systematic campaign in occupied Ukrainian territories to erase Ukrainian identity and instill pro-Russian sentiment in children. This effort involves rewriting the school curriculum, using Russian textbooks that justify the war, and forcing participation in patriotic events. Organizations like the Russian defense ministry's "Youth Army" are establishing branches to provide military-style training. Furthermore, thousands of Ukrainian children have been taken on tours of Russia or forcibly deported to "re-education camps," actions that are banned by international law and have led to an ICC arrest warrant for President Putin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK over shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday, with proponents arguing it could help prevent learning loss and ease childcare burdens for working parents. Some school districts are already adopting a five-week summer break with a longer two-week half-term in October. However, the proposal is divisive; while some parents are in favor, many teachers oppose it, viewing the long break as essential for recharging and planning. The potential impact on holiday costs is also a key factor, with uncertainty over whether a shorter summer would raise or lower prices.</p>

          <p>The surging global demand for lithium, essential for electric car batteries and renewable energy storage, is causing a severe environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama salt flats. The extraction process, which involves pumping vast quantities of brine, is depleting water resources in the arid region, harming local ecosystems and the indigenous communities who depend on them. Residents report drying wetlands, shrinking lagoons, and a decline in flamingo populations. While mining companies are piloting new, less impactful technologies, locals remain skeptical, questioning if the global transition to green energy is coming at their community's expense.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a shift in public mindset from risk-averse saving to investing, suggesting that savers are missing out on financial rewards. The government plans to encourage people with money in low-interest cash accounts to consider stocks and shares, potentially through targeted messages and new ad campaigns. While a proposal to cut the tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) has faced backlash, the idea has not been completely ruled out. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and caution that pushing inexperienced savers into volatile markets could backfire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After years of growth fueled by China's economic rise, interest in learning Mandarin is waning in the United States and other Western nations.

This "huge shift" reflects changing geopolitical landscapes and perceptions of China.
