          <p>An aid ship named Madleen, carrying climate activist Greta Thunberg among others, was reportedly boarded by Israeli troops as it attempted to break the blockade of Gaza. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition stated that communication was jammed and an irritant substance was sprayed, with the Israeli military instructing the vessel to change course. Israeli officials claim the blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas and offered to deliver aid through established channels. A photo posted by the activists showed people in life jackets with their hands up, though independent verification of the event remains pending. Optimism surrounding the prospect of this event unfolding peacefully is low.</p>

          <p>Following days of clashes between law enforcement and protesters over immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, National Guard troops arrived in the city. Protests escalated, leading to the use of tear gas and non-lethal rounds by the National Guard near the Metropolitan Detention Center. President Trump announced the deployment in response to what he called "two days of violence, clashes, and unrest," while Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory" and requested the troops' removal. The situation remains tense as protests continue, with some demonstrators blocking the 101 Freeway and vandalizing vehicles.</p>

          <p>Nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, raising the possibility of further industrial action. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the award as inadequate, setting the stage for a potential strike ballot. According to the RCN, nursing staff in England have faced over a decade of pay erosion, leading to increased resignations. Ministers announced the pay awards following review body recommendations, including a 5.4% average increase for resident doctors and 4% for consultants, but the RCN argues that nursing has been placed at the "back of the queue".</p>

          <p>A Mossad operation targeting Hezbollah with explosive pagers and walkie-talkies significantly weakened the Iranian-backed group, leading to the assassination of its leader and the disruption of its command structure. This operation, along with subsequent Israeli airstrikes, led to a ceasefire and a shift in the regional balance of power. Analysts suggest that Hezbollah's losses have undermined Iran's proxy war strategy, impacting its influence in Lebanon and Syria. The events have forced Iran to reconsider its approach to regional security and its reliance on proxy forces.</p>

          <p>British energy firms are being paid substantial sums to curtail power generation due to grid capacity limitations, raising concerns about rising energy bills. Wind farms like Moray East and West are compensated for turning down output when the grid cannot handle the electricity. Octopus Energy estimates that balancing the grid in this way has cost the country over Â£500 million this year alone. The government is considering regional pricing to improve efficiency and lower costs, but the move faces opposition from energy firms and political opponents, and the long-term impact on consumer bills remains uncertain.
