          <p>Former President Donald Trump addressed the possibility of a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. While stating he is allowed to grant clemency, Trump said it is something he has not thought about and deflected questions by suggesting focus should be on others associated with Epstein. This comes as Maxwell has been meeting with Justice Department officials, with her lawyer stating she has been answering all questions truthfully.</p>

This article explains the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which requires three criteria to be met: at least 20% of households facing extreme food lack, 30% of children suffering acute malnutrition, and a death rate of at least two adults per 10,000 daily. The difficulty in collecting reliable data in a conflict zone, especially on non-trauma mortality, presents a major hurdle to an official declaration.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that deportation flights have begun from a controversial immigration detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz.' The state is collaborating with federal authorities to increase immigration arrests and expand the tent-based facility's capacity to hold up to 4,000 individuals. This move is part of a broader effort to 'surge' enforcement, though it comes amid reports from detainees about poor and unsanitary conditions at the site.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's trip to Scotland is primarily a taxpayer-funded visit to promote his private business interests, specifically his golf resorts. The author contends that the trip, which includes the dedication of a new course named for his mother, is the latest example of Trump exploiting the presidency for personal profit. This behavior is part of a broader pattern of using government resources for visits to his properties, which charge the government for expenses.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice under the Trump administration has reversed course on police reform by ending federal consent decrees and investigations in several cities, including Louisville and Minneapolis. These agreements were designed to hold law enforcement agencies with patterns of misconduct accountable for implementing systemic changes. Community activists and civil rights groups have condemned the move as a significant setback for police accountability, though some local officials have vowed to continue reforms independently.</p>
