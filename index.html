          <p>An early morning explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood resulted in the collapse of three rowhomes, killing one person and injuring two others. The blast, which occurred around 5 a.m., caused significant damage to adjacent buildings and vehicles, prompting the evacuation of local residents. Officials have launched an extensive search and rescue operation, with fire department personnel, police, and the ATF investigating the cause. The investigation is expected to be a slow, methodical process as crews work to determine the origin of the explosion while ensuring the stability of the remaining structures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary highlights a significant ideological shift, particularly concerning views on Israel. As an outspoken critic of Israel's government and a supporter of the BDS movement, his success in a city with a large Jewish population has caused both alarm and celebration. The outcome reflects a growing divide among Democratic voters, especially younger progressives, who are increasingly critical of Israel's actions in Gaza and are separating anti-Israel sentiment from antisemitism. This election is seen by some as a bellwether for national Democratic politics, indicating that pro-Palestinian stances are no longer a disqualifier.</p>

          <p>An early summer heatwave is causing record-breaking temperatures across Europe, with Spain hitting a new national June high of 46Â°C (114.8Â°F). Multiple countries, including Portugal, Italy, and Greece, have issued high alerts, with authorities warning of wildfire risks and advising citizens to take precautions. The extreme heat is expected to continue, reaching cities like London and Berlin in the coming days. Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of these heatwaves to human-driven climate change, noting a significant rise in such events since the year 2000, which is also impacting local wildlife.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated that if Zohran Mamdani is elected mayor of New York City, he must "do the right thing" or risk the city losing federal funding. In a Fox News interview, Trump extended this threat to any future NYC mayor, asserting that they will have to "behave themselves" to avoid severe financial consequences from the federal government under his potential presidency. Trump has repeatedly labeled Mamdani, a democratic socialist, a communist, a characterization Mamdani rejects. This is not the first time Trump has threatened to use federal funding as leverage against political opponents.</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment program within a matter of months following recent U.S. military strikes. In a television interview, Grossi noted that while the targeted facilities suffered severe damage, Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity for nuclear technology. This assessment appears to contrast with the Trump administration's claims of having "totally obliterated" the facilities. Grossi emphasized the importance of resuming dialogue and allowing international inspectors back into the country to ensure a technically sound and peaceful resolution.</p>

The case involved two lengthy trials, with the first ending in a hung jury and a mistrial.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is considering compelling journalists to reveal their sources for leaked intelligence that questioned the effectiveness of recent U.S. military strikes on Iran. In a Fox News interview, Trump threatened prosecution for both the reporters and their sources if they do not comply, condemning the reporting from outlets like CNN and The New York Times as "unpatriotic." The leaked Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggested the strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by months, contrasting with Trump's claims of obliteration. This move raises significant First Amendment questions regarding reporter's privilege and freedom of the press.</p>

Despite its strong opening and positive audience scores, the movie's high budget of over $200 million means it still has a long road to profitability.

Germany's Nick Woltemade stood out as the tournament's top scorer and joint-top assister, continuing his impressive form from his season with Stuttgart. England's Charlie Cresswell, a defender for Toulouse, was a defensive rock, leading the competition in ball recoveries and demonstrating impressive composure.

He specifically called the phrase "Globalizing the Intifada" unacceptable. In the same interview, Jeffries expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's claims regarding the Iran strikes and criticized a recent Supreme Court decision on birthright citizenship as "reckless."</p>

          <p>Lando Norris secured his third victory of the season at the Austrian Grand Prix, holding off a persistent challenge from his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri. The one-two finish for McLaren narrows the championship gap between the two drivers to just 15 points. The race was dominated by the McLaren duo, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing a distant third. The event was disastrous for Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who was knocked out of the race on the first lap after a collision with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli. Antonelli apologized for the incident but received a three-place grid penalty for the upcoming British Grand Prix.</p>

When asked what should happen to these U.S.-born children, Mullin argued against separating families, stating, "they should go where their parents are."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States is critically vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems. China's control over the global supply chain, accounting for over 90% of refining capacity, allows it to weaponize this dependence, as seen with recent export controls. The author contends that despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to create a coherent strategy to build an independent supply chain. The piece calls for a sustained, bipartisan national strategy that treats critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power, requiring investment, permitting reform, and strong international partnerships.

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to dismantle federal energy efficiency regulations, including the popular Energy Star program. Following an executive order, the Department of Energy and the EPA are preparing to eliminate or modify dozens of rules governing appliances like dishwashers, light bulbs, and toilets. While the administration claims these standards drive up costs, consumer groups and some manufacturers argue they save households money on utility bills and provide crucial comparison information. The potential rollback of these standards, established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, faces resistance and the prospect of legal challenges based on anti-backsliding provisions in the law.</p>

A recent Justice Department memo suggested a president has the authority to rescind such designations, setting the stage for a legal battle.

          <p>Automaker Lotus has reassured the UK business secretary that it has no plans to close its factory in Hethel, Norfolk, following an urgent meeting on Sunday. The discussion was prompted by reports that the company's Chinese owner, Geely, was considering moving production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, a move that would risk 1,300 jobs. Lotus had previously paused production due to a 25% U.S. tariff on car imports. The UK government stated it was reassured by management's commitment to its UK operations, and Lotus insisted that Britain remains the heart of its brand, even as it explores strategic options for global competitiveness.</p>

          <h2>USPS Issues Warning About 'Brushing' Scams Involving Unsolicited Packages</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is warning Americans about "brushing" scams, where people receive unsolicited packages containing low-value items they didn't order. This scheme is used by third-party sellers to post fake "verified" reviews to boost their product ratings. However, receiving such a package is a red flag that your personal information, including your name and address, has been compromised. Experts warn this could be a precursor to broader identity theft or financial fraud. The USPS advises anyone who receives a mystery package to report it to the Postal Inspection Service, audit their financial accounts, and update their passwords.</p>
