          <p>A Champions Cup rugby match between Sale and Toulouse was delayed by 40 minutes after a parachutist became stuck on the stadium roof. Captain Yannick Trouillet, one of the paratroopers delivering the match ball, veered off course and his parachute snagged in the stadium's awning. Stadium staff and Toulouse's mascot worked together to free Trouillet, ensuring his safety with post protectors and an inflatable rugby pitch. The incident added an unexpected twist to the start of the highly anticipated match.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended President Trump's new tariffs as a national security imperative, arguing that the U.S. needs to protect domestic industries and stop other countries from "ripping us off." In a "Face the Nation" interview, Lutnick dismissed concerns about market panic, asserting that the tariffs are necessary to reset global trade and bring manufacturing back to America. He stated that the administration intends to protect companies investing in the U.S. and ensure American workers benefit from reindustrialization.&#x20; ‹br›‹i›(not investment advice)‹/i›</p>

          <p>Several legacy media outlets are now covering scandals that have long been alleged against leading Democrats, including Hunter Biden's dealings with Burisma and President Biden's mental decline. This shift comes after years of these claims being dismissed or downplayed by many in the media, who are now facing increased scrutiny over their past reporting. A newly released book also examines Biden's cognitive abilities leading up to the election, which led to a decline in the polls and Biden dropping out of the race in July. The change in coverage raises questions about media bias and the timing of these investigations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered all national parks to remain open, despite significant staffing shortages, sparking concerns from conservation groups. The order requires approval from top officials before any park closures or reduced hours, a move criticized as micromanagement that undermines the expertise of park staff. With record visitation numbers and reduced staff, the decision raises concerns about visitor safety, park maintenance, and the protection of natural resources. Critics argue that this decision prioritizes appearances over the well-being of the parks and those who work to maintain them.</p>
