          <p>The city of Evanston, a suburb of Chicago, has issued a warning to its residents about the potential presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the coming days. This alert follows President Trump's continued threats of an immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment in the Chicago area. The Department of Homeland Security announced "Operation Midway Blitz," an enforcement action targeting the region, prompting local officials to advise residents on their rights. The city has affirmed its commitment to protecting its immigrant and refugee communities amid the heightened tension.</p>

          <p>France's government has been ousted after Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a parliamentary confidence vote he initiated, marking a significant political crisis for the nation. The vote, which failed 364-194, was a gamble by Bayrou to gain support for his unpopular budget plans aimed at slashing public spending. This development forces President Emmanuel Macron to find his fourth prime minister in just twelve months, creating further legislative uncertainty for Europe's second-largest economy. The political instability stems from Macron's 2024 decision to call a snap election that resulted in a fractured parliament with no clear majority.</p>

          <p>Ticket resale marketplace StubHub is aiming for a valuation of up to $9.2 billion in its much-anticipated initial public offering. The company plans to sell over 34 million shares at a price range of $22 to $25 each, seeking to raise as much as $851 million. This move comes after previous IPO plans were paused due to market volatility, including concerns over President Trump's tariffs. StubHub, which will trade on the NYSE under the symbol "STUB," reported a 10% revenue increase in the first quarter, signaling a potential rebound in the IPO market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary order allowing President Donald Trump to proceed with the termination of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter. The brief order, penned by Chief Justice John Roberts, puts a hold on lower court rulings that had reinstated the Biden-appointed commissioner. This case is a significant test of executive power, challenging the 90-year-old precedent from Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which limits a president's ability to fire commissioners of independent agencies without cause. The legal battle has created a back-and-forth situation for Slaughter, who has been fired and rehired through various court decisions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration, allowing federal agents to continue conducting widespread immigration raids in the Los Angeles area for the time being. The 6-3 decision lifts a lower court's order that had barred agents from making stops based solely on factors like race or language without "reasonable suspicion." This ruling is a significant development in President Trump's stated goal of carrying out record-level deportations of undocumented migrants. The court's liberal justices dissented, arguing that the decision could jeopardize constitutional freedoms by permitting stops with insufficient cause.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,600 per ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets due to growing global instability. This represents a significant climb of over 38% since the beginning of 2025, prompting questions about whether it is too late for new investors to enter the market. Despite the peak prices, some financial analysts remain bullish, with firms like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan forecasting that gold could reach $4,000 by mid-2026. The rally is supported by signs of a weakening labor market and the potential for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Roger Blevins Jr., frontman for the band Mingo Fishtrap, is back on stage after a 2022 tongue cancer diagnosis forced him to halt his career. Following surgery that removed most of his tongue and reconstructed it with tissue from his thigh, Blevins had to relearn how to speak and sing. Now celebrating a year with no evidence of disease, he has returned to performing and credits his medical team with saving not only his life but also his passion for music. Inspired by their journey, Blevins and his wife have launched a nonprofit called "The Tough Crowd Project" to help other families facing cancer.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after his murder, Germany is reflecting on the killing of Enver Simsek, a Turkish-born florist who was the first of ten victims of the neo-Nazi terror group National Socialist Underground (NSU). For over a decade, his family was wrongly suspected by investigators, enduring humiliation until the NSU's existence was revealed in 2011. Simsek's daughter, Semiya, has recently co-authored a book detailing the family's pain and the systemic failures of the investigation. The case continues to raise critical questions about how a far-right terror cell could operate undetected in Germany for so many years.</p>

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood soared more than 14% on Monday after S&P Global announced the company will be added to the prestigious S&P 500 index. The long-speculated inclusion, which will officially occur before trading on September 22, is a significant milestone for the company. Being added to the benchmark index often acts as a major catalyst for a stock, as passive index funds are required to purchase its shares. The news marks a high point for Robinhood, whose stock has risen over 210% year-to-date after a volatile period following its 2021 IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Amber Alert for a one-year-old boy has been canceled after he was safely rescued in Arizona. The infant, Enzo Antonescu, was allegedly kidnapped at a Target store in Southern California by his father, Dragan Antonesco, who reportedly held the child's mother at knifepoint. The father's parents are also accused of assaulting the mother and participating in the kidnapping. Authorities say an Arizona state trooper recognized the family's vehicle from the alert and conducted a traffic stop, leading to the child's recovery and the arrest of the three suspects who were allegedly en route to Chicago.</p>

His comments came as AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla, also speaking at the event, expressed confidence that his party would win the 2029 federal election.

The acquisition of valuable AWS-4 and H-block licenses will significantly boost the capabilities of SpaceX's Starlink satellite network to provide direct-to-cell service for standard mobile phones globally. This move positions Elon Musk's company to potentially launch its own mobile services, building on its existing partnership with T-Mobile. The cash-and-stock deal also provides financial and regulatory relief for EchoStar, which owns the struggling Dish Network and has been under pressure to utilize its spectrum assets.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has stated that the government could suspend visas for citizens of countries that do not cooperate with migrant return agreements. She emphasized that securing the UK's borders is her "top priority" and that more coordinated action is being discussed among the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. The potential policy would target nations that refuse to take back their own citizens who have no legal right to be in the UK. This statement comes as the government faces mounting pressure over a 37% increase in small boat crossings over the Channel compared to last year.</p>

          <p>Amid a weakening U.S. job market, financial experts are offering guidance for the more than 40 million Americans with student loans who may be facing unemployment. For federal loan borrowers, options like income-driven repayment (IDR) plans can lower monthly payments, potentially to zero, based on current income including unemployment benefits. Deferment and forbearance options can also temporarily pause payments, although interest may still accrue on some loans. Those with private student loans have fewer standard options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to inquire about available hardship assistance programs.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has announced he will move to change the chamber's rules to overcome Democratic obstruction and speed up the confirmation of President Trump's executive branch nominees. Republicans argue the move is necessary due to an "unprecedented blockade" by Democrats, who have forced time-consuming procedural votes on nearly every nominee. The proposed change, which could be voted on this week, would likely allow for voting on large groups of non-controversial nominees at once. This action represents the latest escalation in the long-running partisan battles over presidential appointments in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Following his dominant sixth Grand Slam victory at the US Open, 22-year-old Carlos Alcaraz is already being compared to the greatest players in tennis history. The Spaniard is the youngest player since Bjorn Borg to win six major titles and is one of only four men ever to have won at least two Grand Slams on all three surfaces: clay, grass, and hard court. His performance in New York was particularly remarkable for its serving prowess, as he hit the fastest serve of the final and faced the fewest break points of any Grand Slam winner since 1991.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates a significant ideological shift among Democrats, with 66% now holding a positive view of socialism compared to only 42% who view capitalism favorably. While U.S. adults overall still prefer capitalism, its popularity has declined since 2010, particularly among Democrats under 50. The survey suggests this trend is driven by a growing sense of economic unfairness and a more negative perception of big business. This evolving sentiment presents a strategic challenge for the Democratic party, highlighting internal divisions on whether to embrace socialist ideas or maintain a more centrist economic platform.</p>
