        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, saw a second night of violent disorder as fireworks, bottles, and petrol bombs were thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. The unrest, described by police as "racially motivated," included the setting of cars on fire and smashing windows of homes, some marked with residents' nationalities. This violence followed a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault, with a 29-year-old man already charged in connection to the initial unrest. Politicians have condemned the violence, urging reflection and cessation of the destructive actions that are harming the town and its residents. The situation has raised concerns about community tensions and the exploitation of such issues by some politicians.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has released a legal opinion asserting that President Trump has the authority to abolish national monuments, reversing a previous determination that such monuments are irreversible. This opinion challenges the Antiquities Act and could allow the administration to alter or eliminate protections for historical and archaeological sites. The opinion specifically targets two monuments designated by President Biden: Chuckwalla National Monument and Sáttítla Highlands National Monument. Environmental groups have criticized this move, arguing it undermines public land protections, while supporters claim it allows for better management of resources and critical mineral mining.</p>

The protest follows controversial laws passed by Orbán's government, including restrictions on LGBTQ+ events and measures allowing for facial recognition technology at demonstrations.

          <p>The US defense sector's dependence on China for critical minerals, essential for advanced weapon systems, is a growing concern as Beijing tightens export restrictions. China dominates the global supply of rare earths and other critical minerals, giving it leverage in trade negotiations and potentially impacting US military readiness. These elements are crucial for manufacturing precision-guided missiles, fighter jets, and advanced radar systems. The export restrictions make the US defense industry more vulnerable, limiting access to both materials and the technology needed to build independent capacity.</p>

This decision, driven by a shortage of healthy starting pitchers and an overworked bullpen, signals a strategic punt on the game.

Under this process, the bases won't be formally named after Confederates who took up arms against the U.S. during the Civil War, but instead after other service members who share similar names. The Trump administration changed back the names of Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, and Fort Benning, in Georgia, and Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll will now "take immediate action" to rename the other seven bases. These latest renamings will unwind a process overseen by the Naming Commission, a panel that was created by Congress in the final days of the first Trump term.</p>
