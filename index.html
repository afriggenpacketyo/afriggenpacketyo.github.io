          <h2>Early Vote Counts Suggest Government Reelection in Australia</h2>

          <p>Early vote counting in Australia's general election suggests the ruling center-left Labor Party is likely to be reelected for a second term, amid major campaign issues such as energy policy and inflation. The Australian Electoral Commission's early projections gave the Labor Party 70 seats and the conservative opposition coalition 24 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese noted his government improved relations with China, removing trade barriers costing Australian exporters $13 billion annually. The election occurs during a cost-of-living crisis, with both sides promising policies to aid first-home buyers, and may result in a minority government if Labor loses more than two seats.</p>

The Football Supporters Association supports the call and welcomes trials in the men's game, while similar trials are underway in the women's game. Charters suggests starting with lower leagues and family zones where alcohol is inappropriate, emphasizing responsible drinking and giving back to loyal fans.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in their native Mexican wetlands, marking a potential comeback for the critically endangered species. A study tracked 18 axolotls released in southern Mexico City in 2017 and 2018, finding they survived and gained weight, indicating successful hunting and predator avoidance. This success in both artificial and restored wetlands suggests potential for scaling back habitat degradation and climate change effects. Axolotls, named after an Aztec god, are culturally significant to Mexicans and medically valuable due to their regenerative abilities, making their conservation a priority.</p>

Engineers at the 38th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation demonstrated that commercially available spectrum analyzers could pinpoint emissions from US low-probability-of-intercept radar (LPIR) with minimal error. LPIR is used in various US defense systems, and the study suggests this civilian technology could compromise its stealth capabilities, raising concerns about electronic warfare strategies.</p>

          <p>A former federal prosecutor, Adam Schleifer, claims his dismissal was influenced by smears originating from Andrew Wiederhorn, the former CEO of Fat Brands, who he was prosecuting. Schleifer alleges that these smears reached the White House through conservative pundits, leading to his firing, which he claims was unlawful. The filing includes an email indicating his removal was "on behalf of President Trump," and Schleifer suggests it was due to his constitutionally protected political activity. The case involves Wiederhorn facing federal charges for an alleged $47-million "sham loan" scheme and illegally possessing a firearm.</p>

          <p>Women in the Bay Area are leading the nation in delaying motherhood, with Marin County having the highest proportion of women giving birth at 40 and older. This trend is attributed to economic opportunities, progressive social norms, and access to reproductive technology. The region embraces diverse family structures and does not pressure women to start families young, with many prioritizing careers and experiences before having children. Fertility clinics in the Bay Area offer advanced treatments, increasing the chances of successful pregnancies at later ages, and companies provide fertility benefits to attract talented workers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is facing a staffing shortage after offering employees incentives to resign as part of the Trump administration's plan to reduce the federal workforce. Despite paying employees to leave, APHIS is now urgently seeking to fill 73 critical positions, including scientists, analysts, and inspectors. This move has angered employees who accepted the resignation offer, as the government will effectively pay two salaries for the same roles through September. The agency declined to comment on the rationale behind this decision, stating it aims to optimize and reduce the workforce while maintaining critical services.</p>

          <p>Cases of whooping cough are on the rise again in the United States, prompting concerns among medical professionals. Preliminary data from the CDC indicates 8,485 cases have been reported in 2025, doubling the cases from the same period last year. Experts attribute the increase to decreased mask usage and social distancing following the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a potential shift in attitudes toward vaccines. The disease is particularly dangerous for infants, and health officials urge vaccination for pregnant women and regular booster shots for adults.</p>
