          <p>President Xi Jinping announced China's plan to mobilize national resources to advance artificial intelligence, aiming for self-reliance in core technologies like high-end chips and basic software. This initiative, leveraging a "new whole national system," seeks to close the technological gap with the United States, which is currently considered the leader in the AI field. The focus is on strengthening basic research and building an independent, controllable AI hardware and software system to move China up the industrial value chain. This push includes addressing regulatory systems alongside technological innovation and industrial development.</p>

          <p>The Trump Justice Department has reversed the Biden administration's position, stating that the UNRWA can be sued in the U.S. for alleged involvement with Hamas in the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. This opens the door for a lawsuit by families of over 100 victims seeking $1 billion in damages, claiming UNRWA aided Hamas by providing funds for weapons and allowing tunnels under its sites. The Justice Department argues UNRWA is not entitled to immunity under U.S. law, marking a significant shift in stance.</p>

Safer alternatives include bottled drinks, hot coffee or tea, sealed snacks like nuts and granola bars, and fresh fruit with peels; experts recommend opting for hot, cooked foods and ensuring hand hygiene to minimize the chances of getting sick before a flight.</p>

The Lending Tree data highlights that 25% of consumers are using BNPL for groceries, up from previous years, while 41% have made late payments on these loans. This reflects economic pressures from inflation, high interest rates, and tariff concerns, leading consumers to seek ways to extend their budgets, though experts advise caution due to potential fees and debt accumulation.

          <p>A Pasadena-based LED lighting company, Nila, faces uncertainty due to President Trump's new trade policies, including a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, affecting imported components used in their energy-efficient lights. The company, which supplies stadium lighting and lights for Hollywood productions and the U.S. Congress, is struggling to plan due to the instability of the tariffs. Nila is now considering shifting assembly operations and focusing on international clients to mitigate the impact of the tariffs on their business.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the importance of truth in combating evil and tyranny, drawing parallels from vampire movies where belief in the truth is essential to defeating the vampires. The author argues that freedom of speech, not the right to bear arms, is the primary defense against tyranny, emphasizing that the survival of corrupt individuals and systems depends on suppressing or discrediting the truth. It highlights the need for individuals to recognize and speak the truth, as it is the first weapon in the battle for good.</p>

          <p>Aimee Semple McPherson, arriving in Los Angeles in 1918, became a pioneering religious innovator, founding the Angelus Temple and a Christian radio station.

Despite a scandalous disappearance and subsequent trial, McPherson continued preaching, leaving a legacy of faith, fame, and spectacle that continues to influence Los Angeles's allure as a place for transformation and second chances.</p>

          <p>Dunsmuir, California, faces a unique challenge: its stunning Mossbrae Falls, compared to Yosemite or Yellowstone, is legally inaccessible to the public. Despite attracting 30,000 annual visitors who trespass along dangerous train tracks, efforts to create a safe trail have been stymied by property rights and bureaucratic hurdles. The Saint Germain Foundation, which owns the land on one side, limits access due to the waterfall's sacred status, while Union Pacific Railroad, owning the other side, has been slow to approve a footbridge proposal, leaving the town seeking solutions for a safe, designated pathway.</p>

          <p>The annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner faces diminished enthusiasm this year, with President Trump expected to boycott and the comedian Amber Ruffin disinvited. Critics view the event as a symbol of the media's failure to effectively counter Trump's tactics and the rise of Maga media. The decision to drop Ruffin has been criticized as cowardice and capitulation, reflecting the media's struggle to unite against Trump's attacks on truth and journalism.</p>

          <p>A Durham University study reveals that chimpanzees exhibit a similar level of empathy to bonobos, comforting each other in distress through behaviors like embracing and holding hands. The research, based on 1,400 hours of observation across both species, challenges the common perception of chimpanzees as violent and despotic compared to the more empathic bonobos. The study also found that younger apes are more likely to offer consolation, suggesting that emotional sensitivity emerges early in ape development.</p>
