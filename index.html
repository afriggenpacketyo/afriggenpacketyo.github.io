          <p>Five Mexican nationals face charges after a boat carrying migrants capsized off San Diego, resulting in three deaths, including a 14-year-old boy from India. The incident, occurring about 35 miles north of the Mexico border, involved a vessel commonly used for smuggling. The U.S. Attorney's Office is prosecuting the suspects for Bringing in Aliens Resulting in Death and Transportation of Illegal Aliens. Secretary Kristi Noem will request the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty, emphasizing the smugglers' greed and indifference as the direct cause of the deaths. This incident highlights the dangers of human trafficking along the California coast.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump intends to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia during his trip to Saudi Arabia. This decision aligns with the preferences of Arab nations but contrasts with Iran's historical ties to the name Persian Gulf. The name change has been an emotive issue, particularly for Iranians who identify with the region's long history as the Persian Empire. While Trump can change the name for official U.S. purposes, the move may be viewed as a symbolic gesture of support towards Gulf countries, with whom Trump has sought closer financial and political ties.</p>

          <p>India stated that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting "terrorist infrastructure" in response to a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 people were killed.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an "act of war," promising a robust response.

          <p>Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell criticized recent ICE operations in the city, which led to the arrests of a convicted child sexual assault perpetrator and an alleged gang member, stating that these actions undermine community safety. He argues that such federal enforcement actions deter people from interacting with local law enforcement. DHS responded that the mayor should want criminal illegal aliens off the streets, and criticized the demonization of law enforcement. ICE reported arresting over 66,000 illegal immigrants and removing over 65,000 during President Trump's first 100 days of his second term.</p>

          <p>President Trump took a softer tone with Canada during his first meeting with new Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite months of belittling the country. Trump praised Canada and its people, a stark contrast to his previous threats to turn it into the 51st state. Carney, however, made it clear that Canada is not for sale. Trump covered a wide range of topics during the meeting, including unrelated issues such as Barack Obama's library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen, as he tried to navigate the awkwardness created by his previous rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Alvin Brown, was abruptly removed from his position by the Trump administration, a rare move that has raised questions. The White House has not provided a reason for Brown's removal, which occurred a little over a year after he was sworn in for a term expected to end in 2026. This decision comes as the NTSB is investigating nearly 1,250 active cases across the U.S., including several high-profile accidents, such as the midair collision in Washington, D.C., and the Baltimore bridge collapse.</p>

          <p>China, a major aluminum producer and consumer, relies on imported aluminum ore due to a lack of high-quality bauxite. However, a plant in Shanxi province is upgrading with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminum from Chinaâ€™s low-grade ore. The technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello, neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing the use of high-silica bauxite in the Bayer process. This development could reduce China's dependence on imported aluminum ore from Guinea and Australia.</p>
