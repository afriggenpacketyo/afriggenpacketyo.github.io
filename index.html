          <h2>Chinese Energy Investments in Africa Increasingly Focused on Renewables</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 02:00:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by ODI Global indicates that China is shifting its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power now constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with a significant portion directed towards renewable energy. The continent has also become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, experiencing a 153% surge in exports between 2020 and 2024, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. This shift aligns with global trends as China committed to halting the funding of new coal-fired power plants overseas in 2021.</p>

          <p>Three Chinese nationals have been arrested in Tokyo for allegedly running an illicit poker gambling den, suspected of earning over 60 million yen ($413,000) in less than a year. The suspects, including a 42-year-old resident of Tokyo's Kita Ward, are accused of collecting fees from patrons at a condominium in Toshima Ward. Police also arrested nine patrons for allegedly engaging in illegal gambling at the apartment, suspecting the operators received 5 percent of winnings as a fee, hosting around a dozen players per day. While one suspect admitted to the charge, the others claimed they were simply playing poker with friends.</p>

          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure in the global art world and the curator-designate of the 2026 Venice Biennale, has died at the age of 57 in Switzerland, just days before she was scheduled to announce the event's theme. As the curator and executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, one of Africa’s largest contemporary art museums, Ms. Kouoh built a global reputation as a torchbearer for artists of color. Her death is described by the biennale's organizers as sudden and untimely, leaving an immense void in the world of contemporary art. Kouoh's career involved expanding the presence of African artists in the global art scene, and she was known for her institution-building work and mentorship of curators.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for high-stakes trade negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from the trade war initiated by President Trump. The talks have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. While Mr. Trump hailed the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal. The Trump administration has accused China of unfairly subsidizing key sectors and flooding the world with cheap goods, while China has maintained that it does not intend to make trade concessions.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a senior staff psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers are often unfairly blamed for their children's problems and are constantly bombarded with messages that they are not doing enough. She emphasizes that being a perfect mother is harmful and that flaws are an important part of a mother's job, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to stop wondering if they are good enough, asserting that they already are. She highlights the historical tendency in psychiatry to blame mothers and urges for a shift in perspective to recognize and appreciate the contributions of mothers.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership believed Han had a better chance of winning the elections, but PPP members voted against the motion to switch candidates. Kim, a former labor activist, expressed his commitment to overcoming the current crisis facing the nation and leading South Korea towards becoming a greater nation. The PPP has been in turmoil since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, and the opposition Democratic Party's candidate, Lee Jae-myung, is currently leading in the polls.</p>

While Mr. Putin indicated Russia wouldn’t stop fighting before the negotiations on May 15, authorities reported an attack by Russian exploding drones that set off air alerts in several cities, including Kyiv.</p>

However, Dopson is concerned about the resale value of the Shark due to the rapid advancements in EV technology and the emergence of new competitors.

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has drawn condemnation from a wide range of Iranians, uniting them across political, ideological, and religious divides. The name "Persian Gulf" has been used since at least 550 B.C. and is deeply intertwined with Iranian national and cultural identity. While Trump has the power to order changes to geographical names used in the United States, other countries are not obligated to follow suit.

          <p>Despite agreeing to a U.S.-led ceasefire to end weeks of military confrontation, India and Pakistan accused each other of violating the agreement hours after it was announced. India reported repeated violations and accused Pakistan of a border intrusion, while Pakistan blamed Indian forces for initiating the violation. President Trump initially announced the ceasefire, crediting the U.S. for mediating the deal. However, explosions and gunfire were reported along the Line of Control, raising concerns about the stability of the truce. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that both Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif were engaged to discuss the ceasefire and future talks.</p>

          <p>A Chinese team has developed an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to perform autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing the capabilities of human controllers in flight missions. The algorithm allows drones to execute high-risk maneuvers that require unstable postures, mimicking the agility observed in birds and bats. Gao Fei from Zhejiang University emphasized that this biological wisdom transforms high-risk maneuvers into high-survival rewards, redefining traditional drone flight paradigms. This breakthrough was published in the journal Science Robotics.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba voiced reservations about using a consumption tax cut as a measure to alleviate inflation, citing concerns about the potential strain on state finances. Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have also expressed skepticism about the consumption tax cut, as the government prepares an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election. Opposition parties support a consumption tax cut, with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan proposing a one-year pause on the tax for food. Regarding trade negotiations with the United States, Ishiba stated that Japan will continue to pursue the complete elimination of additional duties on its exports.</p>

Trump expressed his desire for China to open up to American businesses, for the benefit of both nations. In retaliation to the U.S. tariffs, China has imposed a minimum 125 percent duty rate on imported U.S. goods and restricted exports of various critical minerals.</p>
