        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the most significant drop since July 2023 and continuing a multi-year deflationary trend. This decline was steeper than anticipated and reflects intense price wars and weak demand within the economy. In contrast, the consumer price index (CPI) saw a slight increase of 0.1%, partly due to a government subsidy program for trade-ins. Despite this, economists remain cautious, pointing to persistent overcapacity and a weakening property sector as signs that deflationary pressures will likely continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a 1,856-kilometer green belt aimed at containing the expansion of three major deserts in its Inner Mongolia region. The project, part of the country's 'green great wall' initiative, connects the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. Engineers utilized a method involving straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by the planting of drought-resistant vegetation like sacsaoul trees. This large-scale ecological project is designed to build an effective sand prevention system and strengthen the region's environmental defenses against desertification.</p>

          <p>In a notable policy shift, President Donald Trump announced his approval for sending defensive weapons to Ukraine, a move he had previously resisted despite requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. During a cabinet meeting, Trump also expressed his displeasure with Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a potential strain in their relationship. This decision comes as Trump also navigates complex diplomatic relations, including hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The article questions the motivations behind this sudden change in policy regarding Ukraine and its broader implications for U.S. foreign relations.</p>

          <p>China has placed eight Taiwanese companies, including major aerospace and shipbuilding firms, on an export control list, citing national security concerns. The ban prohibits the export of dual-use items, which have both civilian and military applications, to these entities. This action coincides with Taiwan's annual Han Kuang military exercises, which simulate a defense against a potential Chinese invasion and are the largest in their history. The move escalates tensions across the Taiwan Strait, as Beijing continues to assert its territorial claims over the self-ruled island.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to reduce the federal workforce while legal challenges continue. The unsigned ruling allows for potentially hundreds of thousands of federal jobs to be cut through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole public dissenter, warning of mass terminations and the dismantling of federal programs. This decision is one of several recent instances where the Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration on contentious policy issues.</p>

The area is particularly vulnerable to flooding due to unstable soil from recent wildfires that scorched the landscape, reducing vegetation that would normally help absorb rainfall.

          <h2>Los Angeles and Other Cities Join Lawsuit to Halt Federal Immigration Raids</h2>

          <p>The city and county of Los Angeles are seeking to join a lawsuit filed by the ACLU against the Trump administration to stop what they term "unlawful" and "unconstitutional" immigration raids in Southern California. The legal action claims federal agents are flouting the law, creating fear in communities, and disrupting the local economy. This move comes as the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement operation enters its second month, with thousands of arrests reported. Local officials argue the raids obstruct law enforcement and are seeking a temporary restraining order to bar unconstitutional arrests.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court alleges they have committed the crime against humanity of gender-based persecution against girls and women in Afghanistan since retaking power in 2021. The charges detail the severe deprivation of fundamental rights, including education, movement, and expression. While the Taliban has dismissed the warrants as "nonsense," the move represents a significant step by the international community to hold the regime's leadership accountable for their policies.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced that federal immigration operations in Los Angeles have resulted in 2,792 arrests since they began in early June. The aggressive enforcement, which has involved ICE, CBP, the National Guard, and U.S. Marines, has been heavily criticized by local and state officials for creating a climate of fear. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned a recent sweep through MacArthur Park as a "disgrace." The operation is seen as a test of the Trump administration's executive authority in carrying out mass deportations in a major city with opposing leadership.</p>

After journalistic inquiry, their accounts were reinstated with an apology from Meta.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on imported copper, a decision stemming from a national security investigation into the metal's imports. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction. The move caused U.S. copper prices to jump to record highs and is part of a broader strategy of using tariffs to protect American industries, following similar levies on steel and aluminum. The new tax is expected to take effect by the end of the month, though some countries may seek exemptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas has brought renewed attention to significant staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA, under the Trump administration. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, including meteorologists and hydrologists, raising concerns about the government's ability to forecast and warn against severe weather. While experts noted that the San Antonio NWS office issued timely alerts for this event, they warned that continued staff and budget reductions could compromise public safety in future weather catastrophes.
