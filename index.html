          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:57:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly asked component suppliers to cease production of its China-specific H20 AI chips, following Beijing's crackdown over alleged security concerns, including potential 'backdoors.' This directive comes after the Chinese government urged local tech companies to halt H20 purchases, despite prior U.S. export license approvals for the chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is currently in discussions with Beijing, expressing hope for a resolution and emphasizing the H20's commercial, non-military use. This situation highlights the complex trade uncertainties impacting the global semiconductor industry and Nvidia's operations in China.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has temporarily suspended an earlier order for the mass removal of stray dogs in New Delhi, issuing a revised directive that mandates sterilization and immunization before the animals are released, except in cases of rabies or aggressive behavior. This new approach follows widespread protests from animal rights activists who criticized the previous order as inhumane and impractical. The court also called for the establishment of designated feeding zones and plans to formulate a comprehensive nationwide policy to address the high number of daily dog bite incidents. The decision seeks a more humane and sustainable solution to the issue.</p>

          <p>Millions across the UK are expected to face significant travel challenges this bank holiday weekend, with warnings of busy roads, a rail strike by the RMT union affecting CrossCountry routes, and planned engineering works. The RAC forecasts particularly heavy traffic on major motorways like the M5, as many embark on getaway journeys. Despite a generally dry weather forecast, large crowds are anticipated at numerous festivals and events nationwide, making careful travel planning essential for those looking to avoid delays and congestion. This marks the last long weekend before Christmas for many regions.</p>

          <p>Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), the nation's third-largest steelworks and part of Liberty Steel, has been placed under government control following a compulsory winding-up order granted by insolvency courts to creditors. This action creates an uncertain future for nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield, with the government agreeing to cover ongoing wages and costs while a buyer is sought. The move highlights the strategic importance of domestic steel production and the broader challenges facing the UK's steel industry, including high energy prices and foreign competition. Officials emphasize the desire to ensure steel production restarts.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised to open lower as investors continue to evaluate the recently announced details of the trade agreement between the European Union and the United States.

While pharmaceutical tariffs are capped at 15%, duties on the automotive sector remain conditional on Brussels lowering its own industrial duties, leading to mixed market reactions and ongoing economic monitoring.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is now a Category 1 storm moving northeast away from the U.S. coast, but dangerous swimming conditions and rip currents are expected at most East Coast beaches for several more days.

Despite this, the Bank of Japan's 'core-core' inflation remained steady, maintaining pressure for a potential interest rate hike as the central bank is seen as 'behind the curve' in addressing inflation.

          <p>India and Russia have committed to expanding bilateral trade, including increasing Indian exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and textiles to Russia, despite U.S. tariff pressures over India's substantial Russian oil imports. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar called their relationship among the 'steadiest,' while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov noted 'wide strides' in hydrocarbon cooperation. This defiance highlights India's independent foreign policy and its resistance to U.S. influence, with experts suggesting U.S. tariffs might even strengthen the India-Russia-China dynamic. Plans also include sending Indian workers to address Russia's labor shortages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have refuted reports that they are passing U.S. tariff costs onto consumers. Toyota stated its July price increases were routine annual adjustments for various operational costs, not a direct response to tariffs. Honda attributed its ability to avoid direct tariff pass-through to its high proportion of American-made vehicles, as ranked by Cars.com's American-Made Index. These denials follow a recent reduction in U.S. auto tariffs on Japan, from 25% to 15%, after a trade deal, providing some relief to the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chocolate lovers face continued price increases due to the lagged effect of soaring cocoa prices, which reached record highs amid West African supply challenges and global retail inflation. While cocoa futures have recently eased, chocolatiers are still processing higher costs from late 2024, leading to a 'hangover' effect for the industry. Experts anticipate prices will remain elevated due to persistent supply tightness, though a more favorable outlook, with improving production and softening industrial demand, might emerge by next Easter. Long-standing productivity challenges in major cocoa-producing regions contribute to the sustained high prices. (not investment advice)</p>

This discovery offers valuable insights into optimizing the release of linalool to enhance pest control and increase crop yields. Field research in Hainan province indicated that maize in densely planted inner rows experienced less herbivore damage but also exhibited reduced growth, suggesting complex plant-to-plant interactions. The findings, published in the journal Science, could lead to innovative agricultural strategies to improve plant defense and productivity.</p>
