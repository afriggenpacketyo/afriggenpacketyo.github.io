        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed the presence of radiological and chemical contamination within Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, following recent Israeli strikes. IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi informed the United Nations Security Council that uranium isotopes and hydrogen fluoride may have been dispersed inside the facility. The destruction spans multiple sites, including Natanz, Isfahan, and Arak, but no radiological activity has been detected outside these locations. Grossi cautioned about potential attacks on the Bushehr nuclear facility, warning of severe consequences due to the large quantities of nuclear material present, which could necessitate evacuations and sheltering of the population. Optimism regarding the containment of radiological threats is tempered by the potential for escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is a program offered by the IRS allowing eligible taxpayers to settle their tax debt for a reduced amount. This option is available to those who cannot realistically pay their full tax bill without facing financial hardship. The IRS evaluates applicants based on their ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity, requiring thorough documentation and a detailed financial statement. While the IRS has strict criteria and a rigorous evaluation process, an OIC can provide a fresh start for those burdened by overwhelming tax debt (not investment advice).</p>

Interim CEO Ron Sargent noted that shoppers are buying more promotional items, private-label products, and larger pack sizes, while cutting back on discretionary purchases. Kroger is also focusing on simplifying promotions and lowering prices on over 2,000 products to cater to value-conscious customers.

Federal undergraduate loan rates are decreasing to 6.39% for the 2025-26 academic year, offering some relief. Experts advise maximizing federal funding options before exploring private loans, which may offer competitive rates, especially with good credit or a cosigner.

          <p>Authorities in southern Mexico are evaluating the damage caused by Hurricane Erick, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm, resulting in at least two deaths.

Coastal residents, particularly in Acapulco, took the storm seriously, recalling the devastation of Hurricane Otis in 2023. Erick initially strengthened to a Category 4 storm before weakening upon landfall, wiping out power to over 120,000 customers.</p>
