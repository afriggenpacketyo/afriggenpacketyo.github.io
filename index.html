            <p>A cable car crash near Naples, Italy, resulted in the deaths of four people, including three passengers and the driver, prompting an investigation by prosecutors. The incident occurred when a cable supporting the cabin snapped, causing it to plunge to the ground. Rescue efforts were hampered by adverse weather conditions such as fog, wind, and rain. The Mount Faito cable car, which has been operating since 1952, experienced a similar accident in 1960, resulting in four fatalities.</p>

            <p>Director James Cameron, known for films like 'Terminator,' has adjusted his views on artificial intelligence, now advocating for its integration into VFX workflows to cut costs and increase efficiency.

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, who was mistakenly deported there. Despite this meeting, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele suggested Abrego Garcia will remain incarcerated by his government. The White House deputy press secretary criticized Van Hollen's visit. Abrego Garcia's wife said her prayers have been answered. The meeting marks Abrego Garcia's first known appearance since his deportation.</p>

            <p>Six staff members on the same floor of a Boston-area hospital have reported developing brain tumors, prompting investigations into potential environmental risks. The hospital maintains that testing has not revealed any environmental hazards, but a labor union is conducting its own investigation. The union claims that the hospital only spoke to a small number of nurses and that the environmental testing was not comprehensive. The hospital has repeatedly suggested there is no evidence to establish that the situation is anything more than a coincidence.</p>

            <p>The White House is rebuilding the National Security Council with aides who are believed to be aligned with President Trump's agenda, following the ousting of six people earlier this month. Derek Harvey, a military intelligence analyst, is expected to be named senior director for intelligence. Retired Lt. Col. Michael Jensen is also likely to join the NSC. Harvey was forced out of the NSC during Mr. Trump's first term by then-National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster over a difference in vision.</p>

            <p>The US administration is set to impose port fees on Chinese ships in an effort to revive shipbuilding in the US and challenge China's dominance of the industry. The fees will be based on cargo weight and container capacity, rising over the next three years. Empty vessels and those moving goods between American ports are exempted. Experts warn the move could disrupt global trade and raise prices for US consumers, as cargoes are redirected to European ports.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's upcoming state visit to the UK, described by him as a "fest," is seen as a potential opportunity to strengthen the special relationship. The visit, scheduled for September, follows a period of strain due to differing views on issues like Ukraine and tariffs. The British government hopes that the visit will provide a platform for diplomatic engagement and influence on key issues. The visit is a risk given the controversies of his first few months.</p>
