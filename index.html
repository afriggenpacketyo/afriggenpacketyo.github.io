          <h2>Creatine Supplementation Shows Promise in Depression Treatment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that creatine, a popular weightlifting supplement, may be effective in treating depression, even without the use of antidepressants. A recent study in India found that participants who took creatine alongside talk therapy experienced greater improvements in their depression symptoms compared to those who only received therapy. Creatine helps the brain convert nutrients into energy, and scientists believe that improving brain metabolism could alleviate psychiatric disorders like depression. While researchers emphasize the need for further studies to confirm these preliminary findings, the affordability and accessibility of creatine make it a promising option for those seeking mental health support (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A group of Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees, who were resettled in the US years ago, are now facing statelessness after being deported from the US. The deportations occurred due to various offenses, including minor violations and more serious charges. Bhutanese authorities refused to accept them back, leading to their detention in Nepal, as neither Bhutan nor Nepal is willing to grant them citizenship rights. The situation highlights the precarious position of refugees caught between countries, and the US is being urged to clarify the terms of the deportations.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge ruled that Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students, could face the death penalty if convicted, despite his autism diagnosis. Kohberger's defense argued that his autism spectrum disorder reduces his culpability, but the judge disagreed, citing U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The judge also ruled that jurors will be able to hear much of the 911 call made from outside the house by two surviving roommates roughly eight hours after the killings, as they realized one of their roommates wasn't waking up. The trial is set to begin in August.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to expedite deep-sea mining in an effort to reduce U.S. reliance on China for critical minerals. The order aims to fast-track permits for mining strategically important minerals from the seabed in both U.S. and international waters. Critics argue that this move contradicts global efforts to adopt regulation and could harm the environment.
