        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A series of bear attacks across Japan has resulted in multiple injuries and one suspected death, highlighting a growing issue of human-wildlife conflict. In one incident, a bear entered a grocery store in central Japan, injuring two men before escaping. Separately, a man was found dead on a mountain in a suspected mauling, and other attacks on a farmer and a tourist have been reported. Experts attribute the rise in bear sightings in residential areas to factors like climate change affecting food sources and a declining rural human population, which allows bears to expand their habitat.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla, now a Category 2 storm, is gradually weakening as it moves parallel to Mexico's Pacific coast. While not expected to make landfall, the National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for parts of the Baja California Sur peninsula. The primary threat from the hurricane is the generation of large swells, which are causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast of southwestern Mexico. Residents and visitors in the affected areas are being warned of potential coastal flooding and dangerous water conditions as the storm progresses northwest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal case against former FBI Director James Comey faces significant hurdles after a central witness provided testimony that undermines the prosecution's claims, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The witness, law professor Daniel Richman, reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information to the press and, on some occasions, advised against it. Prosecutors noted in an internal memo that relying on Richman's testimony would create "insurmountable problems" for proving Comey knowingly made false statements to Congress. This development casts serious doubt on the viability of the indictment.</p>

          <h2>UK Spy Case Against Two Men Collapses Due to Government's Failure to Designate China a Threat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prosecution of two men accused of spying for China has been dropped, a collapse attributed to the UK government's inability to provide evidence officially labeling China a "threat to national security" during the period of the alleged offenses. The Director of Public Prosecutions explained that a legal precedent from another case raised the evidentiary bar, requiring this specific designation under the Official Secrets Act. Despite months of requests, the government did not provide witness statements meeting this new threshold, leading to the case's failure. The situation has prompted criticism and questions about the government's official stance on China.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has intercepted a nine-vessel aid flotilla in international waters as it attempted to breach the naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. The operation, organized by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, was carrying food, medical supplies, and 150 international passengers. Israel's foreign ministry stated the interception was necessary to prevent a breach of a "legal naval blockade" into a combat zone. The passengers are reportedly being transferred to an Israeli port for prompt deportation. This event occurs amidst a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where a UN-backed body has confirmed famine conditions in some areas.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $4,000 per ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets due to global economic instability and political tensions. This rally, the largest since the 1970s, is fueled by concerns over international trade disputes and delays in the release of key U.S. economic data caused by a government shutdown. Central banks have also been significant buyers of gold, moving to diversify their reserves away from the U.S. dollar. Analysts note that while the current surge is driven by short-term uncertainty, the long-term trend is supported by strategic institutional purchasing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed Assembly Bill 255, a bipartisan measure that would have allocated up to 10% of state homelessness funds for abstinence-based recovery housing programs. Proponents argued the bill would provide a crucial alternative for homeless individuals with substance use disorders who benefit from sobriety requirements and community support. Newsom, however, deemed the bill "unnecessary," stating that current guidelines already permit such housing and warning against creating "duplicative" funding categories. The veto has drawn criticism from those who believe the state's "Housing First" policy is failing to address the addiction and mental health crises among the homeless population.</p>

The indictment was pursued by a newly appointed U.S. attorney, a Trump loyalist, despite career prosecutors in the office reportedly concluding there was insufficient evidence to bring charges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pumpkin, a quintessential symbol of autumn in America, has a rich and complex history that is more cultural than botanical. Originally a vital food source for Indigenous peoples and early European settlers, the word "pumpkin" evolved from Greek and French roots. For centuries, it was also used as a derogatory term for people considered empty-headed or unrefined. However, during the 19th century, as the U.S. became more urbanized, the pumpkin was romanticized as a symbol of an idealized agrarian past and the small family farm, an association that continues to drive its popularity today.</p>

          <p>A new study challenges the long-held belief that Sir Ernest Shackleton's Antarctic exploration vessel, the Endurance, was one of the most robustly built ships of its time. The research, published in the journal Polar Record, argues that the ship had several structural weaknesses that made it unsuitable for the compressive forces of pack ice. The author points to evidence that the ship was originally designed for Arctic tourism, not deep polar exploration, and even Shackleton himself expressed doubts about its construction in a private letter. The paper concludes the vessel sank due to these design flaws rather than simply the loss of its rudder.</p>

France's budget deficit and debt levels are well above EU limits, and the country is under an "excessive deficit procedure" to correct its finances.

          <p>China's Ministry of Transport anticipates a record-breaking travel surge during the eight-day "Golden Week" national holiday. The total number of journeys is forecast to exceed 2.4 billion, marking a 6.2% increase from the previous year. To accommodate the massive influx of travelers, the national railway operator has added nearly 1,900 extra trains. High-demand routes, such as those connecting Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing, are experiencing rapid ticket sales as the country sees a major post-pandemic rebound in domestic tourism and travel.</p>

          <p>Australia faces uncertainty over the availability of its cricket captain, Pat Cummins, for the upcoming Ashes series against England. Reports indicate that fresh scans on a back stress problem have shown it has not yet healed, making him a doubt for the entire series. While the Australian camp has not made a final decision, Cummins was already ruled out of recent white-ball series. The potential absence of the star pace bowler would be a significant blow to Australia's chances, likely requiring Steve Smith to step in as captain and Scott Boland to join the bowling attack.</p>

          <p>American golfer Collin Morikawa has acknowledged that the behavior of some home fans at the recent Ryder Cup in New York "probably crossed the line." The European team, particularly Rory McIlroy, was subjected to significant verbal abuse from spectators during their victory. Morikawa clarified that his pre-tournament call for fans to "create absolute chaos" was not intended to encourage rudeness. The incidents, which included McIlroy's wife being hit by a thrown cup, have reignited the debate over appropriate fan conduct and sportsmanship at the highly charged international event.</p>

          <p>A continuing U.S. federal government shutdown is causing significant flight delays at major airports for a second consecutive day due to staffing shortages. Air traffic controllers are required to work without pay during the shutdown, leading to an increase in sick leave and reduced staffing levels at facilities nationwide. Airports in Houston, Nashville, Chicago, and New York are among those affected, with over 3,000 flights delayed. Transportation officials have warned that they will slow air traffic to ensure safety if controller shortages persist, raising concerns about potential disruptions to upcoming holiday travel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is poised to significantly reduce its reliance on Russian and Iranian natural gas by boosting domestic production and increasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, particularly from the U.S. By 2028, Turkey could meet over half of its gas needs from these alternative sources, shrinking the market for its traditional pipeline suppliers. This strategic shift enhances Turkey's energy security and supports its goal of becoming a regional energy hub. With several long-term pipeline contracts nearing expiration, Ankara is expected to seek more flexible terms and smaller volumes, fundamentally altering the energy landscape of the region.</p>

The talks are focused on achieving a permanent ceasefire, the exchange of hostages for prisoners, and post-war governance in Gaza. Hamas has stated it is ready for a deal but requires "real guarantees" from the international community that the war will end permanently.</p>

          <p>This article examines the qualities that have solidified Jordan Pickford's position as the undisputed starting goalkeeper for the England national football team. While his animated on-pitch demeanor was once a point of criticism, he has matured and demonstrated remarkable consistency, making only one error leading to a goal in over 78 international appearances. Experts and former teammates praise his improved all-around play, exceptional long-range distribution, and his ability to perform under the immense pressure of major tournaments. Despite other talented English goalkeepers, his experience and proven track record have effectively ended the debate over the position.</p>
