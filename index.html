          <p>Trygroup Inc., a major Japanese tutoring company, issued a public apology for inaccurately portraying Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials.  The false claim, featured in a junior high school video lesson, described the disease's development through mercury exposure but incorrectly labeled it as inherited. Following criticism, the company removed the video and corrected the information, responding to concerns from patient groups and the Environment Ministry. Minamata disease is a severe neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning, affecting thousands near Minamata Bay.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways in the UK has been renationalized, marking the first step in the Labour government's plan to return the entire rail network to public ownership by the end of 2027. This move aims to improve services, address issues like frequent cancellations and high ticket prices, and save millions in compensation fees paid to private operators.  The renationalization follows years of criticism of the privatized system and is welcomed by rail unions.  Further nationalizations of other rail operators are planned for the coming years.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that dog owners' work-related stress, particularly rumination after work hours, can negatively impact their pets' well-being.  The research, involving 85 working dog owners, found a correlation between owners' stress levels and increased stress-related behaviors in their dogs, such as whining and restlessness.  This suggests a phenomenon of "crossover" stress, where stress from one individual affects others in the household.  The study emphasizes the importance of managing work stress to protect the well-being of pets.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to increase salaries for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to improve recruitment and working conditions.  The new scheme, starting in January, will offer annual salaries exceeding 6 million yen ($41,000), significantly higher than the current average.  The move reflects the growing global popularity of Japanese cuisine and the increasing difficulty in recruiting qualified chefs.  The government aims to utilize these chefs as "food diplomats" to promote Japanese culinary arts abroad.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) in the UK has been renationalized, marking the first such transfer under the Labour government's plan to bring rail services back into public control.  The government emphasizes improved services and reinvestment in infrastructure rather than immediate fare reductions.  The move has been met with mixed reactions, with unions expressing concerns about outsourcing and the Conservatives calling for the government to deliver on its promises.  The renationalization is a significant step towards the government's broader rail reform agenda.</p>

Reform UK proposes funding these measures by cutting net-zero projects and scrapping asylum seeker hotels.  The announcement highlights growing political divisions over social welfare policies.</p>
