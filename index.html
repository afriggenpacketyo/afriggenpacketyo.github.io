          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed the $90,000 mark, reaching its highest level since March, as investors seek refuge in the cryptocurrency amid stock market volatility. The surge coincides with increased pressure from President Trump on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, fueling uncertainty in traditional markets. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin experienced significant inflows, indicating growing investor confidence in the digital asset as a hedge against economic instability. Analysts suggest that breaking the $88,000 resistance level could pave the way for further gains. (not investment advice)</p>
