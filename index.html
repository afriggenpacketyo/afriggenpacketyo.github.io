          <p>China has sanctioned Japanese lawmaker Seki Hei, accusing him of spreading falsehoods regarding Taiwan, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong, which Beijing views as undermining its sovereignty. The rare move by the Chinese foreign ministry freezes any assets Seki holds in China and prohibits transactions with him or his immediate family. This action targets a conservative, China-born political commentator elected to Japan's House of Councillors this year. The sanctions reflect escalating tensions over issues like the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, which are claimed by both nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's August shipments to the U.S. plummeted by 33%, contributing to the slowest overall export growth in six months, missing economists' estimates. This downturn is attributed to U.S. President Trump's trade policies targeting transshipments and a loss of momentum in businesses' frontloading activities. Imports from the U.S. also decreased by 16%, while China increasingly relies on alternative markets like Southeast Asia and the EU amidst ongoing trade tensions. The persistent real estate slump and rising job insecurity further weigh on the economy, despite a recent extension of tariff truce between Beijing and Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets, particularly Japan, saw gains after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation over the weekend, following a national election defeat. The Nikkei 225 rose 1.5%, and the Topix reached a record high, with investors eyeing potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae. Takaichi, known for advocating deregulation and opposing interest rate hikes, is seen by some as a candidate to drive growth. The Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields continued to rise amidst persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty, pointing to a period of extended political uncertainty for Japan.

Trump signaled a readiness for a second phase of sanctions on Moscow, a move welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who urged Europe to cease buying Russian energy. This comes after Russia launched its largest aerial bombardment on Ukraine, hitting Kyiv's main government building. The discussions will focus on further isolating Russia financially, with the US seeking increased EU support for secondary tariffs on countries trading with Moscow.</p>

The Shenzhen-based company also launched Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, and its Quanta X2 robot, aiming for "robotic butlers" within five years. Despite AI for robots lagging behind other generative AI advancements, the company is generating revenue and plans for an IPO next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Father Michael Garvin, a recently ordained priest from the Diocese of Cleveland, attended the canonization Mass in Rome, which included the recognition of Carlo Acutis as the first "millennial saint." Acutis, a 15-year-old computer enthusiast known as "God's influencer" for his website documenting Eucharistic miracles, died of acute leukemia in 2006. Garvin emphasized that sainthood is attainable for everyone, regardless of age. Pope Leo XIV also canonized Pier Giorgia Frassati, a popular Italian figure who died at 24 in 1925, during the same event.</p>

          <p>A joint China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic data from NASA’s InSight lander, has discovered that Mars possesses a solid inner core, approximately 600km in radius. This finding is significant because Mars, unlike Earth, was not expected to have cooled fast enough to form such a core. The presence of a solid inner core, similar in proportion to Earth's, revives the debate about whether Earth was the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics. This discovery provides crucial insights into planetary formation and evolution, challenging previous assumptions about the Red Planet's internal structure.</p>

However, he lacks the necessary votes. This crisis stems from President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call a snap election, which resulted in a weakened minority government.

          <p>Linebacker Nate Landman, a new team captain for the Los Angeles Rams, secured a 14-9 season-opening victory over the Houston Texans with a critical forced fumble in the final minutes. Landman's "punch-out" separated the ball from a Texans running back, leading to a recovery by Braden Fiske and sealing the win. This defensive effort, which also included an interception and multiple sacks, compensated for an offense that still needs fine-tuning, despite quarterback Matthew Stafford reaching over 60,000 career passing yards. Coach Sean McVay praised Landman's intentional play, highlighting the team's ability to find a way to win.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles' Recreation and Parks Commission has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for a million dollars, aiming to restore it for its 2026 centennial. This "crown jewel" of the park, where Walt Disney was inspired to create Disneyland, closed in 2022 after its previous operator died. The carousel, one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds, requires significant repairs as it currently cannot be moved by hand. Its acquisition is part of a broader park restoration project slated for completion before the 2028 Olympic Games, with hopes of reopening the beloved attraction soon.</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, and parts of Europe and Africa, witnessed a "blood moon" during a total lunar eclipse on Sunday night. This phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the moon. The red color is due to sunlight reflecting and scattering through Earth's atmosphere, with blue wavelengths dispersing more easily. This celestial event, which has captivated humans for millennia, offered a spectacular visual display, although the Americas missed out on the total eclipse.</p>
