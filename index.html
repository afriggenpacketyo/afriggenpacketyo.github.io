          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts, intended to fund President Trump's agenda and tax breaks, are causing anxiety among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could leave 8.6 million more people without health insurance by 2034. Many Republicans claim the cuts aim to eliminate fraud and waste without affecting coverage for those in need. However, some Medicaid recipients worry about reduced access to care and difficult choices between healthcare and basic necessities. The article highlights personal stories of individuals who depend on Medicaid for essential services, including care for disabled family members and substance use disorder treatment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge voiced her frustration with the Trump administration's handling of the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, accusing them of withholding information regarding his deportation to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, who had a legal status preventing deportation due to gang persecution risks, was wrongly sent to a Salvadoran prison due to an "administrative error". The Justice Department invoked state secrets privilege, leading to limited document disclosure. The judge questioned the administration's good faith efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, citing conflicting statements from officials and a lack of progress in depositions.</p>

          <p>Direct peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul resulted in an agreement to conduct a large prisoner swap, exchanging 1,000 prisoners each. However, the two sides failed to broker a temporary cease-fire or arrange a meeting between Presidents Putin and Zelensky. Russia demanded Ukraine withdraw from the four regions it annexed in 2022 for a cease-fire, a condition Ukraine rejected. Despite the lack of progress on a cease-fire, both delegations agreed to write up and share conditions that would make a cease-fire possible, and agreed to meet again.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have included a provision in their budget bill that would grant the Trump administration unilateral authority to label nonprofits as supporting terrorism, potentially leading to punitive actions with limited due process. The provision mirrors a bill passed in 2024 and would allow the treasury secretary to designate a nonprofit as providing material support to terrorism based on their sole determination. This could result in the loss of tax-exempt status and significant reputational damage.

Abuse is about power and control, not just physical violence, and even if both parties engage in harmful behaviors, one is typically the abuser. The defense may be trying to reframe the violence as consensual, but this strategy is risky and may not be effective.</p>
