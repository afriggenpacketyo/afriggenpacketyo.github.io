        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An attack during a peaceful march in Boulder, Colorado, supporting Israeli hostages resulted in injuries to twelve people, prompting an FBI investigation into what is being called a "targeted act of violence." The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails while yelling "Free Palestine." Soliman faces multiple felony counts, including attempted murder, and a federal hate crimes charge, and officials have confirmed he is an Egyptian national whose visa expired in 2023 after arriving in 2022. The attack has been condemned by officials, including Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who called it a "heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community."</p>

          <p>The UN secretary-general has called for an independent investigation into the killing of Palestinians near an aid distribution center in Rafah, Gaza, following disputed reports of Israeli forces opening fire. Witnesses reported being shot at while waiting for food from the center, which is run by the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Red Cross stated that its hospital received 179 casualties, including 21 deaths, while the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency reported 31 deaths. The Israeli military denied its troops fired at civilians, and the GHF called the reports "outright fabrications," adding they have not seen evidence of an attack near their facility. Given the conflicting reports, an independent investigation is being sought to determine the facts of the incident.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack on a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder. According to court documents, Soliman admitted to researching how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and purchasing the necessary ingredients, and allegedly told police he wanted to kill all Zionist people. Soliman, who disguised himself as a gardener during the attack, reportedly stated that he had been planning the attack for a year, but waited until his daughter's graduation, and sixteen unused Molotov cocktails were found near him when he was arrested. The attack injured 12 people and has been condemned as an act of hate.</p>

Both sides committed to returning the bodies of soldiers, with Russia handing over 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers next week and Ukraine returning 6,000 Russian soldiers at an unspecified time.

          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport, which had been closed for renovations, reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule, aiming to alleviate recent flight delays and cancellations. The temporary closure of runway 4L-22R in mid-April had left only two other runways operational, leading to flight restrictions. The Port Authority accelerated the construction schedule, hiring additional crews and coordinating with contractors to complete the project ahead of the original June 15 deadline. The FAA is working to certify the runway for arriving flights, which would further increase the airport's capacity, and while the runway is open, some weeknight and weekend closures are still expected to fully complete the project by the end of the year.</p>

The bill, called the "Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025," has bipartisan support and aims to pressure Russia to end the conflict in Ukraine, and other senators have voiced support for sanctions to hold Russia accountable.</p>

Krenwinkel's attorney argues that after 54 years in prison, she has accepted responsibility, participated in therapy, and is no longer a public safety risk. Debra Tate, Sharon Tate's sister, has been an outspoken advocate for keeping Krenwinkel behind bars, but Krenwinkel's fate now rests with Newsom's decision.</p>
