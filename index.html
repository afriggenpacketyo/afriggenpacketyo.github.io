          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:20:58 EDT</div>

          <p>China's Communist Party has publicly released a directive aimed at strengthening its legal system to challenge foreign economic sanctions, particularly those from the United States. First circulated internally in February, the policy paper seeks to enhance China's ability to apply international law and practices to protect its national interests. According to experts, this move is part of a broader strategy to create a sophisticated legal toolkit for engaging with and retaliating against trade and technology restrictions imposed by other nations. The directive emphasizes the need to build an advanced system for understanding and utilizing foreign law effectively.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reddit is introducing mandatory age verification in the United Kingdom to comply with the new Online Safety Act, which requires platforms with adult material to implement robust age-checking measures. Starting July 14, a third-party firm named Persona will verify users' ages through selfies or government-issued IDs for access to mature content. While Reddit will only retain the user's verification status and date of birth, privacy advocates express concern over data collection and the potential for circumvention. The UK's regulator, Ofcom, expects other companies to adopt similar measures or face significant fines and potential business disruption measures.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive BBC interview, former President Donald Trump stated he is "disappointed but not done" with Vladimir Putin, citing Russia's continued aggression in Ukraine despite diplomatic efforts. Trump announced a new plan to send weapons to Ukraine, funded by European allies, and threatened Russia with severe tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days. The interview also touched on Trump's support for NATO, his views on UK politics, and his domestic agenda, framing his presidency as a mission to save America. His remarks signal a significant shift in his approach to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, or PFAS, are persistent 'forever chemicals' that do not break down in the environment and are linked to severe health issues like cancer and organ damage. A recent court case in Italy highlighted the problem, where executives were jailed for contaminating a region's water supply, affecting an estimated 350,000 people. Originally developed for the atomic bomb and later commercialized as Teflon, these chemicals are now found in countless consumer products and are detectable in the blood of nearly all Americans. Despite decades of manufacturers knowing the risks, global contamination is widespread, prompting new regulations in the US and a planned phase-out in the EU.</p>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 stock index has achieved a new record, breaking the 9,000-point barrier for the first time. Analysts attribute the more than 10% gain in 2025 to several factors, including investors diversifying away from US markets and the UK's advantageous trade deal with the United States. The index, often criticized for its lack of tech companies, has been seen as a stable and reliable option in uncertain global economic times. Top-performing stocks include precious metals producers and defense contractors, reflecting current market trends and geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

His reputation is considered permanently tarnished by his association with Epstein and a disastrous 2019 interview, with senior royals, including Prince William, reportedly adamant about restricting his public role.

          <p>China's voluntary health insurance scheme for urban and rural residents saw another significant drop in enrollment, with 15.8 million fewer participants in 2024 compared to the previous year. This continues a downward trend driven by rising premiums and stagnating incomes, which make the plan a financial burden for many families, particularly in rural areas. The decline puts additional pressure on a system already facing economic headwinds and waning public trust. Overall, China's basic medical insurance, including a separate program for urban employees, covered 1.326 billion people, a decrease of over 7 million from 2023.</p>

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev characterized the warning as a "theatrical ultimatum" that Russia "didn't care" about. Trump had announced the plan, which includes 100% secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian exports, during a meeting with the NATO Secretary General. This development comes as the U.S. prepares to send new weapons to Ukraine, signaling Trump's growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to negotiate an end to the war.</p>

A fellow disciple told the BBC that the church, where Marten spent four months as a teenager, was a "place of torture" and abuse, though there is no indication Marten was personally abused. Messages from Marten years later show she was still affected by her experience, which she felt was a cult that practiced subtle manipulation.

The lab's Tick Index consistently shows a high risk for tick bites across the tri-state area. With nearly half a million Americans affected by Lyme disease annually, health experts are urging the public to take precautions such as using repellents and performing thorough checks after outdoor activities.</p>

A key finding was that many Jewish employees and patients feel unsafe within the NHS, prompting a recommendation for the health service to hold a summit to address the issue.

With UK government debt approaching 100% of GDP, markets are anxious for stability and details on how the Treasury will manage its finances ahead of the Autumn Budget. Reeves is expected to announce an overhaul of the pensions regime to address rising costs but is constrained by commitments not to raise key taxes. Analysts suggest the speech will be closely watched for any signals on fiscal policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The £650 million program will apply to vehicles costing up to £37,000, with the goal of making zero-emission cars more affordable for working families. While the government and industry welcome the move, critics and some consumers argue that the primary barrier to EV adoption is the lack of public charging infrastructure. The government has pledged to increase the number of charging points from 82,000 to 300,000 by 2030 to support its ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals the scale of a major abuse scandal at Muckamore Abbey Hospital in Northern Ireland, which was uncovered after CCTV cameras were mistakenly left recording for six months. The 300,000 hours of footage captured what police described as 1,500 "crimes" in a single ward, including physical assaults and severe neglect of vulnerable, non-verbal patients. Despite the discovery almost eight years ago, no cases have yet reached trial, and families have not been allowed to view the footage. The case is considered the UK's largest systemic abuse scandal, prompting calls for greater accountability.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent covering the trials of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon describes the proceedings as extraordinary and chaotic, unlike any other criminal case she has reported on. The couple, convicted of manslaughter, frequently disrupted the court, sacked numerous barristers, and were accused by the judge of attempting to sabotage their own retrial. Despite the serious charges, they often appeared affectionate and united in the dock. The article details numerous behind-the-scenes moments, including Marten's outburst about Gordon's past violent sexual assault conviction, which nearly derailed the entire process and showcased the couple's contempt for the legal system.</p>

          <p>Search and rescue operations in central Texas have been hampered by forecasts of more heavy rain, following devastating floods that killed at least 131 people. Most of the victims were children at a summer camp in Kerr County, which was swept by floodwaters on July 4. Authorities have lowered the number of missing people to 101 but have not found any survivors since the day of the disaster. The high death toll has led to criticism of the county's lack of a flash-flood warning system and has prompted the governor to call a special legislative session to investigate emergency preparedness.</p>

The coach helped Scheffler with his green reading and grip, but a switch to a mallet-style putter proved to be the turning point.

With Japan already holding one of the world's highest public debt-to-GDP ratios, the prospect of further debt-funded spending is making investors demand higher yields.
