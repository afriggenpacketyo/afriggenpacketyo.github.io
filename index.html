          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, had her 31-month jail sentence upheld by the Court of Appeal after being convicted of inciting racial hatred via an online rant against migrants. Connolly posted a swearword-ridden message on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling for "mass deportation now" and urging followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers, which was viewed 310,000 times before deletion. The Court of Appeal judges rejected her appeal, stating that the original sentence was not manifestly excessive, emphasizing the severity of inciting racial hatred and the widespread reach of her message.</p>

          <p>Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, is set to be released from prison four months early after his 18-month sentence for contempt of court was reduced. The High Court accepted that Yaxley-Lennon had shown a "change in attitude" and had tried to comply with an order that barred him from repeating lies about a Syrian refugee whom he had libeled. The judge noted the "absence of contrition or remorse" but also his assurance that he would comply with the injunction in the future. Yaxley-Lennon was originally jailed for ignoring an order not to repeat false allegations about the Syrian refugee who successfully sued him for libel.</p>

          <p>The EU formally adopted its 17th package of sanctions on Russia as EU defense and foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss the conflict in Ukraine. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has called for "consequences" from Washington if Moscow "doesn't agree on an unconditional ceasefire." These actions come as US President Trump stated Ukraine-Russia ceasefire talks would begin "immediately" following his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though the conditions of these talks are currently unclear. Russia has called for "compromises" from Ukraine, and Kyiv rejects any withdrawal of its forces from its territory forcibly annexed by Russia.</p>

          <p>While President Trump's poll numbers have declined, Democrats are not necessarily benefiting as many voters remain disillusioned with both parties. According to polls, voters do not see Democrats as a credible alternative and view them as out of touch with the average person. The data suggests that young voters and voters of color who joined Trump in 2024 are increasingly unhappy with him but are not returning to the Democratic Party either. Many voters are waiting to see how Trump implements his agenda, and some disengaged voters are tuning out of politics entirely, posing further complications for Democrats.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is maintaining its full-year sales forecast and will not raise prices due to tariffs, according to CFO Richard McPhail. The company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements allow it to maintain current pricing levels. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which plans to raise prices due to tariffs. Home Depot's Q1 earnings missed expectations, but sales beat estimates, with comparable sales improving throughout the quarter. The retailer is focusing on professional customers and has seen positive results from its spring Black Friday event.</p>

Garcia allegedly told police he lied to the family about needing to protect them, fearing they would not like him if he stopped the deception. He reportedly carried a handgun, pointed it at family members, and kept them from leaving the house for extended periods. The police were called after a family member reported they could no longer endure the situation, and Garcia was taken into custody without incident.</p>

After speaking with Mr. Putin by phone, President Trump said that he welcomed direct talks between Ukraine and Russia toward a cease-fire and a broader deal to end the war. But Mr. Putin’s diplomatic victory could undermine his broader economic goals to normalize relations with the United States. The price of oil, the main source of Russia’s budget revenue, has stabilized at around $65 a barrel after plunging in the days after Mr. Trump’s announcement of global tariffs in April.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff reduction, Chinese exporters are continuing to diversify away from the U.S. market due to lasting scars from the trade war. A survey found that 95% of Chinese exporters plan to increase exports to markets outside the U.S., with Southeast Asia being a top choice for relocating production. Even with the tariff reduction, the U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate on Chinese goods remains significantly higher than before the second Trump administration. This shift reflects a broader trend of U.S.-China "decoupling" and efforts by American firms to move production out of China.</p>

While the administration emphasizes "trade, not aid," critics argue that the M.C.C. has boosted commercial diplomacy and directly benefits U.S. interests.

          <p>Emergency rooms in the United States are facing a crisis due to a dramatic rise in patients waiting for beds on traditional hospital wards, known as "boarders." This overcrowding leads to worse patient outcomes, fragmented care, and rising frustration among staff. A recent study found that boarding has negative effects on emergency medicine residents' training, diminishing their ability to manage patients and handle department surges. Experts suggest that real change requires collective outrage and investment in healthcare infrastructure, including adding beds, staffing, and aftercare capacity.</p>

          <p>Lionel Messi's Inter Miami have been terrible lately, and his complaints to the referee only made their situation worse. In the immediate aftermath of Sunday’s game, Major League Soccer wishes those dynamics didn’t exist at all. Messi claimed referee Guido Gonzales Jr told him he was not aware of the backpass rule. MLS Wrap Up, the league-produced review show, mentioned the call in passing but never showed the incident on-screen. It is the chaos of the league that is its easiest and most enticing entry point, with referee controversy working just as well to drum up attention here as it does everywhere else in the world.</p>

He contends that Biden's decision to prioritize identity and sycophancy over political talent in his running mate selection proved detrimental to the party's chances in 2024.</p>

The ruling reverses a trial court's decision, with the appeals panel emphasizing the need for clear and specific guidelines. The lawsuit also addressed the board’s policy of notifying parents about issues related to a student’s gender identity, but the panel said that issue was no longer in play because state law prohibits such automatic notification policies.</p>
