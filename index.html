          <p>The head of the Royal Navy, Adm Sir Ben Key, has been temporarily removed from his duties pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct, according to the Ministry of Defence. While the MoD has not released specific details regarding the allegations, reports suggest that Adm Key is suspected of having an affair with a subordinate. Earlier in the week, the MoD issued a statement saying that the First Sea Lord had "stepped back due to private reasons." The investigation is ongoing, and further comments are being withheld at this time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has temporarily restrained the Trump administration from implementing extensive cuts and layoffs at over 20 federal agencies, which are part of a federal cost-cutting initiative led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Judge Susan Illston ruled that the federal employee unions are likely to prove that the Trump administration's attempts to downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or placing workers on administrative leave to comply with the February executive order. The order remains in effect for at least 14 days as the judge reviews the case.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, leading to significant flight delays and cancellations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that the telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar display at Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark airspace. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the Trump administration's plan to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system and replace outdated equipment, which has been blamed for hundreds of delays at Newark over the last two weeks.

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested by federal authorities for allegedly trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in his city. The arrest occurred after Baraka demanded to be let through a security gate at the Delaney Hall ICE facility, where protesters and members of the state's congressional caucus were gathered. Baraka's administration had previously filed a lawsuit to block the opening of the detention facility, arguing that its operators failed to obtain proper permits.

          <p>The military conflict between India and Pakistan has escalated sharply, with Pakistan accusing India of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting at least three of its air bases, including a key installation near Islamabad. Pakistan retaliated with short-range surface-to-surface missiles, targeting Indian air bases and a missile storage facility. The conflict began after militants killed 26 people in India-controlled Kashmir, leading India to conduct airstrikes on Pakistan. The use of drones has become a significant feature of the conflict, marking the first time the unmanned aerial vehicles are being used by the two countries against each other.</p>

          <p>China reported a drop in consumer prices in April, with the national consumer price index (CPI) decreasing by 0.1% year-on-year. This decline has fueled fears of deflation, as the country grapples with the economic impact of high tariffs on shipments between China and the United States. Despite potential negotiations to ease the trade war, tariffs remain high and continue to hinder bilateral trade, leading to increasing stockpiles of unsold goods for Chinese manufacturers. Food prices declined by 0.2% from a year earlier, while service prices rose by 0.3%.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have introduced the first components of a $4 trillion tax cut plan, intending to maintain key aspects of President Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax cuts while implementing more generous tax breaks for a limited time. The legislation seeks to secure the larger standard deduction and lower individual income tax rates established in 2017. Additionally, the bill proposes temporary expansions, such as adding $1,000 to the standard deduction for individuals annually until 2029 and temporarily increasing the child tax credit to $2,500 for the next four years. The bill is expected to face opposition from Democrats, who criticize the plans to cut spending on programs for the poor to finance tax cuts benefiting the wealthy.</p>

The lawsuit alleged that the companies failed to update their labels regarding the risk of diminished response to Plavix in about 30% of patients, particularly non-Caucasians. While a court had previously ordered the companies to pay $916 million, a settlement was reached for the lower amount before an appeal was decided.

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will not be running in the upcoming Georgia Senate race, citing her unwillingness to fight for a team that refuses to win. Greene's decision follows Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's decision not to seek the Republican nomination, leaving the primary field largely open. Representative Buddy Carter has entered the race, branding himself as a "MAGA Warrior" and a close ally of President Trump. The Georgia seat is crucial for both parties' Senate ambitions, as Republicans aim to oust Ossoff to expand their majority, while Democrats seek to maintain control of the Senate.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Immigration</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, to address the issue of illegal immigration, according to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Miller argued that the Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus in cases of rebellion or invasion. Legal experts contend that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without congressional authorization. The potential suspension of habeas corpus would represent a significant escalation of the administration's immigration policy, curtailing a right enshrined in the Constitution.</p>

          <p>An upcoming BBC drama series, The Bombing of Pan Am 103, dramatizes the 1988 Lockerbie plane bombing and how flaws in the initial victim response influenced the FBI's handling of 9/11. The series highlights how families spoke out about the flaws in the system, leading to reforms such as strengthened travel warning systems and tighter baggage screening. Screenwriter Gillian Roger Park says the families "made history" and a lot of the protocols introduced in the aftermath of 9/11 were based on what they campaigned for. Former lawyer Jonathan Lee hopes the show shines a light on the human stories behind the horror.</p>
