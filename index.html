        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large maritime festival, the Tall Ships Races, has begun in Aberdeen, Scotland, expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors. The four-day event features nearly 50 impressive vessels from around the world, including the towering Dar Mlodziezy from Poland and the BAP Union from Peru. Alongside the ships, the festival offers a vibrant lineup of free entertainment, including concerts by bands like Deacon Blue and Kaiser Chiefs, street food, and family-friendly activities. Organizers hope to create a "party city" atmosphere, though a weather warning for heavy rain has been issued for the weekend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovenia's parliament has passed legislation to legalize medically-assisted suicide for terminally-ill adults, making it the first Eastern European nation to do so. The law, which passed with a 50-34 vote, follows a referendum where 55% of voters supported the right to end-of-life autonomy. To be eligible, individuals must be mentally competent, suffering from an incurable condition with no prospect of improvement, and have exhausted all treatment options. While hailed as a landmark decision for compassion and dignity, implementation is pending as detailed procedures and oversight mechanisms are finalized.</p>

          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence has indicated it will not offer compensation to thousands of Afghans whose personal data was leaked in February 2022 but were not evacuated to Britain. The MoD stated it would "robustly defend against any legal action," citing an independent review that concluded it was "highly unlikely" individuals would be targeted solely for being on the leaked spreadsheet. This decision comes after a super-injunction on publicizing the leak was lifted, affecting over 19,000 people who now fear retribution from the Taliban and are seeking safety for their families.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic primary for mayor is seen by many as a significant moment for Muslim and South Asian American representation in politics. The 33-year-old assemblyman's platform, focusing on affordability and Palestinian rights, has resonated with a diverse coalition of voters, including working-class communities and Muslims nationwide. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, his campaign's success suggests a shift in what voters value, prioritizing substantive policies over identity alone. Supporters view his rise as a sign of hope and a challenge to long-standing assumptions about who can lead America's largest city.</p>

          <p>A fireworks display at the Rheinkirmes fair in Düsseldorf, Germany, resulted in injuries to 19 people, four of them seriously, after some rockets malfunctioned.

The incident, which injured at least one child, prompted organizers to end the event early to prevent panic.

          <h2>Tyler Glasnow Shows Positive Signs in Return Despite Dodgers' Shutout Loss to Brewers</h2>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers losing 2-0 to the Milwaukee Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a promising performance in his second start since returning from injury. Glasnow pitched six strong innings, allowing only one run while showcasing increased fastball velocity and a more confident, less analytical approach on the mound. This outing is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on the health and dependability of their high-priced pitcher for their long-term success. However, the team's offense was shut down by Brewers' pitcher Quinn Priester, leading to a disappointing loss.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China next week. The hearing will focus on countering what the committee calls China's "economic coercion against democracies." During Morrison's term, relations between Australia and China deteriorated significantly, particularly after Australia called for an investigation into COVID-19's origins, leading to Chinese tariffs on Australian goods. His testimony comes as his successor, Anthony Albanese, has been working to warm relations with Beijing, highlighting a shift in diplomatic approach between the two administrations.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a new regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation, which received bipartisan support, is designed to legitimize dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies for payments and is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry. The law requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets, a move supporters claim will bolster the U.S. dollar's global status. However, critics argue the bill lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections and could make the U.S. financial system vulnerable to exploitation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese scientists suggests that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, can inadvertently speed up the spread of cancer to other organs. The research provides a potential explanation for why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis in areas like the lungs even after successful initial treatment. The team's findings also identified that using specific drugs alongside chemotherapy could inhibit this process in mice. A clinical trial based on this discovery is now underway with breast cancer patients, offering potential new strategies to improve long-term cancer treatment outcomes.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian court has imposed strict restrictions on former president Jair Bolsonaro, ordering him to wear an ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew. The measures were implemented over fears he might flee the country while facing trial for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn the 2023 election results. The order from Judge Alexandre de Moraes also bans Bolsonaro from social media and from communicating with his son and foreign diplomats. This development occurs amid rising tensions with the U.S., where the Trump administration has threatened tariffs and revoked visas for Brazilian officials.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal, its owner Rupert Murdoch, and its parent companies. The suit stems from a report detailing a sexually suggestive birthday letter allegedly sent by Trump to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter, and his lawsuit targets the reporters and companies involved. In response, the newspaper's publisher, Dow Jones, expressed full confidence in the accuracy of its reporting and stated it would vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the elimination of its primary scientific research division, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). The move is part of a broader agency reorganization and is expected to impact over 1,500 employees, including many leading scientists, with the stated goal of saving $748.8 million. Former agency officials and scientists have condemned the decision, warning that dismantling the internationally respected research body will weaken public health protections and shift environmental costs onto communities. The ORD conducts critical research on pollutants, water safety, and other environmental health risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beijing's disciplinary authorities are highlighting a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of grass-roots government mismanagement and wasteful spending. The "Yaohan Longevity City" project, which was supposed to be a major health tourism hub, was left largely abandoned after poor decision-making and a broken capital chain. China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection condemned the project as a "severe waste of resources" and a case of local officials making "blind decisions." This public shaming serves as a warning to other local governments across China to avoid similar impractical initiatives.</p>

          <p>Scientists from the Chinese army are proposing a new "super X-rail gun" design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval rail gun, a world-first, is limited by its power, capping projectiles at a weight too light to be effective in naval warfare. The new design involves cross-stacking two rail guns, which researchers claim will increase bore pressure enough to fire a 30kg shell at seven times the speed of sound. This innovation aims to overcome existing limitations and advance the military application of electromagnetic weapon technology.</p>
