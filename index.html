          <p>China's market regulator has initiated a preliminary anti-monopoly probe into U.S. chip giant Nvidia, alleging violations related to its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, which was initially approved with specific conditions. This ongoing investigation, announced by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), has caused Nvidia's shares to decline and is expected to further complicate trade discussions between Chinese and U.S. officials currently underway in Madrid. The SAMR has not yet detailed the precise nature of Nvidia's alleged breaches of the country's anti-monopoly laws, but the move signals increasing scrutiny. This action is part of a broader trend of rising technology tensions between Beijing and Washington, following other recent Chinese probes into the semiconductor industry, and highlights ongoing economic friction.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Defense Intelligence unit claims to have successfully detected and destroyed a valuable Russian Buk-M3 surface-to-air missile system, estimated at $40-50 million, in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. This assertion, which cannot be independently verified, aligns with Ukraine's strategy of increasing attacks on Russian infrastructure, such as oil refineries and railway lines, to disrupt military fuel supplies and Moscow's war funding. Concurrently, Russia's ambassador to Romania has dismissed allegations of a Russian drone incursion into Romanian airspace as an "unfounded provocation" by Kyiv, further escalating diplomatic tensions. These events underscore the ongoing military and political complexities of the conflict.</p>

          <p>North Korean officials have declared the country's status as a nuclear state "irreversible," asserting it is permanently specified in their basic law and beyond international interference. This statement from North Korea's Permanent Mission to the U.N. coincides with the launch of "Freedom Edge 25," joint military exercises involving the United States, South Korea, and Japan off Jeju Island. North Korea criticized these drills as a "grave challenge" to its security interests and accused the U.S. of hypocrisy regarding nuclear proliferation. The International Atomic Energy Agency, despite North Korea's claims, continues to maintain readiness to verify the DPRK's nuclear program, which it considers a clear violation of U.N. resolutions.</p>

Rubio conveyed U.S. dissatisfaction, stating the need to "move forward and figure out what comes next."

These so-called legacy chips are widely used in cost-sensitive applications like smart home appliances and industrial motor drives. Major U.S. chipmakers such as Texas Instruments, ON Semiconductor, Analog Devices, and Broadcom are expected to be significantly affected by this investigation. The probe was initiated based on a request from the Jiangsu Provincial Semiconductor Industry Association, which reported a "continuous and significant decline" in prices for the U.S.-origin products throughout 2024, suggesting competitive dumping practices.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is facing mounting pressure and public frustration from within the Labour party following the sacking of U.S. ambassador Peter Mandelson. Mandelson was dismissed last week after emails surfaced showing supportive messages he sent following convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein's guilty plea to sex offenses. Labour backbenchers are openly questioning Starmer's leadership and judgment, with some predicting his departure if upcoming May elections yield poor results for the party. This scandal, coupled with a previous high-profile resignation, highlights a bleak mood within the parliamentary Labour party and widespread concerns about the government's direction, with Downing Street hoping to reset the agenda during President Trump's visit.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that 14 NHS trusts will undergo investigations into their maternity services as part of a rapid review, prompted by persistent "failures in the system." Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the "extraordinary courage" of bereaved families who have come forward with issues spanning over 15 years. However, some families, forming the Maternity Safety Alliance, have criticized the review as "not fit for purpose," advocating for a statutory public inquiry instead. Past inquiries have revealed systemic problems like ignoring women's voices and poor leadership, with a recent report finding over half of maternity buildings unsatisfactory, underscoring a crisis in care.</p>

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated that Russia would pursue any EU states or officials involved in seizing its property through "all possible ways," including international and national courts, and "out of court" measures, potentially for the rest of the century. The EU is reportedly considering using cash balances from maturing Russian bonds to fund a "Reparations Loan" for Ukraine.

          <p>China's $12.7 trillion stock market rally appears poised for further growth, driven by a continued shift of household savings into equities, according to central bank data.

The M1 money-supply gauge, which measures readily available funds for investment, rose 6% year-on-year, its fastest since January 2023. This significant rotation is attributed to low-interest-rate policies that are diminishing returns from traditional banking deposits, thereby making equities a more attractive investment option for households.

          <h2>Emmy Awards Host's Charity Bit Undermines Acceptance Speeches and Broadcast Flow</h2>

          <p>Emmy Awards host Nate Bargatze's recurring bit, where he docked $1,000 from a charity donation for every second a winner's speech ran over, ultimately detracted from the ceremony. Intended to keep the show timely and highlight the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the gag instead led to rushed speeches and a heavily scripted broadcast. Critics argue the bit undermined the emotional impact of wins, particularly for unexpected recipients like Jeff Hiller and Hannah Einbinder, whose passionate message was overshadowed by the on-screen deduction graphic. The article concludes that despite Bargatze's intentions, the awards lacked genuine fun and sincerity, with the charity donation ultimately unaffected by speech lengths.</p>

          <p>Aldi UK chief executive Giles Hurley has warned that any new measures in the upcoming Budget that further increase costs for employers could lead to higher food prices for consumers. Hurley noted that the impact of last year's National Insurance rise and the cost of new packaging rules has already "rippled through to prices on the shelf edge." He urged careful consideration of policies affecting business operating costs, citing a "very real risk" of them translating into food price hikes. While global factors contribute to inflation, Hurley believes some domestic policy decisions have inadvertently created a more stubborn inflation situation in the UK compared to other developed countries, with food inflation expected to reach 5.7% by year-end.</p>

          <p>China is exploring an ambitious initiative to convert existing coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities, specifically utilizing fourth-generation reactors. Proposed by China Energy Engineering Group Co., Ltd (CEEC), the nation’s top state-owned energy infrastructure builder, this "C2N" initiative aims to provide a direct path to decarbonization while preserving valuable energy infrastructure, especially in coastal areas. China, which currently possesses over 1.19 terawatts of coal-fired capacity and expects 100 gigawatts to retire by 2030, sees this as a strategic move. Researchers involved believe these advanced reactors could also enhance site safety requirements and secure greater public acceptance, contributing significantly to the nation's clean energy transition goals.</p>

          <p>Two years after devastating wildfires, Maui youth continue to experience mounting mental health challenges, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD, exacerbated by an ongoing shortage of specialists. Over a third of Maui students lost a family member, were injured, or had a parent lose a job, leading to isolation and difficulty concentrating in school. Despite increased demand, the number of child psychiatrists on the island has halved. While the state education department has tried to bolster staff, hiring remains difficult due to Maui's high cost of living. Programs like the Maui Hero Project are offering alternative support, but stigma, particularly in certain communities, hinders access to traditional counseling.</p>

Rooney questioned the lack of progression and clear patterns of play, highlighting Amorim's 36% win rate across all competitions as the worst for any permanent United manager since World War Two.

          <p>Netflix's drama "Adolescence" achieved an Emmy sweep, winning several top prizes, largely due to its acclaimed one-take filming technique across all four hour-long episodes. This unique shooting style enhanced the immersive depiction of a teenage boy accused of stabbing a classmate, and the show's exploration of social media's impact on youth resonated widely. Co-created by Stephen Graham, the series was inspired by real-life teen stabbings, aiming to spark public discussion on societal issues, even leading to government support for its availability in schools. Breakout star Owen Cooper, though previously acting in drama classes, gained significant recognition for his powerful performance, especially in a chamber piece episode with a child psychologist, showcasing his range.</p>
