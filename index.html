          <p>Sources indicate that Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel is expected to close at $55 per share after receiving clearance from President Trump, who referred to the deal as a "partnership."

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, outlined proposals to alleviate financial pressures on families, including tax breaks for married couples and the removal of the two-child benefit limit. Farage emphasized that these measures are intended to support lower-paid workers and families, rather than promoting a "benefits culture." The party also aims to raise the income tax threshold to Â£20,000, funding these initiatives by scrapping net-zero climate measures and cutting public sector diversity initiatives. However, Stuart Adam, a senior economist, raised concerns about the feasibility of funding these expensive proposals. </p>

          <p>National Public Radio (NPR) is suing the Trump administration over an executive order to cut federal funding, alleging that the order violates the First Amendment's protection of free speech and the press.

The lawsuit seeks to block the order and declare it unconstitutional, asserting that it threatens the public radio system. NPR receives only 1% of its revenue directly from the federal government, with the largest share coming from corporate sponsorships.</p>

          <p>Conflicting claims from Israel, Hamas, and the Trump administration have created confusion regarding the progress of cease-fire talks aimed at freeing hostages held in Gaza. While Hamas claimed to have accepted a proposal from Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, Witkoff denied the claim. Prime Minister Netanyahu hinted at potential progress but later blamed Hamas for the impasse. The back-and-forth has left families of hostages and Palestinians in Gaza in a state of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Consumer confidence improved in May after a period of decline, coinciding with the Trump administration's easing of tariffs. The rebound in consumer sentiment was seen across all age and income demographics, ending five consecutive months of decline.
