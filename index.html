          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A draft executive order reportedly prepared for President Trump's signature proposes sweeping changes to the State Department, including shuttering embassies in Southern Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and international organizations. The order also suggests consolidating regional bureaus and altering the Foreign Service Officer Test to prioritize alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. The New York Times initially reported on the document, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded on X, stating the report was "fake news". The draft order says that any current foreign services officers or civil service personnel who do not want to take part in the new regional organization structure or "serve the interests of the administration may elect to voluntarily separate from the department through a one-time buyout and transition program".</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that the El Salvadorian government initially attempted to prevent him from seeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from Maryland, but later reversed course. Van Hollen met with Abrego Garcia after holding press conferences highlighting the violation of international law. The senator accused the Salvadoran government of staging photos during the meeting to portray Abrego Garcia as being in paradise, while he is being held in one of the most notorious prisons in the world. Abrego Garcia's deportation occurred due to an "administrative error," and a legal battle continues regarding his return to the U.S.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee addressed concerns about President Trump's proposed tariffs, noting anxieties among Midwest business leaders regarding their potential impact on operations.

He expressed hope that the current trade situation could lead to a new "golden age of global trade," while acknowledging the risk of preemptive purchasing distorting economic activity.

            <p>Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, accusing Senator Chris Van Hollen of meeting with an MS-13 gang member. Homan argued that due process rights are more limited under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which the administration invoked to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants. He also denied that any migrant is being labeled a gang member solely based on tattoos, stating it's one of many factors considered. Homan's defense of the law came hours before the Supreme Court temporarily halted its use to deport Venezuelans being held in Texas.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's stance on immigration reveals a preference for the wealthy, aligning with the market's view of citizenship as a commodity. While most dislike the idea of treating national belonging as a commodity, Trump's focus on attracting affluent immigrants mirrors the existing "golden-visa" schemes offered by many countries. This approach underscores a transactional view of immigration, prioritizing economic gain over other considerations.</p>

            <p>An Israeli investigation into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics last month in Gaza found "professional failures" and will result in the firing of a deputy commander. The investigation cited "poor night visibility" and an "operational misunderstanding" as factors, but said there was no evidence of execution. The findings asserted that six of those killed were Hamas members. Palestinians and human rights groups have repeatedly accused Israel's military of failing to properly investigate or whitewashing misconduct by its troops.</p>

Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week to seek answers about the detention and safety of Abrego Garcia, who was deported in March to the country’s notorious CECOT prison, despite a 2019 court order prohibiting his removal due to safety fears. The Trump administration alleged he was affiliated with the MS-13 gang -- an accusation his attorneys and his family firmly deny.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in a massive natural gas project in Alaska to reach trade deals that would satisfy President Trump and avoid high U.S. tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the Alaska LNG project could play an important role in trade negotiations, helping to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. The Alaska LNG project has three major pieces: The pipeline, a gas processing plant on the North Slope and a plant to liquify the gas for export at Nikiski, Alaska. Glenfarne expects to reach a final investment decision in the next six to 12 months on the first phase of the project.</p>

The CEO believes this presents a "big opportunity to change the way American people consume this stuff". Prolonged tariffs could cause a "huge uptick" in short-term sales of used and refurbished devices, especially smartphones. (not investment advice)</p>
