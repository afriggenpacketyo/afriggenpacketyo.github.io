          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld California's ban on large-capacity ammunition magazines, reversing a lower court decision. The court found the ban consistent with historical weapons restrictions, focusing on the limitation of a firearm's capacity rather than its overall use.  This ruling is a significant win for California and other states supporting similar gun control measures.</p>
