          <p>Microsoft's shares experienced a significant surge of approximately 9% following the release of its Q3 2025 earnings report, which exceeded expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company's Azure cloud business was a primary driver of this success, and Microsoft provided a surprisingly robust forecast for the upcoming period. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the company's plans to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, allocating $80 billion in fiscal 2025 for data center construction. Despite concerns about potential impacts from tariffs, the optimistic forecast provided reassurance to investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mark Carney faces a divided Canada following a historic election victory, with young voters increasingly concerned about housing affordability, crime, and the cost of living. This marks a shift from 2015 when young voters helped sweep Justin Trudeau to power, now younger Canadians, particularly men, have rallied behind the Conservatives. While Carney campaigned heavily on standing up to Trump, affordability and a broken "Canadian promise" were central to Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's message. The Liberals managed to gain seats, but the Conservatives made significant gains, blocking the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government.</p>

          <p>Meta's Reality Labs reported an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the first quarter, with sales of $412 million, reflecting the company's ongoing investment in the metaverse.

Since late 2020, Reality Labs has accumulated losses exceeding $60 billion. While the losses were slightly lower than analysts' expectations, the division's sales fell short, indicating continued challenges in the metaverse venture.</p>

Investors appeared to shrug off the GDP contraction, possibly due to the understanding that it was influenced by a surge in imports ahead of anticipated tariffs.

          <p>The Hamilton County Coroner's Office has identified Daniel Thomas Halloran as the tenth victim recovered from Fox Hollow Farm, the residence of suspected serial killer Herb Baumeister. Halloran's remains were identified through DNA analysis, adding a significant development to the ongoing efforts to provide answers to the families of those who went missing. Police believe Baumeister lured gay men to his home in the 1980s and 1990s, where he allegedly killed them and buried their bodies across his property. Baumeister committed suicide in 1996 shortly after bone fragments were discovered on his property.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed that egg prices are falling, but some food economists say this statement is misleading, as retail egg prices have climbed during his term. While wholesale egg prices have dropped, the economists say that the price paid by shoppers has increased significantly since he took office. Economists also reject attributing blame for egg prices to any president, as a president exerts minimal influence over day-to-day egg costs. The increase in retail egg prices has been attributed to bird flu decimating the egg supply while demand persists.</p>

          <p>President Trump has taken about executive actions in his first 100 days in office. Congress has enacted just five laws, a low watermark in modern congressional history for this time period. There has been no significant push back as he legislates through executive actions on everything from immigration to election law, ignores statutes that require the White House to inform the Senate on certain actions before taking them, upends the economy with tariffs that Congress could technically block and, most notably, allowed billionaire Elon Musk to lead a government "department" — without confirmation hearings before the Senate.</p>
