          <h2>Australian Inflation Eases, Strengthening Case for Interest Rate Reduction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 21:37:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's second-quarter inflation fell to 2.1%, its lowest since early 2021, just below economists' forecasts and nearing the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range. This drop supports the possibility of an interest rate cut, especially given weaker-than-expected GDP growth and a rising unemployment rate. While the RBA previously held rates steady to confirm the inflation trend, analysts now anticipate a 25-basis-point cut at the upcoming August meeting. The central bank acknowledges that temporary cost-of-living relief contributed to the lower figures and expects inflation to rise again later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno, Nevada, resulted in three fatalities and three injuries. The suspect, identified as 26-year-old Dakota Hawver, opened fire in the valet area and parking lot, killing three individuals and wounding two others before being shot by police. A casino security guard who confronted the gunman was also shot but survived. Hawver, who had no known connection to the victims, fired approximately 80 rounds from a legally purchased handgun and remains in critical condition. Authorities are investigating the motive for what appears to be a random act of violence.</p>

          <h2>Former Trump Attorney Emil Bove Confirmed to Federal Appeals Court Amid Controversy</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Emil Bove, a former lawyer for Donald Trump, to a lifetime seat on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The confirmation was highly contentious, with Democrats raising alarms over whistleblower allegations that Bove previously advocated for defying court orders related to immigration. Further accusations suggest Bove misled Congress about his involvement in dropping corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams. Despite these claims and opposition from Democrats and two Republicans, the Senate voted 50-49 to approve his nomination, which critics argue prioritizes loyalty over judicial temperament.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old Lyme disease researcher, who has been a legal U.S. permanent resident since arriving from South Korea at age five, was detained at San Francisco International Airport for over a week. Tae Heung “Will” Kim was returning from a family wedding when he was taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection, with officials citing a 15-year-old misdemeanor marijuana charge as a violation of his status. His lawyer and family have struggled to get information about his whereabouts or the specific reasons for his prolonged detention. The case highlights the precarious situation of green card holders with old, minor offenses on their records.</p>

          <p>Google has transformed its Android operating system into the world's largest earthquake detection network by utilizing the accelerometers built into billions of smartphones. When multiple phones in an area detect the initial, subtle P-waves of an earthquake, Google's system sends alerts to users who are about to experience the more destructive S-waves. This provides a crucial warning of 15 to 60 seconds, allowing people time to seek safety. The system has successfully detected over 11,000 earthquakes since 2021 with very few false alarms, while iPhone users can access similar alerts through third-party apps.</p>

He says he felt abandoned by the system, which only provided more coordinated support after he entered end-of-life care.

As part of the settlement, UCLA admitted it had "fallen short" and will fund Jewish community groups and an anti-antisemitism initiative.

The zoo stated that conflicts among the baboons had increased and that attempts to re-home them or use contraception had failed, leaving culling as a "legitimate last resort." Animal rights groups have condemned the action as "avoidable and illegal," filing a criminal complaint and arguing the zoo followed irresponsible breeding policies.

His lawyers contend that Combs is not a flight risk or a danger to the community, and that his conviction for transporting sex workers across state lines should not require mandatory detention.

A note found on the 27-year-old shooter, who played high school football, requested his brain be studied for CTE and blamed the NFL for concealing the dangers of the sport. CTE can only be diagnosed posthumously but is associated with mood swings, dementia, and violent behavior. The incident draws parallels to other cases of violence and suicide involving former football players diagnosed with CTE, highlighting the disease's devastating consequences.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo is now home to two male Tasmanian devils, named Danny Zuko and Crush, marking the species' return to the zoo for the first time in five years. The animals, which are native only to the island of Tasmania, arrived from a conservation organization in Australia. Tasmanian devils are the world's largest carnivorous marsupials and are known for their powerful bite and noisy feeding habits. They are currently classified as an endangered species, primarily due to a contagious and fatal cancer known as Devil Facial Tumor Disease, as well as threats from human conflict.</p>

          <p>The parents of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy who died from a rare brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, are speaking out to raise awareness. The infection occurs when contaminated freshwater is forced up the nose, and Jaysen contracted it after swimming in Lake Murray, South Carolina. His family emphasized that they were unaware of the risk and want to ensure no other family suffers a similar tragedy, urging for better public information about the dangers of swimming in warm freshwater lakes. Health officials recommend using nose clips when jumping into such bodies of water.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has voted to draft a rule prohibiting law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from concealing their identities with masks or gaiters while on duty in unincorporated areas. The move responds to recent widespread immigration raids where armed federal agents with hidden faces have detained people. While supporters say the measure is needed to protect civil rights and ensure accountability, its legal enforceability against federal agents is highly questionable due to the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. The county appears prepared for a legal battle with the federal government over the issue.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration has proposed a full repeal of its 2009 "endangerment finding," the legal and scientific foundation that allows it to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. This move would dismantle the basis for nearly all U.S. climate regulations, including emissions standards for vehicles and power plants. While the administration frames this as a major deregulatory action, environmental groups and state regulators have condemned it as a dangerous rejection of climate science. California officials, however, noted that much of their state-level climate action predates the finding and vowed to continue their efforts.</p>

This marks the first major redesign in 50 years, potentially moving away from the tradition of featuring notable historical figures. The bank is considering new themes such as nature, innovation, architecture, or key historical events. Some of the public suggestions include images of the Angel of the North sculpture and the Sycamore Gap tree.

While praising Figma's ubiquitous product, strong growth, and profitability, Cramer warned that its initial public offering price is already expensive and could become overvalued if the stock surges upon debut. He also raised concerns about the broader weakness in the enterprise software sector and the potential for increased spending on AI to negatively impact the company's profit margins in the coming years. The planned IPO values Figma at up to $18.8 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

A new development company, Platform4, will be formed to oversee the "brownfield first" approach. However, industry groups are skeptical, pointing out that tens of thousands of homes are already stalled by planning delays and regulatory hurdles, and that the construction industry lacks the capacity to meet these new targets.</p>

The BBC found cases where soldiers were extorted by police, had their bank accounts drained by recruitment center staff, or were defrauded by their own commanders. Despite President Putin's promise to treat these soldiers as a "new elite," their large cash payments make them attractive targets. In one instance, police officers charged with robbing a soldier avoided prosecution by signing up to fight in Ukraine themselves under a new law.</p>

          <p>Atmospheric scientists are warning that air travel is becoming bumpier due to climate change, with the frequency of severe turbulence expected to double or triple in the coming decades. A warmer atmosphere intensifies thunderstorms and strengthens the jet stream, both of which are major causes of turbulence. This has already led to a 55% increase in severe turbulence over the busy North Atlantic route in the last 40 years. While planes are built to withstand these forces, the increase could lead to more injuries for unbelted passengers and higher economic costs for airlines.</p>

          <p>Recent polling indicates that tax cuts are no longer the guaranteed political winners they once were, with a majority of Americans opposing the latest Republican tax cut and spending reduction bill. This trend follows the unpopularity of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which were correctly perceived by the public as primarily benefiting the wealthy. The article suggests this shift is due to lower overall tax burdens, rising income inequality, and a growing awareness that tax cuts do not pay for themselves and contribute to the national debt.
