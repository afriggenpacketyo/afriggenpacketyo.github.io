          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed the discovery of the remains of all seven workers who went missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse. The facility, operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks, and the property is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. As federal and state agencies investigate the cause, families of the victims are demanding justice and have hired an attorney. The county has declared a local emergency to streamline the response and investigation into the fatal incident.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an end to the nearly two-decade-long requirement for airline passengers to remove their shoes during airport security screenings. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the change aims to streamline the screening process and make travel more enjoyable for the public while maintaining safety. The mandate was first implemented by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as a security measure following an attempted shoe bombing in 2001. This policy shift marks a significant change in airport security procedures across the United States.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire, exacerbated by strong winds and dry conditions, has reached the edge of Marseille, France's second-largest city, prompting the mobilization of a thousand firefighters. The blaze, which authorities say was sparked by a car fire, has led to the evacuation of at least 400 residents and injured nine firefighters. Officials have urged residents to stay indoors as crews battle to control the fire, which has burned approximately 700 hectares. The incident highlights a broader trend of intense wildfires across Southern Europe, with other major fires reported in Spain and Greece amid a severe heatwave.</p>

          <p>Doctors are expressing growing concern that the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in healthcare facilities is creating an atmosphere of fear, deterring some people from seeking necessary medical attention. While ICE agents are often present to get medical clearance for detainees, their appearance has reportedly caused patients to delay critical care. Medical experts emphasize that this can have severe health consequences and point to potential ethics violations by agents. In response, some hospitals are now providing staff with guidance on how to interact with federal law enforcement to protect patient privacy and rights.</p>

Despite the catastrophic damage that killed over 180 crew members, the remaining crew heroically saved the ship, sailing it to Australia for repairs.

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that follows a national security investigation into the matter. The new tax, which the Commerce Department expects to be effective by the end of the month, caused U.S. copper prices to jump significantly. This decision aligns copper tariffs with the 50% levy already placed on steel and aluminum, part of a broader strategy to protect and boost American industry. The move is expected to benefit domestic producers but may harm the many U.S. firms that rely on imported copper for manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting approaching at the end of July, financial experts suggest that savers should act strategically to capitalize on currently high Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates. Potential interest rate cuts could lower returns, making it crucial to lock in favorable rates now. Savers are advised to carefully calculate their deposit amounts and term lengths to avoid early withdrawal penalties, shop at online banks which often offer higher rates, and secure a high-rate CD as soon as possible. This proactive approach can help protect savings and maximize interest earnings in a potentially changing economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

The film portrays Superman, played by David Corenswet, as somewhat obtuse and overwhelmed, a departure from traditional depictions. While the plot is entertaining and filled with quirky side characters and villains, the movie's tone is seen as recklessly shape-shifting. The reviewer suggests that while Gunn confidently injects his signature weirdness, the film falters when it attempts to be sincere, making the Man of Steel feel more like a Man of Marshmallow.</p>

The triple lock policy ensures the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR report warns that the UK's public finances are in a vulnerable position, with rising debt exacerbated by government reversals on planned spending cuts.

          <p>This opinion article challenges the progressive argument that universal social programs are more politically durable than means-tested ones, using the recent Republican cuts to Medicaid as a case study. The author contends that the political resilience of programs like Social Security and Medicare stems more from benefiting the elderly, a powerful voting bloc, rather than their universal nature. The article points out that means-tested programs have actually grown substantially over the past few decades, while some universal benefits like unemployment insurance have been cut. It concludes that the substantive policy benefits of universalism are stronger than the political ones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. is still in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Control Enforcement (ICE), causing him to miss a court date for a weapons charge in Los Angeles. His lawyer confirmed his detention, which comes as Chávez Jr. also faces an active arrest warrant in Mexico for alleged arms and drug trafficking. According to authorities, Chávez Jr. entered the U.S. on a tourist visa and his application for permanent residency was denied due to fraudulent statements. Mexican officials have noted they expect to prosecute him if he is returned to the country.</p>

          <p>The family of an off-duty San Diego police officer has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Riverside County after he was found dead outside a jail just minutes after his release. The officer, Lawrence David Orso, was arrested on suspicion of DUI and had a blood alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit. The lawsuit alleges that jail staff were deliberately indifferent, ignoring his complaints of chest pains and other signs of medical distress, and released him while still intoxicated. The family claims the county failed to establish proper policies and training that could have prevented his death.</p>

          <p>During a Cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump suggested the possibility of a federal takeover of New York City and Washington, D.C. Citing concerns over the potential election of a socialist mayor in New York and crime rates in the nation's capital, Trump claimed the White House has "tremendous power" to run places when necessary. He stated his administration is considering taking over D.C. to ensure it is run "flawlessly," despite police data showing a decrease in crime.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers and restaurants are facing searingly high beef prices, which reached a record $5.98 per pound in May. The primary cause is a classic case of supply and demand, with American appetite for beef remaining strong while the nation's cattle herd has shrunk to its smallest size since the 1960s. This reduction in supply is largely attributed to years of widespread drought, which diminished feedstock and forced ranchers to sell off cattle. Experts predict that due to the long biological cycle of raising cattle, prices are likely to remain elevated for the next several years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This review praises the new James Gunn-directed "Superman" movie for its consciously sincere and lighthearted tone, which sets it apart from previous, grimmer adaptations. The film presents Superman not as a lone god but as one of many heroes, a choice that helps define his unique, altruistic character. The reviewer finds the film's whimsical energy, reminiscent of Saturday-morning cartoons, to be a brilliant and refreshing shift for the superhero genre. By embracing sincerity and silliness, the movie successfully makes a case for the enduring appeal of a hero who stands for unambiguous good.</p>
