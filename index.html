        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Both Russian and Ukrainian forces are actively testing and utilizing AI in the conflict, focusing on target identification, intelligence gathering, and de-mining efforts. The Ukrainian army analyzes over 50,000 video streams monthly using AI to identify and map targets, enhancing strategic planning and resource allocation. AI-based software enables drones to autonomously lock onto targets and complete missions without jamming, potentially evolving into fully autonomous weapons systems controlled via smartphone apps. Concerns remain about the ethical implications and potential for friendly fire, leading to cautious implementation and the need for human oversight in critical decisions, as Ukraine works towards thousands of such systems by 2026. </p>

          <p>Republican and Democratic lawmakers are at odds over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. The subsidies have enabled millions to afford health insurance, with enrollment doubling since 2020. Without these tax credits, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that millions of Americans will be unable to afford health insurance by 2035, potentially doubling the average ACA premium. Advocates emphasize the ACA marketplaces as a safety net for gig workers and entrepreneurs, urging lawmakers to find a resolution to prevent significant financial burdens and healthcare access issues for affected individuals. </p>

          <p>Robert Roberson, convicted in 2002 for the death of his 2-year-old daughter, has been granted a stay of execution by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. His defense argues that his daughter's death was misdiagnosed as shaken baby syndrome and was instead caused by severe viral and bacterial pneumonia. The court has ordered a review of Roberson's arguments under Texas' junk science law, referencing the case of Andrew Roark, who was exonerated after a similar diagnosis was discredited. Roberson's legal team also highlights his undiagnosed autism at the time of conviction, hoping his case will set a precedent for those with developmental disabilities in the criminal justice system. </p>

Sanders dismissed the comments as an attempt to start something, emphasizing positivity moving forward. He also addressed his silent response to teammate Dillon Gabriel being named the starting quarterback, acknowledging that his playfulness may not always be well-received. Sanders remains in a positive mental space, thankful for any role he has on the team, as he sees a "light at the end of the tunnel" amidst the quarterback situation. </p>

          <p>A near-complete skeleton discovered on Dorset's Jurassic coast has been identified as a new species of ichthyosaur, named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or the "sword dragon of Dorset". The dolphin-sized marine reptile, dating back approximately 185 million years, is the only known example of its kind and fills a crucial gap in ichthyosaur evolution. Marks on its skull suggest it may have been killed by a bite to the head from a larger ichthyosaur, while malformed limb bones and teeth indicate serious injury or disease during its life. The discovery highlights the dangerous nature of life in the Mesozoic oceans and the ongoing significance of Dorset's Jurassic Coast for paleontological finds. </p>

          <p>A Microsoft engineer has resigned after 13 years, citing the company's continued sale of cloud services to the Israeli military and the lack of internal discussion about the conflict in Gaza. The engineer referenced reports of Microsoft subscriptions used by the Israeli military and claimed that internal communication systems for raising concerns were cut off. This resignation follows months of employee protests and previous firings related to the company's cloud business with the Israeli military. Outside Microsoft headquarters, employees and community members protested, urging the company to cut ties with Israel after a ceasefire took effect in Gaza. </p>

According to the Israeli government, 48 Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza, with only 20 believed to be alive, while the conflict has resulted in a large number of Palestinian casualties. </p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us," ruling that the lyrics were opinion. The lawsuit alleged that UMG published and promoted the track, which included false pedophilia allegations against Drake, tarnishing his reputation. UMG welcomed the dismissal, while Drake's spokesperson stated their intention to appeal the ruling. Drake has also filed similar complaints against iHeartMedia and Spotify, alleging conspiracies to inflate streams of "Not Like Us," which both companies deny. </p>

Those returning included children who refused to attend Russian schools and faced threats of removal from their families. Ukraine estimates that Russia has illegally deported or forcibly displaced thousands of children, a claim Russia denies, stating it is ensuring their safety from wartime hostilities. </p>

          <p>The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office in Arizona misused millions of dollars intended to remedy racial profiling, spending it on unrelated expenses, according to an expert's report. The funds, allocated for compliance costs in a racial profiling case stemming from Joe Arpaio's immigration crackdowns, were used for personnel costs, vehicle purchases, and office renovations. The report criticizes the lack of oversight by Maricopa County and its governing board, revealing that a significant portion of the spending was either wrongly attributed or improperly prorated to the compliance fund. The sheriff's office has stated that its attorneys are reviewing the report. </p>

          <p>There's a growing trend of tech billionaires, like Mark Zuckerberg, investing in sprawling compounds with shelters and self-sustaining resources, fueling speculation about "apocalypse insurance." Concerns about potential threats like war, climate change, and artificial intelligence (AI) are driving this trend, with some computer scientists advocating for underground shelters for AI researchers. While proponents tout AI's potential benefits, like curing diseases and solving climate change, others fear its misuse or the possibility of AI surpassing human control. As governments and researchers grapple with AI's risks, the super-rich continue to prepare for potential doomsday scenarios. </p>

With Bellingham sidelined, Rogers seized the opportunity to cement his place in the team, demonstrating Tuchel's willingness to look beyond established stars. The victory, achieved without several key players, reinforces Tuchel's vision and challenges the notion of indispensable players in the England squad. </p>

          <p>Following the arrest of a suspect in connection with the Palisades fire, residents are directing blame towards L.A. City Hall for alleged failures in fire prevention and response. The focus is shifting to the city's handling of the fire, particularly the draining of a key reservoir and the response after the initial fire was extinguished. Legal experts debate the potential for civil liability, citing California law that gives public officials broad immunity from failing to provide fire protection. While some believe the arrest weakens civil cases against the government, others argue that negligence in preparation and response remains a viable legal avenue. </p>
