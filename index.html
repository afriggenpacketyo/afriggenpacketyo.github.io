          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie is backing Democratic Representative Ro Khanna's call to subpoena Jeffrey Epstein's estate for more extensive documentation beyond just personal letters. Massie advocates for a full release of financial records to "follow the money," as well as unsealing the controversial plea bargain Epstein received. The two congressmen have co-sponsored legislation to force a vote on the release of the files, which would have the force of law while protecting victim identities. They are now seeking a discharge petition to bypass the House Speaker and bring the matter to the floor for a vote.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old boy in foster care has died in Alabama after being left in a hot vehicle by a state contractor. The child was supposed to be transported to a daycare program following a supervised visit with his father but was instead found unresponsive hours later. The incident has prompted a police investigation into potential criminal charges and calls from state lawmakers to examine existing laws to prevent future tragedies. The state's Department of Human Resources confirmed the contractor terminated the employee involved.</p>

          <p>A new savings vehicle, dubbed the "Trump IRA," allows parents to contribute up to $5,000 annually for children under 18, with some government incentives. While the tax-free growth is a benefit, this article suggests other strategies may be more effective for long-term savings. Alternatives like 529 education accounts, custodial Roth IRAs, and whole life insurance policies are presented as potentially superior options for building a child's financial future. The analysis concludes that while the new IRA is a nice giveaway, parents should consider more robust investment strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian authorities reported that a Ukrainian drone attack targeted St. Petersburg, causing a five-hour closure of the city's main airport.

          <p>Global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek have shown significant improvements in employee well-being, including less burnout and better work-life balance. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key reason for increased happiness is not just the extra day off but also a heightened sense of effectiveness at work. To fit their tasks into fewer hours, teams are forced to streamline processes and eliminate busywork, making them feel more productive and in control. This enhanced professional accomplishment has a major positive impact on their overall well-being, a benefit researchers had not initially expected.</p>

This approach, termed "egonomics," is evident in his use of tariffs and his ventures in cryptocurrency, which serve to increase his fortune regardless of their actual economic outcomes.

          <p>An 18-year-old woman has sustained potentially life-changing head injuries in an incident on a ride at the Netley Marsh Steam and Craft Show in Hampshire, England. The teenager was hospitalized following the event, which occurred late Saturday night. Police are now coordinating with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to investigate the circumstances of the accident. A witness who administered first aid described the injury as a "degloving injury." Despite the incident, the fair organizers announced they would remain open for the final day of the show.</p>

          <p>Top delegations from the European Union and the United States have converged at Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland for critical talks aimed at averting a trade war. The meeting, which Trump stated has a "50/50" chance of success, seeks to establish a framework agreement before a U.S.-imposed August 1 deadline. If an agreement is not reached, the U.S. has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on all EU imports. An agreement in principle is reportedly centered on a 15% baseline tariff on EU goods, a compromise seen as a painful but necessary price for restoring market stability.</p>

Known as the "CEO monk" for his commercialization of the temple's heritage, Shi has been a controversial figure since becoming abbot in 1999.

The complicit mechanics are accused of creating additional holes in the tires and then overcharging for the repairs. Despite a recent crackdown by authorities, the fast-moving nature of the con makes it difficult to stop, leaving many motorists frustrated and out of pocket.</p>

          <p>Former rugby player Matt Dawson argues that for the current British and Irish Lions team to be truly remembered as legendary, they must complete a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia. While celebrating the series victory is significant, Dawson compares the situation to his 1997 Lions team, which won the series 2-0 but lost the final test. He notes that the current squad has openly discussed the goal of a clean sweep, a mindset he attributes to their high ability and the relative weakness of the Australian side. He suggests some team rotation will be necessary to maintain freshness and achieve this historic goal.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee has launched a billboard campaign in several Republican-leaning states to blame Donald Trump for the financial struggles of rural hospitals. The billboards, placed near four specific hospitals, highlight the impact of the more than $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts included in Trump's major legislative act. Rural hospitals have been closing at an alarming rate for over a decade, and analyses predict these cuts will exacerbate the crisis, potentially closing hundreds more. The DNC aims to connect the policy directly to the potential loss of local healthcare for voters in these areas.</p>

Merchants in one of the oldest Chinatowns in the country report that while customer traffic remains steady, spending has dropped significantly on imported items like furniture, tea, and traditional foods. One long-time supermarket owner noted that costs for these goods have risen by an average of 50%, forcing customers to cut back on their purchases and threatening the financial stability of local businesses.</p>

          <p>This article posits that Donald Trump's presidency is inadvertently making socialism more appealing to a new generation of Americans. The author argues that by blatantly favoring insiders, staffing his administration with plutocrats, and vilifying free markets, Trump validates critiques of capitalism as a rigged system. This perceived corruption and economic inequality, combined with the financial precarity felt by many, has created an opening for politicians championing socialist ideas. The piece suggests that to counter this trend, proponents of market economics must address the system's flaws and cleanse it of the cronyism that Trump's tenure has highlighted.</p>

          <p>This essay laments the disappearance of comprehensive event listings from publications like The New York Times and The Village Voice, arguing their loss harms artists, audiences, and the cultural ecosystem. The author, a musician, recalls how these listings were once a vital guide for discovering new art and a crucial platform for emerging performers to gain visibility. In today's algorithm-driven media landscape, cultural coverage has narrowed to focus on established celebrities, making it harder for niche subcultures to survive. The piece calls for a revival of listings as a public good that documents and nurtures a city's vibrant artistic life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping in the U.S. is rooted in a post-Civil War system where employers, unwilling to pay formerly enslaved workers a fair wage, encouraged customers to provide a small gratuity instead. This legacy persists today through the federal tipped minimum wage of $2.13 per hour, which requires customer tips to make up the difference to the standard minimum wage. According to the Economic Policy Institute, this system effectively shifts the responsibility of paying wages from the employer to the consumer. Powerful lobbying by groups like the National Restaurant Association has fought to preserve this system for decades.</p>
