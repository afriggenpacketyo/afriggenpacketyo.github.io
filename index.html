          <p>A deadly explosion outside a California fertility clinic is being investigated as an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI. The suspect, identified as Guy Edward Bartkus, died in the explosion, which also injured four others. Bartkus reportedly held views against bringing people into the world against their will, according to CBS reports. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers (ARC), stated that no staff members were hurt, and there was no damage to any of its eggs, embryos, and reproductive material. Out of caution, sheriff‚Äôs deputies will be conducting extra patrols at fertility centers located in San Bernardino county.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has launched a "go-team" to investigate after a Mexican Navy sailing ship, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams stated that a preliminary investigation revealed no damage to the bridge itself, which has since been reopened to the public.

          <p>Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, resigned from her post due to policy differences with the Trump administration regarding the approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In an interview on "Face the Nation," Brink explained that she could no longer in good faith carry out the administration's policy, which she felt put pressure on Ukraine rather than Russia. Brink emphasized the need for the U.S. to maintain pressure on Russia to end the war and support Ukraine in defending its sovereignty. She argued that appeasement only leads to more war and that the U.S. should prioritize keeping Ukraine free, deterring Russia, and sending a clear message to China.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Walmart will "eat some of the tariffs" in response to President Trump's demands, claiming he received this assurance from Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon. This follows Walmart's earlier announcement that it would need to raise prices for consumers due to the impact of Trump's tariffs on international trade. Trump had criticized the company, insisting it should absorb the tariffs instead of passing the costs onto customers. Bessent indicated that Walmart is promising to absorb some of the tariffs, similar to what it did in previous years, while also acknowledging that the company had to present a worst-case scenario during its earnings call.</p>

          <p>Hawaiian lei making, an ancient tradition introduced by early Polynesian settlers, is facing challenges due to suburban sprawl and climate change. The exquisite array of flowers used in leis is becoming scarcer, with an estimated 90 percent now imported from countries like Thailand. Andrew Mau, who owns a small Oahu boutique, noted the impact firsthand, with reduced flower stocks forcing lei-makers to adapt. He creates "forever leis" from wood beads, seeds, and shells as a response to the perishability of flowers. Meleana Estes, a Hawaiian native, emphasizes that a lei is an "expression of aloha" and a gesture of love.</p>

          <p>China Telecom Quantum Group has launched what it claims is the world's first commercial cryptography system impervious to hacking, even by quantum computers. The system integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to create an end-to-end quantum-secure architecture. The company said it had also completed the world‚Äôs first cross-regional quantum-encrypted phone call over a distance of more than 1,000km (600 miles) between Beijing and the city of Hefei using this integrated system. This combination forms an end-to-end quantum-secure architecture for core uses such as real-time communication, data protection and trusted identity authentication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent conceded that Walmart may pass along some of the costs from President Trump's tariffs to consumers through higher prices. Bessent said that he spoke with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, stressing in two news show interviews that what he thought really mattered for Walmart customers was the decline in gasoline prices. Gas is averaging roughly $3.18 a gallon, down from a year ago but also higher over the past week, according to AAA. Trump had previously warned Walmart to avoid raising prices. Walmart executives said that higher prices began to appear on their shelves in late April and accelerated this month.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly stated that President Trump should reject the Qatari royal family's gift of a $400 million jet, citing national security concerns. Pence highlighted Qatar's history of "playing both sides" and argued that accepting such a gift is inconsistent with U.S. security and intelligence needs. Experts have also warned that converting the jet into Air Force One could take years and cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump stated the plane will be formally given to the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>

          <p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore vetoed legislation that aimed to study and recommend reparations for harms caused by slavery and racial discrimination, setting himself apart from other Democratic governors. Moore stated that the state had sufficiently studied the legacy of slavery and that now is the time for continued action, not another study. He plans to introduce legislation next year to address racial disparities in wealth, homeownership, education, and food security. The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland expressed disappointment, hinting at a possible override of the veto. The bill was modeled after similar measures in California and Illinois.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat with 277 people on board crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday evening, killing two people and injuring more than a dozen others who were on board in a dramatic scene along the New York City waterfront, according to authorities. The captain, who was maneuvering the ship, lost power and mechanical function, and the current "caused the ship to go right into the pillar of the bridge, hitting the mass of the ship where there was a couple of sailors," NYPD Chief Wilson Aramboles said during a press briefing. No one fell into the water, according to officials. Officials said they did not believe the bridge sustained any structural damage. The bridge has since been reopened to traffic, Adams said just after midnight, adding that "we can confirm that the bridge sustained no damage" after a preliminary inspection.</p>

The intensified diplomacy came as Russia launched its largest drone barrage against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, after the first direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in years failed to yield a ceasefire.</p>
