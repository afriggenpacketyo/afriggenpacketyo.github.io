          <p>Celebrating its tenth anniversary, Ethereum has evolved from a fledgling concept into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Launched by Vitalik Buterin and a small team, the platform's ability to run smart contracts has enabled the rise of decentralized finance, NFTs, and tokenized assets, attracting major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank. Despite its success, Buterin warns about the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption grows. The blockchain continues to be favored by institutions for its stability and security, solidifying its role as the essential plumbing for a new generation of financial services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has launched an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump. This inquiry follows a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's prosecutorial activities before the 2024 election were politically motivated and violated the Hatch Act, which restricts partisan political activities by federal employees. While Smith's team has not commented, the OSC is an independent agency that can only recommend disciplinary action, not file criminal charges. The Justice Department is also conducting its own investigation into prosecutors who pursued cases against Trump.</p>

          <p>The German government has declared the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza to be "very insufficient" despite recent efforts, including a 9.6-ton airdrop by its own military. This statement comes as a UN-affiliated organization warns of a "worse-case" famine scenario unfolding in the territory. Meanwhile, US envoy Steve Witkoff visited Tel Aviv, promising families of Israeli hostages that he would work to secure their release. The situation remains dire, with aid groups criticizing airdrops as inefficient and the World Health Organization reporting a spike in malnutrition-related deaths in July.</p>

          <p>England concluded day three of the fifth Test against India at 50-1, needing another 324 runs to secure a series victory. The hosts made steady progress in their chase of 374 before opener Zak Crawley was bowled by Mohammed Siraj just before the close of play. Earlier, India built a formidable lead of 396, largely thanks to a brilliant century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a surprise fifty from nightwatchman Akash Deep. Despite some sloppy fielding from England, who dropped six catches, the improved batting conditions set the stage for a tense and potentially record-breaking final two days at The Oval.</p>

          <p>Cat Eccles, the Member of Parliament for Stourbridge, is being investigated by the parliamentary standards commissioner for failing to declare a sponsored trip within the required timeframe. The inquiry focuses on a possible breach of rules after Eccles registered a trip to Israel and the Palestinian Territories, valued at £2,600 and sponsored by Labour Friends of Israel, after the 28-day deadline. The visit took place in late May but was not officially registered until early July. A spokesperson for the MP attributed the delay to an administrative error, stating there was no intention to hide the trip.</p>

The attack occurred Friday morning, and the suspect, an Army veteran who lived next to the bar, fled the scene. Authorities have since located his vehicle but are still searching for Brown, who is considered armed and dangerous, in a mountainous area west of the town. The incident has left the small community of 9,000 people on edge, with law enforcement urging residents to remain indoors and lock their doors.</p>

          <p>Chicago Sky's Angel Reese jokingly pointed a finger at Las Vegas Aces player Sydney Colson following a bizarre incident during a game against the Golden State Valkyries. For the second time in a week at a Valkyries road game, a neon green dildo was thrown onto the court, causing a brief stoppage in play. On social media, Reese humorously asked Colson why she kept throwing her "mean green" in different arenas, to which Colson replied with a smirking photo. The lighthearted exchange follows a similar incident during a Valkyries game against the Indiana Fever earlier in the week.</p>

The incident highlights the inherent risks of digital "whisper networks," which gained popularity for safety but can lack accountability and become vulnerable to attack.

          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for news, relying on influencers and algorithm-driven content rather than traditional media outlets. According to a Pew Research poll, 39% of adults under 30 regularly get news from the app, favoring creators like Aaron Parnas who provide rapid-fire updates on current events. This shift is driven by a preference for convenience and simplified explanations, though it raises concerns about misinformation and the lack of in-depth reporting. Despite fears over the platform's Chinese ownership and content quality, news consumption on TikTok is becoming a significant trend that reshapes how information is delivered and consumed.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited President Trump's sweeping asylum ban, ruling that his administration cannot expel migrants to countries where they might face torture or persecution. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision centers on a proclamation that effectively closed the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the standard asylum process, it affirmed that migrants must still be allowed to apply for other mandatory humanitarian protections. The ruling upholds a lower court's finding that the proclamation defied U.S. laws requiring the government to hear such claims.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race or speaking Spanish.

The decision addresses high-profile operations in Southern California that have caused widespread fear and led to protests, reinforcing legal guardrails against indiscriminate enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions won their series against Australia 2-1, but their ambition of a historic 3-0 whitewash was denied in a 22-12 defeat in the final Test in Sydney. Australia, powered by the immense presence of lock Will Skelton, delivered a dominant performance to outplay the Lions in difficult, rainy conditions. While the Lions celebrated with the trophy, the feeling was bittersweet, as players and coaches acknowledged they had not reached their full potential during the tour. The series will be remembered for its close margins, particularly the dramatic Lions victory in the second Test in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>Women are increasingly turning to specialized retreats to navigate the often-challenging transition of menopause, seeking education and community to cope with symptoms like hot flashes, anxiety, and mood swings. Programs like the M/Power retreat at Canyon Ranch offer a holistic approach, combining medical diagnostics, fitness activities like yoga and weight training, and counseling. For many, these retreats provide a space to break the silence surrounding menopause, a topic historically under-discussed in medicine and society. This trend reflects a generational shift where women are demanding better solutions and openly addressing the physical and mental health impacts of this life stage.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in quarterly profit, primarily due to a $3.76 billion writedown on its investment in Kraft Heinz. The food giant, which Berkshire helped create, is struggling with changing consumer tastes and is exploring a potential spinoff of major brands. While Berkshire's operating earnings remained relatively stable, driven by strong performance from its insurance and railroad businesses, the paper loss on Kraft Heinz highlights the challenges in the processed food sector. The company continues to hold a massive cash pile of over $344 billion, as Buffett finds few attractive large-scale acquisition opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza report that international aid efforts, including airdrops and deliveries from the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), are failing to alleviate a catastrophic hunger crisis. Residents describe the search for food as a "death journey," with hundreds reportedly killed near aid distribution sites since May. For those on the ground, diplomatic discussions about Palestinian statehood feel disconnected from the immediate reality of starvation and survival. They view the current aid as symbolic and insufficient, with one mother stating, "This is not life... We have reached the peak of starvation."</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that aligning your workout routine with your personality traits could make exercise more enjoyable and sustainable. Researchers found that extroverts often prefer high-intensity group activities like HIIT or team sports, while conscientious individuals are drawn to goal-oriented training like preparing for a marathon. Conversely, those with more anxious tendencies may prefer private, one-on-one sessions, and introverts gravitate toward solo activities like running or at-home yoga. The findings suggest that instead of forcing a particular regimen, people can find greater success by exploring different forms of exercise that better match their innate disposition.</p>

          <p>Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who passed away at 54, is remembered for his nuanced and pivotal role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." As the charming but academically challenged son, Warner skillfully balanced comedy with vulnerability, evolving the character from a carefree slacker into a young man with purpose. His character's journey, which included a diagnosis of dyslexia, challenged his parents' narrow definitions of success and provided a relatable arc for many viewers. Warner's performance was central to the groundbreaking series, showcasing a complex Black teenager who finds his identity not by simply meeting expectations, but by growing into his own person.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just hours after the agency released a surprisingly weak July jobs report. The report showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs, far below expectations, and included a steep downward revision of 258,000 jobs for the previous two months. Trump, who had confirmed McEntarfer to her role, claimed without evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes and ordered her immediate dismissal. The move drew swift criticism from economists and policy experts, who warned it threatens the integrity of nonpartisan federal economic data.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv on Saturday, reaffirming his commitment to securing their release from Gaza. The meeting took place during a protest where families urged the Israeli government to do more to bring their loved ones home, nearly 22 months after their abduction by Hamas. Witkoff reportedly promised the families that he and President Trump would work to return the remaining captives. The visit comes amid growing fears for the hostages' well-being, intensified by recent videos released by militant groups showing captives in a visibly fragile state.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced that Hamas's Beit Hanun Battalion, which operated in northern Gaza, has been defeated, with a group of its terrorists surrendering to IDF troops on Saturday. The militants reportedly emerged from a tunnel shaft and, during on-site questioning, revealed the location of a nearby weapons cache containing firearms, grenades, and vests. According to the IDF, the terrorists decided to surrender after a fellow militant was killed in a clash with Israeli forces. The Givati Brigade has been operating in the area to dismantle the battalion, which posed a threat to nearby Israeli communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, has drawn sharp criticism from senior members of his own party. Following a weak jobs report, Trump dismissed McEntarfer and alleged the numbers were rigged, a move that Republican senators including Cynthia Lummis and Thom Tillis called problematic and "impetuous." Lawmakers expressed concern that firing the statistician over unfavorable but accurate data undermines the credibility of objective government statistics and politicizes vital economic information. The backlash from within the GOP highlights a significant split over the president's handling of nonpartisan federal agencies.</p>
