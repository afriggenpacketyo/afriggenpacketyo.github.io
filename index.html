          <h2>Airbnb Issues Disappointing Revenue Guidance Due to Economic Uncertainties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 16:59:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airbnb's first-quarter earnings were generally in line with expectations, but the company's revenue forecast for the second quarter fell short of analysts' estimates, causing shares to decline. The company cited broader economic uncertainties, particularly in the U.S., as a factor contributing to the disappointing guidance. While North America experienced strong year-over-year growth, there was softness in travel from Canada to the U.S. towards the end of the quarter. Airbnb also announced upcoming platform updates that will extend beyond accommodations and reported removing 450,000 listings since updating its host quality system in 2023.</p>

          <p>Amazon's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, driven by growth in its cloud computing and advertising divisions, but the company's guidance for the current period was weak, causing the stock to fall. Amazon noted that tariffs and trade policies were among the factors that could affect its guidance, a concern that was not mentioned in the previous quarter's outlook. The company faces significant exposure to tariffs, particularly through its retail unit, as it sources some products from China, which is subject to increased levies. Despite this, advertising sales were a bright spot, increasing 19% year-over-year. </p>

          <p>The U.S. military's standards for investigating sexual assault reports and sexual harassment complaints will remain unchanged despite a department-wide review into how discrimination claims are handled, according to a senior official. This announcement comes as the Defense Department faces potential staff reductions due to the Trump administration's efforts to trim government personnel. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has called for a review of equal opportunity programs to ensure discrimination complaints are not being weaponized, but officials maintain this directive will not affect how sexual assault reports are handled. The number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court's intervention in its effort to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. The administration argues that a lower court's decision to delay the termination of the TPS program for Venezuelans undermines the Executive Branch's authority over immigration policy. The Homeland Security Secretary revoked the TPS designation in February, but a federal judge blocked the move, citing negative stereotypes. The program, established in 1990, provides temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries facing wars or natural disasters.</p>

          <p>National security adviser Mike Waltz is departing from his White House position and will be nominated as the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations.

          <p>A top Trump appointee in the Justice Department ordered an aggressive investigation into student protesters at Columbia University who protested Israel’s conduct in Gaza, prompting concerns among career prosecutors and investigators about political motivation and potential First Amendment violations.

Prosecutors feared the investigation was a pretext for an intimidation and deportation campaign against student protesters.

The original Ice Bucket Challenge raised $115 million for ALS research and patient care.

AWS revenue increased 17% to $29.27 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations. Despite the slower growth, AWS operating income totaled $11.55 billion, exceeding estimates, and the segment's operating margin reached its widest point since at least 2014. The company is investing in data centers containing chips for training and running artificial intelligence models, and expects the cost of AI for customers to decrease over time.</p>

          <p>Historically, gold has demonstrated consistent performance during economic downturns, as investors seek safety amid market volatility and economic uncertainty. During recessions, stock markets tend to decline, consumer confidence drops, and uncertainty prevails, leading investors to flock to gold. Gold has generally gained value during past recessions, such as the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors contributing to this trend include gold's safe-haven appeal, central bank responses to monetary policy, concerns about currency devaluation, and the need for portfolio diversification.

          <p>Approximately 1,500 lawyers gathered in Foley Square in Manhattan as part of the National Law Day of Action, protesting President Trump's threats against judges and the legal system. Similar actions took place in around 50 cities across the nation, led by lawyers who believe President Trump is threatening the foundation of America’s legal system. Attendees pointed to a range of actions, including Mr. Trump’s targeting of law firms he viewed as hostile, wrongful deportations and the arrest of a Wisconsin judge on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement. Organizers instructed attendees to dress “as if they were appearing in court,” and encouraged them to carry pocket Constitutions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas ruled that the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act does not authorize President Trump to deport Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang.

The judge stated that the President's invocation of the AEA exceeded the scope of the statute and was unlawful.
