          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated she declined an offer from US President Donald Trump to deploy American troops to Mexico to combat drug cartels, emphasizing Mexico's sovereignty and inviolability. Sheinbaum asserted that while collaboration and information sharing are welcome, the presence of the US Army would never be accepted on Mexican soil. She also mentioned urging Trump to halt weapons smuggling from the US into Mexico, which contributes significantly to cartel violence. Trump's previous rhetoric has repeatedly angered Mexicans, including accusations of Mexico being dominated by criminal cartels involved in murder, sexual assault, and torture.</p>

          <p>Residents in Boca Chica Village, Texas, are voting on incorporating the area as Starbase, a new municipality dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX. The proposed city, largely populated by SpaceX employees, would establish a local government with power over planning and taxation. Nearby residents have voiced opposition, citing environmental concerns and potential restrictions on access to Boca Chica Beach. A state bill could grant Starbase officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to the beach and state park during rocket launches, a move opposed by Cameron County officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law allocating $1 billion for school vouchers, enabling over 5 million students to use state funds for private education, marking a significant win for conservatives pushing for school choice. The new law makes Texas the 16th state to offer public funds for private education to all students, with each eligible student receiving up to $10,000 annually beginning in the 2026-27 school year. Supporters argue that vouchers empower parents, while opponents contend they drain money from public schools and primarily benefit wealthier families. The law requires private school students to take standardized tests and includes audits of voucher-accepting schools.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell, Leader of the House of Commons, apologized after describing grooming gangs as a "dog whistle" issue during a debate on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions, sparking criticism from political opponents.

The exchange occurred during a discussion about Reform UK's pledge to cut diversity and inclusion roles within councils, prompted by a question about a Channel 4 documentary on sexual assault gangs. Powell stated that as a constituency MP she has dealt with horrendous cases of child exploitation.</p>

          <p>Federal officials cleared a large homeless encampment in Oregon's Deschutes National Forest, forcing dozens of people to relocate to other wooded areas. The sweep, described as the largest eviction of a homeless camp in recent history, displaced an estimated 100 to 200 people due to concerns about wildfires, trash, and reports of violence. With shelters at capacity and housing costs in Bend, Oregon, soaring, advocates argue that the eviction is not a solution to homelessness but merely shifts the problem elsewhere. Many of those evicted moved to a different part of the Deschutes National Forest or to an area known as ‚ÄúDirt World.‚Äù</p>

          <p>A CBS analyst recounted an incident where Shedeur Sanders, then quarterback for Colorado, skipped a scheduled pregame meeting with CBS, raising questions about his attitude and professionalism. The analyst noted that Sanders was seen sitting in a pickup truck outside the hotel instead of attending the meeting, which is unusual for a high-profile player. This incident, along with other reports of Sanders' behavior during NFL Draft interviews, has led some to question his commitment and whether he is getting out of things he is supposed to be doing. Sanders was eventually drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round.</p>

          <p>Arsenal plans to use the "anger and rage" from their recent loss to Bournemouth as motivation against PSG, focusing on improving their defense against set-pieces, which have been a significant weakness this season. Of the goals Arsenal has conceded this season, 38.7% have come from set-piece situations, the most in the English top flight. The team must score against PSG while preventing them from scoring, a difficult task given PSG's strong home record. Arsenal has struggled to maintain leads in recent games, dropping 21 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season.</p>

The move has raised concerns in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been restricted for over two months, and prompted anxiety among families of hostages held by Hamas. International mediators have been trying to broker a cease-fire to exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners, but both sides have conflicting demands. Prime Minister Netanyahu has suggested that defeating Hamas is a higher priority than securing the release of the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>As Democrats in California seek to rebound from recent losses, the question of whether their leaders are too old has emerged. A resolution initiated by San Francisco Democrats calls for exploring a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders, sparking debate within the party. The discussion follows concerns about leaders like Senator Dianne Feinstein, who remained in office despite health issues, and former President Joseph R. Biden, whose age was a campaign issue. While some support the idea of making way for younger candidates, others argue that age limits are discriminatory and disregard the value of experience.</p>

          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located on a volcano in Hawaii, has achieved a milestone by capturing a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this tool will enhance their ability to predict potentially damaging solar storms that can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) stated that the image was taken during technical testing, highlighting the VTF's potential. The telescope's construction faced years of protests due to its placement on land considered sacred by many native Hawaiians.</p>
