          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has called on European nations to unite with Beijing against Washington's tariffs, accusing the US of weaponizing them and violating WTO rules. Wang stated that the US's actions harm global economies and represent a regression in international relations. He emphasized China's commitment to openness and mutually beneficial cooperation, echoing President Xi Jinping's call for countries to resist protectionism. This appeal comes amid rising trade tensions between the US and China, with tariffs significantly impacting goods exchanged between the two nations.</p>
