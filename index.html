          <p>A tragic boat accident in Nigeria's north-central Niger State resulted in the deaths of at least 29 people, with two still unaccounted for, after a vessel carrying over 100 passengers capsized. Rescuers successfully saved 50 individuals from the incident, which occurred when the boat struck a submerged tree stump near the Gausawa community. Authorities attributed the disaster to severe overloading and a collision, highlighting the frequent occurrence of such accidents on Nigeria's river networks due to poor maintenance and lack of safety compliance. This event tragically underscores the urgent need for enhanced maritime safety measures and stricter enforcement to prevent future losses of life in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested the Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court decision that deemed many of its tariffs illegal. The Justice Department warned that the ruling could "unilaterally disarm the United States" and jeopardize the nation's economic stability and trade negotiations. This appeal follows a 7-4 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which stated the president lacked authority under an emergency powers law to impose such sweeping duties. The administration is pushing for an expedited review, emphasizing the high stakes for ongoing trade discussions and national economic policy.</p>

Eyewitnesses described the railway car hurtling down a steep street out of control before crashing violently into a building, causing severe damage. The Portuguese government has declared a nationwide day of mourning and initiated an investigation into the causes of this "unprecedented tragedy." This incident has deeply shocked the capital, which relies on these historic funiculars for both local transport and tourism, prompting widespread condolences from European leaders.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a rise on Thursday, mirroring an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, despite persistent fears about the broader economy. Key indices in Japan, Australia, South Korea, and Hong Kong all showed gains, with Australia's household spending also increasing by 0.5% month-on-month. However, global bond markets remain a focus, with long-dated borrowing costs under pressure, as exemplified by the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield nudging above 5% following a court ruling on Trump's tariffs. The mixed signals indicate a cautious optimism in specific sectors amid wider economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Shares of Nidec Corp plunged by over 22% on Thursday after the Japanese electronics manufacturer announced an independent third-party probe into alleged improper accounting at its Chinese subsidiary, Nidec Techno Motor.

          <p>The Restoration of America Foundation (ROAF), a pro-life organization, is urging the Senate Finance Committee to press Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the removal of safety protocols for the abortion pill mifepristone. ROAF argues that the Biden-era rollback of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements, which allowed telehealth prescriptions and mail-order delivery, endangers women by bypassing crucial medical screenings for complications like ectopic pregnancy. The group contends that these changes leave women vulnerable and shift healthcare costs to taxpayers, emphasizing the need for immediate reinstatement of the essential safeguards to protect public health.</p>

The legislation includes provisions to protect women from being sued and bars men who committed sexual assault from collecting damages.

          <p>The UK and its allies are prepared to offer comprehensive support to Ukraine, both leading up to and following any eventual peace deal, according to the UK defence secretary. This commitment includes ensuring the safety of Ukraine's skies, seas, and land once a resolution is reached, with a top-level meeting in Paris planned to discuss these security guarantees. Despite Russia's defiant stance and intensified aerial attacks, allies are recycling seized Russian assets into military aid and exploring economic pressures. However, Russia has dismissed the idea of foreign troop deployment as unacceptable, highlighting the significant diplomatic challenges ahead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Americans continue to hold a negative view of the U.S. economy, predominantly describing its current state as "uncertain" and "struggling." This sentiment has seen a slight dip over the past month, with a majority expecting prices to continue rising, at least somewhat. The perception of personal financial situations is closely linked to these price changes, with higher-income individuals reporting better conditions. Partisan differences also influence economic evaluations, though no group believes prices are decreasing. Overall, the poll reflects persistent public pessimism and concerns about a potential recession.</p>

          <p>Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, declared on Thursday that Russia considers any potential foreign military deployment in Ukraine "unacceptable" and has no plans to discuss it. This firm rejection comes in response to remarks by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had discussed "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Germany's defense minister had also previously dismissed such suggestions as premature. Russia's stance, as detailed in this article, underscores the deep divisions and high tensions surrounding the ongoing conflict, hindering diplomatic progress towards a resolution.</p>

Tencent's Youtu-Agent framework, for instance, achieved a high score on a web traversal benchmark.

          <p>President Donald Trump has dismissed the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein controversy as "irrelevant" and a "Democrat hoax," despite a bipartisan push in Congress to release all related files. His comments came as survivors of Epstein's sexual assault gathered on Capitol Hill to demand greater transparency and justice. One survivor emotionally challenged Trump's characterization, emphasizing the real trauma experienced by victims and stating this issue is not political. House Speaker Mike Johnson, while urging against a discharge petition, stated that the House Oversight Committee's investigation is the better path to uncover the truth.</p>

While Trump views tariffs as crucial for American industry, critics argue his strategy carries significant diplomatic risks and may face challenges from the U.S. judiciary.

          <p>President Trump has significantly expanded the U.S. military's traditional role, now deploying it more deeply into crime fighting, including lethal strikes against drug smugglers in international waters. This shift challenges the long-standing principle of separating military and law enforcement functions, a vision dating back to the American Revolution. Domestically, the National Guard has been deployed to cities like Los Angeles and Washington D.C. to combat crime. Critics argue that these new tactics, which include designating criminal gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, set problematic precedents and raise serious legal and constitutional questions about the scope of presidential power.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, determining that the situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion." This decision blocks the administration from using the obscure wartime law to remove migrants who sued in Texas, marking a significant legal setback for Trump's immigration strategy. The court found no evidence that the mass migration was an "armed, organized force." The ruling, which grants a preliminary injunction, underscores judicial pushback against the administration's broad interpretation of executive powers in immigration enforcement.</p>
