            <p>The use of disposable vapes is decreasing in the UK as a ban on their sale approaches, with many users switching to refillable and rechargeable options. The ban, set to take effect on June 1, 2025, aims to reduce littering and tackle rising rates of youth vaping. While overall vaping use had been increasing, the announcement of the ban has led to a decline in disposable vape usage, especially among young adults. Experts caution that while reducing youth vaping is important, policies should not discourage smokers from using vapes as a smoking cessation tool.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's emphasis on "defending free speech" is a guise for promoting the interests of US tech companies. The author criticizes the administration's demands regarding digital regulation and taxation, suggesting they prioritize commercial gains over genuine free speech principles. The piece contends that Britain should not take instructions on political freedom from a regime that stifles media independence and subverts democratic alliances, highlighting the complexities of balancing commercial interests with ideological values.</p>

            <p>Due to US President Donald Trump’s scorning of Europe, the European Union is re-engaging with China, including high-level visits and restarted negotiations over EU tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. EU leaders are planning a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in July, despite it being Europe’s turn to host. While some officials express openness to new opportunities with China, others emphasize the limitations of relying on either the US or China, advocating for strengthening Europe's own capabilities.</p>

            <p>President Trump's repeated defiance of court orders, particularly in a deportation case, has sparked concerns about a potential constitutional crisis in the United States. Legal experts and scholars are questioning whether the system of checks and balances is at risk if the president refuses to abide by court rulings. The case involves the deportation of Armando Abrego Garcia, whom the Supreme Court ordered to be returned, but the administration has shown no intention of complying, raising fears about the future of the rule of law.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has issued a cease and desist order against Google for violating Japan's anti-monopoly law. Google required Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. The JFTC found that Google used licenses to mandate the preinstallation and prominent featuring of Google Search and Chrome on devices, as well as excluding rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model. This action aligns with similar crackdowns on Google in the UK and the U.S.</p>

            <p>The White House has implemented a new media policy that significantly restricts access to President Trump, particularly for wire services like the Associated Press. This move comes after a judge ruled that the White House had improperly punished the AP for its coverage. The new policy gives the press secretary greater control over who can question the president, raising concerns about viewpoint discrimination and the government's ability to control independent media coverage. The AP and the White House Correspondents’ Association have expressed strong opposition to the new restrictions.</p>
