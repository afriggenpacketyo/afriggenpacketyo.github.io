          <h2>Trump Urges Fed to Lower Rates Following Positive Jobs Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 09:12:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed his call for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates after a strong April jobs report, arguing that there is no inflation and lower rates would benefit consumers. This continues Trump's pattern of attempting to influence the central bank, despite its intended independence. While he has previously criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump has recently scaled back these criticisms, though he still believes he knows more about interest rates. The president's renewed call comes as the Fed navigates economic growth amid trade tensions and global economic uncertainties.</p>

          <p>According to U.N. officials, civilian deaths in Ukraine have significantly increased since cease-fire talks with Russia began in February, despite the intention of de-escalation. Russian strikes have intensified, targeting cities and resulting in a 46% increase in civilian casualties compared to the same period last year. Analysts suggest this escalation is typical during negotiations as both sides seek to gain leverage before a potential truce. President Trump initiated the talks, and Vice President Vance suggested negotiations could extend into the summer, highlighting the complex and protracted nature of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has achieved its first parliamentary by-election win in Runcorn and Helsby, narrowly defeating Labour after a recount, marking a significant breakthrough for the party. The party also secured its first mayoral victory in Greater Lincolnshire, signaling growing support. Labour managed to retain mayoralties in North Tyneside, Doncaster, and the West of England, albeit with reduced vote shares, as Reform UK emerged as a strong contender in these races. Early council results show Reform UK making substantial gains in seats, primarily at the expense of the Conservatives, reflecting a shift in the political landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing expectations despite concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on trade. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, indicating a stable labor market, and the labor force participation rate edged higher. Health care and transportation sectors led job creation, while the federal government saw a slight decline in employment. Economists suggest it is too early for the tariff impacts to be fully reflected in the jobs data, but they will be closely monitoring future reports.</p>

The professors' donations are intended to help protect the university's financial resources and support staff and students who may be affected by the funding cuts.

          <p>Roche has partnered with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand's petrelintide amylin analog for obesity treatment. The agreement aims to create both a standalone treatment and a combo-therapy with Roche's incretin asset CT-388. Zealand will receive $1.65 billion upfront, with potential milestone payments reaching $5.3 billion. Early clinical data suggests that amylin analogs offer comparable weight reduction to GLP-1s with potentially superior tolerability and lean muscle preservation.</p>

          <p>Hiring slowed in April, with the U.S. adding 177,000 jobs, following President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement, although the reading exceeded economists' expectations.

The jobs data follows a report showing the U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter of 2025, largely due to the tariff proposals.

The New York Times conducted numerous interviews and reviewed court documents to paint a fuller picture of Mr. Abrego Garcia, who represents both sides of the debate: those who support the lengths taken by President Trump to crack down on illegal immigration and those who believe his efforts amount to cruel and Constitution-defying overreach.</p>
