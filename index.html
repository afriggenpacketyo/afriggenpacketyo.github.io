          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts suggest that US tariffs on Chinese imports could put up to 16 million jobs at risk in China, particularly in manufacturing for retail and wholesale. The report highlights communication equipment, apparel, and chemical products as especially vulnerable sectors due to their heavy reliance on US-bound exports. This analysis comes amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods. China's Politburo has pledged to stabilize the economy and support those affected by the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysis of images revealed that the victims were unarmed and posed no threat. Despite a parliamentary committee's call for an investigation and public release of findings, no report has been issued, and no one has been held accountable. The BBC's investigation traced the fatal shots to a police officer and a soldier, highlighting the lack of accountability for the deaths and sparking outrage.</p>
