          <p>Shares of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk declined after President Trump announced his administration's goal to cap GLP-1 weight loss drug prices at $150 per month, a significant reduction from current costs. This move, discussed during a White House event, aims to align U.S. drug prices with those in other developed nations, although negotiations with drugmakers are ongoing. The high cost of these medications has been a barrier for consumers and employers, with only a fifth of large employers currently offering coverage. The article notes that a $150 cash price would make these drugs competitive with cheaper compounded alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Concerns over credit quality are unsettling bank investors following disclosures of significant loan write-offs by regional banks like Zions and Western Alliance, citing alleged fraud from borrowers. This situation, reminiscent of the 2023 banking crisis, highlights risks in lending to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), a rapidly growing sector since the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of potential widespread issues, as banks are a major funding source for these less-regulated lenders. The article indicates that while some losses are small, their near-total wipeout nature is alarming investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old senior at Neshaminy High School, Ryan Duffy, tragically died from Streptococcus Pneumoniae Meningitis after a sudden illness. The school district confirmed his passing, prompting enhanced cleaning protocols, though this type of meningitis is not typically contagious through casual contact. Duffy's obituary highlighted his love for school and games, and the community is mourning his unexpected death. Authorities have not yet determined how he contracted the infection, which causes inflammation of the brain's lining and can be fatal if untreated.</p>

          <p>Following a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump suggested that both Ukraine and Russia should declare victory in the ongoing conflict, stating, "Let history decide!" Zelenskyy indicated that discussions about long-range weapons like Tomahawks were kept private to avoid escalation, despite Trump's earlier openness to a drone-for-Tomahawk exchange. Trump's comments came after a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he plans to meet soon in Budapest to negotiate an end to the fighting.

          <p>Former White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pleaded not guilty to 18 counts related to the improper handling of classified materials after surrendering to federal authorities. U.S. Magistrate Judge Timothy Sullivan informed Bolton of the potential penalties, including significant prison time and fines per count. This article from a Fox News politics newsletter highlights the legal proceedings against Bolton, which stem from allegations of mishandling sensitive government information.

          <p>Northampton Saints climbed to the top of the Prem table after a decisive 36-19 bonus-point victory against Newcastle Red Bulls at Kingston Park. The Saints scored five tries, despite playing half an hour with a man down due to JJ van der Mescht's two sin-bins. Newcastle, still searching for their first league win since last November, managed to close the gap twice but ultimately couldn't capitalize on their numerical advantage. This result places Northampton ahead of reigning champions Bath, showcasing their strong performance early in the season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit the deployment of National Guard members in Illinois, challenging a lower court's block on federalizing troops. The Justice Department argues the lower court's order undermines the President's Commander-in-Chief authority to protect federal immigration officers and property amid protests. Illinois officials, including Governor J.B. Pritzker, have denounced the federalization as "un-American," contending that the protests do not constitute a "rebellion" warranting such action.

This incident marks the first reported survivors from recent U.S. strikes in the Caribbean, which have previously killed dozens.

          <p>Jack in the Box is selling its entire stake in subsidiary Del Taco to Fremont, Calif.-based Yadav Enterprises for $115 million in cash, a deal expected to close in January 2026. This divestiture, part of Jack in the Box's "Jack on Track" revamp, aims to strengthen its balance sheet and allow focus on its core brand. Jack in the Box had acquired Del Taco in 2022 for a significantly higher sum, but the Mexican fast-food chain has recently struggled, closing many Colorado locations. The article notes Yadav Enterprises, already a major franchisee, will acquire over 550 Del Taco restaurants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven fully preserved skeletons discovered in a water well in the ancient Roman city of Mursa, Croatia, have been identified as Roman soldiers killed 1,700 years ago. Researchers determined the men, aged 18-50, were robust but showed signs of early-life stress, and were likely thrown into the well shortly after death. Injuries on some skeletons, including blunt-force trauma and puncture wounds, suggest they may have died during a 260 C.E. battle or skirmish. DNA analysis indicates none were local to the area, with origins possibly in Northern Europe or the Byzantine Empire, offering insights into Roman military history.</p>
