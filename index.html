          <p>Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras alongside her deported mother, asserting that due process was followed because the mother had due process and chose to take her child with her. Homan disputed claims that the child was deported, stating that the mother made the decision. This case is among others involving U.S. citizen children being deported with their parents, including a four-year-old with Stage 4 cancer, raising questions about the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown and the rights of U.S. citizen children. Homan maintained that having a U.S. citizen child does not make immigrants immune from the law.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that he believes Volodymyr Zelenskyy is prepared to relinquish Crimea, despite Zelenskyy's previous insistence that the territory belongs to the Ukrainian people.

German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius criticized a reported U.S. proposal involving Ukraine ceding territory to Russia, calling it a form of capitulation.

The U.S. has responded by stating that North Korea must now be held accountable for prolonging the war, while military experts express concerns about the preparedness of North Korean troops for modern warfare.</p>

Communication equipment, apparel, and chemical products are identified as especially vulnerable due to their high share in U.S.-bound exports from China. The U.S. has imposed tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese imports this year, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing, which has applied tariffs of 125% on U.S. goods.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Ronen Bar, the head of Israel's domestic security agency, Shin Bet, of lying to the country's Supreme Court. This accusation is part of an ongoing legal dispute regarding Netanyahu's attempt to dismiss Bar, with the Prime Minister filing a 13-page affidavit defending his decision. The case was brought by Israeli watchdog organizations and opposition parties, challenging Netanyahu's decision to remove Bar due to a lack of trust.

This has raised hopes that Trump may not force Ukraine into a peace plan that is perceived as heavily favoring Moscow.

Repowering existing wind farms presents economic benefits to operators, including no need to acquire property and the potential for increased electricity output.

The strikes, dubbed Operation Rough Rider, have focused on command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, and weapons manufacturing and storage locations. The campaign has cost well over $1 billion so far, raising concerns about the rapid rate of munitions being used. The U.S. military says the targets included antiship ballistic and cruise missiles and drones used by the Houthis against ships in the Red Sea.</p>
