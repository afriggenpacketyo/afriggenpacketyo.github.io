            <h2>Fintech Stocks Experience Surge Amid Tariff Pause, but Risks Remain</h2>

            <p>Fintech companies like Affirm, Toast, Block, and PayPal are experiencing a rally following the Trump administration's announcement of a 90-day pause on planned tariffs. However, the pause does not eliminate the threat of tariffs, and investors are still pricing in risks such as inflation and potential pullbacks in discretionary spending. Legacy payment networks like Visa and Mastercard continue to benefit from inflation due to their structural ties to nominal GDP, but consumer lending fintechs like Affirm could suffer if consumers reduce spending when the tariff pause is lifted. The article also notes that cross-border payments and remittances may face pressure due to slowing global travel and regulatory scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on most new tariffs and a reduction of the "reciprocal tariff" rate to 10%, excluding China, where tariffs are being increased to 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the 10% tariff rate applies to imports from most countries, including Canada and Mexico, during the 90-day period. The announcement caused an immediate surge in the U.S. stock market. Bessent explained that President Trump wants to be personally involved in negotiations with over 75 countries seeking trade solutions, highlighting the President's strategy to create leverage.</p>

            <p>President Trump initially announced reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, describing it as "Liberation Day," but later paused these tariffs for 90 days for most countries, except China, where tariffs increased to 125%.

Economists forecast that the tariffs will cause inflation and prompt retaliatory tariffs from trade partners. The tariffs went into effect on April 9, in addition to a baseline 10% tariff that took effect on April 5. (not investment advice)</p>

The court did not rule on the lawfulness of the firings but said the Trump administration was likely to succeed in showing that the lower court lacked jurisdiction.

            <p>U.S. crude oil futures surged more than 4% after President Trump announced lower tariff rates for countries except China. The U.S. benchmark rose to close at $62.35 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent also increased. The oil market rebounded after initially falling due to China's retaliatory tariffs. Traders have been concerned about a potential trade war leading to a recession, which would impact crude oil demand. The U.S. and Iran are scheduled to hold talks in Oman to discuss Iran's nuclear program, potentially impacting the global oil market. (not investment advice)</p>

Gregory Meeks, moved to force a vote on terminating the national emergency authority, but this is now unlikely to occur. Johnson argues that Trump's tariffs are having the desired effect and that nations are proposing more free trade agreements with the U.S.</p>
