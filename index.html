The handgun believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered near the suspect. The officer is in stable condition at a local hospital and is expected to recover from his injuries, and the suspect is believed to be connected to the prior shooting of two teens in a Waymo autonomous taxi. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has determined that California violated Title IX by allowing transgender girls to compete on girls' sports teams. The Education Department proposed a resolution requiring California to bar transgender women from women’s sports and strip transgender athletes of records, titles, and awards. If California rejects the proposal, the federal government could terminate the state’s federal education funding. This decision follows an investigation into the California Interscholastic Federation and the California Department of Education, reversing the Biden administration's attempts to expand Title IX protections for transgender students. </p>

The lawsuit challenges Chief Judge George L. Russell III's order that pauses removals until 4 p.m. on the second business day after a habeas corpus petition is filed. The administration argues this violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes presidential authority.

President Trump has maintained the raid had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities and announced that Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth would hold a news conference to address the issue.

These combined factors could raise gas prices by nearly 70 cents per gallon, though experts hesitate to provide an exact estimate. While global oil inventories are expected to increase, providing some relief on oil prices, California consumers will likely not benefit due to these state-specific regulations. The state's gas and diesel excise tax will increase, and amendments to the Low Carbon Fuel Standard program will add further costs to gasoline production. </p>

Despite Trump's earlier promise to lower food prices, many commonly purchased grocery items have increased in price.

          <p>Bernie Sanders reflects on Zohran Mamdani's victory, emphasizing the importance of addressing economic and moral issues, challenging the oligarchy, and fighting for working families. He argues that the Democratic Party must move beyond relying on billionaire donors and focus on policies that improve the lives of ordinary Americans. Sanders highlights Mamdani's progressive economic policies, such as taxing the wealthy, rent control, free public transportation, and publicly owned grocery stores. He suggests that the Democratic Party should listen to the needs of working people and embrace a vision of economic, social, racial, and environmental justice. </p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in a terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has been indicted on 12 federal counts of a hate crime. Soliman is accused of using Molotov cocktails to attack participants in a "Run For Their Lives" event, which aimed to raise awareness for Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The attack injured 15 people and one dog, and Soliman allegedly shouted "Free Palestine!" during the incident. Authorities found a handwritten document in Soliman's car expressing anti-Zionist sentiments, and Soliman reportedly told law enforcement he wanted to take revenge and targeted the event due to the flags and signs displayed. </p>

          <p>The European Union has launched an antitrust investigation into Mars' proposed acquisition of Kellanova, the maker of Pringles, citing concerns that the deal could lead to increased bargaining power for Mars and subsequent price hikes for consumers. The European Commission's preliminary assessment indicates that the multibillion-dollar deal could negatively impact retailers across the 27-nation bloc. EU competition chief Teresa Ribera emphasized the importance of ensuring that the acquisition does not further drive up the cost of shopping baskets, given current inflation and high food prices. Mars has defended the acquisition, stating it would deliver more choice and innovation to consumers. </p>

The president of the Tibetan government-in-exile suggests that selection after the Dalai Lama's demise based on reincarnation remains the more likely scenario. The Dalai Lama is expected to make an announcement at a meeting of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in July, though it is uncertain if the succession issue will be addressed. </p>

One tout claimed to have secured hundreds of tickets for Swift's Eras tour, with some making millions through this practice.
