          <p>Eric Spofford, former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers, was arrested for allegedly conspiring to stalk and intimidate journalists from New Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR) in retaliation for their investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against him.

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), launched in 2011, aimed to reforest the country, but satellite data and field reports suggest it's falling short of its goals. Analysis reveals that some NGP land has experienced deforestation, with native trees being cleared for cash crops. Communities often lack long-term access to the land, leading to unsustainable practices and illegal logging. Despite the program's intent to restore native rainforests, many designated protection areas have little to no tree cover.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing severe drought conditions due to an exceptionally dry spring, impacting agriculture, groundwater levels, and retail prices. The situation is particularly dire in the north and northeast, with soil moisture levels critically low. Experts warn that even if rain falls, it may not effectively recharge groundwater due to the parched soil. The German Association of Towns and Cities has urged citizens to conserve drinking water, while the energy sector faces challenges due to low river levels.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized a new FIA rule imposing stiffer load tests on front wings in Formula 1, calling it a "waste of money." The rule, intended to limit the aerodynamic advantage gained from front wing flexibility, has reportedly changed nothing. Hamilton said the wings still bend, just less, and teams had to spend money on new wings, adding that the change could have been given to charity. The FIA delayed the rule's introduction, expecting teams to introduce new wings anyway as part of their development programs.</p>

Scientists fear that Kennedy's fixation on toxins could divert resources from genetic research, which has led to promising new therapies.
