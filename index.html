          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still in a protracted battle with FEMA over rebuilding funds. Mayor Andrew Gilich reports that the city is owed $34 million for critical sewage and stormwater system upgrades, but disputes over costs and project phases have stalled progress. This situation is not unique, as hundreds of other Katrina relief projects across the region remain incomplete, highlighting ongoing systemic issues and bureaucratic delays within the federal disaster response agency.</p>

          <p>California fire officials are investigating whether the prestigious Hundred Acre winery in Napa Valley played a role in starting the recent Pickett fire. The blaze, which has burned nearly 7,000 acres, originated on the winery's property, and investigators are reportedly looking into whether discarded ashes were the cause. While the winery is cooperating with the investigation, the fire continues to threaten hundreds of buildings in the region, with containment currently at 33%.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its long-standing "customer of size" policy, which previously guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased for comfort and space. Under the new rules, a refund will only be issued if the flight has at least one open seat upon departure, creating financial uncertainty for travelers. Advocates for the plus-size community have called the change heartbreaking, stating it removes a key accessibility feature and adds financial and emotional burdens to flying.</p>

          <p>A new video analysis by BBC Verify has determined that Israel struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack, contrary to initial reports of two strikes. The investigation identified that two separate staircases were hit almost simultaneously, followed by a rapid double-strike on first responders and journalists nine minutes later. This detailed analysis raises further questions about the incident, which has drawn international condemnation, as legal experts weigh whether the attack violated international law.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of U.S. consumers found that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is more likely to be a reason not to buy one of its vehicles than a selling point. According to the report, 35% of respondents said FSD would make them less likely to purchase a Tesla, compared to only 14% who said it would make them more likely. These findings present a challenge for Tesla, as CEO Elon Musk has positioned the company's future on the success of its autonomous driving technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake does not have the authority to unilaterally fire the director of Voice of America (VOA). The decision affirms that the VOA director can only be removed with the backing of a bipartisan advisory board, a firewall established by Congress to protect the broadcaster from political interference. As the board is currently vacant due to dismissals by President Trump, the ruling effectively prevents the director's termination.</p>
