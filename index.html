          <p>In the ongoing Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, singer Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, testified about her relationship with Combs, describing early stages as "sweet and attentive." The jury was shown messages between the two, including loving emails and texts where Ventura expressed deep affection. However, the defense argued Ventura willingly participated in Combs' "swingers lifestyle," presenting messages where she seemingly expressed excitement about sexual events, which Ventura disputed, stating "There's a lot more to that." The trial continues to explore the complexities of their relationship amidst sexual assault allegations.</p>

          <p>Becky Hill, the former court clerk in the Alex Murdaugh murder trial, was released on bond after being arrested on charges of obstructing justice, misconduct, and perjury. The charges stem from allegations of jury tampering during the trial and accusations that she misused her position for financial gain by promoting her book about the case. Murdaugh's defense attorneys believe the charges could lead to a new trial for Murdaugh, who was convicted of murdering his wife and son. Hill resigned from her position in March following the allegations.</p>

          <p>At Kid Rock's restaurant in Nashville, managers reportedly asked undocumented kitchen staff to go home to avoid rumored immigration raids. This action caused service disruptions as many workers stayed home out of fear of detention. The restaurant, licensed by the conservative musician Kid Rock, struggled to serve post-concert crowds due to the reduced staff. Nashville officials have criticized the raids, but claim local government is "powerless" against federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals a shortage of affordable homes is hindering homeownership for middle-income families. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, down from half before the pandemic. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of reach. The lack of affordable homes is partly responsible for driving up prices even higher, as would-be buyers often bid up home prices to secure a property.</p>

          <p>President Trump denounced Western intervention and nation-building during a speech in Saudi Arabia, receiving applause but also skepticism.

The scientists hope that solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange colored cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.
