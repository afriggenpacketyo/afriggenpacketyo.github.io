          <p>Liverpool star Mohamed Salah publicly questioned European football's governing body, UEFA, over a tribute to former Palestinian player Suleiman al-Obeid. Salah highlighted that UEFA's social media post failed to mention how al-Obeid died, prompting a wider discussion. According to the Palestinian Football Association, al-Obeid was shot and killed by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. The incident underscores the ongoing tensions and the role prominent sports figures play in bringing attention to the human cost of the conflict.</p>

Police responded to the scene where they found four male and two female victims with non-life-threatening injuries, except for one 38-year-old man who is in critical condition. According to the police commissioner, it appears a group of people were gathered outside when a gunman opened fire. Homicide detectives have been called to investigate due to the severity of one victim's injuries.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that the industry's "ChatGPT moment" could occur within the next two to three years. He defines this milestone as a robot being able to autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. While he believes hardware is sufficient, he states that the AI for embodied intelligence is currently inadequate. Wang suggests that generative video models, which create interactive simulations for robots to follow, might be a more promising approach than current methods.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the 2022 death of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide by her colleague Matthew Ecker, took a dramatic turn due to a small piece of evidence. Ecker claimed Pennig locked herself in the bathroom before he heard a gunshot. However, investigators found a metal piece of the door's lock underneath Pennig's body. This suggested the door was forced open before she was shot, leading to the theory that Ecker broke in and then killed her. This finding was crucial in his eventual conviction for second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>A significant water service outage is affecting approximately 9,200 households in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills after a critical valve broke during a heatwave. Officials are pleading with residents, even those with restored water, to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets and watering lawns. The L.A. Department of Water and Power explained that conserving water is essential to build up enough pressure in the system to complete the complex, underground repairs, warning that continued consumption will only prolong the outage.</p>

          <p>Northern China's traditional rainy season has brought unusually severe and deadly flooding to Beijing, marking the fifth such disaster in the region since 2012. This year's event is considered unusual because the intense storms primarily impacted the northern districts of the capital. This is a notable shift from previous major floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern areas. The recurring and shifting nature of these extreme weather events raises concerns about climate patterns and the city's preparedness for such disasters.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a fatal shooting at their Atlanta headquarters, CDC employees have expressed a mixture of terror, frustration, and a grim sense of inevitability. Many staff members feel the attack is a physical manifestation of the escalating hostility and political attacks directed at public health workers since the pandemic began. Some employees directly blamed the combative anti-science rhetoric from high-profile political figures for fanning the flames of hatred. The incident has left many feeling abandoned by their own leadership and fearing for their safety at their workplace.</p>

          <p>As the Lee Fire in northwest Colorado continued its rapid southern advance, officials ordered the evacuation of nearly 180 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center. The Colorado Department of Corrections confirmed that all 179 inmates from the minimum-security facility were safely transferred to other secure locations outside the fire-affected area. The evacuation was a precautionary measure as the wildfire grew to become the sixth-largest in the state since 2001. There were no reported injuries to inmates or staff during the transfer.</p>
