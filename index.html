          <p>President Trump defended his recent aggressive rhetoric towards Chicago, stating his goal is to "clean up our cities" and not to "go to war." He shared a social media post likening potential federal action to the film "Apocalypse Now," drawing criticism from local officials who accuse him of authoritarianism. Despite his focus on Chicago, FBI data indicates other cities in Republican-led states have higher murder rates, a point Trump dismissed when questioned by reporters. The controversy follows his executive order to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War.</p>

          <p>England's football manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his intention to integrate long throw-ins and long-ball tactics into the team's strategy ahead of the next World Cup. Despite England's successful qualifying campaign, which has featured a more possession-based style, Tuchel believes these direct tactics will be crucial in the tournament setting. He acknowledged the limited training time available but emphasized that such patterns, along with crosses, are becoming relevant again in modern football. This tactical shift would be a notable change from the style seen under previous management.</p>

          <p>A drone launched by Houthi militants from Yemen successfully bypassed Israeli air defenses and struck the passenger terminal at Ramon International Airport near Eilat. The attack caused minor damage, including broken windows, and resulted in one man being treated for light shrapnel wounds. While most drones in the barrage were intercepted, this successful strike marks an escalation by the Iran-backed group, which has been targeting Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The airport resumed normal operations shortly after the incident.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended the U.S. Open men's final at Arthur Ashe Stadium, his first visit to the tournament in a decade. His presence drew a mix of cheers and boos from the crowd as he sat in a luxury suite with various administration officials. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid focusing on potential disruptions related to his attendance, a standard practice for off-court distractions. The visit marks a return for Trump, who was once a regular fixture at the event before his political career.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed confidence that the administration will win its Supreme Court case defending President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs," but warned of severe financial consequences if the court rules against them. A negative ruling could force the Treasury to issue refunds estimated between $750 billion and $1 trillion to businesses that paid the duties, which would be a significant blow to government revenue. The administration is seeking an expedited decision after a federal appeals court found the tariffs illegal, and is simultaneously preparing alternative plans using other legal authorities to maintain trade pressure if the appeal fails.

It draws parallels to the overreach of the "war on terror," warning that such actions are counterproductive, risk civilian casualties, and undermine international cooperation.

          <p>U.S. authorities are investigating a cyber espionage campaign believed to be linked to Chinese intelligence, which targeted individuals and groups involved in U.S.-China trade talks. The attack involved a malicious email, disguised as correspondence from a Republican congressman, sent to trade groups, law firms, and government agencies. Cybersecurity analysts traced the malware to APT41, a hacker group associated with Beijing. The operation was apparently designed to gain insight into the White House's strategies and recommendations for the highly contentious trade negotiations between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to prioritize a deal for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The demonstrators, including families of the hostages, expressed fears that an expanding military offensive in Gaza will further endanger the lives of those still in captivity. This represents one of the largest recent protests against the government's war strategy. Despite growing domestic and international pressure, the Israeli government has vowed to continue its military campaign until it achieves "total victory" over Hamas.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is ready to move to a "second phase" of sanctions against Russia over the ongoing war in Ukraine. While he did not elaborate on what these new measures would entail, the comment suggests a more aggressive posture after previous threats were withheld during peace talk efforts. The statement follows recent actions, such as imposing punitive tariffs on India, a major buyer of Russian energy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that secondary tariffs on countries that continue to purchase Russian oil could be a potential next step to pressure Moscow economically.

          <p>The UK's Defence Secretary, John Healey, has confirmed that the government is considering an expansion of its plan to use military sites for housing asylum seekers. The initiative is part of a broader "all of government effort" to move individuals out of costly hotels, which have become a point of political contention. Officials are reportedly working to identify additional military and non-military locations for temporary accommodation. The move comes as the new Home Secretary faces the ongoing challenge of small boat crossings across the English Channel, with over 30,000 arrivals so far this year.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul sharply criticized Vice President JD Vance for his comments endorsing the extrajudicial killing of alleged drug traffickers. Vance had called a recent U.S. military strike on a Venezuelan boat, which killed 11 people, the "highest and best use of our military." Paul labeled Vance's sentiment "despicable and thoughtless," arguing that it glorifies killing without a trial and ignores the principle of due process. The public disagreement between the two high-profile Republicans highlights a rift over the Trump administration's increasingly militarized approach to combating international drug cartels.</p>
