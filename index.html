          <p>President Trump expressed interest in a Russian proposal for an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, connecting Russia and Alaska. Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev suggested Elon Musk's Boring Company could build the 70-mile link, potentially reducing costs and completion time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, voiced his disapproval of the idea. This development follows recent talks between Putin and Trump regarding the Ukraine War, adding another layer to their complex diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 60 years, CBS News is closing its Pentagon workspace, declining to sign new press requirements that journalism associations deem infringements on First Amendment rights. The Pentagon's policy mandates formal authorization for publishing information, even unclassified, aiming to control leaks. This move ends a long tradition of embedded reporting, which allowed journalists like David Martin to build relationships and break stories from within the building. Most major news organizations also refused the restrictions, with only a few, like One America News Network, agreeing.</p>

Benioff's initial remarks, suggesting a need for more 'cops' during the Dreamforce conference, drew immediate backlash from local officials and led to a board resignation. While he later clarified that city and state leaders are primarily responsible for safety, his comments were amplified by right-wing figures.

          <p>Seven fully preserved skeletons discovered in a water well in the ancient Roman city of Mursa, Croatia, have been identified as Roman soldiers from 1,700 years ago. The men, aged 18-50, were robust but showed signs of early-life stress. Researchers believe they were likely killed in a 260 C.E. battle or skirmish, with some skeletons showing blunt-force and puncture wounds. DNA analysis suggests they were not local to the area, with origins in northern/Eastern Europe and the Byzantine Empire, offering a unique glimpse into ancient military life.</p>
