          <p>Kate Forbes, the Deputy First Minister of Scotland, has announced she will not seek re-election in the next Holyrood election. The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch stated her decision is driven by a desire to spend more time with her young family and not miss their formative years. Her departure marks a significant change in the Scottish National Party's leadership landscape, as she is a prominent figure within the party. This move concludes her tenure in the Scottish Parliament at the end of the current term.</p>

          <p>The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA) has labeled the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) proposed compensation scheme for car finance mis-selling as "completely impractical." The trade body's primary concern is the scheme's retroactive nature, covering loans as far back as 2007, for which both firms and customers may lack necessary documentation. While a recent Supreme Court ruling limited the scope of claims, the FCA is still developing the final rules for eligibility and compensation, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion.

          <p>The Philippines and India have conducted their first-ever joint naval exercises in the contested waters of the South China Sea, signaling strengthening defense ties. The two-day patrol involved multiple naval vessels from both nations and coincided with a state visit by the Filipino president to New Delhi. This military cooperation is seen as a response to China's expansive territorial claims in the region, which overlap with those of several Southeast Asian nations. The Filipino military reported being shadowed by Chinese vessels during the exercises but noted no untoward incidents occurred.</p>

          <p>India is in a difficult position after former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened a "penalty" and a 25% tariff over its continued importation of discounted Russian oil. Since the Ukraine invasion, Russia has become India's top oil supplier, a practice that New Delhi says has helped stabilize global prices. Analysts suggest India is unlikely to immediately alter its long-term contracts but faces a "clear and present danger" from the U.S. threats. The situation forces India to weigh the economic benefits of Russian oil against the risk of damaging its relationship with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

This incident is the latest in a series of deadly events along the perilous "Eastern Route," where thousands risk their lives each year. Despite its own civil war, Yemen remains a major transit point for migrants, who often face extreme dangers and exploitation on their journey.</p>

The officials argue that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel and that a continued military campaign is causing immense suffering. Their appeal coincides with stalled ceasefire talks and growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in the territory.</p>

          <p>A musical advertisement from cryptocurrency firm Coinbase, titled "Everything is Fine," has generated significant online discussion by satirizing the UK's economic challenges, including inflation and strikes. The ad, which depicts a grim but cheerful Britain, was praised by some in the tech and venture capital communities for its pointed critique but criticized by others as misleading and self-serving. The controversy highlights ongoing tensions between the crypto industry and traditional financial systems and regulation. Coinbase's CEO stated the ad's message about updating the financial system is not specific to the UK or any political party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of African political elites seeking medical treatment abroad highlights a critical issue of underinvestment in their own countries' public healthcare systems. This trend, known as medical tourism, is driven by a lack of specialized treatments, poorly equipped local hospitals, and an over-reliance on foreign aid for health funding. According to the 2001 Abuja Declaration, African Union members pledged to allocate 15% of their national budgets to healthcare, a target few have met. This capital flight for medical services, with countries like India being major beneficiaries, further strains national budgets and perpetuates the cycle of inadequate local care.</p>

The body, particularly the kidneys, is highly effective at regulating its own electrolyte levels. Unless a person is engaged in prolonged, intense exercise or suffering from specific illnesses causing rapid fluid loss, drinking plain water and eating a varied diet is sufficient for maintaining proper hydration and electrolyte balance.</p>

The policy has created significant uncertainty in the global economy, potentially redirecting trade flows and prompting retaliatory measures from other nations.

          <h2>Texas Democratic Lawmakers Leave State to Block Vote on Republican-Favored Redistricting Maps</h2>

          <p>A group of Democratic state legislators has fled Texas in a dramatic effort to block a special session vote on a new congressional map. By leaving the state, they aim to deny Republicans the two-thirds quorum required to pass legislation. The Democrats argue the new maps are a partisan gerrymander designed by Republicans, at the behest of Donald Trump, to unfairly expand their U.S. House majority in the 2026 elections. They also criticized the Republican leadership for prioritizing redistricting over providing disaster relief for recent catastrophic floods, accusing them of holding victims hostage for political gain.</p>

          <p>In a sharp escalation of the political standoff in Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove Democratic lawmakers from office if they do not return to the state. The threat came after dozens of Democrats left to break quorum and block a vote on a contentious redistricting plan favored by Republicans. Abbott cited a non-binding legal opinion and gave the lawmakers a deadline to return, stating "this truancy ends now." The Democratic caucus responded defiantly with the statement "Come and take it," setting the stage for an unprecedented constitutional and political confrontation over the new congressional maps.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement in Montana is in the fourth day of a manhunt for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in the small town of Anaconda. The victims, all local residents, were known to the suspect, who was a regular at the bar. Authorities believe Brown, who is considered armed and dangerous, fled the scene and may have stolen a vehicle containing camping gear and clothes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD reported its first monthly decline in deliveries for the year, a sign of the intense competition from an ongoing price war in the country's EV market. Other major players like Li Auto and Nio also saw a drop in July shipments, while competitors Xpeng, Xiaomi, and Leapmotor posted growth. The price war, initiated by significant discounts from market leaders like BYD, has become so fierce that it has drawn warnings from Chinese policymakers to halt excessive competition. This slowdown for the top brands indicates a significant reshaping of the competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hotel and property tycoon Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to abetting the obstruction of justice in a major corruption case involving a former government minister. Ong admitted to helping ex-transport minister Subramaniam Iswaran cover up evidence related to expensive gifts, including a private jet trip, that Ong had given him. The case has been a rare and shocking scandal in Singapore, a country known for its low tolerance for corruption. Due to Ong's poor health from a rare cancer, prosecutors agreed to recommend a fine instead of a jail sentence, exercising "judicial mercy."</p>

          <p>A sports analysis argues that Manchester City's most important summer signing may not be a player, but rather Pep Lijnders, the former assistant to Liverpool's Jürgen Klopp. The hiring of Lijnders, who was instrumental in developing Liverpool's high-intensity counter-pressing style, suggests manager Pep Guardiola may be planning a significant tactical evolution. The article posits that Guardiola recognizes modern football is shifting towards a more direct, transitional style, away from his classic positional play. The addition of Lijnders, along with recent player signings who excel at dribbling and carrying the ball, points toward a strategic rebuild at the club.</p>

          <p>Renewed violence has erupted at two separate flashpoints in Syria, testing the authority of the country's transitional government and threatening fragile ceasefires. In the north, government-affiliated forces clashed with Kurdish-led forces, while in the southern province of Sweida, they fought with armed Druze groups. These outbreaks challenge the interim government's efforts to consolidate control and integrate the country following the ouster of Bashar Assad. The violence in Sweida follows a period of intense sectarian clashes in July, highlighting the deep-seated tensions the new leadership is struggling to manage across the fractured nation.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams have found and identified the bodies of all five miners who were trapped following a collapse at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile. The miners were caught deep inside the world's largest underground copper mine after a tremor, which also killed another worker instantly. After three days of drilling through rock, rescuers reached the workers but confirmed there were no survivors. Authorities are now conducting a criminal investigation to determine if the collapse was caused by a natural earthquake or mining activity, and whether any safety violations occurred.</p>

          <p>As a practical step toward easing tensions, South Korea's military has started to remove loudspeakers that broadcast anti-Pyongyang propaganda across the border into North Korea. The move is part of President Lee Jae-myung's initiative to improve relations and restore trust with the North, following a similar halt to the broadcasts in June. This de-escalation measure is a tangible sign of goodwill, although Pyongyang recently rejected an offer for renewed dialogue. The broadcasts have long been a source of irritation and a symbol of the high tensions between the two technically-warring nations.</p>

Ben and Lucy Armstrong had to flee with their young son and dogs as the fire, which killed two people and spread over 100 square kilometers, rapidly approached their house. They described returning to find only the burnt walls of their home remaining, with countless memories and sentimental items destroyed. The family is now staying with relatives and relying on community support and a fundraiser to begin rebuilding their lives from scratch.</p>
