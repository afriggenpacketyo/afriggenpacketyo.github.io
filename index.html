            <p>Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland, leaving them with life-threatening injuries including burns and stab wounds. Abedi, who is serving a sentence for 22 counts of murder related to the 2017 bombing, used hot cooking oil and homemade weapons in the assault. The Prison Officers' Association is calling for a review of freedoms given to prisoners in separation centers following the incident. Authorities are investigating the attack, and the Justice Secretary has vowed to pursue the strongest possible punishment. </p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, and semiconductors, marking a significant reprieve for the tech industry amid broader trade tensions with China. White House officials stated the exemptions aim to encourage companies like Apple and Nvidia to onshore manufacturing in the United States. However, other tariffs, including those related to fentanyl and earlier impositions, still apply to some electronics. This move is seen as a potential game-changer for tech investors, offering relief from concerns about rising gadget prices. </p>

            <p>President Trump has been using executive orders to target specific law firms, leading to legal challenges and firms cutting deals to avoid potential damage. This action is raising concerns about the use of executive power and its impact on the American legal system. NPR's Justice Correspondent Ryan Lucas is investigating how this use of executive power is changing the landscape of the American legal system. Some firms are fighting back, while others are attempting to negotiate to mitigate the impact. </p>

            <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and advocate for Palestinian rights, has been ruled deportable by a federal immigration judge in Louisiana based on claims his views compromise US foreign policy interests. Secretary of State Marco Rubio alleges Khalil engaged in antisemitic protests, but provides no evidence. Critics argue the deportation attempt is meant to silence dissent and conformity, infringing on constitutionally protected speech. The ACLU speculates the decision to deport Khalil was "pre-written," raising concerns about the executive branch's power and the integrity of American democracy.</p>

            <p>Susman Godfrey, a law firm that previously represented Dominion Voting Systems, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block an executive order targeting the firm. The firm argues that the order, which seeks to restrict their access to government buildings and cancel government contracts, is an unconstitutional act of retaliation for their work defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. Susman Godfrey contends that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies. The lawsuit claims the executive order is an abuse of power and sets a dangerous precedent for future administrations. </p>

            <p>While Apple and other technology companies received a tariff reprieve from President Trump, many U.S. businesses face irreversible damage from the 145% tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned shipments from China, impacting industries like furniture, toys, apparel, and sports equipment. Experts warn that these high tariffs will halt most trade between the U.S. and China, leading to lost sales and product shortages, particularly for small businesses. Integrated logistics giant Maersk anticipates a massive restructuring of liner services to North America, causing congestion and freight rate spikes. </p>

Critics argue that resources would be better spent on conserving existing endangered species, as de-extinction does not address the root causes of extinction, such as habitat loss and climate change. The welfare of resurrected animals is also a concern, as they would lack kin and natural habitats. Studies suggest that de-extinction could lead to the extinction of other species due to the high costs involved. </p>

            <p>California's sea lion population is being threatened by a severe toxic algae bloom, causing domoic acid poisoning and overwhelming animal rescue teams. SeaWorld San Diego has rescued a significantly higher number of sea lions this year compared to previous years, requiring them to double their staff. The neurotoxin, produced by the algae, affects marine animals and can lead to seizures and heart failure. Warming oceans, potentially exacerbated by debris from recent wildfires, are contributing to the severity of the algae blooms. </p>

            <p>President Trump has authorized the military to take control of land at the US-Mexico border, granting them a more direct role in securing the boundary. The memorandum allows the Department of Defense to have jurisdiction over federal lands, including the Roosevelt Reservation, enabling troops to detain immigrants accused of trespassing. Military activities will include border-barrier construction and emplacement of detection equipment. Critics argue this move circumvents the Posse Comitatus Act, while supporters claim it's necessary to address threats at the border. </p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs, potentially keeping prices down for consumers. This move benefits tech companies such as Apple, Samsung, and Nvidia. U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors, and some chips will be exempt from the 145% tariffs on China and the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. The announcement has been welcomed by the tech industry, with analysts describing it as removing a "huge black cloud overhang."</p>

Experts believe the missing parts, including the main rotor and transmission, are crucial to determining the cause of the crash. A preliminary investigation suggests a rotor may have broken off, causing the helicopter to crash. Authorities are also considering the possibility of bird strikes, drone interference, or mechanical failure. </p>

            <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze federal funding allocated to Maine by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The funds had been withheld following a clash between President Trump and Maine Governor Janet Mills over the issue of transgender athletes. The feud began after Trump issued an executive order barring transgender student athletes from playing on girls' sports teams. The USDA paused funding for certain administrative and technological functions in schools in response to Mills' "defiance of federal law."</p>

Maybe there is an even easier first step – to make friends with our feathered visitors. If only we could find time to truly appreciate the beauty and friendship of birds, even we naturally destructive humans might instinctively become their protectors.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff strategy is being questioned for its potential to revive US manufacturing, with critics arguing that his vision of roaring industrial chimneys is outdated. The complexities of modern supply chains, such as the Apple iPhone's reliance on components from 43 countries, make reshoring difficult and expensive. A case study of TSMC's new fabrication plant in Arizona highlights the challenges of finding qualified American talent and the increased costs of manufacturing in the US. Bringing manufacturing back home can be done, but not within one electoral cycle. </p>

The assessment was made by a number of observers after an exchange of escalating duties in the past week. Trump ended the week with a 90-day pause on fresh tariffs for most of the United States’ trading partners, leaving a baseline duty of 10 per cent in place for the period, however, the one big exception was China.</p>
