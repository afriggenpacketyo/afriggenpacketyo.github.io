          <p>The long-postponed deadline for Real ID enforcement at U.S. airports has arrived, with passengers showing up early and prepared. While the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) stated that full enforcement would begin, the Homeland Security secretary indicated that those without compliant IDs would still be allowed to fly after additional screening. Travelers at LaGuardia, Chicago Midway, and Newark Liberty International Airport experienced varying levels of preparedness and wait times, with some facing extra screening due to non-compliant IDs. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey increased staffing to facilitate the transition.</p>

Stefanik pressed further, referencing past resignations of university presidents who failed to answer similar questions directly. Raymond eventually confirmed that some disciplinary actions had been taken, but refused to discuss individual cases, leading to further criticism from Stefanik.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study draws parallels between the origins of the Covid-19 and SARS pandemics, suggesting both originated in the wildlife trade. Researchers analyzed the genomes of the coronaviruses responsible for both outbreaks, finding that both viruses likely jumped from bats to wild mammals in southwestern China before being sold in city markets. This conclusion contrasts with the politically charged "lab leak" theory, which the White House has promoted. The study highlights the risks associated with selling wildlife in urban centers, with some scientists warning that such practices could lead to future pandemics.</p>

The judges emphasized that the administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion, or predatory incursion, and that migrants are entitled to due process.

The increase is significantly higher than typical seasonal trends, indicating that consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of tariff-related price increases.

          <p>Sixteen individuals, including a leader of the Sinaloa cartel, Heriberto Salazar Amaya, have been arrested in what federal prosecutors are calling the "largest fentanyl bust in DEA history." The operation resulted in the seizure of 3 million fentanyl-laced pills and other drugs, along with $5 million in cash and numerous firearms. The Justice Department emphasized the severity of the fentanyl crisis, noting that it is the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 34. Authorities plan to keep those arrested in American prisons for as long as possible.</p>
