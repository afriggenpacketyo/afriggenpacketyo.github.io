FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino have characterized the incident as a terrorist attack, with FBI agents present at the scene.

          <p>Exit polls indicate an extremely tight race in the Polish presidential election between Warsaw's Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki. Early polls showed conflicting results, with each candidate claiming a marginal lead, making the official result, expected on Monday morning, highly anticipated. Trzaskowski, supported by the pro-EU coalition, aims to remove political influence from the judiciary and liberalize abortion laws, while Nawrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party, advocates for a strong, sovereign Poland. The outcome will significantly impact Poland's relationship with the EU and the direction of its domestic policies.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce a major defense review, including plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines to replace the current fleet by the late 2030s. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance warfighting readiness and deter growing threats, with a commitment of £15 billion to the nuclear warhead program. The Strategic Defence Review will also include investments in munitions production, long-range weapons, cyber capabilities, and military housing repairs. These measures aim to bolster the UK's defense capabilities and support thousands of jobs and apprenticeships in the defense sector.</p>

          <p>Extensive wildfires in Canada have forced the evacuation of over 25,000 residents across Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, with ongoing hot, dry weather exacerbating the situation. The fires have also led to diminished air quality in both Canada and parts of the U.S., prompting health warnings and reduced visibility. Manitoba has declared a state of emergency, and resources are stretched thin as authorities struggle to contain the blazes. International assistance, including firefighters and equipment from the U.S., has been deployed to help combat the fires, with critical conditions expected to persist until weather patterns change.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic hurricane season has officially begun, with forecasters predicting an above-average number of storms due to warmer ocean temperatures. Experts emphasize the importance of preparedness, even for inland communities, as storms can cause deadly floods and significant damage far from the coast. Concerns have been raised about potential impacts on weather forecasting due to staffing cuts and funding reductions at NOAA and the National Weather Service. Despite these challenges, officials maintain that they are ready to meet the needs of emergency management communities throughout the hurricane season.</p>

Forecasters predict an above-normal number of storms this year, with a 60% chance of 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 of which are expected to become hurricanes. The names are set by the World Meteorological Organization and are rotated every year, with some names being retired if a storm is particularly deadly or costly. Naming storms helps meteorologists and officials communicate forecasts and warnings more effectively.</p>
