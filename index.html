          <p>Independent candidate Catherine Connolly has secured a decisive victory in Ireland's presidential election, garnering over 64% of the vote in a race against two mainstream party candidates. Backed by left-wing parties, the 68-year-old lawmaker from Galway campaigned on themes of peace and neutrality, often expressing critical views of the US and EU. The election was marked by a low voter turnout and a high number of spoiled ballots, which some analysts interpret as widespread dissatisfaction with the political establishment's handling of issues like immigration and housing.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has reported that President Xi Jinping personally led the drafting team for the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan, underscoring his deep involvement in shaping national policy. The reports emphasize that Xi played a "decisive role" and dedicated significant effort to the document's formulation, which was informed by his extensive inspection tours across China. This personal oversight highlights the centralization of power under Xi, as the plan's framework underwent multiple revisions by the Politburo Standing Committee before its presentation to the Central Committee.</p>

A hurricane warning is currently in effect for Jamaica, as the storm is expected to strengthen to a Category 3 or higher system while slowly moving northwest through the Caribbean early next week.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris strongly indicated she is considering another presidential campaign in 2028, stating "I am not done." While dismissing current polls that show her with low favorability, she expressed confidence that a woman will eventually become president and affirmed her commitment to a life of public service. During the interview, she also criticized former rival Donald Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" who has weaponized the justice system and to whom many business leaders have capitulated.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or using technology to optimize sleep, highlights an increasing reliance on gadgets that can sometimes fail spectacularly. This was recently demonstrated when an Amazon Web Services outage caused high-tech Eight Sleep mattresses to malfunction, trapping some users in upright positions or subjecting them to extreme temperatures. The incident underscores the expansion of the sleep-tech industry, which offers everything from smart mattresses to neurotech headbands, into a multi-billion dollar market. While some devices offer real benefits for sleep disorders, the general trend introduces more potential points of failure into a fundamental biological process.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his Seattle-area mansion for $63 million, marking a significant profit from his original $37.5 million purchase price. The sale comes as Bezos has relocated to Miami and continues to reduce his ownership stake in Amazon, which has now fallen below 10%. This financial move coincides with an ongoing legal battle where Bezos is seeking to have his wife's brother, Michael Sánchez, cover nearly $200,000 in legal fees related to a past defamation lawsuit.

Labour has recently faced a series of internal disputes and public relations challenges.

A significant factor in this performance gap is the company's decision to sell a large portion of its stake in Apple, which has since surged to a record high. By reducing its holdings by 69% since late 2023, Berkshire has potentially left an estimated $50 billion in unrealized profits on the table, a move Buffett has partially attributed to expectations of future capital gains tax increases.

Offering choices within established boundaries can also empower children by giving them a sense of autonomy.

By allowing kids to interact with coaches and teammates independently, parents can help them develop self-starting behaviors and a sense of agency. Wambach also suggests that during games, parents should emphasize acts of leadership and good sportsmanship over the final score.</p>

          <p>Russian missile and drone attacks across Ukraine have killed at least four people and injured twenty others, according to Ukrainian officials. In Kyiv, two people were killed by a ballistic missile strike, while two others died in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where residential buildings were also damaged. Ukraine's air force reported that it successfully intercepted most of the incoming drones and several missiles, but the deadly assault prompted President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew his urgent appeal for additional Western air defense systems, particularly U.S. Patriot systems.</p>

          <p>The 123-year-old East Wing of the White House, which has housed offices for first ladies for decades, has been demolished to make way for a new, $300 million ballroom. The demolition proceeded without submitted plans to the relevant federal oversight agency, drawing criticism from historic preservation groups. President Trump stated the project would be privately funded by himself and corporate donors, including major tech and defense companies. The controversial construction project has raised questions, with some speculating it may signal Trump's intentions regarding presidential term limits.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant drop in the number of active serial killers since their peak in the 1970s, public fascination with them remains high, fueled by social media rumors and popular entertainment. Recent panics over supposed serial killers in Austin, Brooklyn, and Boston have been debunked by law enforcement, yet the narrative persists. Criminologists attribute the real-world decline to factors like the disappearance of hitchhiking, advances in DNA technology, and increased surveillance. However, the cultural obsession continues, with experts suggesting that these "monsters" serve as a canvas for societal fears and anxieties.</p>

Beijing's official recognition of "Taiwan Restoration Day" is seen as a strategic move to reinforce its sovereignty claims over the self-ruled island.

While AI tools are being used for specific tasks like dubbing and animation, they currently lack the quality required for major studio productions, and concerns over copyright and security persist, keeping the technology a curiosity rather than a revolution for now.</p>

Experts note that these direct-to-consumer ads are a form of persuasion, not just information, and can influence patient behavior and requests to doctors in ways they may not even realize.
