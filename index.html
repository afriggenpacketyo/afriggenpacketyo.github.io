          <p>The Department of Justice is reportedly seeking a grand jury indictment against former national security adviser John Bolton regarding his handling of classified documents. This development follows an FBI search of Bolton's home and office in August, where agents allegedly discovered records marked as classified. The investigation stems from his controversial book, "The Room Where It Happened," which the Trump administration had previously attempted to block, claiming it contained sensitive information. Bolton has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the matter.</p>

          <p>Daniel Duggan, a former U.S. Marine pilot, is appealing his extradition from Australia to the United States, where he faces charges for allegedly training Chinese military pilots over a decade ago. A 2016 U.S. indictment accuses him of conspiring to provide instruction on aircraft carrier operations to Chinese aviators without a proper license. Duggan, who denies the allegations and claims they are politically motivated, has been detained in Australia since 2022. His legal team argues there were flaws in the extradition process approved by Australia's former attorney-general.</p>

          <p>An Alaska Airlines flight from Portland to Dallas was forced to make an emergency landing in Boise, Idaho, after a passenger allegedly assaulted two flight attendants. The passenger, identified as 61-year-old Tracy Barkhimer, was arrested and faces two counts of misdemeanor battery after exhibiting erratic behavior and striking the crew members. Following the incident, the flight was delayed for 90 minutes before continuing to its destination. Alaska Airlines has since banned the passenger from flying with the carrier.</p>

          <p>A World Health Organization report indicates a significant drop in tobacco consumption in Southeast Asia over the past two decades, with smoking prevalence falling from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020. This success is attributed to strong public health initiatives, including higher taxes, advertising bans, and smoke-free public spaces in countries like Singapore and Thailand. However, challenges persist, as Indonesia has not ratified the WHO's tobacco control framework and the region faces a rising trend in e-cigarette use, particularly among adolescents.</p>

          <p>The British government has once again postponed its decision on whether to approve China's application for a new, large-scale embassy near the Tower of London. The deadline for the ruling by Housing Secretary Steve Reed has been moved from October 21 to December 10, marking the second such delay. The proposed 20,000-square-meter complex, which would be Europe's largest embassy, has raised national security concerns due to its proximity to London's financial district. Critics fear the location could pose a significant espionage risk.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has announced that the Trump administration has found a way to continue paying FBI agents during the ongoing government shutdown, which has halted pay for most federal workers. While the specific source of the funds was not disclosed, the move ensures that essential law enforcement personnel will receive their paychecks. This follows a similar action to pay members of the military, but raises questions about the administration's legal authority to appropriate funds without congressional approval during a funding lapse.</p>

          <p>The 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks during the U.S. government shutdown, as the program is covered by mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration (SSA) warns that other services could be impacted due to potential staff furloughs. Activities such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards could be halted or delayed until a funding agreement is reached. The annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement could also be postponed.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government shutdown in effect, all active-duty military personnel are required to continue performing their duties but will not receive their pay until Congress passes a funding deal. While a 2019 law guarantees back pay after a shutdown ends, the delay can cause financial hardship for service members and their families. Essential civilian Defense Department employees will also continue to work without pay, while others are furloughed. Financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA have announced plans to offer no-interest loans to affected members.</p>

          <p>While most FAA and TSA employees are deemed essential and must work during a government shutdown, a prolonged impasse could lead to significant travel disruptions. Experts warn that if the shutdown continues for an extended period, unpaid airport screeners and air traffic controllers may start calling in sick, leading to labor shortages. This could result in longer security lines and potential flight delays, similar to what occurred during the 2018-2019 shutdown. The U.S. Travel Association estimates a prolonged shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion per week.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is not expected to significantly impact the processing of most conventional mortgages from private lenders. However, borrowers seeking government-backed loans through agencies like the FHA, VA, or USDA could experience some delays. The FHA and VA are expected to continue most operations, but worker furloughs might slow processing times. The USDA, however, will likely halt the issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans entirely, and obtaining required flood insurance through FEMA could also become more complicated for some homebuyers.</p>

          <p>Despite the government shutdown forcing hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without pay or be furloughed, members of the U.S. Congress will continue to receive their salaries. Lawmakers' pay is funded by a permanent appropriation under the Constitution and is not subject to the annual funding lapse that affects federal agencies. This distinction often draws public criticism during shutdowns, as the legislators responsible for the funding impasse are not personally affected by the delayed paychecks that impact other government workers.</p>

          <p>Following a shaky ceasefire, the Gaza Strip confronts a monumental task of rebuilding without a functioning government and amid ongoing security challenges. With over half the territory still monitored by Israeli troops and internal street battles occurring between Hamas and other factions, establishing stability is a primary hurdle. The reconstruction itself, estimated by the U.N. to cost $70 billion, is hampered by a severe shortage of equipment and the complex political need to form an interim governing body of Palestinian technocrats to oversee the process.</p>

The lawsuit further alleges the company concealed this risk from the public and regulators while marketing the product as safe. J&J denies the allegations, stating its talc-based powder was safe and did not contain asbestos.</p>
