          <p>Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), emphasized to the BBC that encountering potentially offensive viewpoints is integral to education. This statement accompanies the OfS's release of guidelines for English universities regarding a new law aimed at safeguarding free speech, set to take effect in August. The guidelines address various facets of university life, including protests, debates, and teaching methods. Ahmed directly addressed students, asserting their right to express any view, regardless of its potential offensiveness, provided it remains within legal boundaries, such as not constituting harassment or unlawful discrimination. </p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that Israeli Air Force fighter jets targeted several military sites in Iran overnight, including an inactive nuclear reactor near Arak. The IDF stated that the strike on the Arak heavy water reactor hit the structure sealing the reactor, preventing its future use in plutonium production. Additionally, a site in Natanz allegedly involved in nuclear weapons development, along with other military production facilities, were targeted. The IDF claimed the Natanz site contained specialized equipment used to advance nuclear weapons development.</p>

Foreign Secretary David Lammy has traveled to Washington to meet his US counterpart, while Iran's foreign minister has confirmed talks with counterparts from the UK, France, and Germany regarding the escalation of their nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. following the Civil War, originating on June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce the freedom of enslaved people. The name is a portmanteau of June and nineteenth, marking the day the Emancipation Proclamation was enforced in Texas. Celebrations include parades, concerts, and cultural events, reflecting a joyful anniversary of independence and a remembrance of the country's history of slavery. Despite some corporate sponsorship tapering, communities continue to honor Juneteenth with festivities and reflections on freedom.</p>

Cooking methods such as barbecuing meats and deep-frying fish also trace back to West Africa. These culinary traditions have woven themselves into the fabric of both American and Black culture, shaping the flavors and dishes that define the nation's culinary landscape. By recognizing these contributions, a greater appreciation for the impact of Black America on American culture can be achieved.</p>

          <p>As Israel and Iran exchange missile strikes, American students and tour groups in Israel are making plans to evacuate. Some students, participating in programs like Birthright Onward, had arrived in Israel just before the conflict escalated. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem has announced that the State Department is planning for contingencies to assist with private U.S. citizens' departure from Israel. After Israel's airspace closed, Birthright Onward moved students out of Tel Aviv, and parents are exploring alternative routes, such as exiting through Jordan or Cyprus.</p>

The law prohibits hormone therapies and surgeries only for their use in treating gender dysphoria. The ruling is likely to shield other bans on transition-related healthcare for minors, which are now on the books in most states. The court circumvented sex equality provisions in a way that seems to render moot much of the 14th amendment’s applicability to sex discrimination cases.</p>
