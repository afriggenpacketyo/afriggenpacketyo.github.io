Matsui expressed gratitude for Nagashima's influence on his career, recalling how Nagashima secured his draft and taught him valuable lessons. Matsui, who flew from the United States for the visit, shared memories and reflected on Nagashima's lasting impact on Japanese baseball, including winning multiple titles as both a player and manager. Nagashima's charismatic persona made him a symbol of Japan's economic growth, and Matsui vowed to fulfill a promise made to him. The event is a somber occasion reflecting on the life and legacy of a significant figure in Japanese sports.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 05:00:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican-backed budget bill includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit (CTC) that could deny the benefit to millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents. The proposed legislation requires both parents to have Social Security numbers to claim the CTC, impacting children with mixed-status parents or undocumented parents. Policy experts estimate that roughly 4.5 million children could be affected by the restriction, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas, and Florida. The bill is intended to prevent tax breaks from going to undocumented immigrants, but the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit.</p>

          <p>The Stanley Cup final between the Florida Panthers and the Edmonton Oilers has taken on political undertones, fueled by Trump's strained relationship with Canada and other factors. Wayne Gretzky's support for Trump and a Panthers minority owner's controversial remarks have added to the tension. The Panthers' brash attitude and association with the "Florida Man" persona further contribute to the rivalry. An Oilers win would be particularly satisfying for many Canadians given the current political climate, and it is clear that the stakes are high on and off the ice.</p>

          <p>As ICE detention numbers rise, private prison companies and local police departments are increasing their involvement in immigration detention and enforcement. Private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic are expanding capacity to meet the administration's demand for more detention space. Concerns are being raised about deteriorating conditions in these facilities due to overcrowding and cost-cutting measures. Local police departments are also playing a larger role through the 287g program, leading to concerns about strained community relations and misallocation of law enforcement resources.

          <p>President Trump is doubling steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%, a move intended to bolster domestic steel production but likely to increase costs for companies that use steel. A North Carolina manufacturer expresses concern about competing with global competitors who have access to cheaper steel. Economists warn that higher steel costs could lead to job losses in downstream manufacturing industries and higher prices for consumers. While some domestic steel producers are optimistic, many forecasters predict slower economic growth due to the unpredictable nature of Trump's trade policies. The article highlights the complex and potentially negative consequences of the tariffs on the broader economy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's DOGE initiative, which aims to amass and utilize existing government data, is raising concerns about declining public trust in the U.S. Census Bureau and other statistical agencies. Current and former Census Bureau workers report increased reluctance from individuals to share information due to fears of data misuse and privacy violations. Experts warn that this distrust could lead to skewed statistics and nonresponse bias, particularly among marginalized communities, hindering the government's ability to redistribute political representation and allocate federal funding effectively. The push to pool government data is raising concerns about privacy protections and potential misuse.</p>

The plan includes modernizing the military, developing a hybrid navy, and increasing long-range weapons capabilities. Experts suggest that uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's approach to NATO is also a factor driving this shift in defense posture. If approved, the plan would increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with a goal of reaching 3% in the future.</p>

The OECD notes that Chinese exports will be curbed by newly imposed tariffs, while imports will fall as production becomes increasingly localized.

          <p>Volunteers unearthed a sandstone carving of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory, at Vindolanda, a fort near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland. The artifact was found by a couple who have volunteered at excavations for two decades, discovering it in rubble near former infantry barracks. Experts believe the stone was part of a larger work and likely painted in vibrant colors. The discovery highlights the grandeur of Roman forts and the symbolic importance of such artifacts to soldiers nearly 2,000 years ago, and the piece is set to go on display at the Vindolanda museum next year.</p>

          <p>Tesla experienced a rebound in Australian sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. While sales in the U.S. and Europe have declined, Tesla's Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, with Model Y sales soaring 122.5% year-over-year. Despite this rebound, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year.
