          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The UBS subsidiary also entered a non-prosecution agreement related to U.S. accounts booked at Credit Suisse AG Singapore, which held over $2 billion in undeclared assets for U.S. persons between 2014 and 2023. This plea comes after Credit Suisse's 2014 guilty plea for similar misconduct, violating the original agreement.

          <p>President Trump ended a tariff loophole that allowed inexpensive goods from China to enter the United States without tariffs, potentially impacting shipping companies like UPS and FedEx. The de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to be imported without tariffs, has been eliminated for goods from mainland China and Hong Kong. This change is expected to reduce the volume of shipments from e-commerce companies selling Chinese goods, potentially depriving logistics companies of a significant revenue source. Some companies are exploring selling more goods to customers in other regions to offset potential losses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to aid the entertainment industry after President Trump called for tariffs on movies filmed overseas. The proposal aims to strengthen domestic production and counter the loss of film and television production to states and nations with more attractive incentives. This comes after Trump met with Jon Voight, who suggested federal tax incentives and changes to the tax code. The industry seeks a balanced federal response to international competition, with unions and lawmakers advocating for tax credits rather than tariffs.</p>

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz Island expressed disbelief and skepticism regarding President Trump's suggestion to convert the historical site back into a federal prison. Visitors questioned the practicality and historical implications of the proposal, given the island's deteriorated state and its significance as a tourist attraction. Local officials and historians also criticized the idea, citing the high costs of renovation and the island's current role as a national park and museum. The Bureau of Prisons, however, stated it was assessing the feasibility of the plan.</p>
