          <p>The CDC has updated its COVID-19 vaccine schedule, now recommending COVID-19 vaccines for children based on shared clinical decision-making between doctors and patients, and removing the recommendation for pregnant women. This change follows a directive from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., blindsiding CDC staff and contradicting advice from medical groups who still recommend the vaccines. Public health experts are concerned about the process and potential impact on vaccination rates, as insurance coverage may become variable, and fewer doctors may keep the vaccines on hand. The decision raises concerns about the stability of the nation's immunization infrastructure.</p>

Japan seeks the removal of all additional U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports, while the U.S. emphasizes boosting investment and addressing economic security issues.

          <p>Rugby league authorities are expressing anger and disappointment over the sport's 130-year history without a knighthood or damehood, citing potential snobbery and class prejudice within the honors system. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, supports calls for recognition, noting other sports have received such honors regularly. David Baines, chair of the all-party Parliamentary rugby league group, suggests the lack of recognition stems from the working-class backgrounds of rugby league players. In contrast, rugby union, often seen as having more middle-class roots, has received knighthoods for over a century.</p>

However, the United Steelworkers union expressed caution, and details of the agreement remain unclear. The announcement follows a court decision temporarily allowing Trump's tariffs to remain in effect, and it is unclear how the announcement would affect the trade deal negotiated earlier this month that saw tariffs on UK steel and aluminum reduced to zero.</p>

          <p>North and South Korea are engaged in an information war, with the South attempting to infiltrate the North with foreign content and the North trying to block it. South Korea uses loudspeakers and smuggled USB sticks containing TV dramas, films, and news to challenge North Korean propaganda. However, North Korea is cracking down on those caught with foreign content and has implemented measures to restrict South Korean influences. The US government has cut funding to some organizations involved, potentially giving North Korea the upper hand in this ongoing conflict.</p>

Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store acknowledged the issue has spun out of control, leading to concerns about teenagers' well-being, grades, and financial strain. The plan is to move celebrations to the post-exam period to mitigate the negative impacts on academics and reduce social exclusion. The russebuss tradition involves renting and decorating party buses, leading to heavy drinking, drug use, and sleep deprivation, with many teenagers feeling left out due to the high costs.</p>

The piece argues that the cultural emphasis on mental health and self-awareness has inadvertently made the prospect of raising children more daunting.</p>
