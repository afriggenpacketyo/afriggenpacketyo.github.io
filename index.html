          <p>The Chelan County Sheriff's Office released a new suspect flyer for Travis Decker, wanted for the murders of his three daughters near a Washington campground last month. Decker, an Army veteran, faces three counts of first-degree murder and kidnapping after his daughters, who were on a planned visitation with him, were found dead. The new flyer includes photos of potential ways Decker may have altered his appearance, and he is considered dangerous and possibly armed. The U.S. Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his arrest, as the search continues with assistance from multiple agencies.</p>

Kelly was moved to solitary confinement earlier in June and experienced faintness and dizziness after being given additional medication by prison personnel. He was hospitalized and found to have blood clots in his legs and lungs, but was allegedly removed from the hospital against medical advice, jeopardizing his health.</p>

          <p>President Trump's contemplation of involving the U.S. in potential strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities has ignited a rift among his supporters. The debate pits isolationist factions against hawkish elements within the Republican party, with some warning against entanglement in another Middle Eastern conflict. Congressman Thomas Massie has joined Democrats in proposing a bill to prevent unauthorized military action against Iran without congressional approval. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon also voiced support for blocking military intervention, highlighting concerns that it could disrupt Trump's coalition and hinder domestic policy goals.</p>

          <p>An L.A. County supervisor raised concerns that individuals impersonating ICE agents may be terrorizing residents, citing an incident where a staff member's godson was pulled over by men in an unmarked car. This suggestion sparked tension, with another supervisor asserting that the detentions are indeed being carried out by ICE. The discussion arose as supervisors considered a study on the economic impact of recent immigration raids, which have caused fear and significantly reduced business activity in many communities. California lawmakers have proposed a bill to ban law enforcement, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks while on duty.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-on-year decline in May, marking the steepest drop since September 2024, primarily due to an 11.1% fall in exports to the U.S. and an 8.8% decrease to China. This decline has contributed to Japan's economic challenges, with the Bank of Japan noting that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade uncertainties. The country's economy shrank by 0.2% in the quarter ending March, and the trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen in May. Japan faces a 10% baseline tariff on exports to the U.S., which could increase to 24% if a trade deal is not reached by July 9. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels, and restaurants, allowing ICE to continue worksite enforcement operations. This decision comes just days after internal guidance directed officials to suspend such operations, amid concerns about the impact on industries reliant on foreign-born workers. The Department of Homeland Security emphasized that there will be no safe spaces for industries harboring violent criminals or undermining ICE's efforts. Worksite enforcement remains a key part of safeguarding public safety, national security, and economic stability.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that individuals can choose the gender they identify with when renewing or applying for a passport. The ruling expands on a previous decision and addresses an executive order issued by Mr. Trump that reversed a policy allowing Americans to self-select their gender, including an 'X' for those who do not identify as male or female. The ACLU praised the decision, stating that the policy attacked the right to privacy and the freedom to live with dignity.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, includes provisions for full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. It also grants authority to the Treasury Secretary and opens the door for a broader range of issuers. The bill now heads to the House, where it faces reconciliation with a similar bill, STABLE.

          <h2>9th Circuit Considers Trump's Authority to Deploy Troops to L.A.</h2>

          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments regarding President Trump's decision to deploy federal troops to Los Angeles, questioning both the decision itself and the court's right to review it. Judges pressed the administration on the extent of presidential discretion in deploying the military on American streets. The case tests the limits of presidential authority, with the administration arguing that the president has nearly unlimited discretion to quell rebellion and execute federal laws. California officials contend that this interpretation is dangerously broad and risks harm to democratic norms.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's approach to Iran, emphasizing Trump's consistent stance against Iran possessing nuclear weapons. Vance's comments come as some conservatives, including Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, have spoken out against U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Vance stated that Trump is only interested in using the American military to accomplish American people's goals. He also highlighted Iran's violation of non-proliferation obligations, suggesting that Trump may take further action to end Iranian enrichment.</p>
