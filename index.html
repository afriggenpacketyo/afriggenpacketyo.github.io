          <p>President Trump announced he "made progress" on a deal concerning TikTok's ownership during a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. In a social media post, Trump stated he would visit China early next year and that the two leaders would first meet at the upcoming APEC Summit in South Korea. The conversation comes as the White House navigates a federal law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest from the app or face a US ban, a law Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and Penguin Random House, labeling the complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible." The lawsuit alleged that a series of articles and a book published by the defendants were libelous and intended to damage his reputation and electoral chances. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday gave the president's legal team 28 days to refile the lawsuit, criticizing the original complaint as more of a political rally speech than a proper legal document.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a Republican-led bill to fund the government for seven weeks, narrowly avoiding a shutdown with a 217-212 vote. The measure, which includes additional security funding for lawmakers, now faces significant opposition in the Senate, where it requires Democratic support to pass. Senate Democrats have condemned the bill as partisan and are pushing a counter-proposal that includes extensions for Affordable Care Act tax credits, setting the stage for a contentious fight as the funding deadline approaches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and China over TikTok's ownership may center on a licensing agreement for the app's highly valued recommendation algorithm. This approach could resolve the stalemate, as Chinese law prohibits the export of such technology without government approval, while US officials have national security concerns about Chinese access to user data. Experts suggest a deal might involve a U.S. entity effectively 'renting' the algorithm, but questions remain about whether this would fully sever ties with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p>

          <p>NATO has intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets after they violated the airspace of member country Estonia over the Gulf of Finland. The incursion, which Estonia's foreign ministry called "unprecedentedly brazen," has heightened regional tensions following recent Russian drone breaches over Poland and Romania. Top EU and NATO officials condemned the incident as another example of reckless Russian behavior, vowing to respond with determination and bolster the alliance's eastern flank against increasing aggression.</p>

          <p>A group of prominent Hollywood actors and filmmakers, including Javier Bardem and Joaquin Phoenix, have pledged to boycott Israel's state-funded film industry to protest the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The boycott targets Israeli film institutions rather than individuals, drawing inspiration from similar actions against apartheid-era South Africa. The move coincides with internal conflict in Israel, where the culture minister has threatened to defund the national film academy for selecting an anti-war drama as its Oscar submission.</p>

Critics have generally praised the record for its witty and vigorous lyrical content, though some have noted that its 23-song tracklist makes for an overly long listening experience.</p>

          <p>The recent interest rate reduction by the Federal Reserve has made borrowing cheaper for homeowners, specifically lowering the monthly payments on Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). An analysis shows that a $50,000 HELOC is now significantly less expensive than it was in previous months, providing financial relief for those tapping into their home's equity. Unlike fixed-rate home equity loans, HELOCs have variable rates that adjust automatically, allowing borrowers to benefit from the current cooler rate climate without needing to refinance.

          <p>Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time during Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, leading his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc in a one-two finish for the team. The session proved difficult for McLaren's Lando Norris, who crashed at Turn Four early in his qualifying simulation, breaking his car's rear suspension and missing crucial track time. Despite the incident, Leclerc commented that McLaren appeared to have formidable pace, suggesting they could be a major threat in qualifying.</p>

This shift reflects an "America First" policy that prioritizes replenishing U.S. stockpiles for a potential conflict with China over arming traditional allies.

          <p>Louisiana health officials have confirmed that a fifth person has died this year from an infection caused by Vibrio vulnificus, a rare flesh-eating bacteria. The state has seen 26 documented cases in 2025, a notable increase that experts suggest may be linked to warming coastal waters caused by climate change. The bacteria, typically found in the Gulf Coast, can be contracted when an open wound is exposed to contaminated water or by eating raw or undercooked seafood like oysters.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its online third-party marketplace was facilitated by relaxing its seller vetting processes, which has led to a proliferation of counterfeit and fraudulent products. Shoppers have received fake items, including potentially hazardous health and beauty products, from sellers who sometimes operate using the stolen identities of legitimate businesses. While the strategy helped Walmart's e-commerce business become profitable, critics describe the platform as a "Wild West" where it is easier for bad actors to operate compared to rivals like Amazon.</p>

To mitigate the impact of trade levies, Apple has been actively diversifying its supply chain, increasing production in countries such as India and Vietnam to reduce its reliance on China.</p>
