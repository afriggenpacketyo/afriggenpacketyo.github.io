        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also serving as the national security adviser, announced a significant restructuring of the National Security Council, reducing its staff by at least half. The changes involve officials returning to their original agencies and others being placed on administrative leave. Some teams focusing on specific regions or issues will be significantly reduced or eliminated, aligning with President Trump's top-down approach to foreign policy debates. Vice President JD Vance’s national security adviser Andy Baker will take a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser, as is White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel.</p>

The facilities planning and management department responded to the leak, shut off the water, and initiated repairs, but there is no estimated timeline for the building's reopening.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Global Change Biology reveals that the increasing use of hummingbird feeders has altered the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbirds' beaks. The birds' beaks have become longer and more slender, allowing them to extract more nectar from feeders, while males' beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competitors. The hummingbirds have also expanded their range northward, adapting to cooler temperatures due to the availability of feeders. Researchers analyzed newspaper archives and museum specimens to track the changes over ten generations, demonstrating the rapid pace of evolution in response to human influence.</p>

          <p>Investigators are examining whether technical malfunctions at a San Diego airport contributed to a fatal plane crash that killed six people and destroyed homes. The airport experienced two separate issues: the Automated Surface Observing Station, which provides weather data, was inoperative due to a power surge, and one of the runways had a lighting system malfunction. The pilot of the Cessna 550, aiming for the runway with lighting issues, did not report any problems or declare an emergency before crashing into a residential neighborhood. The plane was not equipped with a flight data recorder, and the NTSB is investigating whether a cockpit voice recorder was onboard.</p>

While the ownership structure remains unclear, Trump indicated it would be an investment by Nippon Steel rather than a complete takeover. Investors reacted positively, with U.S. Steel shares jumping significantly. The United Steelworkers union expressed concern, while Pennsylvania officials voiced support for the deal.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, originally due in the spring, with a spokesperson stating it will be released later this year. The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures, including potentially scrapping the two-child benefit cap. The delay has drawn criticism from the SNP, who accused Labour of imitating Nigel Farage, while Save the Children UK expressed concern over the continued two-child limit. However, the Trussell Trust suggested the delay could be positive if it leads to a more substantial strategy.</p>

Advised by his doctor to refrain from performing, Joel, 76, will undergo physical therapy. NPH involves the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to symptoms like difficulty walking, cognitive issues, and urinary incontinence. The condition is treatable with a surgical procedure to implant a shunt, and fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds.</p>
