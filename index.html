          <p>A group of Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, is questioning Google about its settlement discussions with Donald Trump's lawyers regarding a censorship lawsuit. The senators expressed concern that Google might offer a favorable settlement in exchange for leniency from a Trump administration on other major legal issues, such as antitrust and labor law violations. This inquiry follows a court filing indicating that both parties were engaged in "productive discussions" about the suit, which stems from the suspension of Trump's social media accounts after January 6, 2021.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has joined a multi-state lawsuit to block President Trump's prohibition on gender-affirming surgeries for minors, framing his opposition as a defense against government overreach into private healthcare decisions. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Republicans, who accuse him of endangering children to appeal to his party's base. This legal and political conflict highlights the deep national divide over transgender rights and sets the stage for future political battles.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reportedly planning to visit China for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which would be his first trip to the country in seven years. This potential visit signals a significant thaw in relations between the two Asian powers, which have been tense since a deadly border clash in 2020. The diplomatic outreach comes as India's relationship with the United States is strained by new trade tariffs, prompting speculation about a strategic realignment by New Delhi.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, labeling him "highly conflicted" due to his investment ties to Chinese companies. The demand, made on social media, followed a letter from Senator Tom Cotton that raised national security concerns about Tan's associations.

          <p>Israel's security cabinet is scheduled to meet to decide on a potential full military takeover of the Gaza Strip, a strategy Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly favors to dismantle Hamas. However, the plan faces resistance from some military leaders who warn it could endanger the remaining hostages and trap Israeli troops in a prolonged conflict. The United Nations has voiced deep alarm, stating that such a move would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences for the already displaced Palestinian population.</p>

          <p>President Trump has instructed the Commerce Department to begin planning for a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from its count for the first time in U.S. history. This move challenges the 14th Amendment's requirement to count the "whole number of persons in each state" for congressional apportionment. The directive renews a legally contentious effort from his first term and is expected to face immediate court challenges from critics who argue it would distort political representation and federal funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump is poised to sign an executive order that would pave the way for alternative assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. This move would direct the Labor Department to review guidance, potentially opening up trillions of dollars in retirement savings to higher-risk, higher-reward investments. While the alternative asset industry has pushed for this access, critics worry about the high fees, lack of transparency, and increased risk for individual savers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wide-ranging new set of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on more than 90 countries has officially gone into effect. This move is a central part of the president's agenda to reshape global trade relationships and encourage domestic manufacturing. The tariff rates vary, with some key allies like the UK and Japan having negotiated lower duties, while other nations face much higher levies as the U.S. uses trade policy as a tool to achieve various economic and political goals.</p>

The number of new billionaires signing the non-binding pledge to give away at least half their wealth has slowed significantly. The report also suggests that the explosive growth in billionaire wealth has outpaced their giving, making it difficult for many members to fulfill their commitment, raising questions about the pledge's overall effectiveness.</p>

The law's provisions, including work requirements for adults, are expected to cause millions of children to lose their health coverage as their parents are dropped from the rolls. This could lead to the collapse of an already fragile pediatric care system, increasing the number of uninsured children and shuttering essential health services.</p>

Citing statements from Israeli officials at the war's outset and documentation from human rights groups, the article argues that the blocking of food, water, and fuel constitutes the use of starvation as a weapon of war, which is illegal under international law. The situation is described as unique because it is entirely human-made and defies a readily available international aid capacity.</p>
