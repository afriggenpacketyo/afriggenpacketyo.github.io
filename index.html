          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale centers on addressing extreme weather conditions exacerbated by climate change, such as heat waves and floods, and how cities can adapt. Curator Carlo Ratti emphasizes the need for a collective intelligence to rethink the built environment and incorporate solutions from various disciplines. The exhibition highlights the urgency of adapting building approaches, noting the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on vulnerable populations. The event showcases climate-adapted designs, like the redesign of Paul-Arnsberg-Platz in Frankfurt, and advocates for a global construction revolution to create more resilient and habitable cities.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to announce sanctions targeting Russia's 'shadow fleet,' a group of oil tankers used to bypass existing restrictions on oil and gas exports. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will reveal the measures at a summit of northern European leaders in Oslo, Norway. The sanctions aim to disrupt President Vladimir Putin's ability to fund the war in Ukraine by cutting off oil revenues. The targeted vessels, deemed 'decrepit and dangerous,' will be banned from British ports and risk detention in UK waters, as the UK seeks to increase pressure on Moscow and promote peace in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, primarily fueled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to prohibitive tariffs. Shipments to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, while imports from the U.S. also dropped nearly 14%. The rise in overall exports may be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were implemented. Meanwhile, exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%, with significant growth in shipments to Indonesia and Thailand.</p>

          <p>Japan is maintaining its demand for the complete removal of tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump as a condition for reaching a trade agreement with Washington. Tokyo seeks the elimination of additional levies, including a 25% tariff on cars and a 25% duty on steel and aluminum. The government dismissed the idea of reducing the consumption tax rate to help soften the blow from inflation and U.S. tariffs, deeming it inappropriate. Meanwhile, Japan's household spending in fiscal year 2024 dropped for the second consecutive year amid rising prices.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a stroke in 2013 that left him with aphasia, has made a remarkable comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Collaborating with musician James Dupré, Travis has released two new songs, 'Where That Came From' and 'Horses in Heaven,' and has extended his 'More Life Tour' into fall 2025. AI was used to model Travis's voice using raw vocals from his past recordings, allowing him to continue creating music despite his condition. Travis's wife, Mary, emphasizes the creative process involved, highlighting that it took eleven months to perfect one song, and that AI has been 'wonderful' for her husband.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to launch a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to navigate U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip represents Nvidia's effort to sustain its presence in China, a critical market, amid tightening restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology. The modified chip will feature significant downgrades from the original H20, including substantially reduced memory capacity, to comply with new technical thresholds set by U.S. officials. Despite these adjustments, Nvidia aims to provide Chinese customers with AI capabilities while adhering to regulatory requirements.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop after its first-quarter earnings fell short of estimates. While revenue increased by 28% year-on-year to $2.24 billion and profit attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million, these figures missed expectations due to 'production fluctuations' affecting blended average selling prices. The company anticipates a sequential revenue decrease of 4% to 6% in the current quarter, with a gross margin decline. Despite these challenges, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, and capacity utilization reached 89.6%.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's tariffs are driving ultra-rich investors in Asia to reduce their exposure to U.S. assets due to increased unpredictability in the world's largest economy.

This pullback marks a significant shift from earlier optimism following Trump's election.

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student recently released from detention, accuses Columbia University of eroding democracy through its handling of campus protests related to the Israel-Hamas war. Mahdawi, who led anti-war protests, claims the university is inciting violence against students and supporting the Trump administration's agenda. He had been arrested as he was about to finalize his U.S. citizenship, with the Trump administration arguing his activism threatened its foreign policy goals. Mahdawi plans to attend his graduation from Columbia as a message of hope and the importance of education.</p>

          <p>Russia is holding a large Victory Day parade in Moscow, celebrating the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, while attempts to end the war in Ukraine falter. President Vladimir Putin will preside over the event, attended by leaders from over 20 countries, showcasing Russia's past glories and justifying its actions in Ukraine. This year's parade is expected to be the largest since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with the presence or absence of foreign dignitaries serving as a sign of allegiance to the West. The Kremlin has tried to justify the invasion by falsely asserting that the government in Kyiv has been hijacked by a group of Nazis.</p>

Industry executives are now relying on Europe to compensate for the pullback in the U.S., but there are questions over whether the handful of giant projects now underway will be completed.
