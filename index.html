          <p>The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, citing increased uncertainty about the economic outlook due to President Trump's tariffs.  Despite this, the Fed still anticipates two rate cuts by the end of the year, projecting weaker economic growth and higher inflation than previously forecast.  The decision follows recent market volatility triggered by the tariffs and reflects the Fed's cautious approach to navigating the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5%, meaning borrowing costs will remain high for consumers.  While rate cuts are still expected in 2025, credit card, loan, and auto financing costs will likely stay elevated.  However, higher rates also mean banks will pay more interest on savings accounts and certificates of deposit.</p>
