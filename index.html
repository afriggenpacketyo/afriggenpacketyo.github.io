          <p>The UK government's borrowing reached its highest September level in five years, totaling £20.2 billion, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase was driven by rising debt interest payments, which offset higher tax revenues and intensified the financial challenges facing the chancellor ahead of the upcoming Budget. Public sector debt now stands at 95.3% of GDP, a level not seen since the early 1960s, fueling debate over the government's fiscal policy and economic strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun serving a five-year prison sentence for conspiring to finance his 2007 election campaign with illicit funds from Libya. He is the first former French head of state to be imprisoned in the modern era, a development that has captivated the nation. Sarkozy, who maintains his innocence and has lodged an appeal, is being held in the isolation wing of Paris's La Santé prison for security reasons. President Emmanuel Macron met with his predecessor before the incarceration, a gesture he described as a humane act.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator stated that his company's proposed acquisition of Bitcoin miner Core Scientific is a "nice to have" but not essential. This comment comes as the deal faces significant opposition from shareholders and a negative recommendation from proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), who argue the offer undervalues Core Scientific. Despite the pushback, Intrator confirmed that CoreWeave will not increase its bid, leaving the fate of the acquisition to a shareholder vote scheduled for October 30. (not investment advice)</p>

He later amplified the controversy by telling people to "ask your daughters" what he meant, which critics have condemned as a racist implication unsupported by data. The remarks have drawn backlash from political opponents and even members of his own conservative CDU party, who have called for a more responsible debate culture from the head of government.</p>

          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday caused widespread disruptions for thousands of major websites and applications globally, including Snapchat, Reddit, and several banks. Amazon confirmed the issue was related to its DNS resolution systems in a key U.S. data center and announced late Monday that services had returned to normal. The incident has renewed concerns among experts about the internet's heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud providers, highlighting how a single failure can have cascading effects across the economy.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have formally urged the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold a lower court's order that blocks the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard into the city. In their legal brief, lawyers argued that the administration's request relies on "mischaracterizations" of the situation and that state and local law enforcement are capable of handling protest activities. They contend that the deployment would cause irreparable harm and disrupt the constitutional balance of power between federal and state authorities.</p>

          <p>Following a brazen daylight heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, art crime experts have expressed grave concerns that the stolen priceless jewels may have already been dismantled.

French authorities have assigned a specialist police unit to the case, suspecting the involvement of a professional organized crime network.</p>

          <p>A theory known as "winology," which posits that the West unfairly dismisses China's advancements due to hierarchical thinking, is gaining popularity on Chinese social media. Originating from Chinese academic circles, the concept suggests a perceived global ranking of peoples that places Chinese at a lower tier, thus preventing objective recognition of the country's successes. The theory is now attracting academic debate, with scholars suggesting it helps explain contemporary geopolitical tensions and fosters intellectual discussion about China's global position.</p>

Critics worry the renovation will reflect the president's personal style rather than the building's historic character, while the White House maintains it will be a "beautiful and necessary" addition.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a U.S. fugitive who faked his own death and fled to Scotland to evade prosecution, has been sentenced to at least five years in prison for the 2008 sexual assault of a woman in Utah.

The judge described him as a "serial abuser of women" and the "very definition of a flight risk" before handing down the indeterminate sentence.</p>
