          <p>The highly anticipated summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded in Alaska without a definitive agreement to end the war in Ukraine. Trump described the talks as "productive" and noted that progress was made, while Putin extended an invitation for a future meeting in Moscow. Despite the dialogue, no ceasefire was announced, and Ukraine was not included in the direct discussions, leaving the conflict's resolution uncertain and stoking concerns among allies about the potential terms of any future deal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from The Guardian frames the Alaska summit as a significant rhetorical victory for Vladimir Putin, arguing that Donald Trump was overly deferential to the Russian leader. The analysis highlights the optics of the meeting, from the red-carpet welcome to Trump's public praise, suggesting it legitimized Putin on the world stage without securing any concessions. The piece also notes Putin's validation of Trump's claims about the 2020 election, portraying the event as an alignment of authoritarian narratives rather than a productive diplomatic engagement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A structured analysis of the Alaska summit identifies several critical outcomes, primarily noting that the meeting served as a symbolic victory for Vladimir Putin by welcoming him back to the world stage. The article points out the conspicuous absence of a ceasefire agreement or any concrete steps toward peace in Ukraine, with both leaders offering only vague statements. Key takeaways include the lack of specifics on what was agreed upon and Putin's unscripted invitation to Moscow, which has left allies questioning the future direction of the peace process.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is advancing a new policy that tightens residency requirements for nationals from mainland China applying to live on the island. The proposed amendment mandates that applicants provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. This measure is part of President Lai's strategy to counter what he views as security threats from Beijing, including societal infiltration, though critics have condemned the move as an attack on mainland spouses and their families.</p>

The team's performance was bolstered by a strong six-inning outing from pitcher Clayton Kershaw and clean defensive play, breaking a recent four-game losing streak. This win provides a much-needed boost for the Dodgers, who have been navigating a difficult stretch marked by inconsistent offense and the recent injury of third baseman Max Muncy.</p>

This surge is largely attributed to intense investor optimism surrounding the potential of artificial intelligence to drive future earnings.

The ambiguity of the summit's conclusion has left European and Ukrainian leaders uncertain about the future of negotiations and America's strategic direction.</p>
