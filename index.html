        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-anticipated decline in August, contracting by only 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from the 2.6% drop seen in July. This figure surpassed economists' expectations of a 1.9% contraction, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline but at a decelerated pace. Meanwhile, imports also contracted less than the previous month but more than forecasted, falling by 5.2%. The data provides a mixed but cautiously optimistic signal for the Japanese economy ahead of the Bank of Japan's upcoming interest rate decision, where it is expected to maintain current rates.

          <p>Online ticket platform StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, establishing the company's valuation at $8.6 billion. This pricing falls at the midpoint of the company's expected range and comes after several previous delays in its attempts to go public. The company, which was reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." The move signals a potential rebound in the IPO market, which has seen renewed activity after a slowdown caused by high inflation and rising interest rates.</p>

          <p>A candlelight vigil held at Arizona State University honored the legacy of conservative leader Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. Attendees and speakers, including close colleagues, used the event to transform the tragedy into a call for political activism, particularly urging people to register to vote. Organizers from Turning Point USA and College Republicans framed the moment as a potential catalyst for the conservative movement, especially among young Americans in Generation Z. The gathering was marked by patriotic chants and a significant voter registration effort, reflecting a deliberate strategy to channel grief into political mobilization.</p>

          <p>A study by the Yale School of Public Health reveals that thousands of abducted Ukrainian children are being subjected to forced "reeducation" and militarization at over 200 facilities across Russia and its occupied territories. Researchers found that children undergo combat and paratrooper training, and in some instances, are made to produce military equipment like drones. The report, based on open-source data and satellite imagery, details a systematic effort to indoctrinate the children with pro-Russian ideologies. This follows a March 2023 arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for Vladimir Putin for the war crime of unlawful deportation of children.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed the state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. While Mangione still faces a second-degree murder charge and eight weapons-related counts in the state case, the judge ruled the evidence was legally insufficient to support the terrorism counts. The judge's decision noted a lack of evidence that Mangione intended to terrorize the public or engage in a broader campaign of violence.

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reports that the 16-year-old responsible for a recent Colorado high school shooting was an active user on a website known for hosting graphic violence and white supremacist content.

The teen, who died by suicide after injuring two students, had posted extremist symbols and tributes to other mass killers on social media.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to make a critical interest rate decision, with most economists predicting a cut amidst conflicting economic data and political pressure from President Trump. While a slowing labor market suggests a need for lower borrowing costs to stimulate hiring, inflation has been gradually increasing, partly due to administration tariffs, which argues for holding rates steady. This places the Fed in a difficult position of balancing its dual mandate of maintaining low inflation and ensuring full employment. The decision will be closely watched for signals about the central bank's future policy direction for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The article argues that Redford consistently sidestepped easy, heroic parts to explore flawed and morally ambiguous characters in films like "The Candidate" and "Downhill Racer." By doing so, he used his all-American image as a Trojan horse to make audiences question their own ideals and the nation's hidden rot. His legacy includes not only his iconic acting roles but also his work as a director and his foundational support for independent cinema through the Sundance Institute.</p>

Players have highlighted a new "clean sheet mentality," a stark contrast to the more free-flowing but defensively vulnerable style seen under the previous manager.

          <p>This opinion article argues that in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder, his allies are ironically using the tragedy to call for crackdowns on dissent and "hate speech," betraying the very principles of free speech Kirk championed. The author notes that Kirk built his career by engaging in often abrasive debate on college campuses, using the First Amendment as a shield for controversial ideas. Now that his political allies are in power, they appear eager to suppress opposing views, with some calling for social media bans and government action against critics. This shift highlights a deep tension within the MAGA movement between its countercultural roots and its current exercise of power.</p>

          <p>Two Labour Members of Parliament, Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley, were denied entry into Israel while on a parliamentary delegation to the occupied West Bank. The MPs, both of whom are doctors, were traveling to observe humanitarian and medical work in the region. The UK Foreign Office has condemned the decision as "totally unacceptable and deeply concerning," stating it is not how British Parliamentarians should be treated. This incident follows a similar denial of entry to two other Labour MPs earlier this year, raising concerns about access and the ability of foreign officials to assess the situation on the ground.</p>

          <p>South Korean engineers detained in a large-scale U.S. immigration raid in Georgia have described being treated like criminals, with armed officers handcuffing and shackling them before taking them to a detention center. The workers, who were in the U.S. temporarily to help build an electric car battery plant, were held on suspicion of visa violations but were later allowed to leave voluntarily. They reported being held in freezing conditions and expressed shock at the aggressive tactics, which included helicopters and drones. The incident has strained relations between the two allied nations, prompting an investigation by Seoul into potential human rights violations.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old wild burro is recovering after being shot with a hunting arrow in Moreno Valley, California, in what is the latest of at least six similar attacks since June. The burro, nicknamed Cupid, was found with an arrow puncturing her right lung and underwent emergency surgery to remove it. A non-profit rescue organization, DonkeyLand, is now offering a $24,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the attacks on the federally protected animals. These wild burros are considered an iconic symbol of the region and have been a part of the local landscape for decades.</p>

          <p>A Utah county prosecutor has laid out startling details in the case against Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk. In a press conference, the prosecutor revealed text messages in which Robinson allegedly confessed to his roommate, stating he did it because he "had enough of his hatred." The evidence suggests the attack was planned for over a week, and Robinson's mother reportedly told investigators her son had become more politically left-leaning and pro-trans rights, clashing with his family's conservative views. Prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder and announced their intent to seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Google's Gemini has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT and signaling that Google is gaining significant traction in the consumer artificial intelligence race. The app's popularity surged following recent updates, including a new image editing feature called Nano Banana that attracted 13 million new users in just four days. This milestone, combined with strong user engagement, has bolstered investor confidence, helping Google's parent company, Alphabet, recently join the exclusive group of companies with a $3 trillion market valuation. The success marks a key victory for Google as it competes directly with early AI frontrunners.</p>

This will be the first time in 12 years that NHL players compete in the Games, a return driven by a strong desire from the players themselves to represent their countries. The decision was also facilitated by a new agreement with the IOC that improves commercial arrangements and player living conditions. While the league will have to pause its season for two weeks, Bettman believes that being on one of the world's biggest stages will ultimately be worth the difficulties.</p>

          <p>Prominent sports investor Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, believes it is unlikely that major sports teams or ownership groups will go public. Speaking at a conference, Harris explained that sports assets have historically been valued more highly as private entities, and publicly traded teams often trade below their intrinsic value. He argued that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which may not align with the short-term earnings focus of public markets. This structure is better suited for intergenerational assets like NFL teams, which can now also raise capital through approved private equity investments.</p>

In exchange, the auditor allegedly assessed substantially lower tax penalties and halted further audits.

Ricks noted that his company recently paused plans for a biotech incubator in the UK, joining other firms concerned about the investment climate. He pointed to the UK's drug pricing controls and rebate systems as major deterrents for capital investment, despite the country's strong scientific base. He suggested that U.S. policymakers should view the UK's situation as a cautionary tale, emphasizing that capital naturally flows to where it is most welcome.</p>
