          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are scheduled to meet in Istanbul for a new round of ceasefire negotiations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated the primary focus will be on exchanging prisoners of war rather than achieving a comprehensive end to the conflict. Separately, Zelenskyy signed a controversial law that curtails the autonomy of Ukraine's anti-corruption bodies, leading to protests in Kyiv. The article provides an update on both the diplomatic and domestic political fronts of the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing reciprocal tariffs of 15% on Japanese exports to the U.S., including a reduction in auto tariffs. President Trump touted the deal as potentially the "largest Deal ever made," claiming it would involve a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. The agreement is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, potentially strengthening his leadership amid domestic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The sentencing for Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the murder of four University of Idaho students, is set to take place, with victims' families expected to deliver impact statements directly to him in court. Kohberger, a former criminology Ph.D. student, admitted to the November 2022 home invasion killings but has not provided a motive. The plea deal spares him the death penalty in exchange for four consecutive life sentences without parole, a resolution that has divided the victims' families but will avoid a lengthy trial and appeals process.</p>

          <p>Opposition groups and civil society in Eswatini are expressing outrage over a deal with the United States to accept deported individuals whom their home countries refuse to take back. The largest opposition party has labeled the agreement "human trafficking disguised as a deportation deal," raising concerns about transparency and safety. The men, convicted of serious crimes including murder and child sexual assault, have been transferred to the southern African monarchy, which says it is prepared to receive more deportees under the U.S.-funded arrangement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Barack Obama's office issued a rare and forceful rebuttal to President Donald Trump's accusation of "treason," labeling the claims "ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction." Trump had alleged, citing a report from his intelligence chief, that Obama orchestrated a plot to undermine his 2016 election victory by linking him to Russian interference. Obama's spokesperson countered that the claims are baseless and do not undercut the widely accepted conclusion from the U.S. intelligence community that Russia did work to influence the election.</p>

          <p>A powerful 1975 photograph by Stanley Forman, capturing a woman and child falling from a collapsed fire escape in Boston, had a lasting impact on public safety regulations.
