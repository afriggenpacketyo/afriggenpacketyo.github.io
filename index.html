          <p>Robert Holzmann, the Austrian central bank chief, suggests the European Central Bank should maintain current interest rates until there is more clarity regarding U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures. He expressed concern that countermeasures in Europe could increase prices, while a lack of countermeasures might exert downward price pressure. Holzmann emphasized the need for caution and further data before making any decisions about monetary policy, noting a broad consensus on lowering rates but disagreement on the timing due to tariff-related uncertainties. The ECB previously voted to cut rates by a quarter percentage point at its April meeting. Optimism score: 55</p>
