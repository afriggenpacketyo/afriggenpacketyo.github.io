        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Sean "Diddy" Combs' 50-month prison sentence for prostitution-related offenses, his defense lawyers announced plans to appeal, arguing the judge improperly considered charges for which Combs was acquitted. Lead attorney Teny Geragos stated the jury's "not guilty" verdict on sex trafficking and RICO counts should have been respected, accusing the judge of acting as a "13th juror" by allowing these unproven allegations to influence the sentence. The defense claims the sentence, four times their requested length, undermines rehabilitation efforts for a man who has already served 13 months. They contend that while he accepts responsibility for domestic violence, he was not convicted of those specific crimes, making the judge's emphasis on past violence inconsistent with the jury's findings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retained firefighters in the UK, who served for decades as on-call emergency responders in rural areas, are still awaiting full pension entitlements despite recent legal victories. Many, like Roger Dunton, who dedicated 28 years, were not eligible for pensions until recent years, with some retirees and widows still facing significant delays in receiving owed funds. The Fire Brigades Union fought for these rights, leading to rulings allowing claims dating back to 2000, and later for entire careers. Complex calculations and administrative issues, exacerbated by past budget cuts, are cited as reasons for the ongoing delays, causing deep frustration among those who gave 24-hour commitment to public service.</p>

          <p>During a terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, authorities announced that one of the two fatalities and one of the three injured may have been inadvertently shot by police officers. The perpetrator, a 35-year-old Syrian-born British citizen, drove into pedestrians outside the synagogue and attacked with a knife before being fatally shot by officers, who noted he carried no firearm. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Steve Watson described this as a "tragic and unforeseen consequence" of their urgent action to end the "vicious" antisemitic incident. The police complaints watchdog is now carrying out an investigation into the full circumstances of what transpired.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Governor Josh Stein signed "Iryna's Law," a bill designed to increase scrutiny on bail decisions and prohibit cashless bail for certain violent crimes and most repeat offenders. The legislation was prompted by the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska by Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., a man with a history of over a dozen arrests. While Governor Stein expressed reservations about some parts, including a controversial amendment related to execution methods, he supported the bill's core aim. He emphasized that it alerts the judiciary to take a special look at people who may pose unusual risks of violence before determining their bail, aiming to enhance public safety.</p>

The compact seeks changes on gender identity, admissions, diversity, and free speech, aiming to promote conservative views and restrict foreign student enrollment. USC's interim president, Beong-Soo Kim, stated the university would consult stakeholders before deciding, highlighting the complex pressure institutions face between federal incentives and state values.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is exploring the creation of new one-dollar coins for the nation's 250th anniversary, potentially featuring an image of President Donald Trump. A draft design reportedly shows Trump's face on one side and him pumping his fist after a near-assassination on the other, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight" engraved. This initiative is possible under the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, signed by Trump. However, existing provisions generally prohibit living persons, especially presidents, from appearing on U.S. currency, though Congress could provide an exception, as it did in 1926 for President Calvin Coolidge.</p>

The sentence, significantly less than the potential life term he initially faced but longer than his defense requested, reflects the judge's unpersuaded stance on Combs' claims of being a "changed man." The court heard graphic accounts of sexual abuse, and the judge highlighted Combs' abuse of power and resources. This denouement to a high-profile trial underscores the severe legal consequences and the complex narratives of celebrity, power, and accountability.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Hall was evacuated after a vehicle crashed near its steps, leading to a nearly two-hour standoff with the driver. The incident prompted road closures and a significant police response, with the driver eventually surrendering and being taken into custody. Posters on the vehicle's dashboard, reportedly stating "Don’t want to hurt no body" and "I need ur help D. Trump U.S. Vet," suggested a potential motive involving a plea for presidential assistance. Mayor Karen Bass confirmed she was briefed and thanked first responders, as authorities investigate whether the crash was intentional, causing significant disruption and raising security concerns at a prominent government building.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, who became a feminist icon after the largest sexual assault trial in French history, is returning to court for the appeal of one of her 51 assailants. For over a decade, Pelicot was drugged and sexually assaulted by dozens of men recruited by her husband, who filmed the acts. Despite all initial defendants being found guilty, Husamettin Dogan is appealing his nine-year sentence, forcing Pelicot to relive the trauma. The trial's immense public resonance, fueled by Pelicot's decision to waive anonymity, has profoundly impacted French society's understanding of consent, but has also tragically fractured her family due to internal accusations of incest.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-China protests in South Korea have not deterred Chinese tourists, with scheduled flights operating normally and South Korea remaining a top destination. Analysts suggest that because both governments oppose the rallies and public safety is maintained, tourists are largely unaffected. The Chinese embassy "regretfully noted" the demonstrations in areas frequented by Chinese travelers, yet no official travel advisories have been issued, indicating a stable situation despite underlying tensions. This suggests that while political friction exists, it has not translated into a significant disruption for the tourism sector or broader economic relations between the two nations, at least for now.</p>

Legal experts condemned this as "jawboning," arguing it constitutes government censorship through intimidation and undermines free speech. The app's developer criticized the tech giants for capitulating to an "authoritarian regime," noting the inconsistency with other crowdsourced mapping features like those for police speed traps. Critics warn that such compliance by major corporations erodes First Amendment protections and sets a dangerous precedent, especially as tech leaders seek to ingratiate themselves with the administration amidst tariff policies.</p>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals widespread apprehension among Americans, who overwhelmingly deem political violence unacceptable yet anticipate its increase in coming years. This concern spans all political affiliations and age groups, with older Americans particularly emphasizing its unacceptability. The poll also highlights a growing pessimism about bipartisan cooperation and a reluctance among nearly half of the public to express political views publicly, fearing negative consequences like insults, threats, or employment problems. This data underscores deep societal divisions and a perceived decline in civility, contributing to a sense of instability and a challenging political climate.</p>

          <p>Sophie Roske was sentenced to eight years and one month in federal prison for attempting to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022. Roske, who pleaded guilty to traveling with weapons and plotting the murder, was motivated by expected Supreme Court opinions on abortion and gun rights. Prosecutors had sought a 30-year sentence, arguing her actions constituted "terrorism" aimed at altering the constitutional order. While the judge acknowledged Roske's mental health issues and remorse, noting she called police on herself, the sentence emphasizes the gravity of threatening a public official. The Justice Department, however, deemed the sentence "woefully insufficient" and plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>Two American intelligence officials allege that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly approved drone attacks on two Gaza-bound humanitarian aid vessels off Tunisia last month. Drones reportedly dropped incendiary devices onto the boats, causing fires, though no one was killed or injured. The Global Sumud Flotilla, which organized the mission to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza, condemned the attacks as reckless and a pattern of "arrogance and impunity." Israel maintains a naval blockade of Gaza, citing security concerns related to Hamas, but the use of incendiary weapons against civilian objects is prohibited. This incident raises serious questions about international humanitarian law and military actions against civilian aid efforts.</p>

          <p>Amazon is closing four more Fresh supermarkets in Southern California, continuing to shift its grocery strategy towards Whole Foods and online delivery. These closures follow others in the U.S. and UK, as the company re-evaluates which locations are most effective and aligns with CEO Andy Jassy's cost-cutting efforts. Amazon, which launched Fresh in 2020 to target mass-market shoppers, has faced challenges and previously halted expansion plans. While scaling back Fresh stores, Amazon affirms its commitment to grocery, innovating with new "price-conscious" brands and expanding same-day delivery. This indicates a strategic refinement rather than a retreat from the market, aiming for greater efficiency and customer reach.</p>

          <p>An analysis underscores the significance of Hamas's conditional agreement to key elements of President Trump's Gaza peace proposal, offering hope for Israeli hostage families. Hamas agreed to release all hostages, living and dead, subject to negotiations and "field conditions," and to transfer Gaza governance to Palestinian technocrats. However, the proposal's crucial requirement for Hamas to disarm remains notably absent from their response. This partial acceptance, following Trump's ultimatum, puts pressure on Israel to halt bombing, creating a complex path forward where the Israeli government will scrutinize Hamas's true intent amidst cautious optimism for a lasting peace, but with many details still to be resolved.</p>

This compromise, a result of years of battles between labor and tech, marks one of the largest expansions of private-sector union rights, contrasting with the Trump administration's stance on worker protections. The law outlines a process for drivers to form unions by collecting signatures, enabling negotiations on pay, benefits, and working conditions.
