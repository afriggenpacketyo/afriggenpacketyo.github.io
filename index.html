          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis, parent company of Jeep and Chrysler, has confirmed a data breach exposing customer contact details after attackers infiltrated a third-party platform used for North American customer services. The company asserts that deeply sensitive financial or health records were out of reach, but the compromised contact information is sufficient for sophisticated phishing campaigns or extortion attempts. This incident is linked to the ShinyHunters extortion campaign, which has spearheaded a wave of data thefts targeting Salesforce customers across various sectors, impacting major brands globally. Stellantis has activated its incident response protocols, launched a full investigation, and is actively advising affected customers on crucial protective measures, including data removal services, vigilance against phishing, and robust password management.</p>

Co-founded by Venezuelan immigrants Yelitza Rivera and her son Jesus Arrieta, the restaurant operates four successful locations across the city. Beyond its culinary offerings, the establishment demonstrates profound generosity by preparing and donating 80 to 100 fresh, scratch-made meals daily to neighbors in need. This significant charitable initiative, a promise made by Rivera, ensures that everyone in the Humboldt Park community has access to at least one hot meal, embodying a deep commitment to social welfare.</p>

Although Jackson himself was hospitalized with a lung infection and unable to attend the event, his family stated he was expected to be well enough to attend church on Sunday. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, former alderman and congressman Bobby Rush, and Jackson's sons, U.S. Rep. Jonathan Jackson and former U.S. Rep.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi faced contentious questioning from Senate Democrats regarding allegations of the Justice Department's "weaponization" under President Trump and the handling of Jeffrey Epstein's investigative files. Democrats, led by Sen. Dick Durbin, accused Bondi of systematically politicizing the DOJ by targeting Trump's political opponents and overseeing the departure of numerous career officials. Bondi, however, vehemently defended her tenure, asserting she was actively working to end the department's weaponization and refocus its mission on combating genuine crime. The hearing also extensively delved into conflicting statements from the administration regarding the release of Epstein's files and a purported "client list," which Bondi firmly denied existed.</p>

          <h2>Psychology Expert Shares Five Rules for Achieving Happiness Without Abundant Wealth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 11:51:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychology expert and author Morgan Housel presents five fundamental rules for achieving happiness that are independent of abundant wealth, advocating for contentment over relentless material pursuit. The article emphasizes that genuine satisfaction arises from appreciating one's current possessions and circumstances rather than perpetually desiring more, drawing inspiration from art and personal anecdotes, such as his profoundly content, low-income grandmother-in-law. Housel argues that happiness is fundamentally the gap between one's expectations and existing circumstances, suggesting that cultivating lower expectations can foster immense psychological wealth.

          <h2>European Union Plans to Double Steel Tariffs Amid Surge in Chinese Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 11:47:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has announced plans to double tariffs on foreign steel imports to 50% and significantly halve the volume allowed into the bloc before duties are imposed. This strategic move aims to shield Europe's struggling steel sector from intense competition, particularly from China, whose production vastly surpasses the EU's. Industry Commissioner Stephane Sejourne emphasized that these measures are vital for the reindustrialization of Europe, enabling the steel industry to invest in decarbonization and regain competitiveness. The proposal, which requires approval from member states and the European Parliament, is designed to replace an expiring safeguard clause and protect the approximately 300,000 direct jobs and 2.3 million indirect jobs at risk.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments concerning a Colorado counselor's challenge to the state's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors, with the counselor arguing the restriction unconstitutionally censors her free speech rights. Kaley Chiles, a Christian counselor, claims the law prevents her from engaging in talk therapy with young patients who wish to reduce unwanted sexual attractions or align with their physical body, while allowing discussions supporting gender transition. Colorado officials, however, contend the law regulates professional conduct to protect minors from practices deemed unsafe and ineffective by major medical associations, which are linked to depression and suicidality. Justices debated whether the therapy should be classified as protected speech or regulated professional conduct, with a decision expected by early July.</p>

          <p>Tesla has released a new version of its full self-driving supervised technology, though investor attention remains primarily focused on a larger, anticipated product announcement teased by Elon Musk for October 7th. Speculation widely points to the reveal of a stripped-down, lower-cost Model Y or significant updates on the long-promised next-generation Roadster. This article notes that Tesla's stock climbed significantly on the pre-announcement buzz, following a multi-quarter slump in auto sales attributed to an aging lineup, increased competition, and consumer backlash against Musk's political rhetoric. The company is actively working to shift investor perception towards its future as a robotics and self-driving car business, seeking new growth drivers.</p>

          <p>September, typically a booming month for shipping ahead of the holiday season, is currently showing strong indications of an emerging freight recession, with the Logistics Managers' Index (LMI) recording its lowest transportation utilization for the month ever. The article highlights that the usual robust growth from holiday merchandise shipments is notably absent, and underlying data points to declining future freight logistics orders alongside significantly rising inventory levels. This oversupply is consequently pushing up warehouse pricing and overall costs for businesses. While transportation prices are still expanding, this article notes it is barely the case, and experts suggest this negative trend needs to persist for at least three consecutive months to definitively confirm a full freight recession.

          <p>The European Union's proposal to double steel tariffs to 50% and significantly reduce duty-free import quotas, a move mirroring Donald Trump's measures, has been widely condemned as an "existential threat" to the UK steel industry. Given that 80% of British steel exports are destined for the EU, this protectionist strategy, primarily aimed at shielding EU producers from cheap Chinese imports, risks diverting millions of tonnes of global steel to the UK market. This potential flood of imports could be terminal for many remaining UK steel companies, according to industry leaders. UK industry bodies and unions are urgently calling on the government to implement its own robust protective measures and immediately negotiate country-specific duty-free quotas with the EU.</p>

          <p>The Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) has announced its intention to formally challenge FIFA's serious allegations of "cheating," following the world governing body's decision to suspend seven players and impose a substantial fine on FAM. FIFA claims Malaysia used forged documents to establish the players' requisite roots in the country, asserting that the grandparents cited as Malaysian were actually born in other nations. FAM vehemently disputes these allegations, stating there is no evidence to support them and that the players consistently acted in good faith, relying on FAM's verification process. This article highlights the unprecedented scope of the case, involving an almost entirely new lineup, and notes the FAM is currently facing significant public and political backlash at home.</p>

          <p>Peter Windsor, 61, of Birmingham, has been found guilty of stalking TV and radio presenter Myleene Klass, after sending her a series of disturbing items that included a gun, handcuffs, and a police uniform. Klass vividly described her "sheer terror" upon being informed of the "highly volatile" accumulation of these items, which also encompassed a will-writing kit and other unsettling correspondence. Windsor, who denied the two counts of stalking causing "serious alarm or distress" and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, also sent numerous "unwanted" gifts and notes to fellow Classic FM presenter Katie Breathwick. This article details the severe emotional distress and violation experienced by the victims due to Windsor's persistent and escalating actions, underscoring the profound impact of stalking.</p>

          <p>David Norris, one of the men convicted of murdering Stephen Lawrence in a racist stabbing in April 1993, has publicly admitted his involvement in the attack for the first time during a public parole hearing. Despite this admission, Norris steadfastly refused to name his accomplices, citing potential risks to himself and his family. Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, vehemently opposes his release, arguing that his lack of full contrition and documented continued use of racist language in prison demonstrate he remains a danger to the public. This article highlights the decades-long struggle for full justice in this landmark case, with Norris's partial admission bringing a complex new dimension to the pursuit of accountability.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has prevented the official release of key jobs reports, but investment giant Carlyle's proprietary data indicates essentially flat employment growth for September, with only 17,000 new jobs. This figure is even lower than August's 22,000 gain, as previously reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The article highlights that Wall Street firms are now actively scrambling to provide alternative economic indicators, with other reports also showing anemic hiring and a loosening labor market. While Carlyle's data suggested weak payroll gains, it also noted brighter spots like a 2.7% annualized GDP growth and a 4.8% acceleration in business investment, offering a mixed economic picture.

          <p>The producers behind the beloved Paddington films and the estate of his creator, Michael Bond, are suing the company behind Spitting Image for copyright and design right concerns. This legal action follows the satirical show's depiction of Paddington Bear as a foul-mouthed podcast host in its YouTube series, "The Rest is Bullsh*t!". In the parody, Paddington is shown swearing, reading advertisements for guns and robot sex dolls, and admitting to cocaine use, adopting a stereotypically strong South American accent. This article highlights the stark contrast between the cherished children's character and the crude satirical portrayal, which also features interviews with Elon Musk and sketches of political figures, raising questions about the legal boundaries of satire and parody.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant debate is unfolding within Germany's CDU/CSU conservative bloc regarding whether regional states (Länder) or the federal government (Bund) should hold primary responsibility for defending critical installations from drone threats. This discussion has gained urgency following two recent drone-related flight suspensions at Munich Airport, underscoring vulnerabilities. While some politicians advocate for greater federal responsibility due to the national security implications of such threats, others contend that individual states are better equipped to handle localized drone incidents. This article highlights that German police forces are typically tasked with drone threats, but the military (Bundeswehr) is constitutionally restricted from shooting down drones domestically unless faced with a full-scale war scenario.</p>

          <p>Jocelyn Bioh's "Jaja's African Hair Braiding" is reviewed as an exuberant workplace comedy that offers a sneakily weighty portrayal of immigrant workers' vulnerable lives. Set in a Harlem hair salon in 2019, the play bursts with gossip, audacious fashion, dazzling hairstyles, and uncensored truths, highlighting the inherent precariousness of life for those seeking prosperity in America. The article praises Whitney White's Tony-nominated direction and the ensemble's vibrant brio, which powerfully emphasizes community as the only reliable answer to impossible times. It notes the play's subtle yet potent political punch, particularly concerning the Trump administration's perceived hostility towards foreign workers, while ultimately prioritizing the humanity and deep love for its diverse and complex characters.</p>

          <p>This article suggests Ukraine is turning the tables on Russia in the ongoing conflict, despite a significant manpower shortage, by effectively leveraging drone technology and evolving combat tactics. Commanders are minimizing casualties through more precise artillery use, careful troop movements, and improved rotation plans, aiming to avoid direct contact. The Atlantic article highlights the "weird intimacy" of drone warfare, where operators can observe and strike targets with chilling precision. While acknowledging the brutality and the hatred fostered by the war, it concludes that Ukraine's institutional reorientation for a long conflict and steady enemy losses, coupled with Western support, may be shifting the balance of time in its favor.</p>

          <p>Gold futures prices have scaled record highs, topping $4,000 per ounce for the first time, with New York spot gold rising to $3,960.60, as investors actively seek safe haven assets amidst the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and pervasive economic uncertainty. The article explains that gold, a non-yielding asset, typically performs robustly during periods of turbulence and low interest-rate environments, having already climbed 52% this year. This significant rally is driven by a confluence of factors, including strong expectations of interest rate cuts, ongoing political turmoil in France and Japan, consistent central bank buying, and a weak dollar. The government shutdown has also postponed the release of key economic indicators, compelling investors to rely on secondary data. (not investment advice)</p>

The stock had initially surged over 5.4% on Monday due to cryptic posts from Elon Musk hinting at the reveal, creating significant market buzz. The article notes this new Model Y aims to offset the loss of federal tax credits by utilizing less premium materials and omitting certain features. This announcement follows a positive third-quarter delivery report but also a preceding period of slumping deliveries earlier in 2025, partly attributed to CEO Elon Musk's political engagements.
