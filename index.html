          <p>The Indian government has approved Apple supplier Foxconn's $433 million joint venture with HCL Group to build a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh, aiming to boost its chip industry. The plant will manufacture display driver chips used in mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, and PCs, with operations expected to begin by 2027. This move aligns with Apple suppliers increasingly shifting to India amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The facility aims to produce up to 20,000 wafers and 36 million display driver chips per month as part of India's "Semiconductor Mission."</p>

          <p>A European Union trade official stated that the EU has no interest in reviving the stalled Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China, citing a steady deterioration in trade ties over the past 15 to 20 years due to increasing barriers for businesses. Despite lobbying efforts by Chinese officials to revise the agreement, the EU's head of trade for its delegation in Beijing emphasized that there are no intentions to resume negotiations. The European Parliament had previously voted to delay ratification of the CAI due to concerns over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>Germany's foreign minister indicated that Berlin supports the U.S.'s call for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. This commitment comes as Germany aims to strengthen its armed forces and take on greater responsibility within NATO and the European Union. While some countries deem the 5% target unrealistic, discussions are ongoing regarding potential compromises, such as increasing classic military spending to 3.5% and investing the remaining 1.5% in defense-related infrastructure. The German Chancellor declared intentions to transform the Bundeswehr into the "strongest conventional army in Europe."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that India has offered to drop all tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. as part of ongoing trade agreement negotiations, though Delhi has not yet commented on these remarks. Trump also mentioned discouraging Apple CEO Tim Cook from expanding production in India, instead urging increased production in the United States. This development occurs amidst existing trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Indian goods, and India's recent efforts to negotiate trade deals with other nations like the UK and the European Free Trade Association. Trump and Modi have previously aimed to more than double trade to $500 billion.</p>

Recent incidents include the arrest of two illegal immigrants for allegedly molesting a minor and a large brawl involving dozens of passengers disembarking from a Carnival Cruise Line ship, resulting in multiple passengers being placed on a "do not sail list."</p>

          <p>Three Maori MPs in New Zealand face suspension from parliament for performing a protest haka during a parliamentary session last year. The parliamentary committee ruled that the haka, a traditional Maori dance, could have intimidated other lawmakers. The Maori Party has criticized the recommendations as a warning to fall in line, while the Deputy Prime Minister has condemned the MPs' actions. The proposed suspensions will be put to a vote.</p>
