          <p>Phil Robertson, the founder of Duck Commander and star of "Duck Dynasty," has died at the age of 79. Robertson, a former football player, created the duck-call business that led to his family's reality TV fame. He was briefly suspended from the show in 2013 for controversial statements, but was later reinstated due to fan pressure. Robertson's family acknowledged his impact on many lives through his faith and desire to spread the Good News of Jesus, expressing gratitude for his life and legacy.</p>

          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old provision in U.S. customs law. This rule allows importers to calculate duties based on the initial sale price between a manufacturer and a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving an overseas producer and intermediary, carried out independently with proof the item is destined for the U.S., along with documentation of the first sale price. While it requires trust between parties and additional complexities, the potential cost savings make it a worthwhile strategy, especially for higher-value consumer goods (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world's first ship dedicated to salmon farming in June, marking a significant step in the country's efforts to reduce reliance on imported seafood. The Su Hai No 1 vessel, costing $83.6 million, is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional systems, this vessel can relocate to avoid adverse conditions and features an onboard processing facility, ensuring fresh salmon delivery to domestic markets within 24 hours. This initiative aligns with China's focus on developing the ocean economy and strengthening food security amid global challenges.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's electoral council, loyal to Nicolás Maduro, claimed his party secured an overwhelming victory in regional and legislative elections. The results, presented without evidence on state television, stripped the opposition of key positions. Despite sparsely populated polling places, the council asserted turnout exceeded 40 percent, though independent observers were absent. This announcement follows a presidential election where Maduro also claimed victory despite evidence suggesting he lost to Edmundo González, according to the Carter Center. The vice president of the electoral body stated that Maduro's alliance won over 80 percent of legislative seats and governors' seats in 22 of 23 states.</p>

          <p>The tone of leaders in the UK and EU has shifted regarding the Gaza conflict, now describing Israel's actions as "morally unjustifiable" and "wholly disportionate." However, there is a disconnect between this condemnation and tangible action on the ground. International organizations and courts struggle to translate findings into action, rendering them powerless against Israel's impunity. While the shift in language is notable, Israel appears to draw strength from the condemnation, reinforcing a sense of isolation and the need to persevere. The world witnesses daily violations of morality and logic, yet effective measures remain absent.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep allows the brain to clear harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, reveals that hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H₂O₂ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," promoting restorative slumber. This breakthrough offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, potentially opening avenues for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

          <p>Wild chickens have become ubiquitous in Miami, establishing themselves in residential areas and even the downtown core. While some consider their crowing a nuisance, many residents have embraced them as an unofficial city mascot. The chickens have a cultural connection to people from rural Cuba and Latin America, where they were commonly kept in backyards. In Little Havana, rooster statues symbolize the area's culture, and locals often welcome the birds into their yards. However, development and gentrification pose a potential threat to their continued presence.</p>

          <p>As South Korea prepares for elections, many women feel their priorities are being overlooked. Despite their involvement in movements to impeach former President Yoon Suk Yeol, issues such as gender-based discrimination and online sexual abuse are taking a back seat. With the economy struggling, young men feel victimized by reverse discrimination, making feminist agendas politically sensitive. Candidates are hesitant to address women's issues for fear of alienating male voters, leaving many women feeling that nothing will change regardless of who wins.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to lower soaring prices, aiming for a retail price of around 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the auction system and seeks to address public criticism over ineffective price control amidst rising inflation. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers. The decision follows the appointment of a new farm minister after his predecessor's resignation. The average supermarket rice price reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May.</p>

The company categorizes fake submissions as boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews.

Such a collapse could disrupt essential services, destroy the Taiwanese independence forces’ will to resist, and create favorable conditions for a "win without fighting."
