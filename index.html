        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge of over 17% during their Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting the ongoing electric vehicle boom. The IPO successfully raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), earmarked primarily for constructing a new factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients, including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing challenges such as punitive tariffs imposed by the U.S. and EU on Chinese EVs, CATL's global expansion continues, driven by robust demand for electric vehicles in China and beyond. The company's financial performance showed resilience, with a 15% increase in net profit despite a slight drop in annual revenue, underscoring its pivotal role in the EV industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center, while simultaneously dropping a trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka. The charges stem from an incident on May 9 when McIver, along with other lawmakers, visited the detention center to conduct an oversight visit, leading to a confrontation with ICE agents. McIver has denied the charges, claiming they are politically motivated and mischaracterize her actions, while U.S. Attorney Alina Habba asserted that no one is above the law. This decision follows protests and controversy surrounding the opening of the detention center, which is expected to significantly expand federal detention capacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hawaii's coral reefs are experiencing severe bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures, threatening marine life and coastal protection. Marine scientist Greg Asner reports that 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, causing them to lose their vibrant colors as algae are expelled from the corals. The warming waters, with average ocean surface temperatures hitting 70 degrees, are accelerating coral deaths, with reefs now dying in weeks instead of years. While efforts are underway to educate tourists about reef-safe sunscreens and implement underwater nurseries, controlling fossil fuels is crucial for the long-term recovery of these vital ecosystems. The decline is most severe in the Caribbean and Florida, highlighting the urgent need for global action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Texas Legislature is considering a bill that would ban minors from accessing popular social media apps and websites, seeking to address the addictive and harmful nature of these platforms. House Bill 186, championed by Republican state Rep. Jared Patterson, has passed the Texas House and is now under consideration in the Senate. The bill would require parental consent for minors to download applications and would place warning labels about the dangers of social media, with the goal of protecting children from the algorithms designed to harvest data and foster addiction. While not the first state to consider such restrictions, Texas's proposed law would be the strictest in the nation, potentially setting a new precedent for online child safety measures.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, implementing a 10-basis-point cut to both the 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates in an effort to stimulate economic growth. This decision comes as trade tensions and persistent deflationary pressures threaten to undermine China's economic stability. The rate cuts are part of a broader package of stimulus measures, including reductions to deposit rates and the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves. Despite trade war fears receding after recent negotiations with the U.S., concerns remain about prolonged housing slump and the potential for renewed tariff escalations.</p>

Interest in trade schools has nearly doubled since 2017, while university enrollment has seen a slight decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, as students recognize the value of hands-on skills and direct entry into the workforce.

The jail has been under a federal consent decree since 2013 due to overcrowding and understaffing, with officials citing defective locks and non-functional cameras.

          <p>The Latino Legislative Caucus has voiced strong opposition to Governor Gavin Newsom's proposed budget cuts to Medi-Cal, including freezing enrollment and charging premiums for adult undocumented immigrants already enrolled. State Senator María Elena Durazo criticized the plan as a form of redlining, while Assemblymember Mia Bonta questioned its constitutionality. The caucus argues that the cuts scapegoat immigrants for California's economic woes, despite their essential role in the state's robust economy. Newsom has encouraged lawmakers to offer alternative budget balancing proposals if they disagree with his approach.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants while legal proceedings continue. This decision lifts a lower court's injunction that had blocked the termination of TPS, potentially leading to the loss of work permits and deportation protections for Venezuelans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, expressing her intention to deny the administration's request for emergency relief. The Trump administration argues that continuing the program is "contrary to the national interest," while TPS beneficiaries contend that ending it would cause significant harm.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested, without providing evidence, that former President Joe Biden delayed sharing his cancer diagnosis, insinuating a cover-up of Biden's health decline. Trump questioned why the public wasn't notified earlier, conflating the Gleason score with the stage of Biden's cancer. He also questioned the absence of cognitive tests in Biden's physical exam, echoing previous concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities. Trump's remarks deviate from his initial expression of sympathy, aligning with unverified conspiracies about Biden's health and ability to lead.</p>

The bill makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish intimate images without consent and requires websites and social media companies to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim's request. First Lady Melania Trump, who advocated for the bill, emphasized its importance in protecting children from online exploitation. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some free speech advocates and digital rights groups express concerns about its potential for censorship and undermining due process.</p>

          <p>The Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, is under scrutiny for using antisemitic tropes in a fundraising pitch for Project Esther, a campaign aimed at dismantling the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States.

Project Esther, largely conceived by Christian Zionists, has a distorted definition of antisemitism, often tagging Jews as perpetrators.

Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky used the Moody's rating change to reinforce his position, stating that the bill would only serve to make “bond buyers realize we aren’t fiscally responsible.” The Republican plan would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>
