          <p>Samsung Electronics has forecasted a significant 56% decrease in its second-quarter operating profit, falling short of analyst expectations. The South Korean tech giant is facing challenges in the competitive artificial intelligence sector, particularly in supplying high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to market leader Nvidia. Competitors like SK Hynix have established stronger positions, and Samsung's efforts to get its latest HBM chips certified by Nvidia have reportedly faced delays. These factors, combined with a struggling foundry business, contribute to the disappointing financial outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House, celebrating recent joint military strikes against Iran while facing pressure to resolve the ongoing war in Gaza. While both leaders projected unity, the discussions were underscored by the urgent need for a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. The U.S. is pushing for a 60-day pause in fighting, but a permanent end to the conflict remains a major hurdle. The meeting also touched on broader regional goals, including expanding the Abraham Accords, with potential peace deals being a key objective for Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against individuals who participated in the city's prohibited Pride parade in late June. The decision comes despite the government's ban and threats of fines or even prison time for organizers, including Budapest's mayor. Police cited public uncertainty over the event's legality, which was fueled by the mayor declaring it an official municipal event. This development occurred despite Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government enacting anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, and the parade itself drew a record-breaking crowd of over 200,000 people.</p>

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales has warned that an overwhelming influx of smuggled drugs is severely destabilizing the prison system. Criminal gangs are reportedly using drones and other methods to supply contraband to inmates, fueling criminality within the jails. The report links this issue to overcrowding and staffing shortages, which leave prisoners with little purposeful activity and contribute to drug use.

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed a United Nations working group that the United States holds legal responsibility for over 200 migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This assertion contradicts the Trump administration's position that it cannot retrieve the migrants because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants were deported under the Alien Enemies Act, with the U.S. paying El Salvador to house them. El Salvador's report clarifies its role was merely to provide prison infrastructure for individuals detained under the U.S. justice system, escalating the dispute over the migrants' legal status and fate.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Newsom Calls for Federal Wildfire Aid While Condemning LA Immigration Raids</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months after major wildfires, California Governor Gavin Newsom is renewing his call for $40 billion in federal recovery aid while simultaneously criticizing the Trump administration. Speaking at an event, Newsom condemned the recent large-scale immigration raid in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park as a "disgrace" and proof of the president's "polluted heart." This places him in the difficult position of seeking bipartisan support for disaster funding from a Republican-controlled House while sharply attacking the administration's policies. He expressed confidence that aid would eventually be approved for California, as well as for Texas following its recent floods.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment to the UK's Football Governance Bill that would require at least 10 Premier League games to be broadcast on free-to-air television each season. The proposal aims to tear down the "expensive paywall" for fans and would also apply to the League Cup Final and major EFL playoff finals. Citing high subscription costs, the party is advocating for a model similar to Spain's La Liga, which mandates one free game per week. The government has stated it has no plans to review the current system, setting up a potential parliamentary vote on the issue.</p>

          <p>The small Australian town of Korumburra is struggling to find closure following the globally publicized trial of Erin Patterson, who was found guilty of murdering three of her former in-laws with toxic mushrooms. The victims were deeply embedded in the tight-knit community, and locals are now weary of the intense media attention that turned their tragedy into "pop culture." The article describes a subdued mood in the region, where residents feel the case has overshadowed the memory of the victims. The community hopes the verdict will allow them to grieve and be known for their strength rather than the crime.</p>

          <p>World number one Jannik Sinner reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals after his opponent, Grigor Dimitrov, was forced to retire from their match due to an injury. Dimitrov, who was leading by two sets, collapsed in pain, clutching his right pectoral muscle, and could not continue. A visibly concerned Sinner expressed that he could not accept the outcome as a win, instead focusing on the well-being of his friend, who has been plagued by injuries at recent Grand Slams. The emotional conclusion was a heartbreaking moment for Dimitrov and a somber advancement for Sinner, who will play Ben Shelton next.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. The new legislation, an amendment to the Employment Rights Bill, will render such confidentiality clauses void. This move aims to stamp out the practice of using NDAs to cover up inappropriate or criminal behavior, a tactic highlighted in high-profile cases like that of Harvey Weinstein. Campaigners have hailed the change as a "huge milestone" in preventing the abuse of power and ensuring victims can speak out.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Mexico City to voice their anger over rising rents and gentrification, which they attribute to an influx of foreigners, particularly American remote workers. The demonstration, held on U.S. Independence Day, included signs like "gringo go home" and saw some participants vandalize storefronts. The issue has been fueled by the transformation of neighborhoods, with local businesses being replaced by establishments catering to expatriates, pricing some locals out of their homes. While Mexican leaders condemned the xenophobic tone, they acknowledged that gentrification is a legitimate problem that needs to be addressed.</p>
