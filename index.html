          <p>A man previously pardoned for his role in the Capitol riot has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Court documents state Christopher Moynihan sent text messages detailing his plan to "eliminate" Jeffries at a New York City event. This incident highlights concerns about recidivism among pardoned rioters and contributes to a rising number of threats against members of Congress. Moynihan faces a felony charge for making a terroristic threat.</p>

          <p>A new documentary titled "Khartoum" aims to highlight the human stories behind Sudan's devastating civil war, which has displaced over 12 million people and created a severe humanitarian crisis. The film follows five residents of the capital, chronicling their lives before and after the conflict erupted in April 2023. Initially a cinematic poem to the city, the production shifted to document the war's brutal impact, using creative techniques to portray the protagonists' escapes and hopes. The film serves as a call for global awareness and action amid what experts call an "actively ignored" war.</p>

The move anticipates strong long-term demand for the company's optical communication products, which are essential for modern data centers. Analysts project significant revenue growth for Corning's optical segment, driven by AI systems requiring substantially more fiber content than legacy technologies. The investment reflects confidence in multi-trillion dollar AI infrastructure spending expected by the end of the decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a new critical minerals agreement between the U.S. and Australia, China has stated that resource-rich countries should actively work to stabilize global supply chains. The U.S.-Australia deal is widely seen as an effort to counter Beijing's dominance in the rare earths market, a sector vital for numerous high-tech products. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson emphasized that global supply chains are a result of market forces and called for normal economic cooperation. This diplomatic exchange occurs as China recently tightened its own export controls on these strategic minerals.</p>

          <p>A new round of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported goods like timber, kitchen cabinets, and furniture is expected to create further hurdles for the U.S. housing market. Homebuilders and buyers are already grappling with rising costs, and these new levies are likely to exacerbate affordability issues and slow new construction. Economists warn that these tariffs add to previous increases on materials like steel and copper, with the costs ultimately being passed on to consumers. The measures could intensify the strain on a housing sector already described as being in a weak position.</p>

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first former French president to be incarcerated, beginning a five-year sentence for conspiring to illegally finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The 70-year-old, who maintains his innocence, will serve his time in the isolation wing of Paris's La Santé prison. The conviction marks a dramatic downfall for the former leader, who has been pursued by multiple criminal inquiries since leaving office in 2012. The event is a historic moment in French politics, as no ex-leader has been jailed since the World War Two era.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola exceeded analyst expectations for third-quarter earnings and revenue, though the company acknowledged that consumer demand for its beverages remains soft. The beverage giant's unit case volume saw a slight 1% increase, but key markets in North and Latin America reported flat volume. This suggests that while pricing strategies are boosting financial results, lower-income consumers may still be purchasing fewer products. The company maintained its full-year forecast, with growth primarily driven by its water, sports, coffee, and tea segments rather than its flagship sparkling soft drinks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The posthumous publication of Virginia Giuffre's memoir, "Nobody's Girl," is placing renewed pressure on Britain's Prince Andrew regarding his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The book details three alleged sexual encounters with the prince when Giuffre was a teenager, accusations Andrew has consistently denied but settled in a 2022 lawsuit. The memoir's launch coincides with a parliamentary motion calling for Andrew to be formally stripped of the titles he has already pledged to relinquish. Giuffre, who took her own life in April, wrote that she had hoped for a meaningful apology from the prince.</p>

          <p>The rapid construction of power-hungry data centers, driven by the AI boom, is a growing factor behind rising electricity bills for households across the U.S. These facilities consume massive amounts of energy, and the rush by tech companies to secure power for both existing and future centers is straining electrical grids. In Maryland, a consumer advocate has asked the regional grid operator to intervene, arguing that speculation for future energy demand is unfairly increasing current costs for ratepayers. The issue highlights a conflict between the tech industry's rapid expansion and the affordability of essential utilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that black garden ants actively redesign their nests to reduce the transmission of deadly pathogens, a behavior termed "architectural immunity." When exposed to a lethal fungus, the ants build more compartmentalized nests with fewer interconnections and more widely spaced entrances. These structural changes complement their known social distancing behaviors, such as self-isolation by infected individuals, to protect the colony's most valuable members. Scientists suggest these findings offer insights into how physical environments can be designed to slow disease spread, providing a potential model for human public spaces.</p>

The women expressed concern that the inquiry was becoming a "cover-up" and criticized the shortlisting of former police and social services professionals to chair it. They alleged that officials were attempting to dilute the inquiry's focus on grooming gangs, which they felt erased the specific motivations behind their abuse.

This involvement means that the evidence used to justify these lethal strikes will likely remain classified, raising concerns about transparency and the legal basis for targeting civilians on the high seas.

          <p>A growing number of U.S. federal judges, including those appointed by Republicans, are issuing strong rebukes to the Trump administration's policies on crime and immigration. Rulings have frequently rejected the administration's sweeping claims of emergency, with judges describing government arguments as "unreliable" or "untethered to the facts." This judicial pushback has slowed some of the administration's more radical actions, such as the deployment of the National Guard to cities like Portland and Chicago. Legal scholars note this pattern reflects a deep skepticism in the courts regarding the administration's credibility and expansive interpretation of executive power.</p>

The pause in fighting brings a return to thinking and grieving, which was impossible during the constant struggle for survival. The author notes that with the destruction of homes, schools, and infrastructure, there is no "normal" life to return to, only a future suspended in uncertainty. The essay conveys that for Palestinians, a ceasefire is another kind of war—a war of memory, loss, and the daunting task of rebuilding.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intervention to secure a Gaza ceasefire has unexpectedly positioned him against the ambitions of Israel's far-right, who had hoped he would facilitate their goal of resettling the territory. The peace plan explicitly rejects any Israeli territorial claims on Gaza, frustrating influential figures in Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition who advocate for settlement expansion. This follows Trump's earlier declaration that he would not permit Israel to annex the West Bank. While the U.S. president's actions have temporarily curbed the settler movement's influence, the fragility of the ceasefire could provide them with new opportunities.</p>
