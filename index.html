          <p>A 65-year-old British man from Essex, Howard Phillips, has been found guilty of attempting to provide intelligence to Russia under the National Security Act. Phillips, who fantasized about being a spy, offered to pass personal information about former UK defense secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he believed were Russian agents. These 'agents' were actually undercover British intelligence officers. Phillips was arrested after a series of meetings and a USB drop, and he now faces sentencing for his actions.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market with high interest rates, this article provides an overview of average mortgage and refinance rates as of July 2025. For new mortgages, the average 30-year rate is 6.75%, while the 15-year rate is 5.95%. The report suggests that while rates are higher than in previous years, securing a good rate is still possible, especially for those with strong credit profiles. It advises shopping around and notes that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief to borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Laura Anne Jones, a Member of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), has left the Conservative Party to join Nigel Farage's Reform UK, becoming the party's first representative in the Senedd. Jones stated the Conservative Party had become 'unrecognisable' and that she could no longer support its policies. The move has been met with anger by Welsh Conservatives, who claim voters will feel let down. This defection follows that of another former Conservative figure and comes amid ongoing investigations into Jones's conduct, which she expects to be cleared of.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston is reviewing arguments in a lawsuit filed by Harvard University against the Trump administration for freezing federal research grants. The administration initially cited antisemitism on campus but now argues it has the right to cancel grants if an institution's priorities do not align with its own. Harvard claims the move is illegal and politically motivated, with the funding freeze impacting approximately 900 research studies, including those related to national security and cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is set to expand its detention capacity by using military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to hold immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. without legal status. This move, approved by the Defense Secretary, comes as the Trump administration intensifies efforts to arrest and detain more individuals, with current detention facilities already over capacity. The use of military resources for this purpose was enabled by a national emergency declaration and is approved through the end of September.</p>

          <p>The South Carolina Shrimpers Association has filed a federal lawsuit against 25 Charleston-area restaurants, accusing them of 'shrimp fraud.' The lawsuit alleges that these establishments violated trade practice laws by deceptively marketing imported, frozen shrimp as 'local' and 'wild-caught.' According to the shrimpers, this practice misleads consumers and damages the reputation and livelihood of legitimate local fishers. The legal action aims to protect the integrity of the state's seafood brand and ensure transparency in advertising for both residents and tourists.</p>

          <p>The projected cost of building the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk has surged to £38 billion, a significant increase from the previous £20 billion estimate. This revised figure, which now accounts for inflation and risk, will add approximately £1 per month to household energy bills for over a decade during construction. The UK government confirmed it is taking a 44.9% stake in the project alongside private investors like Centrica and EDF. Critics have condemned the massive cost overrun, warning that taxpayers will ultimately bear the financial risk. (not investment advice)</p>

The publisher cited a lack of internal alignment and an inadequate review process, but authors and editors believe the decision is a form of censorship driven by the politically charged climate surrounding Palestinian scholarship.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor has unveiled a proposal to rewrite or repeal over 60 workplace regulations, aiming to reduce what it calls 'obsolete' and burdensome rules. The changes would affect a wide range of protections, including minimum wage requirements for home health care workers, safety standards for construction sites and mines, and rules governing exposure to harmful substances. While the administration claims the move will stimulate growth, critics and union leaders argue the deregulation would severely weaken worker protections and put employees at greater risk of harm.</p>

          <p>A century-old dam system in Ohio highlights a nationwide problem of aging flood-prevention infrastructure at a time of increasing climate risk and decreasing federal investment. The Huffman dam, which protects Dayton, is part of a system that has seen a 228% increase in the volume of water it must store, and it requires $140 million in repairs. This issue is echoed across the Midwest, where thousands of dams are in poor condition.

          <p>China has unveiled its next-generation high-speed rail technology, which has successfully surpassed the previous operational speed barrier of 350 km/h (217 mph). Researchers achieved this breakthrough by developing a new train design that significantly reduces aerodynamic resistance and energy consumption. By optimizing the train's head shape and adding a novel cover structure to the undercarriage, scientists were able to reduce drag by over 20%. This innovation allows for higher speeds without a corresponding increase in energy use, marking a significant advancement in rail transport.</p>

The author argues that heat is a major killer, and creating more shade through trees and artificial structures is a vital, low-tech solution for making cities more livable and protecting vulnerable populations. The article calls for a shift in urban planning to intentionally design for shade, framing it as a basic human right and a necessary adaptation for life on a hotter planet.</p>

Recent events, including Israeli military actions in Gaza, the West Bank, and now Syria, have created clear policy disagreements with the U.S. The Trump administration, focused on normalizing relations with Syria's new government, views Israel's recent airstrikes there as undermining its diplomatic efforts. This growing friction suggests a return to a pattern of mismatched regional strategies between the two allies.</p>
