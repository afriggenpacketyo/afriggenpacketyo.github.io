          <p>In a 4-4 deadlock, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court's decision, preventing Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, resulting in the split decision. The proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, intended to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum, faced opposition from public school advocates who feared disruptions to education systems nationwide. This ruling leaves the broader issue of state-sponsored religious charter schools unresolved at the federal level, paving the way for future legal challenges. </p>

          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump's tax bill, a major victory for Republicans despite unanimous Democratic opposition and some Republican dissent. The bill includes amendments designed to appease various factions within the GOP, such as accelerated Medicaid work requirements and increased state and local tax deductions. However, investors on Wall Street showed concern, with major indexes falling due to worries about exploding federal deficits and weaker long-term fiscal health. The bill now faces a complex path through the Senate, where significant changes are expected before a vote. </p>

The new regulations clarify producer obligations and reporting timelines but include broad exemptions for single-use plastics under FDA and USDA jurisdiction. Critics argue that these exemptions and the potential use of chemical recycling undermine the law's original purpose of reducing plastic waste. The revisions have sparked controversy, with environmental groups and the bill's author expressing concerns that the changes favor industry interests over environmental protection. </p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), increasing the cap to $40,000 for taxpayers reporting less than $500,000 in income. The provision, if enacted, would go into effect in 2025, with the SALT cap and income phaseout increasing annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal could still face pushback in the Senate. </p>
