          <p>The military regime in Burkina Faso announced it thwarted a coup attempt allegedly planned by individuals in Ivory Coast, aiming to sow chaos and assault the presidency. Interim President Ibrahim Traore, who himself rose to power through a 2022 coup, has frequently accused Ivory Coast of harboring his opponents. Security Minister Mahamadou Sana stated the plot involved recruiting soldiers to attack the presidency on April 16, implicating former army officers Major Joanny Compaore and Lieutenant Abdramane Barry. Since Traore's rise, the junta has suppressed dissent, leading to arrests and accusations of undermining republican institutions, amidst ongoing jihadi violence in the region. Optimism score: 35</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Commerce Department plans to impose tariffs up to 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam following an investigation into alleged subsidies from China and the dumping of cheap products. These tariffs, varying by company and country, are a response to requests from major solar equipment producers to protect their US operations. Some companies in Cambodia face the highest duties due to perceived lack of cooperation, while others in Malaysia face lower rates. The International Trade Commission will make a final decision in June. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office will publish data on the nationalities of foreign criminals, including the crimes committed, by the end of the year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper ordered officials to overhaul their systems to make this possible, responding to pressure to disclose the figures. There were over 19,000 foreign offenders awaiting deportation at the end of last year, a rise attributed to early releases, instability in some countries, and appeals against deportation. The most common nationalities among foreign criminals living in the community are expected to be Albanians, Romanians, and Poles, with drug production, theft, and violent assault as their most frequent offenses.

          <p>The Atlanta City Council approved a $1.4 million settlement with Oliver Simmonds, a former Atlanta police officer acquitted in the 2019 fatal shooting of 18-year-old D'Ettrick Griffin.

A jury found Simmonds not guilty of felony murder and other charges in September 2023, leading to the settlement.

          <p>This article analyzes Max Verstappen's driving style and a recent five-second penalty he received at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix for gaining an advantage by leaving the track. Stewards determined Verstappen did not give Oscar Piastri enough room, violating driving standards guidelines. While Verstappen chose not to comment, his team principal deemed the penalty harsh, but new guidelines, influenced by Verstappen's aggressive racing, led to the decision. The article suggests Verstappen may adapt his approach, and Piastri has established himself as a decisive competitor. Optimism score: 75</p>
