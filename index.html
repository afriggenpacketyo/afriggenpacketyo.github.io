            <p>The British government has taken control of the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe to prevent its closure. Emergency legislation was passed to maintain steel production and protect jobs, as the owners were selling off raw materials. The government is seeking a buyer and will not sell to another Chinese company, but the takeover's cost to taxpayers remains uncertain. The plant is the UK's last capable of producing virgin steel, vital for major construction projects.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly exploring the possibility of deporting American citizens, raising concerns about due process and the rule of law. This consideration follows the administration's existing policies of deporting immigrants with limited due process, targeting them for protected speech, and detaining them in foreign prisons. Critics argue that these actions undermine constitutional rights and establish dangerous precedents. The Supreme Court's involvement in pausing lower court orders has further enabled the administration's deportation agenda.</p>

            <p>Vietnam, which initially benefited from the US-China trade war, now faces new challenges with President Trump's tariffs. While some companies are hesitant to invest, Vietnam is exploring measures to offset the impact, such as lowering corporate tax rates. The country's manufacturing sector, a key driver of economic growth, is at risk, but Vietnam remains conciliatory and adaptable. The government is also supporting projects like a Trump Organization golf resort and Starlink, showing its commitment to economic growth and foreign investment.</p>

            <p>The author explores which character from Homer's "Iliad" best represents Donald Trump, considering Menelaus, Achilles, and Agamemnon. While Achilles shares Trump's petulance and vengefulness, the author ultimately argues that Agamemnon is the closest parallel. Agamemnon, a brute who relies on intimidation and self-interest, leads his countrymen on a grievance-fueled crusade. The author draws parallels between Agamemnon's leadership and Trump's impact, suggesting both cause unnecessary pain and hardship.</p>

            <p>Cheap clothes from China may face price increases due to President Trump's tariff policies, potentially disrupting the fast fashion industry. The end of the "de-minimis" rule, which exempted low-priced goods from duties, is expected to impact retailers like Shein and Temu. While some companies may diversify production, others are considering stocking more inventory in the US. The changes could prompt consumers to explore alternatives like secondhand clothing, but some experts believe the love for cheap goods will persist. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>California farmers are bracing for economic consequences as President Trump's tariffs disrupt global trade. While a temporary pause has eased immediate concerns, tariffs on key markets like China and Canada are causing anxiety. Farmers fear retaliatory measures and long-term damage to export markets. They are also concerned about rising costs for imported equipment and supplies, with some already experiencing financial strain. The situation is prompting calls for government support and negotiations for better trade agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A retrial of Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is set to begin, stemming from a 2017 editorial that allegedly linked her to a 2011 shooting. Palin's initial loss in 2022 was overturned due to a judge's misstep, granting her a rare second chance. The case, watched closely by conservative allies hoping to weaken press protections, faces legal challenges and a shifted media landscape. The retrial raises questions about the bounds of the First Amendment and Palin's potential gains.</p>

Lee critiques the transactional nature of modern politics and expresses concern over the rise of bullies in comedy and politics. He also laments the shift in his own comedic perspective due to current events.</p>

            <p>The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration, raises concerns about its potential impact on married women. With millions of women changing their last names upon marriage, their birth certificates may no longer match their current identities. Legal experts suggest that states accepting secondary documents like marriage certificates could ease this hurdle, but varying policies across states and administrative burdens may still disenfranchise voters. The bill's passage could affect close elections by reducing potential voters.</p>
