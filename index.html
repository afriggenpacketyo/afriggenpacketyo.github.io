          <p>Chinese scientists working on a full-scale test line have reportedly discovered a solution to reduce turbulence in Hyperloop systems, potentially mitigating the 'extremely unpleasant' ride quality identified in Elon Musk's Hyperloop concept. The study, published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, highlights that minor track imperfections and electromagnetic resonance can cause violent low-frequency vibrations at high speeds. However, the research team, led by Zhao Ming, claims to have found a method to decrease turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving ride comfort using supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests. The findings could significantly advance the development of vacuum-tube maglev technology and improve passenger experience.</p>

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth test flight of the Starship mega-rocket, achieving orbit but ultimately experiencing a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly' during reentry due to a propellant leak and loss of attitude control. The Super Heavy booster also suffered a catastrophic failure upon attempted splashdown. Despite these setbacks, the mission marked the first reuse of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage and demonstrated improvements in ascent performance. The company plans to accelerate the launch cadence for future flights, incorporating data from this test to enhance Starship's reliability for future missions to the moon and Mars.</p>

The 24-year-old is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki in 2017. Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament and is the only wrestler to reach yokozuna without a single losing record.

Kennedy cited a lack of data supporting additional shots for healthy children, while federal health officials did not explain the change regarding pregnant women. Public health experts have expressed concerns, emphasizing the risk of severe disease and hospitalization among infants and the vulnerability of pregnant women to COVID-19 complications.</p>

          <p>A cancelled project to widen part of the A1 in Northumberland has left families displaced and their former homes in disrepair after the government spent millions purchasing properties in the path of the planned route. The project was cancelled after a change in government, leaving families who had already sold their homes and moved facing financial losses and emotional distress. The properties, now owned by National Highways, remain empty and are deteriorating, prompting criticism of the wasted expenditure and the lack of a strategy for their future use.

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to cut an estimated $100 million in federal funding to Harvard University, citing concerns about discrimination and antisemitism. The Government Services Administration (GSA) plans to send a letter to federal agencies requesting a review of Harvard's grants to determine if contracts can be terminated or redirected. The administration claims Harvard has failed to meet standards regarding discrimination and antisemitism, prompting criticism from students and faculty.

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley is warning that the government's anti-crime pledges will not be achievable without significant additional funding for policing. In an article for the Times, Sir Mark and other chief constables highlight a decade of underinvestment, increased demand, and social volatility as major challenges. They argue that without adequate financial support, there will be no restoration of neighborhood policing or reduction in knife crime and violence against women and girls, jeopardizing government promises. The Home Office maintains it is backing the police with substantial funding, but the police chiefs insist more is needed to address structural inefficiencies and reform the service.</p>

          <p>The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) is changing its competition rules for the state track and field championships to allow more girls to participate, following controversy over a trans student-athlete's participation. The CIF will extend access to more 'biological female' athletes for the championship meet. The change comes after Donald Trump threatened to pull federal funding from California if it did not bar trans students from girls' sports. The new pilot entry process aims to achieve participation opportunities while navigating a complex issue.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space but lost control during its ninth test flight. A propellant leak caused the spacecraft to spin, resulting in a breakup during reentry.

Despite the loss, the flight demonstrated improvements in ascent and reuse of a booster, indicating ongoing progress in the development of a fully reusable spacecraft for missions to Mars.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a steep drop in mothers’ mental health in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The research, involving nearly 200,000 mothers, found that the percentage rating their mental health as 'excellent' decreased, while the percentage reporting poor mental health increased, particularly among single parents and those with children on Medicaid. Factors contributing to this decline may include high housing and child care costs, food prices, lack of paid parental leave, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts emphasize the need for increased access to mental health care and support for mothers.</p>
