          <p>Christopher Walrath, a corrections officer, admitted guilt to first-degree manslaughter for his role in the beating death of Robert Brooks at Marcy Correctional Facility. Walrath acknowledged leaving his post to participate in the assault, which included striking Brooks in the groin and applying a prohibited chokehold. The attack, captured on body camera footage, occurred shortly after Brooks' arrival at the prison and was described by the district attorney as a violent "welcome to Marcy". Walrath will face a 15-year prison sentence, with other prison employees also reaching plea deals in connection to the case, and Brooks' family has filed a civil rights lawsuit alleging excessive force and a system that tolerates violence.</p>

          <p>Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu has resigned, and his Social Democrat party is withdrawing from the government after George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate, won the first round of the presidential election.

Ciolacu stated that the coalition had failed to meet its objectives and lacked legitimacy. The resignation triggers up to 45 days of political instability as Romania seeks a new government, a situation described as a dangerous power vacuum.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house America's most violent offenders, citing a need to isolate dangerous criminals. He directed the Bureau of Prisons, Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security to implement the plan, framing it as a symbol of law, order, and justice. The announcement follows Trump's clashes with courts over deporting accused gang members and his frustration with due process requirements. Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, is currently a popular tourist site managed by the National Park Service.</p>

Concerns are rising that if Martin is not confirmed, judges on a court led by a Trump-antagonist could select a temporary replacement. The attorneys general argue that crime has spiraled in the nation's capital under the Biden administration, and Martin has already shown leadership in restoring the rule of law during his interim period. They cite Martin's actions against pro-Hamas protestors and Chinese-backed hackers as evidence of his effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration's decision to suspend leasing and permitting of new wind energy projects. The states argue that the move threatens the wind industry and a key source of clean energy. The lawsuit claims that the indefinite pause on federal wind-energy approvals is unlawful and must be blocked. Trump announced the pause on his first day back in office, directing his administration to halt offshore wind lease sales and stop issuing permits for both onshore and offshore projects.</p>

The editorial claims that Trump's tariffs are engineered to hike prices, kill off "uncompetitive" firms, and clear the way for a leaner economy, ultimately harming workers. The piece contends that this is class politics disguised as economic nationalism, a controlled demolition of what remains of US labor's bargaining power, sold as a populist renaissance.
