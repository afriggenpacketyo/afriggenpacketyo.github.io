          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, has reportedly agreed to plead guilty to all charges. This plea deal would spare him the death penalty, resulting instead in four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The agreement comes shortly before his trial was scheduled to begin in August, concluding a case that garnered national attention and sparked a lengthy manhunt. A court hearing to formalize the plea is expected to take place soon.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer production from China to a new plant in Kentucky, a decision accelerated by U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The company states the move will create 800 new American jobs in fields like engineering and advanced manufacturing, with the new facility expected to be operational by early 2027. While the company cites its "zero distance" philosophy of building products where they are sold as the primary driver, it acknowledges that the tariff environment made the decision more urgent and financially sensible.</p>

This decision provides legal certainty for same-sex couples and is seen by activists as a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights that could influence similar legal battles in other British territories.

Analysts believe it could enhance U.S. strategic capabilities, particularly in potential conflicts like one over the Taiwan Strait.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including pre-ordering large amounts of inventory before tariffs took effect. Companies have also absorbed some costs and utilized trade loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay or reduce duty payments. However, experts caution that this buffering effect may be temporary and that price increases could still materialize later in the year if tariffs remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stanford University is cutting $140 million from its budget for the upcoming academic year, a move the administration attributes to "consequences from federal policy changes." These changes include reductions in federal research funding and the potential for a significant new tax on the university's endowment, as proposed in recent legislation. The cuts are expected to result in staff layoffs and a slowdown in faculty hiring, though the university will increase its endowment payout to protect financial aid and doctoral funding. This reflects the growing financial pressures on higher education institutions due to shifts in federal policy.</p>

The piece argues this rhetoric is not a considered strategic position but rather a lazy and nihilistic way to avoid the responsibilities of global leadership. This approach, the author contends, is poisonous to democracy by painting a narrative of despair and moral vacuousness.</p>

          <p>The Republican budget bill could significantly reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion, potentially causing 11.8 million Americans to lose their health insurance by 2034, according to the CBO. Key changes include imposing new work requirements for many recipients, which experts warn could disproportionately harm older adults and those with administrative hurdles. Healthcare advocates also express concern that the cuts would threaten the financial viability of rural hospitals and community health centers, which heavily rely on Medicaid revenue.

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has applied with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a national trust bank charter. If approved, this would allow Circle to establish a federally regulated bank, enhancing its ability to integrate stablecoins into the traditional financial system and offer custody services. The move is seen as a proactive step to align with emerging U.S. regulations for stablecoins, such as the proposed GENIUS Act. This development follows a period of significant growth for Circle, whose stock has risen sharply since its recent IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

The BBC has since expressed regret for not cutting the live stream sooner and has removed the performance from its iPlayer service.

          <p>The Republican "big, beautiful bill" includes several provisions that would significantly erode access to reproductive care, according to policy experts. The legislation aims to defund Planned Parenthood for at least a decade, which could lead to the closure of nearly 200 clinics nationwide. It would also incentivize insurers to drop abortion coverage from ACA marketplace plans and make deep cuts to Medicaid, affecting access to a wide range of health services for low-income people. These measures come three years after the overturning of Roe v. Wade and represent a concerted federal effort to restrict abortion access even in states where it remains legal.</p>

The legislation, which aims to extend Trump-era tax cuts and enact new ones, is funded in part by deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid, which the CBO estimates would leave nearly 12 million more Americans uninsured. The process has been contentious, with Democrats forcing a 16-hour reading of the 940-page bill to delay its progress. Republican leadership remains confident of passing the bill and sending it to the House before the July 4th deadline.</p>

The report found that the bottom 20% of households would see their incomes decrease by an average of 2.9%, while the top 20% would see a 2.2% increase. This disparity is primarily driven by sharp cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for lower-income families.
