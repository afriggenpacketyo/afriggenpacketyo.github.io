        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the significant decline in drug overdose deaths in the US, noting a 26% drop in 2024. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as the end of pandemic-related isolation, increased awareness of fentanyl risks, and the widespread availability of naloxone (Narcan). The article also highlights concerns about potential cuts to federal funding for opioid treatment programs, which could undermine the progress made in reducing overdose fatalities. While the news is positive, the article emphasizes the need for continued efforts to combat the opioid crisis. Optimism Score: 70</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article reports on a study linking phthalates, chemicals found in plastics, to 350,000 cardiovascular deaths globally in 2018, however experts caution that the study relies on statistical modeling and assumptions. Phthalates are endocrine disruptors found in personal care products and food packaging and have been linked to metabolic disorders. The study estimates that 13% of cardiovascular deaths among 55- to 64-year-olds worldwide could be attributed to phthalates. Experts emphasize the need for further research to understand the link between phthalates and heart health. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is attempting to distance himself from the recent stock market decline, attributing it to his predecessor, Joe Biden, despite the market's surge during Biden's term.

However, the first 100 days of Trump's second term have seen a significant market downturn, and the article also references recent GDP figures indicating an economic contraction.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case regarding the eligibility of a virtual Catholic charter school in Oklahoma for state funding. The case centers on whether St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School can receive public funds despite its religious teachings.

Justices questioned the school's policies on teaching evolution and including children of other faiths, with the court's decision having potential ramifications for charter schools nationwide.
