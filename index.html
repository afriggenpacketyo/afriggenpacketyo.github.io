          <p>Amazon announced plans to extend its same-day or next-day delivery services to over 4,000 smaller cities, towns, and rural communities in the United States by the end of the year, marking the first time these areas will have access to such rapid delivery options. This initiative is part of a larger $4 billion investment aimed at tripling the size of Amazon's rural delivery network by the end of 2026, enhancing accessibility and convenience for customers in underserved regions. The expansion reflects Amazon's ongoing efforts to improve its logistics infrastructure and reach a broader customer base, potentially boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty in these areas.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a rebellion from Labour MPs over planned welfare changes aimed at cutting disability and sickness-related benefits by £5 billion annually by 2030. Despite opposition from over 120 Labour MPs, Starmer insists the current welfare system is unsustainable and requires reform. The Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill faces a vote in Parliament, with rebel MPs citing concerns about the impact on poverty and inadequate consultation. The government's recent U-turn on winter fuel payments has reportedly emboldened the opposition to the welfare reforms.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte affirmed the U.S.'s commitment to the alliance, aiming to reassure allies amid concerns about Washington's potential withdrawal due to uneven defense spending. Rutte emphasized that the U.S. expects European and Canadian allies to increase their defense spending to match U.S. levels, addressing a long-standing point of contention. The summit in The Hague is taking place against the backdrop of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, with members agreeing to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. Rutte urged European allies to focus on investment plans, industrial base development, and support for Ukraine, rather than worrying about U.S. commitment.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order preventing the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without providing them an opportunity to raise fears of torture or death. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, with Sotomayor accusing the government of unlawful conduct and undermining due process. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety, stating it can now remove illegal aliens to willing countries. The legal battle stems from the administration's efforts to deport migrants to countries other than their origin, such as Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda.</p>

          <p>Rising natural gas prices are expected to increase air conditioning costs for Americans this summer, potentially costing the average household around $186 per month. Experts recommend sealing windows and doors, using fans, managing sunlight, and using heat-producing appliances wisely to reduce energy consumption. Regular maintenance of AC systems, such as changing filters, can also improve efficiency and prevent breakdowns. Homeowners with long-term sustainability goals may consider planting trees for natural shade.</p>
