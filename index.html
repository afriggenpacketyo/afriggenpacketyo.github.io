          <p>The daughter of renowned Chinese artist Fan Zeng, 87, has publicly claimed that her father has been "taken away" by his new, much younger wife, Xu Meng. Fan Xiaohui stated she lost contact with her father in early July and recently returned from overseas to find his Beijing residence sealed and empty. The situation has raised significant concern, as she also alleges that most of her father's valuable possessions and artworks have gone missing following his marriage to the 37-year-old state media TV presenter last year.</p>

          <p>This opinion article recounts a personal experience of a flight cancellation at a tense airport, contrasting the author's and other passengers' frustration with the tranquility of a nursing baby. The author uses this observation as a metaphor for finding spiritual peace amidst life's challenges, suggesting that true calm comes not from favorable circumstances but from faith in a higher power. The piece posits that just as the infant felt secure in its mother's arms, people can find unwavering peace by trusting in God, regardless of external turmoil or uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia's persistent refusal to agree to a ceasefire is significantly complicating peace negotiations. This comes after a summit in Alaska between the U.S. and Russian presidents, where Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region for peace. Zelenskyy, who is preparing to meet with the U.S. president and European leaders at the White House, reiterated that no substantive talks can occur without a ceasefire in place. He warned that Russia might intensify its military pressure to create more favorable conditions for itself in the ongoing diplomatic discussions.</p>

          <p>Community advocates and violence prevention workers are criticizing the Trump administration's strategy of deploying the National Guard and increasing police presence to combat crime in Washington D.C. They argue that this militarized approach ignores the root causes of violence and undermines the progress made by community-based intervention programs. Experts in the field contend that sustainable safety is built through investment in local infrastructure and support systems, not solely through law enforcement response. The administration's recent cuts to gun violence prevention grants are seen as further evidence of a disconnect from effective, on-the-ground solutions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a Department of Justice motion to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Ghislaine Maxwell, stating the documents are not an "untapped mine lode" of new information about Jeffrey Epstein's network. The judge's decision has renewed questions about whether other, more substantial investigative files will ever be released to the public. Legal experts and victims' advocates argue that the Trump administration has the authority to release non-grand jury documents but may be avoiding it for political reasons, creating ongoing frustration for those seeking full accountability.</p>

While the storm is not currently forecast to directly impact the mainland United States, a tropical storm warning is in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Forecasters note the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which could lead to fluctuations in its strength over the coming days.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government ordered an end to a strike by more than 10,000 of its flight attendants, which had caused hundreds of cancellations. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board mandated that staff return to work and extended the previous collective agreement until a new one is reached through binding arbitration. While the airline works to stabilize its schedule over the next week, the union has accused the government of violating workers' rights by forcing an end to the dispute over pay and working conditions.</p>

China's foreign ministry condemned the act as a "blatant provocation against historical justice," urging Japan to reflect on its history of aggression and sever ties with militarism.

In contrast, their Social Democrat (SPD) partners, including Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, strongly oppose compulsion and are pushing a plan to make voluntary service more attractive.

While rappelling down a series of falls known as the Seven Teacups, extreme water hydraulics pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. A search operation was launched when he failed to return, and rescuers located him by flying a drone behind the waterfall. Wardwell was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter, suffering only minor injuries and dehydration in what authorities called a "stunning survival story."</p>

This shift presents a major challenge for faculty, many of whom may be unaware of the technology's deep integration into student life.

          <h2>Commentary Explores How New Film 'Materialists' Reflects the Financial Pragmatism of Modern Dating</h2>

          <p>This commentary article reflects on the new Celine Song film "Materialists," which portrays modern romance through a transactional and market-driven lens. The author argues that the film's depiction of characters evaluating partners based on financial worth, while perhaps jarring to some, is an honest reflection of today's dating landscape. The piece suggests that the consumerist logic of dating apps, combined with economic pressures like rising living costs and stagnant wages, has increasingly entangled financial security with romantic decisions. It posits that for many, particularly younger adults, partnering up has become a pragmatic strategy for financial stability.</p>

          <p>Residents are fleeing Gaza City's Zeitoun neighborhood in large numbers due to days of continuous Israeli bombardment, which the local Hamas-run municipality describes as "catastrophic." The Israeli military plans to displace a million people from the city to southern camps and has announced it will resume allowing tents into the territory for shelter. Meanwhile, a nationwide strike is underway in Israel, with protesters demanding an end to the war and a hostage release deal, opposing the government's plan to occupy Gaza City. The UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and a potential famine in the region.</p>

          <p>Australia has granted political asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker from Hong Kong. Hui fled the city in 2020 after facing multiple criminal charges related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was among several activists with a police bounty placed on them. In a social media post, Hui expressed gratitude to the Australian government for providing protection for him and his family. He also used the opportunity to urge Australia to do more to help other Hong Kong activists who remain imprisoned for their political activities.</p>

          <h2>British Horse Racing Announces Unprecedented One-Day Strike to Protest Proposed Betting Tax Increase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 04:01:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British horse racing industry will hold a one-day strike on September 10, canceling four scheduled race meetings in protest of a proposed government tax hike on betting. The campaign, "Axe The Racing Tax," opposes the Treasury's plan to raise the tax rate paid by bookmakers on racing bets to align it with online gaming. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) argues the increase would be "destructive," predicting a revenue loss of £330 million and threatening nearly 3,000 jobs in the first year alone. This marks the first time the sport has voluntarily refused to race in protest of government policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new judicial interpretation from China's Supreme People's Court is set to crack down on companies that evade social insurance contributions for their employees. This increased enforcement is expected to make hiring retirees, who are exempt from these contributions, more financially attractive for businesses like McDonald's. The trend has sparked a public debate, with some concerned that it will shrink job opportunities for the record number of young university graduates entering the workforce. The policy aims to address the country's pension crisis but may have unintended consequences for youth employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, stating it is more than a "regular protest group." Cooper cited incidents for which the group claimed responsibility, leading to charges with a "terrorism connection" as assessed by the Crown Prosecution Service, including an alleged break-in at an Israeli defense firm. The defense comes as police announced 60 more people will be prosecuted for showing support for the banned group, bringing the total arrests to over 700 since the ban was enacted in early July.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand All Blacks have returned to the number one position in the world rugby rankings for the first time in four years after a 41-24 victory over Argentina. The match, which was the Rugby Championship opener for both teams, saw the All Blacks build a strong first-half lead before holding off a spirited second-half comeback from the Pumas. The win, combined with South Africa's loss to Australia, was enough to push New Zealand back to the top spot. The two teams are set to face each other again next Saturday in Buenos Aires.</p>

This deployment will bolster the federal government's ongoing intervention in the city, which President Trump has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness. The move has been met with protests from residents and criticism from local officials, who argue it represents federal overreach and that violent crime rates are lower than during Trump's first term.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this personal essay, the author recounts her journey from being a student who found Renaissance art cold and unrelatable to an adult who now sees its profound power. She argues that her initial inability to connect with masterpieces like Piero della Francesca's "Madonna del Parto" was due to a lack of life experience, not a lack of intellect. Events like trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood opened up new emotional pathways, allowing her to understand the deep human stories within the art. The piece suggests that aging and experience can make one less cynical and more willing to be moved by art and the shared human condition it represents.</p>

          <p>After finishing second for three consecutive seasons, Arsenal is entering what is considered a pivotal year for manager Mikel Arteta, with high expectations of winning the Premier League. The club has invested heavily over the summer, spending £190 million to sign key players like midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres to strengthen the team's core. The strategy has been to add depth and eliminate any drop-off in quality between starters and reserves. With an emphasis on a more direct and potent attacking style, the club believes it now has all the necessary components to secure its first league title in 21 years.</p>
