          <p>China is holding a major military parade in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, an event it calls "Victory Day." The parade, President Xi Jinping's third since taking power, will display advanced weaponry like hypersonic missiles and drones. The event is notable for its high-profile attendees, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose presence together has been termed an "Axis of Upheaval" by some analysts. Former President Trump commented on the event, questioning if Xi would acknowledge the significant US support China received during the war.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region experienced declines, mirroring losses on Wall Street as investors grew concerned about rising global bond yields and trade tensions. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 saw a drop, and yields on Japanese Government Bonds rose, with 20-year yields reaching a 26-year high. Similarly, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell ahead of its latest GDP data release, while markets in South Korea and Hong Kong also pointed towards a weaker trading session. The downturn reflects growing investor apprehension about the global economic outlook and the potential impact of ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that China is experiencing a "branding supercycle," moving beyond its reputation for low-cost manufacturing to building globally trusted brands. The success of companies like Pop Mart with its Labubu dolls is cited as an early sign, but the trend is expanding into industrial sectors like electric vehicle batteries (CATL), cars (BYD, Xiaomi), and drones. This shift indicates that Chinese companies are now competing on brand trust and recognition, not just cost advantage. The piece suggests that as consumers begin to recognize and request Chinese component brands, it marks a significant evolution in the country's business mindset.</p>

          <p>A woman in Alhambra, California, successfully escaped a domestic violence situation by using a discrete hand signal popularized on social media. A bystander at a 7-Eleven recognized the gesture—tucking the thumb into the palm and closing the fingers over it—and called 911. Police responded quickly, arresting the suspect, a convicted felon who attempted to flee and was found with a stun gun. The "signal for help," created by the Canadian Women’s Foundation during the pandemic, has become a vital tool for survivors to discreetly seek help in dangerous situations.</p>

Johnson explained that he was hungry to take on a more dramatic role to break away from being typecast as an action star.</p>

          <h2>Labour Peer Sue Gray Questions Government Plan to Restrict Civil Service Internships by Class</h2>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, a Labour peer and former senior civil servant, has raised concerns about a new UK government policy that restricts a key civil service internship program to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. While acknowledging the good intentions, Gray argued that she benefited from exposure to people from diverse backgrounds when she joined the civil service and questioned the evidence base for the change. The government defended the policy, stating it aims to widen the talent pool and make the civil service more reflective of the country, a point echoed by a fellow Labour minister who disagreed with Gray's assessment.</p>

Citing instances where homeowners successfully saved their properties with garden hoses, the department has created a community brigade program to provide residents with the proper training and equipment.

Cardi B testified that while a heated verbal exchange occurred, she never physically touched the guard.

The company has been developing an AI-powered "Agentforce" of customer service bots, which has led to a decline in the number of support cases that require human intervention.

          <p>The UK's public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), has reported that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) cannot accurately calculate the total cost of a secret relocation program for Afghans. The program was established after a massive 2022 data breach exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied to move to the UK. While the MoD estimates the cost at £850 million, the NAO stated it lacks confidence in this figure because the ministry failed to separately track the scheme's expenses.

While the worms cannot survive on a plastic-only diet, scientists are optimistic about developing a co-supplementation to maintain their health.

          <p>A BBC report examines the work of the Safer Living Foundation, a unique UK charity in Nottingham that provided community-based support to convicted sex offenders to prevent reoffending. The foundation reported a reoffending rate of just 2% among its participants, compared to a national average of 15.1%, by addressing issues like isolation and shame. Despite its apparent success in protecting potential victims, the center was forced to close in May 2025 after failing to secure necessary funding. Its closure highlights the societal and financial challenges of funding rehabilitation programs for one of society's most reviled groups of criminals.</p>

          <p>Shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, jumped 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling on remedies in its landmark antitrust case. Investors reacted positively to the decision, which did not require the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser or Android operating system, avoiding the worst-case scenario for the company. While the ruling imposes new limits, such as banning exclusive default search engine contracts, the market perceived the consequences as manageable. The outcome was also seen as a win for partners like Apple, which receives billions from Google to be the default search engine on its devices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police forces and councils across the UK are issuing fresh warnings about an increase in parking-related scams. These fraudulent schemes include fake text messages demanding payment for non-existent fines and physical "skimming" devices attached to parking payment machines to steal card details. Experts advise the public to be wary of messages that lack specific details like vehicle registration, time, and location of the alleged offense. For payment machines, people should check for any mismatched or bolted-on parts over the contactless reader and use cash or a trusted app if anything seems suspicious.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who fail to take action against the trafficking of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals. The legislation would also target Chinese manufacturers and distributors who do not implement credible measures, such as "know-your-customer" procedures, to prevent their products from entering the illicit drug trade. Supporters of the bill argue it is necessary to target the source of the deadly opioid crisis. However, some lawmakers emphasized that sanctions alone are insufficient and must be paired with effective diplomacy and law enforcement cooperation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a scathing ruling declaring the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles to be a "serious violation" of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement except under specific circumstances authorized by Congress. The judge's opinion details how administration officials, including the Defense Secretary, attempted to circumvent the law by creating a "constitutional exception" to justify the deployment. The analysis in the article suggests this legal reasoning reveals an attempt to establish martial law in practice, if not in name.</p>

Chanting slogans like "Gringos leave," protestors are voicing anger over rising housing costs and the displacement of local culture caused by an influx of digital nomads and foreign visitors. While travelers are often the visible target, experts note that policy gaps are the root cause, and residents feel they have no other recourse to make their voices heard. These protests reflect a growing global backlash against a tourism model that many feel benefits visitors at the expense of locals.</p>

          <p>A column in the Los Angeles Times analyzes a federal judge's ruling that President Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles was illegal. The piece focuses on trial testimony from Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who stated his "loyalty to the country" was questioned by another official after he raised concerns about the legality of a proposed operation. The author argues this exchange reveals a dangerous pressure within the administration for military leaders to prioritize personal loyalty to the president over their oath to the Constitution. This trend, combined with a purge of military leadership, could undermine the rule of law.</p>

Cramer reaffirmed his faith in major tech stocks like Nvidia and Apple, suggesting that these growth leaders can weather downturns and typically rebound.

          <p>Zack Polanski's landslide victory as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales is seen as a significant shake-up in UK politics. His blunt, social-media-savvy style contrasts with the party's previous leadership and may appeal to voters disillusioned with the Labour party. However, this leftward shift presents challenges. Polanski's approach could alienate more moderate, conservative-leaning voters in rural areas where the Greens recently won seats. Furthermore, his party may end up competing for the same voter base as a new party being formed by Jeremy Corbyn, potentially fragmenting the left-wing vote.</p>
