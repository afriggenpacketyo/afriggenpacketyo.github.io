          <p>A manhunt is underway for a 45-year-old former U.S. Army soldier suspected of fatally shooting four people at a tavern in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities have identified the victims as the 64-year-old bartender and three male patrons, aged 59, 70, and 74. The suspect, who lived next door to the bar, is believed to have known the victims and is considered armed and dangerous. A reward has been offered for information leading to his capture as local, state, and federal agencies intensify their search.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, the new tariff rates announced by the Trump administration are "pretty much set" and unlikely to be negotiated further before taking effect. The executive order imposes a baseline 10% tariff on imports from over 60 trading partners, with higher rates for specific countries like Canada. Greer explained that the President evaluates potential trade deals against the leverage of tariffs to reduce the trade deficit and reshore manufacturing. Bank of America's CEO noted economists predict the tariffs will lead to slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent court filing, the Trump administration has denied the existence of a daily arrest quota for immigration agents, contradicting earlier media reports and public statements from White House officials. Senior adviser Stephen Miller had previously mentioned a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day. However, Justice Department lawyers now assert that no such directive has been issued as a matter of policy to ICE or DHS. The filing is part of a lawsuit in California alleging unconstitutional immigration sweeps, where the administration's conflicting statements are under scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City area on Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. While the quake was minor, it caused brief shaking that startled residents across the region, though no significant damage or injuries were reported. The event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that hit the same area in April 2024. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while such events are infrequent on the East Coast, a quake of this magnitude is not expected to cause damage.</p>

          <p>Over 3,200 unionized Boeing workers in the St. Louis area have rejected the company's latest contract offer and are set to strike. The members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, who assemble fighter jets and the MQ-25 refueling drone, argue the contract does not adequately reflect their skill and importance to national defense. Boeing's offer included minor compensation changes and maintained current overtime policies, but the union found it insufficient. This marks the first strike at Boeing's St. Louis defense hub since 1996.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, surpassing California in new utility-scale solar capacity last year, primarily driven by large projects from utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is facilitated by state rules that streamline the approval process for solar projects under 75 megawatts. Despite this boom, the industry faces headwinds from the federal rollback of solar tax credits, which is expected to significantly reduce rooftop solar installations. The state's progress demonstrates how favorable economics can drive renewable energy adoption even without strong climate policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore references to President Donald Trump's two impeachments to an exhibit at the National Museum of American History. The statement followed a report that a temporary placard detailing the impeachments had been removed from "The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden" exhibit in July. The Smithsonian clarified the placard was removed because it did not meet museum standards for presentation, not due to any external pressure. The museum affirmed its responsibility to tell "accurate and complete histories" and will update the section in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a weaker-than-expected jobs report. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited downward revisions in previous months' data as "hard evidence" justifying the move, suggesting the president "wants his own people there" for more reliable data. The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, including Trump's own former BLS chief, who called the act "groundless" and a "dangerous precedent" that could undermine trust in government statistics.

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix, his third victory in four races, closing the championship gap on his teammate Oscar Piastri to just nine points. Despite the win, Norris admitted he is "not making life very easy" for himself after a poor start saw him drop to fifth on the first lap. He recovered by successfully executing a difficult one-stop tire strategy, a move he was initially unsure would work.

This opposition adds to that of major rail unions and some political leaders, who argue the consolidation would harm jobs, disrupt service, and create a dangerous monopoly over national infrastructure.
