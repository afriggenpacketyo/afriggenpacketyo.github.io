The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced strong bipartisan backlash from both senators and House representatives, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he withdrew the provision because he could not secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families.

The error occurred due to a technical glitch that multiplied winnings by 100 instead of dividing them during a currency conversion. The company's CEO, who has since stepped down, expressed deep regret for the disappointment caused, though no incorrect prize amounts were actually paid out. The incident is part of a series of technical issues the company has faced over the past year.</p>

          <p>Virginia Senator Mark Warner has accused the Trump administration of explicitly threatening the University of Virginia with severe funding cuts to force the resignation of its president, Jim Ryan. Warner stated that the university was warned of losing jobs, research funding, student aid, and visas if Ryan did not step down by a specific deadline. Ryan, who had championed diversity initiatives opposed by the administration, resigned on Friday, citing his unwillingness to risk the university's welfare. Warner condemned the action as an outrageous overreach that threatens academic freedom.</p>
