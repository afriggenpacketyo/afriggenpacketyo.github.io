          <p>A Florida jury has convicted Ryan Routh on all five charges related to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in September 2024. Routh, who represented himself at trial, was arrested at Trump's golf course after aiming a rifle at a Secret Service agent before the then-presidential candidate was in view. The agent fired, causing Routh to flee without discharging his weapon. This incident was the second of two assassination attempts against Trump during the 2024 campaign season.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball's competition committee has approved the use of an Automated Ball/Strike System (ABS) starting in the 2026 season. While human umpires will continue to call balls and strikes, teams will be granted two challenges per game, with the ability to retain a challenge if successful. The system, which has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019, aims to increase accuracy and reduce disputes over calls. This marks a significant technological evolution for the sport, following other recent rule changes like the pitch clock.</p>

          <p>An informational article explains the 'Medigap birthday rule,' a provision available in about 18 states that allows Medicare beneficiaries an annual window to switch supplemental insurance plans without medical underwriting. This rule, typically tied to a person's birthday, enables seniors to change to a Medigap plan with equal or lesser benefits, potentially saving money or finding better coverage without being denied due to pre-existing conditions. The specifics of the enrollment period and plan options vary by state, offering crucial flexibility for managing healthcare costs.</p>

          <p>With average home equity high, homeowners are considering Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) for large expenses. Following recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost for a $60,000 HELOC is now slightly lower, at approximately $730 for a 10-year term. The article suggests that the variable rate of a HELOC could be advantageous if further rate cuts occur, making it a potentially flexible borrowing tool in the current economic climate. This analysis provides context for homeowners weighing their financial options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the transnational gang Barrio 18 as a foreign terrorist organization. The department cited the group's history of attacks on officials, security forces, and civilians across Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. This designation places Barrio 18 alongside other criminal groups like MS-13 and certain drug cartels that the Trump administration has labeled as terrorist entities. The move aligns with the administration's strategy of using anti-terrorism measures to dismantle gangs and cartels, including authorizing military action against them.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from CDC scientists, U.S. infection rates from highly drug-resistant bacteria, known as 'nightmare bacteria,' increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The surge is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which are resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. Researchers suggest the increase may be linked to a rise in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, collected from 29 states, indicates a growing public health threat that could make common infections much more difficult to treat.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has ordered actor Noel Clarke to pay at least £3 million towards the legal costs of Guardian News and Media after he lost his libel lawsuit against the publisher. Clarke had sued the newspaper over a series of 2021 articles that reported on allegations of sexual misconduct against him. In August, a judge dismissed his claim, finding the reporting was defensible on the grounds of truth and public interest. Clarke, who represented himself at the costs hearing, stated that the case has led to the loss of his work, savings, and health.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants are benching starting quarterback Russell Wilson in favor of rookie Jaxson Dart for their upcoming game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The decision comes after the team's 0-3 start to the season, during which fans were heard chanting for the change. Wilson has struggled, throwing three touchdowns and three interceptions, while the offense has failed to find a rhythm. Dart, a highly-touted rookie, will make his first career NFL start as the team seeks a spark to turn its season around.</p>

          <h2>Fed Chair Powell Highlights Economic Challenge of Rising Inflation and Slowing Job Market</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the current economic landscape as a 'challenging situation,' citing the dual pressures of rising inflation and a slowdown in hiring. In recent remarks, Powell noted that the downside risks to employment have increased, which was a key factor in the Fed's decision to cut interest rates last week. He also expressed continued concern about the path of inflation, emphasizing the 'two-sided risk' the central bank must manage. These conditions, sometimes termed 'stagflation,' create a difficult dilemma for policymakers balancing employment goals with price stability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a new $100,000 fee on all applications for H-1B high-skill work visas, a move aimed at curbing alleged misuse of the program by outsourcing firms. This analysis argues that while the policy may deter companies from hiring lower-wage foreign workers, it will also severely harm American innovation and economic growth. The exorbitant fee is expected to hinder universities and non-profits from attracting top international talent for scientific research. Critics suggest alternative reforms, such as prioritizing visas based on salary, would be more effective without damaging U.S. competitiveness.</p>

          <p>A Missouri woman, Lisa Jeanine Findley, has been sentenced to more than four years in federal prison for attempting to defraud the Elvis Presley estate through a fraudulent sale of Graceland. Findley pleaded guilty to mail fraud, admitting to a scheme where she created a fake company and forged documents to claim that Presley's late daughter, Lisa Marie, had used the historic property as collateral for a non-existent $3.8 million loan. She then attempted to force a foreclosure sale before the Presley family took legal action to stop it.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has uncovered and is dismantling a massive network of 'SIM farms' in the New York area, with multiple sites containing over 100,000 active SIM cards. These devices can be used for large-scale fraud, such as phishing texts and scam calls, but officials warn they could also be used to overwhelm and crash cellular networks. The investigation is ongoing, but authorities have described the operation as highly organized and possibly state-sponsored. The discovery was made as world leaders gathered for the UN General Assembly.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the strongest storm of 2025, has caused significant devastation in eastern Taiwan, resulting in at least two deaths and trapping or leaving scores of people missing. The disaster was exacerbated when a mountain barrier lake, formed by previous landslides, burst its banks and flooded a nearby township. The typhoon, with winds equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, is now heading toward China's southern coast, prompting mass evacuations in Guangdong province and widespread flight cancellations in Hong Kong.</p>
