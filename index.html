          <h2>Donald Trump's Visit to Scotland Elicits Divided Reactions</h2>

          <p>A recent trip by U.S. President Donald Trump to Scotland, the birthplace of his mother, has highlighted a significant split in public opinion. While Trump held court at his golf resorts and conducted meetings with UK and Scottish leaders, many Scots, including First Minister John Swinney, expressed disapproval through protests and critical statements, reflecting polling data that shows low favorability for the president. The visit mixed business with diplomacy, as discussions included topics like the conflict in Gaza and US tariffs on Scotch whisky, though no formal agreements were reached. The article suggests Trump's business interests ensure he will remain a fixture in Scottish politics.</p>

          <p>One year after a fatal knife attack at a dance workshop claimed the lives of three young girls, the community of Southport observed a three-minute silence to honor the victims. Bebe King, Alice Aguiar, and Elsie Dot Stancombe were killed in the July 29, 2024, tragedy, which also left several other children and adults injured. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed national solidarity, while local leaders praised the community's resilience and the victims' families for their inspirational strength. Instead of large vigils, churches and community centers opened for quiet reflection, honoring the families' wishes and focusing on togetherness and love.</p>

          <h2>Education Secretary Criticizes Maine Official Over Emails Challenging Trump's Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 15:46:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon issued a warning to Maine after emails surfaced showing the state's education commissioner, Pender Makin, advising schools to adhere to state law over federal executive orders from President Trump. The emails suggested non-compliance with orders related to DEI and transgender athletes in sports, prompting McMahon to state that defying federal law will have consequences. This conflict is part of an ongoing dispute between the Trump administration and Maine, which has led to a Department of Justice lawsuit against the state for allegedly violating Title IX. A recent poll indicates that a majority of Maine voters support restricting sports participation based on biological sex.</p>

          <p>Following a prolonged chase lasting over 12 hours, authorities in the Dominican Republic successfully intercepted a speedboat and seized 1.5 tons of cocaine. The operation, which involved helicopters, boats, and cars, concluded with the arrest of three Dominicans and one Colombian off the country's southern coast. This seizure is one of the largest in the nation's history, highlighting its role as a significant transit point for drugs, many of which are destined for Europe. The incident underscores the ongoing efforts by Dominican authorities to combat large-scale drug trafficking, with officials having seized over 46 tons of drugs in the previous year.</p>

          <p>The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has stated it will not grant congressional immunity to Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein. This decision came after Maxwell's lawyer informed the committee that she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights and refuse to testify under a subpoena unless certain conditions were met, including immunity from prosecution. Her lawyer also noted that Maxwell would be "eager" to testify publicly if she were to receive a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. The committee is seeking her testimony to inform potential legislative reforms regarding sex trafficking laws and the government's handling of the Epstein case.</p>

These compounded alternatives became prevalent while Wegovy was on the FDA's drug shortage list, and some pharmacies continue to produce them.

          <p>President Donald Trump has offered a new explanation for ending his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, claiming it was because the financier repeatedly hired away staff from his Mar-a-Lago club. Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump asserted that he banned Epstein after warning him not to "poach" employees, and identified Virginia Giuffre, an underage victim of Epstein, as one of the workers who was "stolen" from the spa. This account contradicts previous statements where Trump cited Epstein's 2009 conviction as the reason for their falling out. Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell while working at Mar-a-Lago.</p>

Investigators found a note in which the shooter, Shane Tamura, claimed he suffered from the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition. Tamura, a former high school football player, took the wrong elevator and opened fire in the offices of Rudin Management, killing an NYPD officer, a Blackstone employee, and a security guard. The incident has prompted the NFL to advise its New York employees to work from home and has renewed focus on the long-term neurological impacts of contact sports.</p>

He argues that as a real estate developer, he is uniquely qualified for the task and has criticized the use of tents for large events like state dinners. Trump envisions a permanent structure capable of holding a thousand guests, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity, and claims to be reviewing concepts with architects.

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could have a disproportionate effect on different drug companies based on their global manufacturing footprints. Analysts suggest that companies like Novartis and Roche, with significant overseas operations, may be more at risk, while firms with larger U.S. manufacturing networks like AbbVie and Eli Lilly are relatively better positioned. The exact tariff rate remains unclear, but the policy could pressure companies' cash flow and potentially lead to higher drug prices or cuts in R&D spending. Some pharmaceutical CEOs have warned the tariffs could disrupt supply chains and ultimately harm patients by limiting innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. trade officials have indicated that any extension of the current tariff pause with China will require final approval from President Donald Trump. Following the third round of high-level talks in Stockholm, negotiators said they would brief the president on the discussions before any decision is made. The temporary truce, which has paused most of the steep "reciprocal" tariffs imposed by both nations, is set to expire on August 12. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that if an extension is not agreed upon, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will "boomerang" back to their previous high levels, underscoring the president's ultimate authority over the trade deal.</p>

This revised ultimatum replaces a previous 50-day window, reflecting Trump's growing frustration with what he perceives as a lack of progress from Russian President Vladimir Putin in ending the war.

Its symptoms can include cognitive decline, impulsive behavior, and emotional instability, but it can only be definitively diagnosed after death through an autopsy. While research has found CTE in a very high percentage of former NFL players' brains studied, scientists are still working to understand its prevalence, precise causes, and how to diagnose it in living individuals.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's potential signing of two elite number nine strikers, Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak, in a single transfer window represents a significant and curious tactical move. This article explores several ways manager Arne Slot could deploy the new talent alongside existing stars like Mohamed Salah and Florian Wirtz. Potential formations include a narrow 4-2-3-1, a more traditional 4-4-2 strike partnership, or even a 4-3-3 with one of the new forwards playing in a creative midfield role. The analysis suggests that rather than a single fixed lineup, the signings provide crucial depth and tactical flexibility for a long season with over 60 games.</p>

          <p>Following a suggestion from President Trump, Republican Senator Josh Hawley has introduced a bill to send tariff rebate checks directly to American families. The proposed legislation, called the American Worker Rebate Act, would distribute funds collected from federal tariffs, providing at least $600 per adult and child. This move aims to offset the increased costs to consumers that result from tariffs, which are taxes paid by domestic companies on imported goods. However, the proposal faces potential opposition from fiscally conservative lawmakers and economists who argue the revenue would be better used for deficit reduction and that rebates could exacerbate inflation.
