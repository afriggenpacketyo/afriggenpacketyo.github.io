          <p>High-ranking officials from the United States and China recently concluded trade talks in London, but both sides have remained tight-lipped about the discussions, leading to speculation and uncertainty. The silence has fueled concerns about potential tensions, shifts in power dynamics, and the fragile state of global trade relations. Tao Dong, president and chief economist at Springs Capital (Hong Kong), suggests that China's stance on export controls on rare earth elements may have caught the US delegation off guard, adding complexity to the already delicate negotiations. The focus has shifted from tariff levels to export controls, indicating a more evenly matched contest between the two economic giants. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities do not suspect foul play in Wein's death, and the investigation has been closed. The discovery followed speculation about a potential serial killer in New England, fueled by the discovery of multiple bodies in the region since March, but police have dismissed these fears, and extend their deepest condolences to Mr. Wein’s family and loved ones during this difficult time.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, with Fordo, a subterranean uranium enrichment site, as a potential target. The decision is under discussion within Trump's national security team, but there is not full agreement on how to proceed. Israel has alleged that Iran is rapidly advancing towards building nuclear weapons, though a recent U.S. intelligence assessment stated that Iran is not currently building nuclear weapons. Trump has publicly stated that the U.S. has complete control of the skies over Iran and knows the whereabouts of Iran's supreme leader, while also warning against any attacks on U.S. troops.</p>

Concerns about President Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere led to stronger provisions safeguarding against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system, and national security. The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors, and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.

In a memo to staff, Jassy urged employees to "be curious about AI" and acknowledged that AI-driven efficiency gains would result in fewer people performing certain jobs. While the exact extent of the workforce reduction is uncertain, Amazon anticipates a shift towards new types of roles as AI is integrated across the company.

          <p>A federal appeals court in San Francisco is considering whether President Trump can continue deploying California's National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities during enforcement operations. The three-judge panel appeared skeptical of California's arguments against the federalization of the National Guard, with the Justice Department arguing that Mr. Trump's decision is unreviewable by courts. California argues that Mr. Trump failed to consider alternative measures before calling in the National Guard and circumvented Gov. Gavin Newsom in his decision. The case involves the interpretation of Title 10, which outlines the circumstances under which the National Guard can be called into federal service.</p>

          <p>Republican Sen. Mike Lee has deleted controversial social media posts about the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband after facing criticism for politicizing the tragedy. The posts, which referenced the attack and blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the shootings, were removed after Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke with Lee. Democrats condemned Lee's posts as dangerous and inciting violence, urging elected officials to turn down heated rhetoric.

JetBlue is also assessing its hiring plans and could combine leadership roles and reduce travel spending.

          <p>Members of Parliament (MPs) have voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment, passed by a majority of 242 votes, ensures that women who terminate their pregnancy outside the current legal framework will no longer face criminal investigation. The law will still penalize anyone who assists a woman in getting an abortion outside the current legal framework, including medical professionals. Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, who put forward the amendment, highlighted cases where women had been arrested for illegal abortion offences.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison, thanks to new evidence and re-examination of old evidence. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, new DNA testing revealed foreign male DNA on items like the rope found around her husband's neck. The prosecution's case relied heavily on blood evidence in the bedroom, but it was found that not all stains were tested and some were not blood.

Smith is set to be taken off of life support, following controversy over Georgia's abortion ban, which initially required her to be kept on life support.
