          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama has publicly refuted rumors of an impending divorce from Barack Obama. Speculation arose due to her absence from several prominent events, leading to assumptions about marital discord. Obama clarified that she is now making independent decisions about her schedule, emphasizing her autonomy as a 'grown woman'. She also expressed feeling guilty for stepping back from certain duties, a struggle many women face when prioritizing their own needs. The former First Lady also spoke at the Democratic National Convention this past summer, urging support for then-presidential nominee Kamala Harris.</p>

            <p>The government is defending its decision to deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, arguing that his presence in the U.S. poses a foreign policy risk. Khalil's lawyers contend that the government has not provided sufficient evidence to support this claim, especially considering his green card status and marriage to an American citizen. Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserted that Khalil's alleged role in 'antisemitic protests' justifies his deportation, even if his actions are otherwise lawful. Khalil's lawyers plan to depose Rubio to understand the grounds for his determination and are concerned about the precedent this case could set regarding the silencing of critics.</p>

            <p>Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national, has been released from Russian prison in a prisoner swap orchestrated by the CIA and FSB. Karelina was sentenced to 12 years for treason after donating to a Ukrainian humanitarian group. In exchange, the U.S. freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics. The exchange, which took place in Abu Dhabi, highlights ongoing communication between the U.S. and Russia despite strained relations. It also underscores the Trump administration's efforts to secure the release of wrongfully detained Americans.</p>

The RSPB encourages people to take actions like avoiding pesticides and installing nest boxes to support starlings and other garden wildlife. The house sparrow remains the most numerous species recorded in the survey, with the starling dropping to fourth place.</p>

Unions argue that these austerity measures disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as pensioners and low-paid workers. International flights are expected to proceed with minimal delays, and bus drivers have continued working despite the strike.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's goal to bring inflation down to 2%. On a monthly basis, prices fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years. Lower fuel prices and sharp drops in travel-related costs contributed to the easing of inflation. Economists noted that the data does not fully reflect the impact of recent trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>CBS has lost distribution rights to 'Wheel of Fortune' and 'Jeopardy!' after a court rejected the network's bid for an injunction. Sony, which produces the game shows, filed a complaint alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing agreements. The court ruled that Sony can begin distributing the shows and does not need to deliver episodes to CBS. CBS Media Ventures said it would immediately appeal the court's ruling.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador's mega-jail. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was granted protection from deportation by an immigration judge due to the risk of persecution from gangs in El Salvador. The Trump administration argued that the judge lacked authority to issue the order and that US officials cannot compel El Salvador to return Garcia. The Supreme Court declined to block the lower court's order in a 9-0 ruling.</p>

The former world number one has secured two runners-up finishes and 14 other top-25 finishes since his debut in 2003. He made a rapid start with three birdies in the opening three holes, continuing to use his putter marvellously to sink three more in a row around the turn. Loose drives led to a par-bogey finish but it did not diminish a wonderful round which saw him post his joint lowest score at the Masters.</p>
