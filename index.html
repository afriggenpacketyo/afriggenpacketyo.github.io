            <p>Heavy rainfall in Moore, Oklahoma, led to severe flooding, tragically resulting in the deaths of an adult female and a 12-year-old child after their vehicles were swept off the road. Emergency responders rescued three others, highlighting the intensity of what police described as a "historical weather event." The flooding occurred amidst severe weather alerts affecting over 30 million Americans during the Easter weekend, with several states experiencing tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds, causing widespread road closures and high-water incidents across the city. The police extended their gratitude to neighboring agencies for their assistance in rescue efforts during this tragic incident. Optimism Score: 5</p>

            <p>While tongue-scraping is an ancient dental hygiene practice, some experts are warning about potential heart health risks. Tongue-scraping can cause microscopic cuts on the tongue, potentially introducing bacteria into the bloodstream and increasing the risk of endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. Over-scraping can also lower nitric oxide levels, increasing the risk of high blood pressure, and should not be a substitute for brushing and flossing. Experts recommend gentle scraping in moderation, emphasizing that maintaining overall oral hygiene through regular dental visits, brushing, and flossing is more crucial for heart health.

            <p>In Texas and Northern Mexico, the tradition of cascarones, confetti-filled eggs, connects generations during Easter celebrations. Denise Solis continues the tradition started by her mother, who made cascarones even during her final weeks with cancer. The act of filling and breaking cascarones symbolizes rebirth and love, and is a powerful connection to the past. Solis now shares this tradition with her son, hiding the cascarones in the backyard for him and his friends to find, laugh, and shower each other with confetti, reminding her of her mother's love.

            <p>China, typically hesitant to take sides in African conflicts, has shown a shift in its approach to the insurgency in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Beijing, through its UN ambassador, has directly urged Kigali to cease support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw Rwandan troops from the DRC. This departure from China's usual non-interference policy reflects its efforts to safeguard its significant mining interests and maintain relationships with both countries involved in the conflict.

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to American consumers for shipments worth more than $800 due to increased customs red tape following the implementation of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The delivery giant cited a surge in formal customs clearances as the reason for the suspension, impacting business-to-consumer shipments from all countries, though business-to-business shipments will continue with potential delays. The White House is also set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 from China and Hong Kong, impacting fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu, who have warned of potential price increases.

            <p>The beauty industry's embrace of snail slime has normalized a practice that raises ethical concerns about the treatment of snails. While the industry assures consumers that snails are treated well, the reality involves methods like acidic spraying and, in some cases, euthanasia. The market for snail beauty products is projected to reach $3.4 billion by 2034, driven by millennials and Gen Z seeking cruelty-free solutions, but the ethics of industrialized snail labor remain questionable. Some studies show the animals are under duress during the extraction process, but without exposure of a cruel snail extraction facility, it’s not obvious how snails get beyond their current designation as insensate slime machines.
