          <p>Yellow heat health alerts have been issued for most of England, forecasting temperatures as high as 28C in London. The alert, effective from Wednesday to Sunday, warns of potential impacts on health and social services, particularly for those aged 65 and over or with health conditions. The UKHSA anticipates a possible rise in deaths and increased demand for health services, with internal temperatures in hospitals and care homes posing a risk to vulnerable individuals. Yorkshire and The Humber is expected to experience only minor impacts, while temperatures across western Europe are expected to rise further into the weekend. The alert aims to mitigate the adverse effects of the anticipated heatwave. </p>

The study assessed the "quality of services" across public finances, education, health, safety, and infrastructure, comparing these metrics against each city's per-capita budget. Provo stood out due to its robust business growth, high school graduation rate, infrastructure, and low violent crime rate. Nampa, Idaho, and Manchester, New Hampshire, followed Provo in the rankings, noted for their low government debt and safety ratings, and low pollution levels and steady growth in home values, respectively.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran intensifies, China finds itself in a precarious position due to its close ties with both countries, as well as Russia, Pakistan, and North Korea. China, Iran's largest energy buyer, has called for de-escalation while supporting Iran's right to self-defense, but has also issued safety advisories to its nationals in Israel. The situation tests China's self-proclaimed role as a neutral mediator and its ability to balance geopolitical interests with domestic priorities. China's UN ambassador framed Israel as the aggressor, urging it to cease military actions, but did not address Iran's nuclear advancements.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has banned chess in public in Afghanistan, with enforcers accosting players, confiscating chess sets, and even beating individuals for playing. This ban extends to buying chess sets and even watching the game, according to a former chess coach in Herat. The Taliban claims the ban is due to religious considerations and concerns about gambling, although chess players deny any gambling occurs in official or informal games. The international chess federation is working to repeal the ban, highlighting that many Muslim countries allow chess, while some see the ban as a way to stop critical thinking.</p>

          <p>Despite political differences, President Donald Trump has a strong affinity for the UK and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, citing personal liking as a key factor in their positive relationship. The UK was the first to secure a trade deal with the U.S. under Trump, benefiting from lower tariffs on car and steel exports. Trump's Anglophilia, rooted in familial links and appreciation for British culture, has also contributed to the special relationship. This cultural connection, combined with strategic alignment on trade and foreign policy, has allowed the UK to maintain a privileged position with the U.S. administration.</p>

          <p>The Mayor of London is moving forward with plans to pedestrianize parts of Oxford Street, aiming to revitalize the area and attract more visitors and investment. The plan involves banning vehicles from a 0.7-mile stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch, diverting 16 bus routes, with potential changes towards Tottenham Court Road. While City Hall claims two-thirds of people support the ban, concerns remain about traffic diversion, accessibility for disabled individuals, and the quality of retail offerings. The proposals depend on the establishment of a new mayoral development corporation to provide planning powers, with detailed consultations planned for later this year.</p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant downturn following the U.S. Senate's proposal to phase out tax incentives for solar and wind power by 2028. This provision, included in President Donald Trump's spending bill, contrasts with the longer-term incentives maintained for nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy. Key renewable energy incentives from former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act are under pressure, leading to concerns about the future of solar energy investment. Despite the negative impact, some analysts view the Senate proposal as an improvement over the House version, though challenges for wind and solar eligibility persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A security expert has lauded Israel's defensive systems for preventing greater destruction during recent Iranian missile attacks. Despite the destructive potential of Iranian ballistic missiles, Israel intercepted approximately 95% of those launched toward its territory. The country employs a multi-layered defense system, including Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow 2, and Arrow 3, along with the new Magen Or laser system and the U.S. THAAD system. In addition to defense, Israel has also targeted Iranian missile storage sites and launching infrastructure, aiming to neutralize the Islamic Republic's military capabilities, though the conflict has caused civilian casualties and disruptions.</p>

          <p>Experts are skeptical about claims that the Trump Organization's newly announced $499 smartphone, the T1, will be manufactured in the U.S., suggesting it will likely be made in China. Despite the company's assertion that the phone will be "built in the United States," analysts point to the lack of domestic manufacturing capabilities and the likelihood that a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM) will design and produce the phone. Smartphone manufacturing became a focal point after Trump's threats of tariffs on imported devices, with calls for Apple to manufacture iPhones in the U.S., which experts deem nearly impossible and substantially costly.</p>

The stewards rejected the protest, leading Wolff to suggest the FIA needs to address such far-fetched claims.

Additionally, bullet train services in northeastern Japan were halted for hours due to inspection, and Japan Post will accept freight license revocation over lax alcohol tests.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced that it will remove FD&C artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027, and will not launch any new products in the U.S. containing those ingredients. This decision follows pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for the food industry to pull back on artificial dyes as part of a larger so-called Make America Healthy Again platform. The FDA in April announced a plan to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year and replace them with natural alternatives. Kraft Heinz has made more than 1,000 recipe changes over the past five years to improve product nutrition.</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is optimistic that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) could eventually replace chemotherapy for some cancer patients, offering more targeted treatment with fewer side effects. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing heavily in developing ADCs, which deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy ones. While ADCs have shown promise, some experts caution that more refinement is needed before they can fully replace chemotherapy. Newer ADCs, like Enhertu from AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, deliver more chemotherapy per dose and use smart linkers to release the drug only inside tumors, showing potential to become standard treatments for certain cancers.</p>

Several letters emphasize the importance of organized labor and the need for conservatives to separate themselves from reactionaries to achieve civic renewal.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite promising a large deportation program, President Donald Trump's administration has deported fewer people than President Barack Obama's, who was once dubbed "the deporter in chief." Obama's high deportation numbers were driven by increased penalties for unauthorized border crossings and deputizing local law enforcement to target immigrants with criminal records. Trump's efforts to replicate this strategy have been hampered by a decrease in border apprehensions and increased opposition to cooperating with federal immigration authorities in liberal enclaves. Although deportations have recently increased, it remains unclear whether Trump can maintain the momentum needed to surpass Obama's record.</p>
