          <p>Harvey Weinstein's retrial for sexual assault has commenced in New York after his previous conviction was overturned due to procedural issues. Prosecutors accuse Weinstein of leveraging his Hollywood influence to sexually abuse and harass women, while his defense argues the claims lack credibility. This trial, Weinstein's third in five years, involves allegations from multiple women, including a former production assistant, an aspiring actress, and a model. The retrial is expected to include testimony from women who brought allegations against Weinstein in the 2020 trial, and the case is a landmark moment for the #MeToo movement, following the overturning of his previous conviction.</p>

          <p>A Federal Reserve report reveals that businesses are attempting to pass on the increasing costs resulting from President Trump's tariffs to consumers. Companies have reported receiving notices from suppliers about rising costs and are looking to avoid absorbing the increases themselves. The report characterizes economic growth as "little changed," but notes that uncertainty surrounding international trade policy is pervasive across the Fed's 12 districts. The report also highlights potential issues in trade with Canada, including a decline in tourism bookings and lost business contacts for tech firms.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb shares experienced a drop after a late-stage trial for its schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, failed to reach statistical significance as an adjunctive treatment. Despite this setback, the CNBC Investing Club is holding its position, awaiting further information on Cobenfy's performance as a standalone treatment and its potential in other indications, like Alzheimer's disease agitation and psychosis. While this study does not change Cobenfy's outlook as a monotherapy for schizophrenia, the Club will lower its price target to account for the update. The Club will hold the position until it can get a better sense of how the Cobenfy ramp is performing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge appears inclined to permanently block President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, citing concerns about its constitutionality and echoing the repression of McCarthyism. The executive order, which cited Perkins Coie's former representation of Hillary Clinton's campaign, sought to strip the firm's lawyers of security clearances and restrict their access to federal buildings. The judge voiced skepticism about the administration's justifications, comparing the order to actions during the Red Scare. The judge expressed frustration with the DOJ's memo following her initial TRO, calling it a 'temper tantrum'.</p>

          <p>Explorers discovered aircraft from the legendary Battle of Midway within the wreckage of the USS Yorktown, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier sunk during World War II. The mission, conducted by NOAA Ocean Exploration, focused on the ship's hanger deck and revealed at least three Douglas SBD Dauntless bombers, including one still armed. These planes are believed to be part of a reserve force or from the USS Enterprise, offering a unique glimpse into the pivotal battle.

The Trump administration's views on climate change, international development, and economic equity often conflict with those of other nations that are shareholders in the global institutions.

          <p>President Trump's desire for automakers to move vehicle production to the U.S. faces several challenges, including an upcoming 25% auto parts tariff and the time-consuming nature of relocating production lines.

While an extension of time could be helpful, the additional tariffs on auto parts could offset any benefits of assembling vehicles stateside.

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated a potential trade deal between the US and China, emphasizing the need for China to change its economic practices. Bessent believes there is an opportunity for a "big deal" if China is serious about reducing its dependence on export-led manufacturing growth and rebalancing towards a domestic economy. The comments come amid escalating trade tensions between the two countries, with both sides imposing significant tariffs on each other's goods. Bessent also called on the IMF and World Bank to refocus on their core missions of economic stability and development.</p>

          <p>Senator Dick Durbin's announcement that he will not seek reelection in 2026 has set off a scramble for his long-held seat in Illinois and will trigger a shakeup in Senate Democratic leadership.

Several senators, including Brian Schatz, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker, are being considered as potential successors. Durbin's departure also opens up the top Democratic spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is expected to be filled by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse.</p>
