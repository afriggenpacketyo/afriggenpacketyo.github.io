          <p>Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan stated that recent social media attacks from Donald Trump validate his decision to switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party. Duncan, who was recently expelled from the Georgia GOP, argued that the party under Trump no longer aligns with his values, making it easier to "love my neighbor as a Democrat." He also confirmed he is considering a run for Georgia governor in 2026, aiming to offer a moderate, common-sense alternative to what he describes as a Trump-dominated Republican slate. The move highlights the ongoing ideological divisions within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>Five years after the largest protests in Belarus's history against the rigged 2020 election, the country remains firmly under Alexander Lukashenko's autocratic control, with increased Russian support. The regime has systematically erased digital evidence of the uprising while escalating repression, with over 60,000 people imprisoned for political reasons. Despite the release of some political prisoners, experts believe the West has limited leverage and has not made Belarus a priority, leaving the prospects for significant change dim. The situation underscores the deep-seated challenges in confronting entrenched authoritarianism in the region.</p>

          <p>Spain's national ombudsman is investigating a decision by the Jumilla local authority to prohibit Muslim religious celebrations, such as Eid, from being held in municipal facilities like gyms and civic centers. The measure, proposed by the far-right Vox party and approved by the conservative Popular Party, has been condemned as "Islamophobic and discriminatory" by Muslim community leaders and Spain's migration minister. Even Spain's Catholic bishops have warned the ban violates fundamental rights. The probe highlights growing tensions over religious freedom and cultural identity in Spain.</p>

          <p>The daughter of Bhim Kohli, an 80-year-old man killed in an unprovoked attack by teenagers, claims police inaction may have contributed to his death. A report revealed that police had identified suspects in a prior racial assault witnessed by Mr. Kohli two weeks earlier but failed to make arrests, citing shift patterns and a bank holiday. The daughter argues that swifter police action could have sent a message and deterred the subsequent violence, and she is calling for the police watchdog to reopen its investigation. The case raises serious questions about Leicestershire Police's handling of anti-social and racially motivated crimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's recent sanctions targeting an Indian refinery for processing and exporting Russian crude oil are not expected to derail ongoing free trade negotiations between the EU and India. Experts suggest the sanctions are largely symbolic and that India can easily adapt its supply chains. Paradoxically, the greater pressure from potential U.S. tariffs on Indian goods may actually push New Delhi closer to securing a predictable trade partnership with the EU. This complex geopolitical dynamic highlights the shifting alliances and economic pressures shaping global trade amid the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Following its bankruptcy and liquidation, the Bed Bath & Beyond brand is being resurrected with the opening of its first new physical store, named Bed Bath & Beyond Home, in Nashville, Tennessee. The new operator, The Brand House Collective (formerly Kirkland's Inc.), plans to convert dozens more stores and is honoring the brand's famous expired 20% off coupons to welcome back loyal customers. The relaunch, a result of complex corporate acquisitions, marks a fresh start for the iconic retailer.

The undiplomatic attack from the Trump-appointed envoy underscores significant friction between the U.S. and UK administrations over the approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the expanding war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, many Americans are struggling with compounding interest. This article outlines four key strategies to combat these charges and regain financial control. These methods include transferring balances to a 0% introductory APR card, enrolling in a credit card issuer's hardship program, and paying off balances before the statement closing date. Another effective option is consolidating high-interest credit card debt into a lower-rate personal loan, which can simplify payments and significantly reduce long-term interest costs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the economic landscape shifts and the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates, a CD laddering strategy is becoming an increasingly sensible approach for savers. This method involves opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates, allowing individuals to lock in current high rates while maintaining access to their funds at regular intervals. By spreading investments across short, medium, and long-term CDs, savers can balance the benefits of high returns with the need for financial flexibility in an unpredictable economy. This strategic approach helps mitigate the risk of locking all funds into a single long-term account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway," which turned 100 this year, is being celebrated as a masterpiece that rewards rereading at different stages of life. The article argues that a central, enduring theme of the book is its profound exploration of the midlife crisis, as seen through its 51-year-old protagonist, Clarissa Dalloway. While often read in youth for its stream-of-consciousness style and depiction of post-WWI trauma, its reflections on mortality, past choices, and finding joy in ordinary life resonate more deeply with age.

          <p>Nearly 24 years after the September 11th terrorist attacks, New York City's chief medical examiner has identified three more victims, bringing the total number of identified individuals to 1,653. The identifications of Barbara Keating, 72, and Ryan Fitzgerald, 26, were made possible by significant advances in DNA extraction and testing technology applied to remains recovered from the World Trade Center site. This ongoing effort provides long-awaited closure for some families and demonstrates a sustained commitment to identifying all 2,753 victims. The work continues, with over 1,100 victims yet to be identified.</p>

This progress comes after the U.S. Defense Department made a significant $400 million investment, making the federal government MP's largest shareholder.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, accusing him of being "highly conflicted" due to alleged investment ties to Chinese companies linked to the military. The unusual presidential intervention in corporate leadership follows concerns raised by Republican Senator Tom Cotton. In response, Mr. Tan, a venture capitalist appointed in March to turn around the chipmaker, defended his career's ethical standards and stated he was committed to U.S. national security. The attack creates significant pressure on Intel, a major recipient of U.S. government funding aimed at rebuilding domestic semiconductor manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The ongoing quorum break by Texas Democrats, who fled to Chicago to block a Republican redistricting effort, is analyzed as a tactic with two primary goals: sending a national message and running down the legislative clock. While successful in drawing attention to the issue and demonstrating resolve, experts believe the effort is unlikely to permanently stop the new maps from being passed. The logistical and financial pressures on the lawmakers, combined with the governor's threats and the inevitability of their return, suggest the standoff is more of a temporary, symbolic victory. The likeliest outcome is that Republicans will eventually pass their gerrymandered maps.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a 14-day temporary restraining order, halting all construction at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention center in South Florida. The order was granted in response to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue that the project violates federal environmental laws by threatening sensitive wetlands and protected species without proper review. The pause applies to activities like paving, fencing, and excavation but does not affect detainees currently held at the facility. The ruling marks a temporary victory for opponents of the state-built detention center.</p>

Marc Nachmann, the global head of AWM, explained that this division offers more stable, fee-based income compared to the cyclical nature of dealmaking. The bank plans to accelerate growth by increasing its number of financial advisors, particularly in international markets, and by expanding its lending services to ultra-high-net-worth clients. This strategy aims to capture more market share in a fragmented sector and provide a less volatile complement to its core banking business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new EPA proposal aims to revoke a 2009 "endangerment finding" that provides the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. If passed, this would repeal strict emissions standards, easing the regulatory pressure on auto manufacturers to produce electric vehicles. Experts suggest this would give carmakers more flexibility to align their production of EVs and gas-powered vehicles with actual consumer demand, which has recently softened. While the auto industry has invested heavily in EVs, this policy shift could alter the long-term strategy for electrification in the U.S. market.</p>

Because sales of homegrown players count as 'pure profit' in financial accounts, these deals provide significant flexibility, helping to fund over £250 million in new signings this summer alone.
