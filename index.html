          <p>Johns Hopkins University professor Yuen Yuen Ang discusses the critical role of innovation in shaping the future for China, the United States, and the world. In an exclusive interview, she reflects on the historical context of US-China engagement, emphasizing the deep investment past leaders made in fostering mutual understanding. Ang suggests that a decline in American expertise on China could be detrimental. She advocates for a renewed focus on building a community of experts to navigate the complex, adaptive relationship between the two global powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a block on a Trump administration executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and temporary residents. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the order unconstitutional, aligning with a lower court's decision. This ruling keeps a nationwide injunction in place, preventing the policy's enforcement while setting the stage for a potential Supreme Court review. The case was brought by several states arguing against the creation of inconsistent citizenship laws across the country.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has stated her party must offer hope and fix problems, positioning herself as a leader in the mold of Argentine President Javier Milei. In an interview, she endorsed Milei's aggressive cost-cutting approach as a "template" for her own leadership, expressing concern over government debt and the state's expanding influence. Badenoch's comments come amid a recent shadow cabinet reshuffle and consistently low polling for the Conservative party. She aims to refocus the party's efforts on the economy and resist simply mirroring the policies of rival Reform UK.</p>

          <p>A growing crisis in student mental health is raising questions about the role and responsibility of UK universities. Students report feeling let down by "one-size-fits-all" support systems, while institutions struggle with rising demand and limited resources, stressing they are not replacements for clinical NHS services. The article explores the complexities of the issue, including the pressure on academic tutors, the difficulty of navigating support services, and the debate over a legal "duty of care." This comes as the number of students reporting mental health conditions has nearly quadrupled over the last decade.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, a highly unusual move that escalates his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This marks the first official presidential visit to the central bank in nearly two decades, challenging the traditional respect for its political independence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates and has even suggested he might try to fire the chairman. The visit is a significant symbolic act, bringing the political conflict directly to the institution responsible for managing the nation's monetary policy.</p>

Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, born from a factory accident, and the band's dark, horror-inspired themes set the template for the genre.

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers made a surprising admission after his debut at first base, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. Devers explained that playing on the field helps keep him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about his desire to exclusively handle DH duties. The comments came after a successful game where he had two hits in the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>

          <p>MLS Commissioner Don Garber has defended the league's policy banning political signage from stadiums, a rule that has drawn criticism from fan groups protesting federal immigration policies. Speaking before the All-Star game, Garber stated the policy is necessary to ensure games are safe and not inciteful for all attendees. While fan groups for teams in Los Angeles, Nashville, and other cities have used banners to protest ICE, Garber asserted that while individual teams can make statements, the league itself will not. The commissioner emphasized that the league's primary role is to provide a safe environment.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a House resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot nearly half a million barred owls in the Pacific Northwest. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved the culling to protect the threatened northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl. Proponents of the resolution, led by Rep. Troy E. Nehls, argue the plan is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money. However, some scientists and conservation groups warn that halting the culling will likely lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>

          <p>New research warns that many commercially available at-home health test kits can provide inaccurate and misleading results, posing potential risks to consumers. Two studies published in the British Medical Journal found that many kits, testing for conditions from bowel cancer to vitamin deficiencies, lack clear information on accuracy or next steps. Researchers at the University of Birmingham analyzed 30 kits and concluded that current regulations are insufficient to protect the public. Experts worry this could lead to false reassurance or place unnecessary pressure on the NHS.</p>

Proponents argue that eliminating the tax would improve the city's "anti-job climate," but it would also remove over $800 million in annual revenue from the city's budget. City officials immediately raised alarms, warning that such a drastic revenue loss would force devastating cuts to essential public services like police and fire departments.

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, beating expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly semiconductors, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While government spending also contributed, analysts remain cautious, suggesting the pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained due to softening global trade. The outlook may influence the Bank of Korea's future decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Other orders seek to expedite the permitting process for data center construction and promote the export of American AI technology.

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see U.S. shipments to those countries face no duties while imports will be subject to a 19% tariff. Analysts suggest these deals are an indirect tactic to contain China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to resources like rare earth minerals. However, the effectiveness of this strategy may be limited, as Chinese companies have been proactively localizing their production within Southeast Asian nations. This reduces their reliance on the transshipment routes that previous U.S. policies targeted.</p>
