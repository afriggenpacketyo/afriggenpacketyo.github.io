          <p>The final practice session of the Japanese Grand Prix was interrupted by trackside fires, causing concern for the race. Lando Norris led Oscar Piastri in a McLaren one-two, but the session was halted twice due to grass fires beside the Suzuka track. The FIA is focusing on dampening the grass before qualifying to mitigate the issue, believed to be caused by sparks from cars and dry grass. Marshals were seen filling buckets and traffic cones with water before pouring it on to the grass to try and prevent the fires.</p>

          <p>In Delta, Ohio, a town heavily supportive of Trump, residents welcome the president's tariffs despite the economic uncertainty they bring. Many believe the tariffs will create a fairer playing field and bring companies back to the US.

Residents express a willingness to endure potential price increases if it means supporting American workers, and some suggest the market dip presents a buying opportunity.&#x20;</p>

          <p>The Trump administration accidentally sent notices to some Ukrainian refugees stating their legal status in the US would be revoked, but later retracted the message, attributing it to an "error." Some Ukrainians who entered the US under the Biden administration's Uniting for Ukraine program received emails stating that their parole status was being terminated. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) later stated that the U4U program has not been terminated and retracted the email. While the Trump administration has not formally terminated the program, it has suspended admissions under the policy.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors are seeking a prison term of more than seven years for former congressman George Santos, who pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges. The US attorney argued that a significant sentence is warranted because Santos's crimes made a mockery of the election system. Santos admitted to deceiving voters, donors, and stealing identities to fund his campaign. Prosecutors claim Santos has been unrepentant and profited from his infamy since his expulsion from Congress.</p>
