          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have emerged as the primary winners, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. The tests, which assess major banks' resilience to hypothetical economic downturns, resulted in lower stress capital buffer requirements for both institutions. This easing of capital requirements is significant as it allows the banks to increase shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, and potentially expand lending and investment activities. The development is seen as part of a broader trend of regulatory easing under the Trump administration, boosting investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals significant disparities in how police forces across England and Wales handle coercive or controlling behaviour cases, a decade after it was criminalized. Victims report being compelled to gather their own evidence due to inadequate police responses, with some forces logging three times more offenses than others. This article highlights cases where victims compiled extensive documentation of abuse, yet faced delays, misplaced evidence, and a lack of understanding from law enforcement. This systemic failure has led to calls for radical change, as critics argue lives are being lost.</p>

A barrister for a victims' group stated that the phrase "generational slaughter," used by a civil servant, resonates with the experiences of thousands whose loved ones died in care facilities. The inquiry will investigate critical decisions, such as discharging hospital patients into care homes without testing and the use of "do not resuscitate" notices. Nearly 46,000 care home residents died with Covid in England and Wales, many in the pandemic's initial weeks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar is on course for its most significant first-half decline since 1973, having dropped over 10% against a basket of other major currencies. This sharp sell-off is attributed to investor concerns over the Trump administration's economic policies, including trade tariffs and a rising national debt, which are perceived as threatening the dollar's safe-haven status. The currency's slump has pushed it to its lowest level since March 2022.

          <p>With interest rates on savings products like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) declining from recent highs, savers are weighing their options against the stock market. Financial experts advise that the choice depends heavily on individual goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. CDs offer a guaranteed, safe return, making them suitable for short-term, specific goals where capital preservation is key. Conversely, the stock market presents higher potential for long-term growth, but with greater volatility and risk, making it more appropriate for goals like retirement that are decades away.

          <p>This opinion article argues that progressive legal organizations are making strategic errors by bringing high-risk cases to a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices. The author contends that recent losses on issues like transgender rights were predictable and that such litigation hands the conservative majority opportunities to codify its agenda into law. Instead of relying on federal courts, the article suggests progressives should shift their focus to building popular support and shaping constitutional culture through legislatures, ballot initiatives, and grassroots organizing.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order to ease U.S. sanctions on Syria, following the collapse of the Assad regime and the establishment of a transitional government. The new Syrian government has been advocating for sanctions relief to help rebuild the war-torn country, pay civil service salaries, and restore its healthcare system. This move aligns with efforts by U.S. allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations and invest in Syria.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from a group of Los Angeles landlords who sought financial compensation for losses incurred during the city's COVID-19 eviction moratorium. The landlords argued that the ban, which prevented them from removing non-paying tenants, constituted an unconstitutional taking of their private property. The court's decision, made without comment, leaves in place a 9th Circuit Court ruling that dismissed the suit, upholding the city's ability to implement such emergency public health measures. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented from the decision to deny the case.</p>

          <h2>Lending Experts Explain Differences Between HELOC and Home Equity Loan Interest Rates</h2>

          <p>As homeowners consider tapping into their home equity, experts are highlighting the key differences between home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans. While both currently offer lower interest rates than credit cards or personal loans, their rate structures are distinct. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's actions, making them unpredictable but potentially cheaper if rates fall. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates based on mortgage bond trading, offering stability and predictability for borrowers who want to lock in a rate. (not investment advice)</p>
