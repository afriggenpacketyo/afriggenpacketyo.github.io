          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has opened a new immigration detention facility, Camp 57, inside Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola. This facility aims to house over 400 undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes and is part of an agreement between the state and federal government. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem highlighted the facility's high security and its purpose in housing dangerous criminal illegal aliens, with detainees being transferred from other facilities across the country. Camp 57, renovated in about 30 days, includes a chapel and law library, and it is separated from the general prison population. The increased transfer of detainees between facilities has raised concerns among immigration advocates about access to loved ones and attorneys. </p>

          <p>Nidec Corp shares experienced a significant drop following the announcement of a probe into alleged improper accounting practices within its Chinese subsidiary, Nidec Techno Motor. An internal investigation revealed evidence suggesting the malpractice could involve the company and its group companies' management, prompting the creation of an independent third-party committee. This announcement follows a previous delay in submitting its financial report due to potentially erroneous declarations of country of origin for certain motors. Nidec, a major manufacturer of mini motors used in various devices, has operations in multiple countries and recently expanded its presence in China with the opening of the Nidec Qingdao Industrial Park. </p>

          <p>China's display of military strength at a parade marking the end of World War Two coincided with President Trump's reflections on China's role and trade policies. Trump's remarks mixed ambivalence, grievance, and concern, particularly regarding China's growing influence and its relationship with Russia and India. The parade, showcasing advanced weaponry, contrasted with Trump's nostalgic focus on America's past and his economic policies rooted in 19th-century mercantilism. Trump's trade actions, including tariffs, have led to shifts in global alignments, but face legal challenges in US courts, potentially dismantling his America-centric trade regime. </p>

          <p>A US federal court has overturned the Trump administration's funding cuts to Harvard University, ruling that the government violated the college's free speech rights. Judge Allison Burroughs blocked the administration from stopping federal funding, stating that the government used antisemitism as a smokescreen for an ideologically-motivated assault on premier universities. While acknowledging Harvard should have done more to address antisemitism, the judge emphasized that fighting antisemitism was not the administration's true aim. The White House vowed to appeal the decision, while Harvard's president affirmed the university's First Amendment and procedural rights. </p>

          <p>American Eagle's shares experienced a significant jump after the company reported strong sales driven by collaborations with celebrities Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. The company's second-quarter performance exceeded expectations, with executives forecasting further success from viral advertising campaigns. One particular ad featuring Sweeney sparked debate but also contributed to the rapid sell-out of her signature jeans. Despite facing challenges from tariffs, American Eagle is raising some prices and negotiating with suppliers to cut costs. </p>
