          <p>The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has temporarily banned U.S. trading firm Jane Street from its markets, accusing it of manipulative trading practices. The regulator has also frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains, claiming the firm artificially influenced the Nifty 50 index for profit. Jane Street allegedly built large stock positions to drive the index up before betting on its decline and selling off, a strategy SEBI deemed manipulative despite no specific rule breach. Jane Street disputes the findings and has stated its commitment to complying with all regional regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family vacation in the Bahamas turned tragic when a 42-year-old former Army Ranger was struck by a boat propeller while snorkeling near the shore. The man, Brent Slough, sustained severe injuries to his lower body and was airlifted to a hospital in Miami for intensive care. The small boat that hit him reportedly fled the scene, and his family is now seeking to find those responsible.

          <p>A mass shooting outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and fourteen others injured. The incident occurred when occupants of a vehicle fired into a crowd leaving an album release party for rapper Mello Buckzz. Police believe the attack was targeted, with some victims being part of the rapper's inner circle, and are preparing for potential retaliatory violence. The lounge has been temporarily shut down as the investigation continues to find the three suspected shooters.</p>

          <p>At a rally in Des Moines, President Trump celebrated the congressional passage of a massive legislative package he referred to as the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." He highlighted that the bill includes what he claims are the largest tax and spending cuts in American history, alongside significant investments in border security. Trump noted the bill passed without any Democratic support, which he plans to use as a talking point in upcoming midterm campaigns. The rally also served as a platform to preview other initiatives for the nation's 250th anniversary.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people missing. The blast occurred Tuesday evening, destroying several structures and sparking grass fires that burned approximately 80 acres. Officials have confirmed that the facility was operating as a commercial fireworks storage site without the required local licenses. The investigation is being led by Cal Fire with assistance from the ATF, as crews continue to manage the hazardous scene and search for the unaccounted-for individuals.</p>

          <p>Republican politician Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin faced backlash after sharing and then deleting a social media post that appeared to celebrate the negative impacts of a new tax bill. His post was a one-word "YES!" in response to a summary stating that 17 million people would lose healthcare and 3 million would lose food assistance. Van Orden later claimed the post was an error and that he intended to reply to a different statement. Critics viewed the incident as an unguarded, cruel reaction to the bill's painful consequences for millions of Americans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent staffing cuts at the National Park Service (NPS) are raising significant safety concerns as the summer visitor season peaks. At locations like Assateague Island National Seashore, the lack of lifeguards is a primary worry, a direct result of a hiring freeze and layoffs enacted by the Trump administration. An analysis by the National Parks Conservation Association found the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff since January, with thousands of seasonal positions remaining unfilled. This shortage of personnel not only affects visitor safety but also the overall maintenance and protection of the parks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Trump administration's signature legislative package, a massive bill that enacts major tax and spending cuts while boosting defense and immigration enforcement funding.

The passage came after a marathon session where Republican leadership worked to overcome internal opposition.
