          <p>Authorities in three Indian states have prohibited the sale of Coldrif cough syrup after it was linked to the deaths of at least nine children. The Indian Health Ministry confirmed that samples of the syrup, produced by Sresan Pharma, contained toxic levels of diethylene glycol (DEG), a dangerous industrial solvent. This incident has intensified scrutiny of India's large pharmaceutical industry, which has faced previous international warnings from the World Health Organization over contaminated medicines. India is a major global supplier of generic drugs, accounting for 20% of the world's supply.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a significant overnight missile and drone assault on western Ukraine, primarily targeting the city of Lviv and energy infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, causing power outages for over 73,000 people. In response to the proximity of the attacks, neighboring NATO member Poland scrambled its fighter jets to secure its airspace, placing its military on high alert. The strikes resulted in at least one death and nine injuries in Zaporizhzhia. This escalation follows recent comments from a US official supporting Ukrainian strikes deep within Russian territory, while Russia reported downing 32 Ukrainian drones overnight.</p>

He highlights an Amnesty International investigation into the US government's use of AI surveillance technology to monitor non-citizen students and immigrants, which he believes targeted him.

          <p>In the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus, a crucial piece of evidence—a maroon minivan believed to be the primary crime scene—was mistakenly destroyed. Police determined the killer used the van to abduct Fandrich before staging his body in his own car. The suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, allegedly had a history of stalking the victim. By the time investigators traced the abandoned minivan to a scrapyard, it had already been crushed, a significant setback for the prosecution's forensic case against Milner.</p>

          <p>Four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone significant transformation, though not without challenges. The club has modernized its training facilities, won a major domestic trophy, and qualified for the Champions League, driven by manager Eddie Howe. However, growth has been tempered by Profit and Sustainability Rules, preventing unlimited spending and forcing a more gradual build compared to previous takeovers like Manchester City's. The article also touches on the ongoing "sportswashing" criticism from human rights groups, who argue the investment is meant to distract from Saudi Arabia's human rights record.</p>

This "soft power" initiative aims to present a more accessible and positive view of the country, bypassing typical news coverage.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's approach to Latin America is erratic and lacks a coherent strategy, characterized by bullying and impetuous actions. The author points to the military buildup around Venezuela and threats against drug cartels as examples of a regressive policy that emulates 19th-century US interventionism. Instead of achieving US goals, these actions are said to be counterproductive, spurring regional backlash and potentially strengthening authoritarian leaders like Nicolás Maduro. The piece suggests that this approach ultimately undermines US influence while creating opportunities for rivals like China to expand their presence in the region.</p>

          <p>Despite recent sales growth, the United States is lagging behind China and Europe in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). While EV sales in the US have increased, they still represent a much smaller market share compared to other major economies. Analysts attribute this slower adoption to weaker government support, the recent expiration of a significant $7,500 tax credit, and the absence of affordable Chinese EV brands due to high tariffs. With the key subsidy now gone, automakers like Ford and GM are anticipating a sharp decline in EV demand, further widening the gap.</p>

After falling behind 3-0 early in a hostile road environment, the Dodgers remained composed. Pitcher Shohei Ohtani settled down to prevent further damage over six innings, while the offense chipped away at the lead. The decisive moment came in the seventh inning when Teoscar Hernández hit a go-ahead three-run home run, silencing the home crowd and giving the Dodgers a crucial series-opening victory.</p>

          <p>After decades in business, the pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced it is closing all of its locations. The company posted a notice on its website confirming the closures and thanking customers for their support. This follows two bankruptcy filings in the past two years, the most recent in May, as the company struggled with debt, declining sales, and litigation related to the opioid crisis. Since October 2023, Rite Aid had already closed over 520 stores, and this final step marks the end of the road for the long-standing American retailer.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated he hopes to announce the release of all hostages from Gaza in the coming days, sending a delegation to Egypt to finalize details. This development follows a statement from Hamas indicating its acceptance of key parts of a peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, including a hostage-for-prisoner exchange. In response, Israel is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan and has reportedly reduced military operations. While Hamas's response is seen as positive, details regarding a full Israeli withdrawal and disarmament remain subject to further negotiation.</p>
