          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly invested over $100 million in various bonds since taking office, as disclosed in recent financial filings to the Office of Government Ethics. These documents, made public on Tuesday, detail 690 transactions, including significant purchases of debt issued by local authorities, gas districts, hospital authorities, and school boards across the U.S. Additionally, Trump acquired bonds from major American corporations such as T-Mobile, United Health, Home Depot, and Meta. This substantial bond-buying spree, which has contributed to a significant increase in his net worth, highlights his continued engagement in financial markets while in public office, with some invested companies directly impacted by his policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida farmers are drastically reducing crop production, with some cutting output by up to 65%, due to severe labor shortages driven by fears of President Trump's intensified immigration policies. Migrant workers, who form a crucial part of the agricultural workforce, are either leaving the state or going into hiding to avoid mass detentions and deportations. Farmers report difficulties in affording legal H2A visa workers, exacerbating the crisis despite the president's earlier acknowledgement of farmers' struggles. Economists warn that this ongoing deportation campaign will significantly harm the U.S. economy, particularly sectors reliant on migrant labor, raising concerns about food security and domestic supply.</p>

          <p>A decision regarding whether Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the rap group Kneecap, will stand trial on a terror charge has been postponed until September 26. The 27-year-old, known as Mo Chara, is accused of displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a London concert last year, a charge he vehemently denies, calling it 'political' and an attempt to silence his group. Surrounded by supporters waving Palestinian flags outside Westminster Magistrates' Court, Ó hAnnaidh asserted the case was a 'distraction' from events in Gaza. His defense team sought to dismiss the case due to a technical error concerning the Attorney General's permission for the charge.</p>

          <p>Lowe's surpassed Wall Street's earnings forecasts in its latest fiscal quarter, driven by increased demand for home projects, though larger-scale renovations remained subdued. The home improvement retailer announced an $8.8 billion acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, a major distributor for large residential and commercial professionals, signaling a strategic shift towards this more stable customer segment. CEO Marvin Ellison highlighted a 'healthy pipeline of demand' from an aging housing stock and pent-up renovation needs, expressing confidence that these investments will accelerate sales growth as the market improves. Despite a slight revision to full-year earnings guidance, Lowe's shares rose, contrasting with competitor Home Depot's recent performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Target's shares dropped approximately 9% despite the retailer surpassing Wall Street's earnings and sales expectations for the fiscal second quarter, largely due to the announcement of a new CEO and continued sales and traffic declines. Michael Fiddelke, the current Chief Operating Officer, will succeed Brian Cornell in February, outlining priorities to re-establish Target's reputation for unique items, improve customer experience, and enhance technology use. The company reaffirmed its full-year forecast, anticipating a low single-digit percentage sales decline. Challenges include stagnant annual sales, falling store traffic, and recent customer backlash over DEI initiatives and the termination of its Ulta Beauty partnership, signaling a complex path to recovery.

          <p>Target's CEO, Brian Cornell, is stepping down next year, to be replaced by COO Michael Fiddelke, as the retail giant grapples with persistent weak sales and significant customer boycotts. The company's struggles intensified after it scaled back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, leading to backlash from conservative activists and, subsequently, a boycott from many Black Americans and other consumer groups. Sales in the first quarter of 2025 fell more than expected, with comparable sales declining in eight of the last ten quarters. This leadership change comes as Target aims to revitalize its brand amidst a challenging retail landscape and public relations issues.</p>

Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who announced the plan, hailed the approval as 'historic,' framing it as a defiant response to Western countries considering recognition of a Palestinian state.

The victims were part of a large-scale deportation operation from Iran, initiated after the Israel-Iran 12-day conflict in June, forcing thousands of Afghans to return under dire circumstances. The Taliban has since arrested the head of the transportation company involved, halting its operations pending a government investigation into one of Afghanistan's deadliest traffic accidents in recent years.</p>

          <p>UK inflation, measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 3.8% in the year to July, its highest level since January 2024 and still significantly above the Bank of England's 2% target. The increase was primarily driven by a substantial jump in air fares, likely due to the timing of school holidays, and a fourth consecutive monthly rise in food prices, including beef, chocolate, and instant coffee. This higher-than-expected inflation strengthens economists' predictions that the Bank of England will slow the pace of interest rate cuts. Rising food and fuel costs are notably straining household finances, as reported by consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of August 20, 2025, average mortgage rates stand at 6.64% for a 30-year fixed loan and 5.82% for a 15-year fixed loan, according to Bankrate, while refinance rates are slightly higher. Despite elevated rates compared to previous years, new homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still secure favorable terms, especially with strong credit profiles. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Fed rate hikes could stabilize mortgage rates. To secure the best rates, borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit, shop around for different lenders, and carefully compare loan terms and fees before locking in a rate.

          <p>India is actively strengthening its diplomatic and economic ties with China and Russia, a move that comes amidst growing friction with the U.S. over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed 'steady progress' in relations with China after meeting Foreign Minister Wang Yi, agreeing to resume direct flights and boost trade. Concurrently, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited Moscow, where Russian officials confirmed continued oil supplies and a planned meeting between Putin and Modi. Experts view India's strategy as an effort to balance diverse partnerships and maintain strategic autonomy, rather than solely a response to U.S. actions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners can find affordable borrowing options through home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), with average interest rates currently around 8.12% for HELOCs and slightly higher for fixed-rate home equity loans. These rates are significantly lower than personal loans or credit cards, making them attractive for large sums. Home equity loans offer a lump sum with fixed rates, while HELOCs provide a revolving line of credit with variable rates. Both products offer potential tax benefits if used for IRS-eligible home improvements. Homeowners should compare lenders and understand the risks, as their home serves as collateral.

          <p>As of August 20, 2025, Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates offer competitive returns, with top rates significantly exceeding the national average and current inflation rates.

These accounts provide a safe investment vehicle, typically insured by FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000, allowing savers to lock in high rates for a specified term.

          <p>As of August 14, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,357.88 per ounce, reflecting its continued appeal as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge.

Global economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rate movements also play significant roles; gold often becomes more attractive when interest rates are low or during economic uncertainty.
