          <p>Despite showing little interest in peace talks with Ukraine, Russia's war-focused economy is facing increasing economic and military pressures. According to Jack Watling, Russian stockpiles of military equipment are dwindling, and further offensives into 2026 would require politically and economically challenging forced mobilization. The Russian economy is slowing due to international sanctions, rampant inflation, and high production costs. Tighter sanctions on Russia's "shadow fleet" and declining oil prices are also hurting Russia, potentially leading Moscow to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>Official figures indicate that UK government borrowing was higher than expected in April, reaching Â£20.2 billion, a Â£1 billion increase from the previous year. This figure surpasses analysts' predictions of Â£17.9 billion. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), this is the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993. The increase in borrowing reflects the difference between government spending and tax income during the month.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000 before slightly retracting. According to James Butterfill, this surge is driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional buyers. The price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. (not investment advice)</p>

From 2006 to 2020, climate change was linked to approximately 15,000 deaths from exposure to fine particulate matter from wildfires, costing around $160 billion. Researchers focused on deaths linked to PM2.5 exposure, which can cause short-term irritation and long-term chronic health issues.

          <p>Chronic water shortages in Gaza are worsening due to Israel's expanding military offensive and fuel shortages affecting desalination and hygiene plants. The UN warns that without immediate fuel deliveries, water and sanitation facilities could shut down. Israel cut off power lines to main desalination plants in March, exacerbating the crisis. Parents report their children are accustomed to drinking salty water, leading to health issues. The situation is further complicated by new waves of displacement, making water distribution even more challenging.</p>

          <p>Thursday's newspaper front pages are dominated by Keir Starmer's "U-turn" on winter fuel payments and Donald Trump's "ambush" of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. The Times reports pensioners must wait over a year for payments to be reinstated, while Trump confronted Ramaphosa with a video alleging white farmers were being murdered. The Financial Times highlights Labour MPs pressuring Starmer after local election defeats, and the Guardian focuses on the government's attempt to head off a backbench rebellion over welfare cuts.</p>

A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. The quake could sink coastal land and trigger waves reaching extreme heights. Unlike gradual climate events, this earthquake would happen quickly, leaving little time for adaptation.</p>
