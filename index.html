          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 07:51:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk experienced a significant drop in its stock price after announcing a new CEO and reducing its full-year financial guidance. The company lowered its sales growth forecast, primarily due to weaker-than-expected U.S. sales for its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, and diabetes treatment, Ozempic. Persistent competition from compounded drugs and a slower market expansion were cited as key factors for the revised outlook. This adjustment follows a previous downgrade in May, signaling ongoing challenges for the company in the competitive U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing has significantly reduced its quarterly losses and reported a 35% increase in revenue, driven by the highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. The aerospace company's adjusted loss per share was better than analysts expected, and it burned through considerably less cash compared to the previous year. CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed optimism, calling 2025 a potential "turnaround year" if the company maintains its focus on safety and stability. Despite these positive signs, challenges remain, including delays in certifying new 737 Max models and potential labor strikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Iona has strengthened into a Category 3 storm while moving through the central Pacific Ocean, with maximum sustained winds reaching 115 mph. The storm is located several hundred miles south-southeast of Honolulu, Hawaii, but currently poses no immediate threat to the islands, and no coastal warnings are in effect. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect Iona to continue moving westward and undergo some additional strengthening before beginning to weaken. This marks the first named storm of the season in the central Pacific, which is also being monitored for Tropical Storm Keli.</p>

          <p>Consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations. However, the company issued a cautious outlook for its 2026 fiscal year, forecasting a potential $1 billion negative impact from increased costs associated with tariffs. CEO Jon Moeller highlighted the company's resilience in a difficult economic environment, just a day before announcing his transition to executive chairman. The guidance reflects anticipated headwinds from tariffs, commodity costs, and other financial pressures, which has been a point of concern for analysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>PayPal reported second-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations and raised its full-year guidance for both earnings per share and transaction margin dollars. The positive report was driven by accelerating growth in its Venmo platform, which saw revenue increase by over 20%, and a 12% rise in total payment volume. Despite the strong performance and improved outlook, which implies a robust fourth quarter, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in after-hours trading.

          <p>A former senior official from Israel's Shin Bet security agency, Yossi Amrusi, has proposed a bold two-pronged strategy to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. He suggests Israel should first cease current negotiation tactics and then simultaneously work to separate Gazan civilians from Hamas through humanitarian zones while conducting localized negotiations directly with those holding the hostages, offering them money and their lives in exchange. Amrusi argues that prolonged, centralized negotiations benefit Hamas and that it is unclear if the group's leadership can even make or enforce a deal. This proposal comes as U.S. and Israeli negotiating teams have paused talks in Doha.</p>

Originally known for his "Twitter Philanthropy" and involvement in meme stocks, Pulte has used his position to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and has referred Democratic Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James for prosecution. Supported publicly by President Trump, Pulte's actions represent an unusual and highly politicized use of the FHFA, an agency typically focused on overseeing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The truce was mediated by Malaysia, the current chair of ASEAN, but was quickly tested by reports of violations from the Thai army, which Cambodia denied. Analysts suggest the ceasefire may hold as both nations have achieved certain political objectives, including weakening the Thaksin dynasty in Thailand and strengthening the Hun family's rule in Cambodia. The involvement of U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened trade tariff delays, is also seen as a key factor in bringing the parties to an agreement.</p>

          <p>As UCLA football begins its training camp, the program faces several critical questions under second-year coach DeShaun Foster, who has boldly guaranteed that fan attendance at the Rose Bowl will significantly increase this season. A central focus is on new quarterback Nico Iamaleava, a high-profile transfer from Tennessee, and how quickly he can master the new pro-style offense. The team must also address its struggling offensive line, which has adopted a "Something To Prove" motto, and replace key defensive players lost to the NFL draft. The team's move to an off-campus training camp in Costa Mesa aims to foster chemistry among many new players.</p>

          <p>The leading international monitor on food crises has warned that the "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip," urging immediate action to prevent widespread death. This alert comes as the Netherlands has declared two of Israel's far-right ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, personae non gratae. The Dutch government cited their repeated incitement of violence and calls for ethnic cleansing in Gaza as the reason for the measure. Meanwhile, Israel's Foreign Minister rejected international pressure for a ceasefire, stating it would be a "tragedy" to stop before Hamas is removed from power.</p>

This hiring binge is causing a brain drain from smaller AI startups, which are struggling to retain their key engineers. Meta, in particular, has been actively luring talent, reportedly offering lucrative deals and recently bringing on Scale AI's CEO to lead its new superintelligence division.

While often harmless, these bugs can cause serious bloodstream infections.

          <p>A conflict is emerging within the Trump administration between the goals of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) movement and the actions of the EPA under administrator Lee Zeldin. While Kennedy's HHS has identified pesticides and other chemicals as health risks, the EPA has been dismantling regulations on these same substances, including atrazine, glyphosate, and PFAS 'forever chemicals'. This contradiction is drawing criticism from MAHA supporters, who are urging Kennedy to challenge the EPA's pro-industry agenda. The situation highlights a fundamental split, with one agency focused on public health and the other prioritizing deregulation for corporate interests.</p>

The transit of China's most advanced combat aircraft through this strategic chokepoint, which connects the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan, was notably not reported by either Tokyo or Seoul. The report, which featured footage of the J-20, suggests a potential stealth capability demonstration by the People's Liberation Army Air Force.

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed blanket tariffs, set to begin August 1, are likely to increase the prices of certain imported foods for American consumers, according to a Tax Foundation analysis. While intended to boost demand for domestic products, the policy will affect items like Brazilian coffee and bananas, which the U.S. does not produce in sufficient quantities to meet demand. The analysis identifies liqueurs, baked goods, coffee, fish, and beer as the top imports that could face significant price hikes. Another study from Yale estimates the tariffs could raise overall food costs by 3.4% in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>
