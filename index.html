          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to discuss trade issues, marking the first high-level meeting since the US increased tariffs on Chinese goods. The article suggests expectations for a breakthrough are low, but the fact that talks are occurring has raised hopes of de-escalation. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the negotiations due to fears that the trade war could lead to slower growth and higher prices globally. Both countries have economic interests in de-escalating trade hostilities, but a lasting resolution remains uncertain, though the talks themselves are a significant step forward.</p>

          <p>China has imposed export controls on rare earth elements, crucial for manufacturing military and space technology, in response to increased US tariffs. This action has raised concerns within the US defense industry, as these elements are essential for producing jet engines, radar, and avionics. The export restrictions, which target seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, took effect after the US imposed tariffs totaling 145 percent on Chinese imports. The article highlights the potential vulnerability of US weapons systems due to China's dominance in the global supply of these critical minerals.</p>

          <p>The family of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, who was deported to Honduras with her mother, has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration. The family's attorney stated they are taking time to consider all options, prioritizing the safety and well-being of their children. A federal judge previously expressed suspicion that the administration deported the child without due process. The Department of Justice argued it was in the child's best interest to remain in her mother's custody, but the family decided to reassess their legal strategy.</p>

This marked Alvarado's second violation within 180 days, leading to a doubled fine under the escalating penalty structure.

President Trump has hinted at lowering tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its "unilateral" tariffs first. Experts doubt the meeting will yield substantial results, but even a minor tariff reduction would signal positive intent.</p>

The leaders warned that "new and massive" sanctions will be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire "in the air, at sea and on land".
