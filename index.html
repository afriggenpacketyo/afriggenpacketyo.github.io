          <h2>Trump Coins' Claims of Soaring Gold Prices Linked to His Popularity Debunked by Experts</h2>

          <p>Trump Coins, a venture by Donald Trump, attributes rising gold prices to his return to the spotlight, citing confidence in U.S. leadership. However, experts argue that this surge is due to financial uncertainty caused by Trump's economic policies, such as widespread tariffs. They emphasize that gold typically rises during economic turmoil, like trade wars or anticipated inflation, and suggest rising gold prices indicate displeasure with Trump's policies. The coins retail for a thousand dollars more than the price of an ounce of gold at the time, and experts suggest that ETFs are a better investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Polson, Montana, and communities nationwide, individuals accused of crimes but in need of mental health care are often confined in small jail cells due to a lack of adequate mental health services. These prisoners, some held for months, await openings at the Montana State Hospital, highlighting a systemic failure to provide crisis care. The Lake County jail's isolation cells exemplify this issue, with inmates held in limbo, neither convicted nor stable enough for release. The situation reflects a broader crisis where jails become de facto mental health institutions, underscoring the urgent need for improved mental health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A massive brood of periodical cicadas, known as Brood XIV, is anticipated to emerge across the eastern United States in the spring of 2025. These insects, characterized by their buzzing swarms, are expected to appear primarily in Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller populations in East Coast states. Periodical cicadas emerge in unison every 17 years, and the timing of their emergence is linked to soil temperature. Their life cycle involves spending years underground as larvae before emerging to mate and lay eggs, which then hatch and burrow back underground.</p>

Nichols suggests practical ways to bridge this gap, such as co-generational service, shared housing arrangements, and university-based retirement communities. These connections can provide valuable support, mentorship, and a sense of belonging for individuals of all ages.</p>

Despite claims of identifying significant waste, fraud, and abuse, DOGE's savings goals have been repeatedly downgraded, and many initiatives have been reversed or delayed. Concerns have arisen regarding DOGE's access to sensitive government data, with allegations of data-sharing violations and the potential creation of dossiers on citizens.

Experts recommend strategies such as grieving job loss, constructing a new identity, finding side hustles, and embracing uncertainty.

          <p>Retirees residing in nine states face the risk of having a portion of their Social Security benefits taxed by their state governments, potentially reducing their income by almost 10%. The specific tax policies vary by state, with some offering exemptions based on adjusted gross income while others tax any Social Security income included in federal taxes. States such as Colorado, Connecticut, and Minnesota provide income-based exemptions, while Montana, Utah, and Vermont have different approaches. Experts advise consulting tax professionals and considering factors beyond taxes when choosing a retirement location.</p>

In the first quarter of 2025, marriage registrations decreased by 8% compared to the same period last year, while divorce registrations increased by 10%. To address this trend, China has streamlined marriage registration rules, allowing couples to register without returning to their place of household residency. However, experts believe the effect may be limited, and the country's low birth rates and shrinking population pose challenges for its economy.</p>

According to Alfred Kammer, director of the European department at the IMF, tariffs and trade tensions are weighing on the outlook more than the positive effects of fiscal measures. Germany's infrastructure spending bill, which unlocked higher defense spending and created a substantial infrastructure and climate fund, will provide some offset to the tariff drag.</p>
