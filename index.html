          <p>Reports in The Wall Street Journal suggested Shell was in preliminary discussions to acquire BP, causing BP shares to surge over 10%.  Shell promptly denied these reports, leading to a partial retraction in BP's stock price increase.  Analysts believe a potential deal would likely involve BP being divided and sold in parts rather than a complete acquisition. This reflects BP's underperformance compared to Shell and other US oil companies in recent years.</p>
