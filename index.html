          <p>McCormick CEO Brendan Foley stated the company is actively assessing and mitigating the impact of new tariffs on its agricultural supply chain. Although 90% of its products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, many key ingredients like black pepper are sourced internationally from various global markets. Foley noted that consumer demand for flavor remains strong despite economic pressures, and the company's stock rose over 5% following a positive earnings report.

          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled by a beach umbrella pole. The incident occurred when a strong gust of wind dislodged the umbrella from her stand, causing her to fall and land on the pole, which pierced her armpit. Remarkably, the pole missed all major arteries, nerves, and tendons by a narrow margin. The lifeguard, identified only as Alex, remained calm throughout the ordeal and expressed gratitude to her fellow lifeguards and paramedics.</p>

          <p>Nike announced it anticipates a $1 billion incremental cost in the current fiscal year due to new tariffs, a significant challenge to its ongoing business turnaround. While the company's fourth-quarter earnings beat low expectations, profits were down 86% as it cleared old inventory and shifted its sales strategy. To mitigate the tariff impact, Nike plans to further reduce its manufacturing in China, adjust its supply chain, and implement price increases. CEO Elliott Hill stated that while recent results are below Nike's standard, he expects business to improve moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct images of an exoplanet, a significant milestone since its 2021 launch. The planet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn and orbits a young star approximately 50 times farther than Earth is from the sun. Scientists used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph to block the star's glare and reveal the faint planet. While a small possibility of it being a background galaxy exists, researchers state the evidence strongly indicates it is a newly discovered planet.</p>

While President Trump claims the program was "obliterated," intelligence assessments vary. The deeply buried Fordo enrichment site was targeted with powerful bunker-busting bombs, with officials claiming it is now inoperable. Other sites like Natanz and Isfahan also sustained severe damage to surface structures, but underground components may be intact. A significant concern is the unknown location of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, which may have been moved before the attacks.</p>

          <p>A coalition of environmental organizations, cities, and tribes has filed a first-of-its-kind class-action lawsuit against the EPA and its administrator, Lee Zeldin. The suit seeks to restore approximately $3 billion in environmental and climate justice grants that were abruptly terminated by the Trump administration. The plaintiffs, including Air Alliance Houston, argue that the cancellation of their legally awarded contracts was unconstitutional and done without cause. This legal strategy aims to provide broad relief for all 350 affected grant recipients, many of whom are small nonprofits without the resources for individual legal battles.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, experts discussed the growing potential for China's yuan to challenge the U.S. dollar's status as the global reserve currency. Diana Choyleva of the Asia Society Policy Institute argued that U.S. policies, such as sweeping tariffs, are diminishing the dollar's role. She suggested that China is actively working to create a separate financial sphere centered on the yuan. Factors like the rise of digital currencies and a reluctance by other nations to depend solely on the U.S. are contributing to the increasing threat to the dollar's long-held dominance.

Following pressure from over 100 Labour backbenchers, the government is expected to agree that planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) will only affect future claimants, not existing ones. Additionally, a Â£1 billion support plan will likely be fast-tracked.
