          <p>China is at risk of deeper deflation as it redirects exports, initially destined for the U.S., towards its domestic market due to high tariffs. This shift is causing a price war among Chinese firms, eroding profitability and potentially impacting employment. The article explains that local governments and e-commerce giants are supporting this redirection, but the influx of discounted goods could further weaken consumer demand and exacerbate deflationary pressures. CPI and PPI figures already indicate a downward trend, suggesting a challenging economic outlook for China. (not investment advice)</p>
