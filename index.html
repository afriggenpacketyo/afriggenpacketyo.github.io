          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has labeled Reform UK's proposal to eliminate indefinite leave to remain for migrants as both "racist" and "immoral." The policy, championed by Nigel Farage, would require legally resident migrants to reapply for visas under stricter rules, potentially leading to deportations. Starmer clarified that he believes many Reform UK supporters are not racist but are frustrated with the Conservative government's failures over the past 14 years. He argued that removing lawfully present individuals, who are neighbors and contributors to the economy, would tear the country apart.</p>

          <p>The British government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan to support Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and its suppliers following a prolonged production shutdown caused by a cyber-attack. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has forced the car manufacturer to halt operations, costing the company an estimated £50 million per week and threatening the stability of its supply chain. This financial support, provided through the Export Development Guarantee, is intended to protect thousands of jobs and ensure suppliers can weather the disruption until production resumes.</p>

His legacy is now carried on by Angel “Angel Baby” Rodriguez, who hosts “The Art Laboe Love Zone,” a tribute broadcast that continues the tradition of playing oldies and reading dedications.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new memoir by King Charles III's former butler, Grant Harrold, recounts the famously blunt and often profane nature of the late Prince Philip. The book describes an incident at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding where Philip was overheard saying, "Thank f--- that’s over." Harrold explains that this type of unfiltered commentary was characteristic of the Duke of Edinburgh, who was known for not suffering fools and speaking his mind, a trait that both intimidated some palace staff and was appreciated by others for its authenticity. This straightforwardness was a consistent part of his public and private persona.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Engineering University have created the first laboratory system capable of simulating the effects of three successive high-yield nuclear detonations on a single, deeply buried target. Led by associate professor Xu Xiaohui, the project addresses the challenge of destroying hardened underground facilities that can withstand powerful conventional weapons. This development allows for the study of complex underground shockwave interactions from multiple nuclear strikes.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is deciding the fate of two bills aimed at making AI chatbots safer for children, facing strong opposition from major tech companies who argue the regulations would stifle innovation. The bills, AB 1064 and SB 243, seek to prevent chatbots from generating harmful content like self-harm encouragement and require notifications that the chatbot is not human. The legislation is supported by parent advocates and the state's attorney general, who are concerned about the mental health risks posed to minors. Newsom's decision is complicated by the tech industry's economic importance to the state.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris's recently published campaign memoir, "107 Days," is generating criticism and straining relationships within the Democratic party. The book includes mild critiques of President Biden and details her frustrations, which has irked some party loyalists. Harris also recounts her interactions with potential 2028 rivals, such as her complicated relationship with California Governor Gavin Newsom and her assessment of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. By airing these grievances and perspectives, the memoir is seen by some as burning bridges and potentially complicating any future presidential ambitions.</p>

          <p>Despite being illegal since the early 2000s, the sale of acitrón, a candied product made from the endangered biznaga barrel cactus, continues openly in Mexico City markets. The cactus is harvested from the wild to be used in traditional dishes like chiles en nogada, especially for Independence Day celebrations. Biologists warn that the slow growth rate of the biznaga makes it vulnerable to extinction from overexploitation, as farming it is not commercially viable. Some chefs are now substituting it with other candied plants to protect the species, but cultural traditions and customer demand keep the illegal trade alive.</p>

This trend of co-buying, particularly popular among younger generations, allows individuals to pool their financial resources to overcome significant affordability challenges. For single buyers, partnering with another person can quadruple the number of affordable listings in the market. While the strategy offers a path to homeownership, it also requires careful legal planning to address potential future complications, such as one party wanting to sell.</p>

          <p>Despite some bipartisan support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Congressional Republicans are deferring to President Trump before negotiating a permanent legislative solution. Created in 2012, DACA protects around half a million individuals brought to the U.S. illegally as children from deportation. While Trump has expressed some openness to a deal, his administration's primary focus remains on a large-scale deportation effort. The coalition of Republicans supporting DACA has diminished over the years, and key senators believe border enforcement must be prioritized before any legalization measures can be considered.</p>

          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, will vote in a referendum on a proposal to significantly restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to combat noise and dust pollution. If passed, the measure would completely ban gas-powered models and permit the use of electric devices only between October and December, with special exceptions. Supporters advocate for the change to protect public health and microorganisms, suggesting rakes as an alternative. Opponents argue the ban is an example of an overly restrictive culture that would create unnecessary difficulties for residents and maintenance workers.</p>

          <p>A shooter on a boat opened fire on a crowded outdoor bar in Southport, North Carolina, killing three people and injuring eight others. The incident occurred at the American Fish Company when an individual on a vessel in the Cape Fear River began shooting at the venue before proceeding up the Intracoastal Waterway. The U.S. Coast Guard later detained a suspect matching the shooter's description at a nearby boat ramp. The suspect is now in police custody for questioning as the investigation, assisted by the State Bureau of Investigation, continues.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he stabbed in the neck while she slept. Elliott, who was 17 at the time, called 911 immediately after the incident, claiming he thought he was dreaming and has since maintained he was sleepwalking. Investigators found no motive or history of conflict between the closely-bonded twins. A sleep disorder expert testified for the defense, concluding that Elliott's actions were involuntary, citing a family history of sleepwalking and the results of two sleep studies.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified 12 potential locations, with sites in Bedfordshire, Leeds, and north London being the most promising. The plan aims to address the housing crisis and stimulate economic growth, drawing inspiration from the post-WWII new town developments. The government will confirm the final locations and funding next spring, with a goal for at least 40% of the new homes to be affordable.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that 79% of companies expect to incur an "AI debt" due to the hasty and improper implementation of artificial intelligence tools. This debt represents the costs associated with fixing security risks, poor data quality, and ineffective AI agents, which can lead to wasted time, financial losses, and employee burnout. Despite a surge in AI adoption, many organizations lack the necessary infrastructure, training, and clear use cases for the technology. Experts advise a more thoughtful approach, including piloting and sandboxing AI systems before full integration to avoid these costly future problems.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa application fees could inadvertently boost the technology sectors in the Middle East. Gulf nations like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are actively working to become global AI hubs, offering high compensation, tax incentives, and long-term visas to attract skilled professionals. As the U.S. potentially becomes less accessible for foreign talent, these countries are positioning themselves as attractive alternatives for tech experts. This shift could alter the global distribution of top tech talent and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The reimposition of UN "snapback" sanctions on Iran is intensifying economic pressures on its citizens, who are already facing record-low currency values and soaring food prices. The sanctions freeze Iranian assets, halt arms deals, and penalize its missile program, compounding the economic fallout from a recent military conflict with Israel. Many Iranians are struggling to afford basic staples like meat and rice, leading to widespread anxiety about the future. The renewed sanctions and regional tensions are also fueling fears of increased government repression within the country.</p>

          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team and hiring a new set-piece specialist, Newcastle United has struggled to score from dead-ball situations this season. The team, featuring several tall players, has only converted one goal from a corner or free-kick, a stark contrast to their upcoming opponent, Arsenal, who have scored half their goals from set-pieces. Head coach Eddie Howe has acknowledged the issue, stating that something is "not quite clicking" and that he is ultimately responsible for improving performance. The article explores the team's strategic shifts, including an increased use of long throws.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the Trump administration's recent claims about the causes of autism and its push for a "cure," arguing that such a perspective is deeply problematic. The author contrasts the administration's negative framing with the positive traits often associated with autism, such as an intense capacity for focus, adherence to facts, and a strong sense of empathy and social justice. The article suggests that autistic individuals possess qualities like honesty and the ability to find pure joy, which stand in stark contrast to the behaviors exhibited by political figures who promote misinformation and lack empathy.</p>
