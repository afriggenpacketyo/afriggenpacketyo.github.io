          <p>Firefighters responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, were ambushed by a shooter from the woods.

          <p>Following a recent fatal crash involving an Air India 787 Dreamliner, the aircraft's safety record is under renewed examination. Despite carrying over a billion passengers without a major incident for nearly 15 years, the Dreamliner program has been plagued by production issues and whistleblower allegations of compromised safety standards. Former employees have raised concerns about defective parts and improper assembly, claims Boeing has consistently denied. While some analysts maintain the aircraft's overall safety record is strong, the crash has brought these long-standing quality control issues back into the public spotlight.</p>

The game was a tribute to Parker, who won championships with both franchises and is only the third player to have her jersey retired by the Sparks.

          <p>Warren Schaeffer, the interim manager for the Colorado Rockies, was ejected for the first time in his career during a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. Schaeffer vehemently argued a strike-three call made against outfielder Tyler Freeman, leading to a heated confrontation with home plate umpire Ramon De Jesus. After being tossed, Schaeffer dramatically drew a line in the dirt to show where he believed the pitch was.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has started debating a major Republican legislative package that includes significant tax cuts and spending changes. A new analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade and cause 11.8 million Americans to lose health insurance coverage. Democrats are highlighting these figures to oppose the legislation, while Republican leaders work to secure enough votes for passage ahead of a self-imposed July 4th deadline. The bill's high cost and deep cuts to social programs have created divisions within the Republican party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have arrested numerous young women for writing and publishing gay erotic fiction, known as "danmei," on a Taiwan-based platform called Haitang. At least 30 writers have been arrested since February for allegedly violating China's strict anti-pornography laws, which are applied more stringently to homosexual content than heterosexual depictions. The crackdown has sparked online debate and fear within the danmei community, a popular and creative space for women to explore themes of desire. The writers face social shame and potential prison sentences of over 10 years for producing and distributing what the state deems obscene material.</p>

          <p>One week after U.S. airstrikes targeted three Iranian nuclear facilities, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created uncertainty about the actual extent of the damage. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated," initial intelligence assessments, including one from the Defense Intelligence Agency, suggested the setback was only temporary. Officials later shifted their focus, emphasizing that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. The evolving narrative and lack of clear damage assessment have raised questions about the mission's primary objectives and overall success.</p>

He also insisted on Iran's right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, calling any demand for zero enrichment "the law of the jungle."

Drawing a parallel to the period after 1989, he notes that American students and scholars are only now beginning to return to China following the pandemic, similar to how they slowly returned in the 1990s. Mahboubi, who recently led a student trip to China, observed a warm reception, which he interprets as a sign of hope. He believes that despite immense changes in China, the pattern of rupture and eventual reconnection in academic exchange offers a positive outlook.</p>

          <p>Vin Diesel has revealed that the character of Brian O'Conner, famously played by the late Paul Walker, will return for the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise, slated for 2027. Speaking at an event, Diesel stated this was one of three conditions he gave Universal Studios for the finale, along with returning the story to its Los Angeles street-racing roots. Walker died in 2013, and his character was given an emotional send-off in "Furious 7" using a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins. It remains unclear how the production will accomplish the character's return.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians living in Russian-occupied Mariupol are countering the narrative of a rebuilt and normalized city portrayed on Russian television, describing it as "fairy tales for fools." Residents report that despite cosmetic repairs on main streets for propaganda purposes, much of the city remains in ruins, with severe water shortages, frequent power cuts, and scarce medicine. They also describe a systematic effort to indoctrinate children in schools with a pro-Russian version of history. Meanwhile, a secret resistance movement persists, gathering intelligence for the Ukrainian military and spreading messages of hope for liberation.</p>

          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced strong bipartisan backlash from lawmakers, conservationists, and recreation advocates. Lee stated he withdrew the proposal because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations. Critics had viewed the land sale as a way to offset the cost of tax cuts in the bill, and its removal is being celebrated as a victory for public land preservation.</p>
