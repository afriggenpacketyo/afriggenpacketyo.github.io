          <p>Freed British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has spoken publicly for the first time since his release last month, expressing unexpected relief and joy in "the small things." After over a decade in Egyptian prisons, including a period of suicidal ideation during a hunger strike, he is now focused on recovery and reconnecting with his family. While committed to fighting for a better world, he states his days of street activism are over, as he navigates a new phase of life. He hopes to travel to the UK soon with his son.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is debating whether to criminalize verbal sexual harassment, or "catcalling," in public, a practice already banned in several other European countries. The center-left Social Democrats argue there is a legal loophole that needs closing, citing the significant impact such behavior has on women, leading to intimidation and withdrawal from public spaces. However, some legal experts suggest existing insult laws could be reinterpreted or that awareness campaigns might be more effective than new legislation. The justice ministry is currently examining legal options.</p>

          <h2>Research Reveals Weak Link Between Financial Incentives and Birth Rates in China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Chinese researchers indicates a "mismatch" between fertility conditions and policy support in China, suggesting financial incentives may not significantly influence birth rates. Guangdong, despite being a top contributor of newborns, offers one of the poorest environments for childbirth, according to the report. The authors emphasize the need for deeper research into the intrinsic connections between fertility conditions and support policies to inform more scientific policymaking. This highlights the complex challenges in boosting declining birth rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The event, marking the 80th anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party, was attended by high-ranking officials from China and Russia, underscoring Kim's growing diplomatic ties. In his speech, Kim emphasized the military's need to become an "invincible entity" to destroy all threats. The parade also featured an "overseas operations unit," possibly indicating troops sent to aid Russia in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw over US$6 billion in liquidations, with Bitcoin declining more than 12% to below US$113,000, triggered by President Trump's announcement of new tariffs. This market weakness exacerbated existing pressures, leading to over US$19 billion in wiped-out bets and liquidations for more than 1.6 million traders within 24 hours. Experts are now focusing on potential counterparty exposure and the risk of broader market contagion, with some estimates placing total liquidations even higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump underwent a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, just six months after his annual physical. His physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, stated Trump "successfully completed a scheduled follow-up evaluation," including advanced imaging and lab tests, which were "exceptional." The report noted his cardiac age was approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age. This second checkup, ahead of a Middle East trip, aimed to dispel health rumors, following previous concerns about swollen ankles and a bruised hand.</p>

          <p>Senior US officials have provided a detailed timeline of the monthslong negotiations that led to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal. The process began in August 2025 with a Hamas acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari proposal, evolving into President Trump's 20-point plan. Key moments included intense diplomatic efforts in New York and Sharm El Sheikh, with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff playing central roles. A significant breakthrough involved Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's apology to Qatar for a prior airstrike, building crucial trust. The deal was separated into two phases: hostage release and a near-permanent ceasefire.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of young adults in their late 20s and 30s are undergoing facelifts, a procedure traditionally associated with older demographics. This trend is driven by a desire for "snatched" looks, the influence of social media, and the normalization of cosmetic procedures. While techniques have advanced, risks remain, and experts caution against complex surgeries for younger individuals. The article explores personal stories, costs, and the psychological impact, with some patients traveling abroad for cheaper procedures, highlighting the pressures to conform to idealized online appearances.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun laying off more than 4,000 federal workers across seven agencies, fulfilling a threat to pressure Democrats during the ongoing government shutdown. The Office of Management and Budget confirmed the "reductions in force," with the Treasury and Health and Human Services departments seeing the most significant cuts. Federal unions have filed a lawsuit, calling the firings "disgraceful" and "illegal," arguing they will devastate critical public services. This move is unprecedented in past shutdowns, where furloughed employees typically received back-pay upon reopening.</p>

          <p>A report from New York City's 26 Federal Plaza reveals traumatic experiences for immigrants and journalists due to aggressive immigration enforcement tactics. Witnesses describe incidents where individuals, including a woman and a child, were forcibly separated and detained by ICE officers, leading to public outcry and disciplinary action against one agent. Lawyers report an unprecedented rise in arrests at the courthouse, with many detainees lacking criminal convictions. Critics argue these tactics, part of the Trump administration's mass deportation initiative, abuse the court system and put immigrants in an impossible position.</p>
