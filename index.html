          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a statement clarifying that most stablecoins are not securities.  The SEC defines "covered stablecoins" as those maintaining a stable value relative to the US dollar, redeemable on a one-for-one basis, and backed by low-risk assets.  The agency stated that offering and selling such stablecoins does not involve offering securities. This clarification follows increasing optimism in the crypto sector regarding potential stablecoin legislation.</p>
