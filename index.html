          <p>Terry Luttrell, the original singer for REO Speedwagon, was involved in a car accident on Sunday morning after performing at a reunion concert in Champaign, Illinois. Luttrell, 78, told The News-Gazette that he fell asleep at the wheel while driving to St. Louis for business, resulting in the crash on Interstate 57. He sustained a cracked sternum from the airbag and experienced back and neck pain but expects to recover fully after rehabilitation in the hospital. Luttrell said he was happy he performed at the farewell concert and that it was a fun evening, despite the accident. The band had previously announced they would stop touring due to "irreconcilable differences."</p>

The issue has divided Trump's MAGA base, with some emphasizing his campaign promise to avoid foreign wars.

          <p>FreshRealm is voluntarily recalling pre-made chicken fettuccine alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart due to potential listeria contamination. The recalled products were produced before June 17 and have establishment numbers "EST. P-50784," "EST. P-47770," or "EST. P-47718" printed on the packaging. This recall is connected to a possible outbreak strain of listeria linked to three deaths, one fetal loss, and seventeen illnesses across 13 states. Consumers are urged to discard or return the recalled products, as listeria can cause serious infections, especially in older adults, those with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women.</p>

          <p>Social Security is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year earlier than previously forecast, potentially leading to a 19% reduction in monthly benefits. The new projection accounts for increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. Experts suggest that Congress needs to act quickly to shore up the program by raising more revenue or cutting benefits. The average Social Security benefit for a retiree is currently $1,976, meaning a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick is rapidly intensifying and is forecast to reach major status before hitting Mexico. The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane warning from Acapulco to Puerto Angel, with a hurricane watch from west of Acapulco to Texpan de Galeana. The storm is expected to bring potentially destructive winds and life-threatening flash floods to portions of southern Mexico. Erick is forecast to produce between 8 to 12 inches of rain, with maximum totals of 16 inches across the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, leading to life-threatening flooding and mudslides.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, the U.S. is weighing direct military involvement. Only the U.S. has the 30,000-pound "bunker buster" bombs capable of reaching Iran's fortified nuclear facility in Fordo, as well as the B-2 stealth bombers needed to deliver them. The GBU-57 MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator) was developed with Iran's nuclear facilities in mind, but there's a lot about it that's classified. Experts agree that the GBU-57 could cause serious destruction to a facility like Fordo, but the real question is whether it would be enough to stop Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <h2>New US Visa Rules Require Foreign Students to Unlock Social Media Profiles</h2>

          <p>Foreign students will be required to unlock their social media profiles to allow US diplomats to review their online activity before receiving educational and exchange visas. The state department directs diplomats to conduct an online presence review to look for "any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States". The new checks are directed at students and other applicants for visas in the F, M and J categories. Those who fail to do so will be suspected of hiding that activity from US officials.</p>

          <p>Juventus players and staff were involved in an awkward encounter at the White House when Donald Trump attempted to get them to enter into a debate on transgender women in sport. Trump asked the players about their views on the subject, but they did not offer a response. Juventus’s general manager attempted to deflect the query, but Trump continued to press the issue. Trump's comments come at a time when trans people are facing increasing hostility in the US.</p>
