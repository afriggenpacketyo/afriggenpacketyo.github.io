          <h2>US Aid Cuts Linked to Rising Maternal and Newborn Deaths in Afghanistan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 16:59:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation reveals a devastating rise in maternal and newborn mortality in Afghanistan following the Trump administration's decision to cut nearly all US aid. The report documents the closure of over 400 USAID-supported medical clinics, which served as critical lifelines in remote regions like Badakhshan province. Through firsthand accounts from grieving families, the article illustrates the direct human cost of the funding withdrawal, as pregnant women are left without access to essential medical care during childbirth. The Taliban government denies allegations that aid money was being siphoned, while local hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to train new female medical staff due to the regime's restrictions on women's education.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man was arrested in Phoenix after being filmed trampling a memorial for the recently assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The incident occurred outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk co-founded. Video footage shows the suspect, identified as Ryder Corral, kicking over flowers, flags, and other items before a mourner intervened and threw him to the ground. Phoenix police, who were already on site for traffic control, took the man into custody on charges of criminal damage and disorderly conduct. The suspect was reportedly wearing a shirt similar to the one worn by Kirk's alleged assassin.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) model, offering short-term, interest-free installment plans, is rapidly gaining popularity among American consumers as an alternative to traditional credit cards. Services like Affirm and Klarna are attracting millions of users, which directly challenges the revenue streams of credit card companies by reducing transaction activity and utilization. However, banks and established financial institutions are wary of the trend, primarily because BNPL loans often do not appear on standard credit reports. This creates what experts call a significant 'black hole' in a consumer's credit profile, making it difficult for lenders to accurately assess creditworthiness and overall financial risk.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Tennessee Titans 33-19, improving their season record to a perfect 2-0. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for two touchdowns, including his first to newly acquired receiver Davante Adams, while Puka Nacua scored on a 45-yard touchdown run. The Rams' defense was also a key factor, with edge rusher Byron Young contributing two sacks and a forced fumble. This victory serves as a final tune-up before the team faces a significant challenge against the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. The upcoming game is viewed as a true test of the Rams' potential as Super Bowl contenders this season.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España, a major Grand Tour cycling event, was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down barriers and occupied the road, leading to clashes with police and forcing organizers to end the race early for safety reasons. Consequently, the podium ceremony was canceled, and Jonas Vingegaard, who was leading, was declared the overall winner. The protests were directed against the participation of the Israeli-owned team Israel-Premier Tech and had caused disruptions throughout the three-week race.

          <p>Manchester United suffered a significant 3-0 defeat to rival Manchester City, marking the club's poorest start to a league season since 1992-93. The loss has intensified scrutiny on head coach Rúben Amorim and his commitment to a 3-4-3 formation that has left the team's midfield frequently exposed. Pundits and fans are questioning the team's lack of quality and tactical rigidity after spending over £200 million on new players in recent summers. Despite the poor results, Amorim has defended his methods, though he acknowledged that his future at the club is not his decision to make.</p>

The law, HB 128, which took effect in August, allows individuals with concealed-carry permits to carry their weapons openly on university grounds. While it is unclear if the suspected shooter was legally permitted to have a rifle on campus, the timing of the law's passage has brought it into the national spotlight. The article notes Utah's generally permissive gun laws, including the absence of 'red-flag' laws, and the state's focus on 'school hardening' rather than restricting firearm access.</p>

The company stated that JD.com had revised its terms and commitments to a degree that was no longer in the best interest of Sainsbury's shareholders, leading to the termination of the discussions. Despite the collapse of the deal, Sainsbury's reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to achieve a retail underlying operating profit of approximately £1 billion for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. JD.com has not yet commented on the development.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has been crowned the new men's 100m world champion in Tokyo, becoming the first Jamaican man to win a global 100m title since Usain Bolt's final victory nine years ago. The 24-year-old, who is coached by Bolt's former mentor Glen Mills, delivered a personal best time of 9.77 seconds to lead a Jamaican one-two finish, with Kishane Thompson taking silver. Seville's victory is seen as a pivotal moment for Jamaican sprinting, finally fulfilling the immense potential he has shown for years. The win marks a triumphant return for Jamaica to the top of the men's sprinting world, celebrated by a visibly emotional Usain Bolt in the stands.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that the Duke of York has not faced sufficient consequences and that every person involved, regardless of status, should be held to the fullest extent of the law. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability. Giuffre, who campaigned for years as a victims' advocate, took her own life in April.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, the center-right CDU party of Chancellor Friedrich Merz secured victory, but the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) saw a dramatic surge in support. According to initial forecasts, the AfD more than tripled its share of the vote from 5.1% in 2020 to approximately 16.5%. This result marks a significant gain for the far-right party in a key western German state and is seen as a litmus test for the national political mood. While the CDU remains the strongest party, the AfD's growing influence signals a continuing rightward shift in the German electorate.</p>
