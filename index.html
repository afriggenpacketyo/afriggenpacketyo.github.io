          <p>Lee Elia, a former manager for the Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies, has passed away at the age of 87. While he had a long career in baseball, including as a player and coach, he is most famously remembered for an expletive-filled tirade against Cubs fans in 1983. The rant, which was recorded after a loss, criticized the fans for their lack of support during a difficult season. Elia also served as a coach for the 1980 World Series-winning Phillies and worked with the Seattle Mariners.</p>

          <p>In the third Test match between England and India, fast bowler Jofra Archer made a dramatic return after a four-year injury absence, taking a key wicket early in his spell. The second day at Lord's saw fluctuating fortunes, with India closing at 145-3 in response to England's first-innings total of 387. Earlier, England's Joe Root completed a century, but Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah's five-wicket haul briefly shifted momentum. The match remains tightly contested, with both teams vying for control in the series.</p>

          <p>A significant political conflict has erupted between UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and the Unite union regarding ongoing bin strikes in Birmingham. The union announced it suspended Rayner's membership after she encouraged workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council, though a Labour source claims she had already quit. This public rift highlights deeper tensions between the Labour government and one of its major union backers over issues like workers' rights and potential job losses.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new tax bill, which raises the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, includes a phaseout that could create a "SALT torpedo" for high-income earners. The benefit begins to decrease for those with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) between $500,000 and $600,000. This structure means that for every dollar earned within this range, individuals lose a portion of the deduction, effectively creating a marginal tax rate as high as 45.5% on that income. Tax experts advise that individuals near this income threshold should carefully consider financial strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The widely adopted fitness goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research suggests it is a reasonably effective health benchmark. Studies show health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts like 2,500, with many benefits plateauing around 7,500 steps. Experts agree that while 10,000 steps is a useful and motivating target for many, the key is simply to be more active, as any increase in movement is beneficial for overall health.</p>

His leadership also came under intense scrutiny following the mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by police, who mistook him for a terror suspect.

          <p>The political environment in Wyoming is undergoing a significant transformation, described as becoming more aligned with the MAGA movement. This article highlights the experience of Dan Zwonitzer, a Republican who was ousted from the state legislature after 20 years. He lost his primary election to a more conservative challenger, reflecting a broader trend in the state. Zwonitzer notes that Wyoming politics now seems "crazier than it ever has," indicating a shift away from traditional conservatism toward a more populist and confrontational style of politics that is reshaping the state's Republican party.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, high-yield savings accounts (HYSA) offer a compelling alternative, with many providing rates above 4.30%. However, there are timely considerations for savers. While current rates are high, they are variable and may fall if the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark rate later this year. A key advantage of HYSAs is their flexibility, as funds remain accessible without penalty, which is valuable in an uncertain economy. A potential drawback is that the best rates are typically offered by online-only banks. (not investment advice)</p>
