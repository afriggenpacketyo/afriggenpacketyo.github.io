          <p>The Trump administration's policies have significantly impacted various scientific fields in the US, leading to the dismissal of numerous scientists and substantial budget cuts for research programs.  Experts warn of long-term damage to scientific expertise across public health, climate science, environmental protection, and nuclear safety.  The administration's actions have been compared to those of authoritarian regimes, raising concerns about the erosion of the scientific method and its application in policy-making.  The consequences of these actions are likely to persist for decades.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament has approved reforms to the country's justice system, including the abolition of the controversial "not proven" verdict.  This verdict, unique to Scotland, has been criticized for its ambiguity and lack of closure for victims. The reforms also raise the threshold for guilty verdicts in jury trials to a two-thirds majority and create a specialized sexual offences court.  The changes aim to improve the justice system's fairness and effectiveness.</p>
