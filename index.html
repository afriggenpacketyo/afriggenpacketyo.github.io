          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles following Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles County, citing lawlessness, while Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory. Activists planned further demonstrations outside Los Angeles City Hall, demanding the withdrawal of the National Guard and ICE. The ICE operations resulted in numerous arrests, including that of a union president, and prompted concerns about the militarization of immigration enforcement in the region. The optimism score for this event is relatively low, reflecting the tensions and potential for escalation.</p>

This shift has reduced the perceived danger of American conspiracies aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party through peaceful means.
