          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing increasing challenges in delivering benefits to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities, with reports of beneficiaries being wrongly marked as deceased and payments being delayed or disrupted. These errors are occurring after initiatives to alter databases and root out fraud, and are affecting beneficiaries' bank accounts, insurance, and ability to work. The agency is also experiencing technological issues and staff departures, leading to difficulties in processing changes and providing timely assistance. Advocates and lawyers say the agency's performance is declining, leaving beneficiaries struggling to receive the money they are owed.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is standing trial in New York City on multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. The indictment alleges a pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals, involving manipulation into commercial sex acts, sexual assault, and the use of money, drugs, and threats to control victims. A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, in 2016 is expected to be a key piece of evidence. Jury selection is underway, with both the defense and prosecution disagreeing on the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors. If found guilty on all counts, Combs could face decades in prison.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has expressed its commitment to supporting the Australian film industry in response to Donald Trump's threat of imposing 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the US. Trump described film incentives as a national security threat. The federal government's location offset scheme offers a 30% rebate for big-budget film projects shot in Australia, but the imposition of tariffs could undermine these incentives. Foreign productions contribute significantly to the local screen industry, with nearly half of the $1.7 billion spent on screen production in Australia during 2023-24 attributed to international projects.</p>

          <p>Indigenous people across North America are rallying to raise awareness and demand sustained responses to violence in their communities, particularly against women and girls. They are advocating for improved cooperation among law enforcement agencies to find missing individuals and solve homicides. Many are using Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day to educate children about the risks they face. According to the U.S. Justice Department, Indigenous women are more than twice as likely to be victims of homicide than the national average.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Syed Asim Munir, has become a central figure in the rising tensions between Pakistan and India following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir. General Munir has taken a hard-line stance, asserting that any military misadventure by India will be met with a strong response. Analysts view his actions as a reflection of his need to project strength and garner public support amidst political and economic challenges in Pakistan. His rhetoric, drawing on religious themes and invoking the ‚Äútwo-nation theory,‚Äù signals a potential shift in Pakistan's stance towards India.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, citing a "National Security threat" due to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers. The move is intended to revitalize the American movie industry, which Trump claims is "dying a very fast death". The announcement has created uncertainty regarding the scope of the tariffs, including whether they will apply to American production companies filming abroad, streaming services, or how they will be calculated. Other countries have expressed support for their film industries.</p>
