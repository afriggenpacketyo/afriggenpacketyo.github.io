          <p>Democratic lawmakers in the Texas House are leaving the state to break quorum during a special legislative session, aiming to halt the passage of a new congressional map proposed by Republicans. The map could significantly increase GOP representation, and this marks the third time in two decades that Texas Democrats have used this tactic to stall legislation. While the move cannot permanently stop the bill, it is intended to run out the clock on the 30-day session, forcing the governor to call another. Lawmakers participating in the walkout face potential daily fines and legal action upon their return.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a jobs report with downward revisions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the data revisions as justification, suggesting a desire for more transparent data under a new appointee. The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists and Democratic lawmakers, who argue it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent of politicizing statistical agencies. Former BLS officials appointed by Trump have also condemned the action as groundless and damaging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A manhunt has entered its third day for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities consider the suspect armed and dangerous, offering a $7,500 reward for information leading to his arrest. The victims, all local residents, were known to the suspect, who was a regular at the bar. Family members of the suspect stated he has struggled with mental illness and PTSD for years, while the community mourns the loss from what the Attorney General described as a heinous, unprovoked act of violence.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police in the United Kingdom have charged a fifth individual in connection with a break-in at RAF Brize Norton in June. Muhammad Umer Khalid, 22, faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place. The incident involved activists who breached the air base's security and spray-painted two military aircraft, causing an estimated £7 million in damages. The group Palestine Action, which has since been proscribed as a terrorist organization by the government, claimed responsibility for the act. Four other people were previously charged with the same offenses last month.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has indicated that the new tariff rates for over 60 trading partners, announced under a recent executive order, are now "pretty much set." In an interview, Greer stated he does not expect further negotiations to alter the rates before they take effect, explaining that many are tied to existing deals, some of which are not public. The plan imposes a baseline 10% tariff on all imports, with higher rates for certain countries like Canada, which faces a 35% tariff on goods not covered by the USMCA. The administration's goal is to reduce the trade deficit and reshore manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

In May, adviser Stephen Miller had publicly stated a "goal" of achieving 3,000 ICE arrests per day. However, Justice Department lawyers now assert that no such policy or directive has been issued to DHS or ICE. This denial comes as part of a lawsuit in California where advocacy groups accuse the administration of unconstitutional immigration sweeps. Critics point to the discrepancy as a significant contradiction between the administration's public rhetoric and its official legal position.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, rattling parts of the New York City metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake happened about 10 kilometers below the surface. While the tremor was minor and no significant damage or injuries were reported, residents across the region felt a brief period of shaking, with some describing it as a loud boom or feeling like a vehicle had hit their house. This event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the same region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity can occur on the East Coast.</p>

The economic viability of solar power, compared to rising natural gas prices, is a key factor, making it a cheaper option for utilities. However, the industry faces headwinds from the impending rollback of federal tax credits and growing grid constraints, posing challenges to maintaining this momentum without consistent policy support.

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has announced it will update an exhibit at the National Museum of American History to ensure it reflects all presidential impeachment proceedings. The statement follows a report that references to President Trump's two impeachments had been removed from "The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden" exhibit last month. The Smithsonian explained that the temporary placard was removed because it did not meet museum standards for presentation and blocked the view of other objects. The institution clarified it was not asked by any government official to remove the content and will update the section in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee have arrested two men in connection with the murders of four people who were relatives of an infant found abandoned and alive. Tanaka Brown and Giovonte Thomas have been charged with accessory after the fact, with investigators alleging they assisted the primary suspect, Austin Robert Drummond, who remains at large. A combined reward of $17,500 is being offered for information leading to the arrest of Drummond, who is considered armed and dangerous. The victims were identified as the infant's parents, grandmother, and uncle, and authorities believe the attack was targeted.</p>

          <p>Canada's U.S. Trade Minister, Dominic LeBlanc, expressed disappointment but remained committed to negotiations after the Trump administration imposed a 35% tariff on Canadian goods not covered by the USMCA. LeBlanc described recent talks in Washington as constructive and stated that Canada is prepared to "do the work needed" to find common ground. The increased tariff on the U.S.'s second-largest trading partner has been justified by the White House as a response to issues like fentanyl trafficking and Canada's earlier retaliatory tariffs. LeBlanc emphasized the integrated nature of the two economies and expects the countries' leaders to speak in the coming days. (not investment advice)</p>

Norris admitted he is "not making life very easy" for himself and acknowledged the need to improve, despite his recent strong results. The win required a strategic switch to a one-stop tire strategy, a risky move that ultimately paid off and demonstrated his ability to recover from early race challenges.</p>

However, nearly 90% of Canadian exports can still cross the border duty-free under the existing USMCA, providing a significant buffer. Canadian officials state they are prioritizing a quality deal over a rushed one and will continue negotiations, while the Trump administration has linked trade to non-trade issues like drug trafficking and defense spending.
