        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friday's UK newspapers feature a mix of stories, prominently including the looming vote on the assisted dying bill. The Daily Express leads with a supporter's plea for choice in having a good death, featuring a photograph of Sophie Blake, who has incurable breast cancer. The Daily Telegraph reports on Labour MPs' last-minute plea to reject the bill, which returns to the Commons after controversies. Other stories include the absence of the Princess of Wales at Royal Ascot and Donald Trump's deadline regarding the Middle East conflict, alongside weather warnings for the heatwave. The overall tone of the news is balanced, presenting both sides of the assisted dying debate and highlighting other significant events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that the drawn-out acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel reveals the fragility of the U.S. business environment. Political motivations seemingly influenced the U.S. administration's initial blocking of the $14.1 billion deal, causing companies to rethink investment strategies in the U.S. market. Despite Trump's later approval after a national security agreement, including an $11 billion investment commitment by Nippon Steel, companies may now hesitate over major U.S. investments due to unpredictable political and economic factors. The situation highlights the increasing government involvement in business deals through industrial policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's secure nuclear site, and believes disabling it is necessary due to the risk of weapons production. He approved attack plans but has not made a final decision, holding off in case Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. The president is considering the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs and is aware of diplomatic efforts to find an off-ramp in the conflict. The U.K. Foreign Secretary met with U.S. officials to discuss potential solutions.</p>

          <p>China has allowed Indian pilgrims to visit Tibet again, leading to hopes of improved relations after years of tension. The pilgrimages, which involve treks to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar, are significant for multiple religions. This year, over 5,500 people applied, with 750 being allowed to travel along two routes between June and August.

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft resigned as a government whip due to disagreement with the government's plans to cut disability benefits. She expressed understanding of the need to address the increasing welfare bill, but argued that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit were not the solution. A government spokesman defended the reforms, stating they would ensure those who can work are supported, while protecting those with severe disabilities. The bill, which tightens criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit, faces potential rebellion from Labour MPs.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court extended its block of a judge's order directing President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Governor Newsom. The court sided with the president, allowing the continued deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles to protect federal property and U.S. immigration agents. The judges determined that the president likely acted within his statutory authority under Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents. The court also stated that the Trump administration was not required to seek Newsom's permission to call up the Guard.</p>

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart, the company behind the popular Labubu toys, experienced a decline after Morgan Stanley removed the stock from its China and Hong Kong focus list. The stock was down more than 5%, continuing a slide from the previous session, marking its first negative week since early May. Despite the recent downturn, Pop Mart shares have seen significant gains year-to-date. Morgan Stanley had previously raised its price target on the toy company, citing long-term growth potential, but cautioned that the stock's high valuation might limit outperformance in the coming quarters.</p>

          <p>China's central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following recent monetary easing measures and a trade agreement with the U.S. easing growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. The trade truce between the U.S. and China has reduced trade war fears, allowing Beijing some flexibility in supporting its currency. Analysts suggest that Chinese authorities may exercise limited urgency in rolling out additional fiscal stimulus in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran, focusing on the Fordow nuclear enrichment site. He is evaluating the effectiveness of U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, known as "bunker busters," to destroy the site. The decision hinges on whether these bombs can effectively neutralize the facility, which is built deep into a mountain near Tehran. Israel lacks the capability to significantly damage the site without U.S. assistance.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration can maintain control of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, pending further litigation. The court found that the president has broad authority to deploy the military in American cities, although this power is not unlimited. The ruling returns the issue to a lower court, focusing on the limits of presidential power rather than the existence of a "rebellion" in Los Angeles. The decision also leaves unresolved the question of whether the deployment violates the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>
