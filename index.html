            <p>President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asserting that interest rates would be lower if Powell "understood what he was doing." Trump's remarks follow increased White House pressure on Powell, with economic advisor Kevin Hassett suggesting the administration is exploring options for removing him, despite Powell's claim he cannot be fired. Trump's frustration stems from Powell's statements that tariffs could raise inflation, creating challenges for the Fed. The FOMC's current target range for the borrowing rate is between 4.25% and 4.5%, and markets anticipate rates will remain steady at the next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

This isn't the first time Lowe has been compared to Stamos; his son has previously photoshopped Stamos' face onto family photos and social media posts.

            <p>Layoffs at the FDA, including support staff for inspectors, could compromise the safety of the U.S. food and drug supply, according to current inspectors. The cuts are impacting travel arrangements and reimbursements, potentially delaying or canceling inspections of factories producing critical items like baby formula and generic drugs. Concerns are mounting that reduced support for inspectors will worsen existing staffing problems and hinder the FDA's ability to meet inspection goals, especially for foreign facilities. Experts emphasize the importance of inspections in ensuring the quality and safety of products, particularly those manufactured in less regulated countries.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to countries other than their place of origin without due process. The injunction prevents the administration from removing individuals to countries like El Salvador or Honduras without allowing them to raise concerns about their safety. The ruling challenges the administration's policy of deporting alleged gang members to countries like El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The judge's order requires the administration to provide noncitizens written notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports, following an investigation that found China's shipbuilding practices unreasonable and restrictive to U.S. commerce. The fees will be charged per voyage and will increase incrementally over several years. The USTR acknowledged public comments that warned the U.S. was in no position to win an economic war that placed ocean carriers using Chinese-made vessels in the middle. The World Shipping Council has expressed "serious concerns" over the port fees.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering revoking Harvard University's tax-exempt status, a move that could have significant financial consequences for the institution. This action is based on the argument that Harvard may not be meeting the criteria for an educational institution due to alleged bias and ideological issues. The administration is attempting to make use of the Bob Jones University v. United States Supreme Court decision to challenge the status. This is dangerous, as conservatives should be wary of far-reaching claims of administrative authority to decide what is within “settled public policy” and what is not.</p>

The controversial program aims to end the koalas' suffering from burns and starvation.

They also question the use of aerial culling as the best approach, advocating for rescue as the first option.</p>

A transmission line failure triggered the outage, leaving over 1.45 million customers without electricity.

The blackout was the latest in a series of major outages on the island, highlighting the vulnerability of the power grid.</p>

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering plans to end its routine food safety inspections, potentially outsourcing this oversight to state and local authorities. The plans, which are not finalized, could free up resources for higher priority and foreign inspections. Some FDA employees have been working on a possible shift of the agency's routine food efforts to states for years, one current and one former official said, which could free up resources to focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. Some states and advocacy groups have called for years for the FDA to move its routine food inspections out to states.</p>
