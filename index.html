            <p>An Oregon detective's offer of a cigarette to a suspect led to a confession and the discovery of a body in a missing person case. After 50-year-old Aaron Friar and his 15-year-old daughter Ellie vanished, investigators discovered a bloody crime scene at their home. Detective Bill Ford interviewed Russell Jones, who initially taunted investigators but then requested a cigarette in exchange for talking. Ford's tactic of "smokin' and jokin'" led Jones to confess that he helped load the body and to direct police to Aaron Friar's remains.</p>

            <p>An 11-year-old girl's testimony played a crucial role in solving the murder of her father, Aaron Friar, in Medford, Oregon. Sierra Friar awoke to yelling and breaking glass, later witnessing her sister's boyfriend, Gavin MacFarlane, outside the house, despite him being forbidden from the property. Sierra's information led detectives to track MacFarlane, who, along with his friend Russell Jones, was later taken into custody after Aaron Friar's car was found with blood in the trunk. The case uncovered a complex web of deceit, with MacFarlane eventually confessing to the murder, motivated by his relationship with Ellie Friar and allegations of abuse.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have reportedly detonated a hydrogen-based explosive device in a controlled field test, achieving significant chemical chain reactions without using nuclear materials. The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds. The bomb uses a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material, which releases hydrogen gas that ignites into a sustained inferno when activated by conventional explosives. The team was led by CSSC research scientist Wang Xuefeng.</p>

            <p>Meenakshi Raghavan, an 82-year-old woman in India, continues to teach the ancient martial art of Kalaripayattu, with no plans to retire. Known as Meenakshi Amma, she teaches about 50 students daily at her Kalari school, which was founded by her husband in 1950. Kalaripayattu, believed to have originated in Kerala over 3,000 years ago, involves various stages of training, including oil massage, stick fighting, weapon combat, and unarmed combat. She also says she will likely practice Kalari until the day she dies.</p>
