        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey faces a federal indictment in Virginia on charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice. The grand jury's decision stems from his September 2020 testimony, where he is accused of lying about authorizing the leak of classified information to the media. Comey, who has consistently declared his innocence, is the first former FBI director to be indicted for a crime and could face significant prison time if found guilty. This article outlines the legal process and the gravity of the accusations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new wave of tariffs, targeting imported branded drugs with a 100% levy unless companies establish U.S. manufacturing plants. Additional duties include a 25% tariff on heavy-duty trucks and 50% on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, all effective October 1. The administration's rationale, as detailed in this article, is to safeguard American manufacturers and create domestic jobs against what it terms "unfair outside competition." These protectionist policies are expanding despite objections from U.S. businesses concerned about rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former Orange County sheriff's deputy, Arcadio Rodriguez, pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor charges related to the sexual assault of two female inmates, receiving no jail time. He was sentenced to time already served under home confinement and must register as a sex offender for at least 10 years. The article highlights District Attorney Todd Spizer's frustration, noting that current California law limits charges to misdemeanors for non-skin-to-skin contact, prompting his push for legislative reform to impose harsher penalties for such abuses of power.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the complex history between former FBI Director James Comey and Donald Trump, explaining how Comey became a primary target for the president. It recounts Comey's 2017 firing after refusing a loyalty pledge and confirming the Russia investigation, which ultimately led to the Mueller probe. The piece highlights the irony of Comey's prior actions, such as his public statements on Hillary Clinton's emails, which inadvertently aided Trump's 2016 election campaign, underscoring the deep-seated political motivations behind his recent indictment.</p>
