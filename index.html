He Lifeng also called for strengthening Shanghai's role in yuan-denominated asset allocation and risk management.

          <p>Marine biologists in East Tennessee are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene caused significant debris accumulation. The study aims to determine the hurricane's impact on sport fish, comparing current data with surveys from the past 30 years. Initial observations suggest conditions are within normal range, but scientists will continue to analyze the data to assess potential disruptions to shoreline habitat and the broader ecosystem. Sport fishing is a major contributor to the local economy, making the health of the fish population crucial for tourism.</p>

          <p>The Senate has voted to overturn an EPA rule designed to limit hazardous air pollutants from heavy industry, marking the first time Congress has weakened the Clean Air Act. The rule, finalized by the Biden administration in 2024, required major sources of pollutants like mercury and dioxins to maintain strict pollution controls. Republican lawmakers argued the rule disincentivized companies from adopting new pollution-reducing technologies. Environmental groups have criticized the move, warning it could increase risks of cancer, birth defects, and brain damage.</p>
