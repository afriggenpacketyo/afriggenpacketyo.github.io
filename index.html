          <p>Danish wind farm developer Orsted saw its shares plummet by over 25% after revealing plans for a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue. This move comes in response to a "material adverse development" in the U.S. market, which hindered the company's ability to secure funds from a planned divestment of its Sunrise Wind project. The offering of new shares to existing shareholders aims to recapitalize the company, reflecting a challenging period for its expansion efforts in the American renewable energy sector. The situation highlights the volatility and financial pressures within the global offshore wind industry. (not investment advice)</p>

This move, after 44 years, means the 1,900 staff members will share in profits and have a say in company operations, aligning with the family's Christian ethos which includes Sunday closures and charity donations. Grant believes this model will preserve the company's legacy and family feel, ensuring continuity beyond a traditional sale.

          <p>Proposed road safety reforms in England and Wales could mandate compulsory eye tests every three years for drivers over 70, potentially leading to driving bans. These changes, which also include reducing the drink-driving limit and introducing penalty points for unbelted passengers, stem from a coroner's report criticizing the UK's "laxest" licensing system. The government aims to reduce the annual toll of road deaths and injuries, which currently cost the NHS over £2 billion. This significant shake-up in driving laws is still under consultation, with ministers emphasizing the need for tougher penalties.</p>

Despite an earlier 90-day agreement to reduce duties and pause punitive measures, trade has significantly declined, particularly China's exports to the U.S. Key issues like increased Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and semiconductor export controls remain contentious. Experts anticipate a Trump-Xi summit, suggesting a more stable but not necessarily friendlier relationship, as both nations structurally move towards decoupling in the evolving global trade landscape.

          <p>Elon Musk's Tesla, primarily known for electric vehicles, has formally applied to the British energy regulator Ofgem for a license to supply electricity to UK households and businesses. If approved, this move could allow Tesla Energy Ventures to compete in the British energy market as early as next year, leveraging its existing solar energy and battery storage products. The initiative comes as Tesla faces a protracted sales slump for its cars in Europe, with new car sales dropping significantly in both the UK and Germany. This expansion into energy supply could open a new revenue stream for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beijing's municipal government unexpectedly relaxed home-buying restrictions, allowing residents and those who paid social insurance/income tax to purchase properties outside the Fifth Ring Road. This move, earlier than market expectations, is seen by analysts as aligning with the central government's push to remove buying curbs in non-central areas. Experts believe this proactive measure will bolster market confidence, addressing concerns about delayed stimulus in the struggling property sector. The policy shift could encourage Shanghai and Shenzhen to follow suit, signaling a potential broader easing of housing market regulations across China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Perseids Meteor Shower Peak This Week Faces Interference from Bright Moon</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Perseids meteor shower, renowned for its spectacular displays, is set to peak this week, but its visibility will be significantly hampered by an 84% full moon. This lunar interference is expected to reduce the hourly meteor count by at least 75%, allowing only the brighter meteors to be seen. While the shower runs from mid-July to August 23, experts advise viewers to wait a week or so past the peak for darker conditions. The Perseids originate from debris left by comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, disintegrating in Earth's atmosphere to create colorful streaks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Lucy Letby murder case, where a nurse was convicted of killing seven babies, faces renewed scrutiny over the reliability of medical evidence from both prosecution and defense. Despite unanimous verdicts on some counts, new expert opinions challenge prosecution claims regarding injuries and air embolism. Conversely, some defense theories, like a doctor accidentally piercing a baby's liver, are contested by other experts and trial evidence. This ongoing debate reveals a significant lack of consensus among medical professionals, prompting the Criminal Cases Review Commission to assess whether the case warrants re-examination.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has labeled Nvidia's H20 AI chip as unsafe, urging Chinese buyers to boycott the processors due to alleged "back-door" vulnerabilities. Despite Nvidia's denials, state broadcaster China Central Television's outlet, Yuyuan Tantian, claimed the US government's efforts to embed "back doors" made the chips untrustworthy. This distrust stems from historical attempts at surveillance via chips and a recent bill proposing tracking features for US chipmakers. The article highlights escalating tensions and a lack of trust in the technology trade between the two global powers, despite a recent deal allowing chip sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal agents from the FBI, DEA, and other agencies were deployed across Washington D.C. after President Trump vowed a swift crackdown on crime and homelessness. Trump stated homeless individuals must "move out, IMMEDIATELY," promising alternative accommodations "FAR from the Capital," and threatened a federal takeover of the city if crime isn't reduced. This action comes despite official data showing a decrease in D.C. crime rates. Homeless residents expressed fear, while locals questioned the federal presence. The situation highlights a tense standoff between federal directives and local realities regarding urban issues.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has endured a difficult first 100 days, facing widespread mockery and criticism from the media and political class. His administration, a coalition that struggled for initial approval, is grappling with rising populist impulses and a more unruly political culture. Merz attempts to forge a modern yet culturally conservative mainstream, but is accused of concessions to both the left and far-right. The AfD party actively seeks to destabilize his coalition, pushing its vote share upwards and presenting a significant challenge to Germany's political stability.</p>

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. clarified that China "misinterpreted" his comments about the Philippines being drawn into a potential China-Taiwan conflict. Beijing had accused him of "playing with fire." Marcos explained his remarks were meant to highlight the necessity of evacuating over a hundred thousand Filipinos in Taiwan if conflict arose, not to provoke. This diplomatic incident occurs amid heightened tensions between Manila and Beijing over South China Sea territorial disputes, including a recent water cannon incident involving a Philippine vessel.</p>

This policy allows foreign nationals who commit crimes in the UK to be deported before their appeals are heard, with hearings conducted via video link from their home countries. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the expansion aims to prevent criminals from "exploiting our immigration system" and "fast-track" removals.
