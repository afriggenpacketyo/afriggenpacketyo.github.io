          <p>President Donald Trump stated that it would be a "great thing" if border czar Tom Homan arrested California Governor Gavin Newsom, prompting a sharp response from Newsom who accused Trump of authoritarianism. Trump also referred to protesters as "professional agitators" and "insurrectionists" who should be jailed. The events follow Trump's decision to send the National Guard to Los Angeles, a move criticized by Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass as escalating violence. Trump insists that Newsom and Bass should be grateful for his assistance despite their criticisms.</p>

          <p>A study in JAMA Pediatrics reveals a significant increase in firearm-related deaths among children and teens after the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago decision, which granted states greater autonomy in setting gun laws. States with more permissive gun laws experienced over 6,000 excess deaths, while states with stricter laws saw a decrease in pediatric gun deaths. The study highlights that firearm deaths have become the leading cause of death for young people in the U.S., surpassing motor vehicle accidents and cancer, and that most of these deaths were homicides and suicides.</p>

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old girl who was groomed and charged with terrorism offences before taking her own life, concluded that authorities missed opportunities to help her. The coroner cited a "systems failure" by counter-terror police and Derbyshire County Council for not referring Rudd earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd had been groomed and sexually exploited online by an American neo-Nazi and influenced by her mother's former partner, who had been in a white supremacist gang. The inquest determined no single organization was to blame for her death.</p>

          <p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented in a Supreme Court case, Social Security Administration v. AFSCME, expressing concerns about the Court's rapid handling of Trump administration cases. She argues that her Republican colleagues are abandoning the "irreparable harm" requirement when the Trump administration seeks emergency relief. Jackson suggests the Court applies different standards to Democratic and Republican administrations regarding the "shadow docket," which involves emergency motions decided without full briefing or oral argument. The justice believes that the Court should return to its prior shadow docket policy.</p>

          <p>The UK government has largely reversed its decision to cut winter fuel payments, raising questions about its spending plans and fiscal rules. Originally, only pensioners receiving pension credit would receive the payments, but now all pensioners will be eligible, with clawbacks for those earning over Â£35,000. This change will cost Â£1.25 billion, leading to a Â£1 billion gap in the government's finances, which the Treasury plans to address in the Autumn Budget. Some analysts believe the net savings for the government could be lower due to increased pension credit claims.</p>

          <p>Some student loan borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan, promised an interest-free break, are reporting unexpected interest accrual. One borrower, Ellie Bruecker, found an unexpected $3,000 in interest on her account. While the Education Department states that SAVE plan borrowers remain in a forbearance that is not accruing interest, it is unclear how widespread the issue is. Experts advise borrowers to check their loan history and contact MOHELA if their debt has grown since July 2024.</p>

          <p>The author defends the concept of the "wife guy," someone who openly and enthusiastically expresses love for his wife, arguing that such expressions should not be viewed with suspicion. The term has evolved to describe someone whose spousal affection is so ostentatious that it becomes inherently untrustworthy, often seen as compensating for shortcomings. The author argues that in a world where many men are afraid to show their feelings, publicly expressing love should be encouraged. He acknowledges the potential for performative affection but ultimately values vulnerability and openness in relationships.</p>
