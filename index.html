        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting August 1, millions of student loan borrowers enrolled in the Biden administration's SAVE plan will see interest begin to accrue again. This follows court injunctions that had paused the program, moving enrollees into a zero-interest forbearance period. The Department of Education frames this as a measure of fiscal responsibility, but advocacy groups estimate the change could increase monthly costs by an average of $300 for a typical borrower. The article also notes that borrowers can opt to remain in forbearance, though their loan balances will grow, and mentions a new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) slated for 2026.

This plan follows a series of lackluster quarterly earnings and aims to rebuild the company's operational foundation.

          <p>This article explains a key consumer protection for federally backed reverse mortgages known as the "95% rule." This provision allows the heirs of a homeowner to settle the reverse mortgage debt by paying either the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever is less. This is particularly significant if the loan balance has grown to exceed the property's market value, preventing heirs from having to pay more than the home is worth to retain it. The rule provides peace of mind for senior homeowners and offers a predictable, more manageable path for their families during estate settlement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, increased to 2.6% in June from a year ago. This uptick is partly attributed to President Trump's tariffs, which have raised prices on certain goods. The core PCE, which excludes food and energy, held steady at 2.8%, reinforcing the Fed's decision to maintain its current interest rate. The report provides evidence of tariff impacts on items like furniture and appliances, while consumer spending and income saw only modest increases, suggesting continued caution among Americans.

Under the extension, Mexico will continue to face a 25% tariff on fentanyl, cars, and a 50% tariff on certain metals.

          <p>During a hearing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, judges sharply questioned the Trump administration's legal basis for imposing sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

Judges noted that IEEPA does not explicitly mention tariffs and expressed concern that the administration's interpretation would grant "unbounded authority" to the president, disrupting the trade framework established by Congress.

          <p>The Brazilian government has announced a compromise regarding import tariffs for Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD. The company will be granted a temporary, six-month tariff exemption in the first half of 2026 for up to $463 million worth of semi-assembled vehicles to support the ramp-up of its new factory in Brazil. However, the government will also accelerate a planned tariff hike on EV kits to 35%, which will now take effect in January 2027. This decision balances BYD's request for relief with pressure from traditional automakers who warned against the risks of the exemption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Species of Giant Stick Insect Discovered in Australia Believed to be Country's Heaviest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 13:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect, Acrophylla alta, in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, Australia. Weighing 44 grams and measuring 40 centimeters long, it is believed to be the heaviest insect ever found in the country. The insect was discovered high in the canopies of the mountainous Wet Tropics region, a habitat that likely contributed to its remaining undiscovered for so long. Researchers suggest its large body mass may be an evolutionary adaptation to help it survive the colder, high-altitude conditions. Two specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum for further study.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether rolling over a 401(k) to an annuity is a sound financial strategy for those nearing retirement, particularly in the current economic climate of high interest rates. While annuities can provide a guaranteed, predictable income stream to protect against market volatility, the decision comes with trade-offs. Converting retirement savings into an annuity can limit liquidity and growth potential, and often involves fees and surrender charges. The article advises individuals to assess their personal risk tolerance, income needs, and proximity to retirement before making such a significant financial move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed its plan to stop sharing crucial satellite weather data that forecasters rely on, especially for tracking hurricanes. The Navy had previously announced it would end the data flow as part of a modernization effort, sparking alarm among scientists who feared it would lead to less accurate storm forecasts. After receiving feedback from government partners, officials found a way to continue providing the data until at least 2026. This information is vital for real-time storm monitoring, issuing timely warnings, and tracking polar sea ice.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Padres have made a significant move before the trade deadline, acquiring All-Star closer Mason Miller and left-handed pitcher JP Sears from the Oakland Athletics. Miller, known for his 101mph fastball, provides a major upgrade to the Padres' bullpen and is under team control through the 2029 season. In exchange, the Athletics received a package of four prospects, including highly-rated shortstop Leo De Vries. The trade aims to bolster the Padres' pitching staff as they compete for a National League wildcard spot.</p>

          <p>Collectible monster dolls called Labubu, from the China-based company Pop Mart, have become a viral fashion accessory and cultural phenomenon in the United States.

The trend has significantly boosted Pop Mart's revenue and stock price, with many consumers who start by buying a Labubu going on to purchase other products from the company.

          <p>This analysis piece from The Atlantic argues that Hamas has a strategic interest in worsening the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, including the growing famine. The author contends that the terror group uses the suffering of civilians to generate international outcry against Israel, hoping to leverage this pressure to end the war on its own terms. The article points to online supporters of Hamas attacking aid efforts and the group's intransigence in ceasefire talks as evidence for this claim. It concludes by suggesting that the best way to undermine Hamas is to flood Gaza with aid.</p>

          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro showed significant heart health benefits compared to its older treatment, Trulicity. The study, involving over 13,000 patients with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, found Mounjaro reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and, notably, showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause. While the results did not meet all analyst benchmarks for superiority, the company believes the data strengthens the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment.

The administration has imposed steep tariffs and sanctioned a supreme court judge, moves widely seen as an attempt to pressure Brazil over the prosecution of former president and Trump ally, Jair Bolsonaro, for an alleged coup attempt. Observers suggest Trump is using U.S. foreign and trade policy for personal political ends, likening his behavior to that of a "tinpot dictator." The pressure campaign has reportedly backfired, damaging Bolsonaro's reputation within Brazil.</p>

The case, which has drawn comparisons to the death of George Floyd, involved hotel staff restraining Mitchell after he reportedly caused a disturbance.
