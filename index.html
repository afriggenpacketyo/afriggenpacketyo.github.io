          <p>United Airlines issued a ground stop for its flights across the United States due to a significant technology issue, impacting major hubs like Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco. The problem caused hundreds of delays and left planes full of passengers waiting on tarmacs as gates became unavailable. While flights already in the air were permitted to continue to their destinations, the outage created a major logistical challenge for the airline. United Express regional flights were not directly affected by the system failure but experienced related delays.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has terminated approximately $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine research projects. Kennedy stated that the administration determined the technology poses more risks than benefits for certain respiratory viruses. The decision has sparked intense criticism from numerous public health experts, scientists, and a Republican senator, who argue the move is not based on scientific evidence. They warn it will undermine U.S. pandemic preparedness and cede a critical technological advantage to other nations.</p>

          <p>This article explores new warnings from longevity specialists regarding the potential health risks of overemphasizing animal-based protein in one's diet. While acknowledging that protein is crucial, particularly for older adults, experts point to research linking excessive consumption of animal products to harmful compounds that can accelerate aging and increase cardiovascular disease risk. The consensus among the featured doctors is to shift dietary focus towards plant-based proteins, such as beans and nuts, as well as fish to promote better long-term health and longevity.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals a stark and growing disparity within England's healthcare system, as patients seeking mental health treatment face significantly longer waits than those with physical conditions. The article highlights the personal toll of this backlog through the story of a young woman with complex PTSD who has been unable to access consistent psychiatric care for a decade. While an innovative walk-in mental health hub in East London is presented as a successful model, the report underscores that systemic challenges and funding priorities leave thousands without timely support.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose a 100% tariff on computer chips and semiconductors made outside the U.S., a policy that would likely raise prices on a wide range of electronics and other goods. The plan explicitly exempts companies that manufacture chips within the United States, creating a powerful incentive for domestic production. This tariff-based strategy represents a significant departure from the subsidy-focused approach of the 2022 CHIPS Act, favoring punitive measures to compel the reshoring of this critical industry.

          <p>Three Americans were successfully rescued from the McMurdo research station in Antarctica during a complex medical evacuation mission. The operation was carried out by New Zealand’s air force, which flew for nearly 20 hours in treacherous mid-winter conditions, including total darkness and extreme cold, to retrieve the individuals who needed urgent medical attention. U.S. officials praised the mission as a flawless execution of a highly challenging and dangerous task, highlighting the skill of the crew and the strong partnership between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In a meeting at the White House, Apple committed to increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total domestic pledge to $600 billion.

The investment aims to expand Apple's U.S. supply chain and directly hire 20,000 American workers, though final iPhone assembly is expected to remain abroad for the time being.

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order to place an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, raising the total import duty to 50%. This action is a direct punitive measure against India for its continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House claims undermines international efforts to counter Russia's war in Ukraine. The new tariff, set to take effect in late August, has been condemned by India's foreign ministry as "unfair" and signals the administration's readiness to sanction major trading partners over the conflict.

          <p>After a former administration staffer was injured in an attempted carjacking, President Trump announced he is considering taking federal control of the Washington, D.C. police force. He also suggested he might seek to overturn the city's half-century of limited self-government, known as home rule, a move that would require congressional action. While Trump frames the potential action as a necessary response to crime, critics and experts see it as a political opportunity to exert federal power over the heavily Democratic capital city, escalating political tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the long-held belief that Pompeii was completely abandoned after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, new archaeological evidence suggests survivors returned to live among the ruins. Researchers have found traces of a precarious settlement, which they describe as a "favela among the ruins," that existed at the site until the 5th century. This discovery indicates that some people, likely those unable to afford a new life elsewhere, reoccupied the city, living in the upper floors of buried structures and salvaging materials from the devastation.</p>

          <p>This article examines China's strategic use of its dominance in the rare earths market as a powerful countermeasure to U.S. technology restrictions. As Washington has implemented export bans on advanced semiconductors to slow China's AI development, Beijing has retaliated with its own export controls on critical minerals. These rare earths are essential for a vast range of technologies, from consumer electronics to defense systems, and China's control over their global refining capacity gives it significant leverage in the escalating geopolitical tech rivalry.
