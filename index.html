        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to continue freezing over $4 billion in foreign aid, siding with the executive branch's power in foreign affairs. The court's conservative majority stated that the potential harm to Trump's conduct of foreign affairs outweighed the potential harm to aid recipients, though liberal justices dissented, arguing the move conflicts with the separation of powers. The Trump administration has been downsizing US foreign aid operations, criticizing them as wasteful or contrary to US foreign policy. Humanitarian groups warn that these cuts could have dire consequences for global health, potentially leading to millions of additional deaths. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance responded to a social media post mocking Trump supporters and accused 'left-wing radicals' of inciting violence. This came after Vance criticized those who denigrate law enforcement, blaming them for encouraging violence after a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas. Vance has also linked the death of Charlie Kirk to 'left-wing political radicalization.' His remarks follow a controversy surrounding Bud Light's partnership with a transgender influencer, which sparked backlash. Optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed Smartmatic by falsely claiming its voting machines rigged the 2020 election. The judge deferred the question of whether Lindell acted with 'actual malice,' which Smartmatic needs to prove to collect damages.

Smartmatic is seeking 'nine-figure damages' from Lindell and MyPillow, while Lindell vowed to keep fighting against voting machines. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>India's intensified security operations against Maoist rebels, aimed at ending the insurgency by March 2026, are raising concerns about the human cost. While the government reports increased success in killing rebels, rights activists worry about the impact on tribal communities caught in the crossfire. Locals in Chhattisgarh allege that security operations often blur the line between armed rebels and ordinary civilians. The government defends its 'zero-tolerance' policy, but activists oppose including locals in security units. Optimism score is 35.</p>
