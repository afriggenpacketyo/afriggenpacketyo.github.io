          <p>Severe storms, including a possible tornado, swept through St. Louis, resulting in at least four deaths and several injuries, as reported by Mayor Cara Spencer. The storms caused significant damage, including collapsed buildings, downed trees, and power lines, prompting urgent warnings for residents to seek shelter. The National Weather Service indicated a tornado touched down in Clayton, Missouri, near Forest Park, home to the St. Louis Zoo, which closed due to the weather. The weather system also spawned tornadoes in Wisconsin, caused power outages in the Great Lakes region, and brought a heat wave to Texas, with warnings issued for severe weather across Appalachia and the Midwest.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service questioned former F.B.I. Director James Comey about a social media post featuring seashells arranged to form "86 47," a phrase critical of Donald Trump. This action followed claims from Trump administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who suggested the post was an assassination threat. Comey deleted the post, stating he was unaware of the violent connotations some associated with the numbers. Trump, in an interview, accused Comey of calling for his assassination and suggested Attorney General Pam Bondi should handle the matter, continuing his long-standing criticism of the former FBI director.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to release audio recordings of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur, who investigated Biden's handling of classified information. This decision comes after Republicans have long demanded the audio, claiming it would reveal a decline in Biden's mental acuity, even though a transcript has already been released. The article notes that an excerpt of the audio was posted by Axios, featuring Biden struggling to recall dates, including the year of his son's death. Hur's report concluded that Biden carelessly kept classified documents but did not recommend charges, describing Biden as "an elderly man with a poor memory."</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings has downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over the increasing government debt and the rising costs of financing the budget deficit. The downgrade reflects a failure by successive administrations to address large fiscal deficits and growing interest expenses. Moody's expects federal deficits to widen, reaching nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, with the debt burden rising to 134% of GDP. The downgrade led to a slight increase in Treasury yields and a dip in stock futures, aligning Moody's with other agencies like S&P and Fitch, which had previously downgraded the U.S.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates, considered "armed and dangerous," escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans, prompting a large-scale manhunt involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. Authorities believe the escape was aided by inside help, as the inmates broke through a cell wall and exited the facility through a loading dock. One inmate was apprehended in downtown New Orleans using facial recognition technology. Sheriff Susan Huston cited defective locks and doors as contributing factors and criticized the city for not funding prison security upgrades, while police are investigating possible staff involvement in the escape.</p>

Senior Assistant City Attorney Michael J. Dundas advised the council to delay the vote to comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act, but the council proceeded anyway. A do-over vote was held two days later, yielding the same result.

The decision came after months of lobbying from Syria's transitional government, which has blamed sanctions for its inability to pay civil service salaries and rebuild the war-ravaged country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that relief may come in the form of waivers allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties, while the administration may seek to permanently repeal some sanctions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 ruling, extended its injunction temporarily barring the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, citing insufficient time and information for detainees to contest their removals. The case was remanded to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the process necessary to satisfy the Constitution. President Trump criticized the ruling, while the ACLU praised the decision as a pause on the use of the Alien Enemies Act.

          <p>A Wisconsin angler discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that had been submerged in Lake Michigan for over a century. The tugboat, built in 1881, was once one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes, used for moving lumber and transporting railway cars. It was scuttled in 1923 and remained buried in the sand until storms recently exposed it. Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks in the Great Lakes before invasive quagga mussels destroy them.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's request to remove a temporary block on deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The justices ruled that people must have the opportunity to contest their removal from the United States, without determining whether Trump's invocation of the law was appropriate. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, challenging Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The court made it clear that it was not blocking other ways the government may deport people.</p>

Another point of contention is a tripling of a local tax deduction - known as Salt - from $10,000 to $30,000 for couples.</p>
