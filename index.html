          <p>The U.S. administration has officially announced new tariffs on nearly 70 countries, with rates ranging from 10% to as high as 41% for nations like Syria. This executive order, set to take effect in seven days, categorizes trading partners based on their trade balance with the U.S., imposing higher duties on countries with larger deficits. While some nations like Japan and the European Union secured lower rates through recent agreements, Canada faces a separate, steep 35% tariff. The move aims to reshape global commerce rules but has drawn criticism for creating economic uncertainty and for the administration's struggle to finalize comprehensive trade deals.

This incident has raised concerns as it echoes a similar attack that occurred in the same city just last year. In that previous event, a Chinese man attacked another Japanese mother and child, and a Chinese woman who bravely intervened to protect them was tragically killed.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In July, Russia launched a record-breaking 6,443 drones and missiles into Ukraine, marking the highest monthly total since the full-scale invasion began. This escalation represents a 13% increase from June and highlights the growing scale and complexity of Moscow's aerial assault campaign. The Iranian-designed Shahed drones, now produced in Russia, have become the primary tool for these nightly attacks on cities and infrastructure. Despite Ukraine's air defenses intercepting a high percentage of these projectiles, the sheer volume has led to a significant rise in civilian casualties, with the UN reporting the deadliest month for civilians in over three years. </p>

          <p>Countries around the world are responding to the latest U.S. tariff announcements, with reactions ranging from relief to disappointment. Nations like Cambodia and Thailand expressed positive sentiments after seeing their proposed tariff rates significantly reduced, while allies like Japan welcomed the certainty of a finalized, lower rate. In contrast, countries such as New Zealand and Switzerland voiced regret over facing higher duties, vowing to continue negotiations. The varied outcomes reflect a complex series of bilateral talks, with many nations scrambling to adapt to the new trade landscape and mitigate the economic impact on their industries and consumers.

          <p>A devastating wave of Russian missiles and drones struck Kyiv, killing at least 31 people and injuring over 150, prompting a day of mourning in the Ukrainian capital. The attack occurred despite a warning from the U.S. president, who had given Russia a deadline to agree to a ceasefire or face tougher sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike, stating that Russia used over 3,800 drones and nearly 260 missiles in July alone and called for increased international pressure and sanctions against Moscow. The continued bombardment underscores Russia's defiance of diplomatic pressures aimed at de-escalating the conflict.</p>

          <p>In response to escalating cartel violence, the Mexican government has deployed over 7,000 military and security personnel to popular tourist areas like Cancún and the Riviera Maya. This initiative, dubbed "Operation Summer Vacation 2025," aims to protect the millions of travelers visiting the region with a coordinated presence of land, air, and sea patrols. While the government intends for the show of force to reassure visitors, some security experts suggest the sight of heavily armed soldiers may instead serve as a stark reminder of the underlying danger. The U.S. State Department maintains a Level 2 travel advisory for the area, urging travelers to exercise increased caution.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, raising concerns that it could dismantle key protections for boxers. Backed by TKO Holdings Group, the parent company of UFC, the legislation proposes creating alternative 'Unified Boxing Organizations' (UBOs) that would allow promoters to control fighter rankings and titles. Critics argue this guts the original Ali Act, which was designed to prevent the exploitation of fighters by separating promoters from sanctioning bodies. The move is seen as clearing the path for Zuffa Boxing, a new venture between TKO and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, to establish a UFC-style monopoly over the sport.</p>

The BBC has stated it was not an easy decision but opted to broadcast the series, filmed before the sackings, after consulting with the contestants.

In one tragic case, a fire in an illegal HMO, caused by a faulty e-bike battery, resulted in the death of one resident. Despite laws requiring licenses for such properties, data suggests that in some boroughs, illegal HMOs may outnumber legal ones by a significant margin, overwhelming the capacity of local councils to enforce safety standards.</p>

          <p>Veteran actor Brian Cox is returning to the Scottish stage in "Make it Happen," a new play about the dramatic rise and fall of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The production is a highlight of the Edinburgh International Festival, which is kicking off alongside the massive Edinburgh Fringe, transforming the city into the world's largest arts venue. Cox, known for his role in "Succession," plays the ghost of economist Adam Smith in the biting satire. At 79, he remains focused on using his platform for protest, stating his tough upbringing in Dundee has rooted him in a desire to see ordinary people get a better break.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's legislature has approved constitutional reforms that remove term limits and allow for indefinite presidential reelection, a move that solidifies President Nayib Bukele's power. The changes, passed with a 57-3 majority by Bukele's New Ideas party, also extend the presidential term from five to six years and eliminate the need for a runoff election. This decision has been heavily criticized by opposition lawmakers and civil society groups, who argue it dismantles democratic checks and balances and consolidates an authoritarian regime. The reform places El Salvador alongside Venezuela and Nicaragua as one of the few Latin American countries permitting unlimited reelection.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian military reports are beginning to confirm the use of new, faster jet-powered versions of the Shahed attack drone by Russian forces. These upgraded loitering munitions, unofficially dubbed Geran-3, are believed to be modeled on Iran's Shahed-238 and can reportedly reach speeds up to 500 mph. This significant increase in speed poses a major challenge for Ukraine's air defenses, particularly for the mobile fire groups that have been effective against the slower, propeller-driven models. If deployed en masse, these jet-powered drones could overwhelm current defensive strategies and require the use of more advanced and costly anti-air missile systems.</p>

          <p>Florida emergency officials have released a heavily redacted 33-page draft plan for evacuating the "Alligator Alcatraz" detention center, sparking demands for greater transparency from lawmakers and advocates. The document outlines general protocols for a hurricane but blacks out crucial details, including the locations of alternate facilities where detainees would be relocated. While state officials insist the facility is prepared and can withstand a Category 2 hurricane, critics argue that the lack of a clear, public plan is unacceptable. Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who has called the facility an "internment camp," stated that the DeSantis administration cannot be trusted with blacked-out information.</p>

          <p>Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has formally requested a trade amid stalled contract negotiations. The two-time Pro Bowl selection, who is entering the final year of his contract, had been holding out of training camp before reporting on Sunday to avoid further fines. McLaurin is coming off a career year where he recorded 1,096 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns, playing a crucial role in the team's successful season. His trade request signals a significant rift between the star player and the organization as he seeks a new long-term deal commensurate with his on-field production.</p>

          <p>This commentary explores the profound financial anxiety and burnout experienced by many millennial women who were encouraged to pursue their passions, particularly in creative fields. The author reflects on her own struggles with economic instability, contrasting her reality with the security achieved by her parents' generation and even her male peers. The article argues that this is a systemic issue, rooted in the undervaluation of women's labor, a lack of financial literacy education, and an economy that relies on their flexibility and unpaid work. Ultimately, it portrays a generation of women grappling with broken promises and the harsh realities of modern economic life.</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait have pledged to strengthen their military relationship as a new joint ammunition factory in Kuwait nears its inauguration. At an event marking the founding of China's People's Liberation Army, Kuwait's deputy minister of defence called the factory a "milestone" in their cooperation. The two nations, which first signed a military cooperation agreement in 1995, will also continue to expand joint training programs. This development reflects Beijing's deepening engagement and growing influence in the Gulf region, even with countries like Kuwait that are traditionally key allies of the United States.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a detailed explanation of what trade tariffs are and how they function as a tool of economic policy. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, which can lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers, potentially encouraging the purchase of domestic products. The current U.S. administration has been using tariffs aggressively to try and reduce the national trade deficit and protect American industries, imposing specific duties on goods like steel and cars, as well as broad-based tariffs on individual countries. This strategy has caused significant volatility in the global economy and has been met with both support for its protectionist goals and criticism for its market-disrupting effects.

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen nearly $200 million in federal research grants to UCLA, citing the university's alleged failure to combat antisemitism and its use of race in admissions. The funding suspension, affecting an estimated 300 grants from agencies like the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health, marks a significant escalation in the administration's scrutiny of higher education institutions. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk called the penalty deeply disappointing, stating that defunding life-saving research does nothing to address discrimination. This action follows a Justice Department finding that UCLA violated the civil rights of Jewish students and comes amid similar pressures on other elite universities.</p>
