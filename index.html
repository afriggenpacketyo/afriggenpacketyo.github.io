          <p>The NHL has suspended Doug Cifu, a minority owner of the Florida Panthers, for posting inflammatory comments on social media during a playoff series against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Cifu engaged in a heated exchange with a fan regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict and made a remark about Canada being the "51st state." After the exchange, Cifu apologized for his behavior, stating that his comments did not reflect the standards of the Florida Panthers organization and that he would work with the NHL to amend his actions. The series between Florida and Toronto is currently tied, adding tension to the situation. Optimism surrounding the situation is low due to the sensitive nature of the exchange.</p>

Founded in 2007, eToro competes with platforms like Robinhood and generates revenue through trading fees and other activities.

          <p>A forthcoming book titled ‚ÄúOriginal Sin‚Äù by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, details how former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.‚Äôs aides allegedly quashed concerns about his mental and physical decline while in the White House. The book, based heavily on anonymous sources, suggests that Biden's advisers downplayed his age-related limitations, including instances where he forgot names of longtime aides and allies. While the book doesn't contain explosive revelations, it paints a picture of an aging president whose inner circle spent more time avoiding the issue of his diminishing abilities than addressing it directly. The book highlights the reluctance of many Democrats to openly criticize Biden's fitness for office, even after his departure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, which will remove deportation protections for over 8,000 individuals. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Afghanistan's improved security situation and stabilizing economy no longer prevent their return, despite the Taliban's takeover in 2021 and ongoing humanitarian crisis. This decision has drawn criticism from advocates who argue it will have long-lasting ripple effects, particularly for those who worked with the U.S. military during the war. The administration is also seeking to roll back TPS for Venezuela, but that move has been halted by a judge.</p>

While some programs are resuming, many workers remain laid-off, and other CDC scientists have not been reinstated, despite calls from states and lawmakers.

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods, resulting from a temporary agreement between the U.S. and China, are prompting Chinese car-parts makers to reassess plans to build production facilities in the U.S. The U.S. agreed to lower its tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145 per cent to 30 per cent for 90 days, cooling tensions between the two countries. While Chinese vendors are confident that U.S. customers will still buy their products, the uncertainty surrounding future tariff rates is hindering deal-making.

The proposal aims for a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could allow Trump to claim a better agreement than Obama's.

          <p>An artificial intelligence (AI) tool has been used to sort through comments about botox and lip fillers submitted as part of a public consultation in Scotland, marking the first use of this kind in the UK. The tool, dubbed "Consult", came up with "nearly identical" results compared to humans performing the same task. Officials hope that Consult will spare civil servants from similar time-consuming tasks in the future, saving taxpayers an estimated ¬£20m. The AI tool examined 2,000 submissions, identifying themes and cataloging answers, with human experts checking its work at both stages.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers in China has cautioned against the rapid adoption of DeepSeek's AI in hospitals, citing potential clinical safety and privacy risks. As of early March, at least 300 hospitals in China have started using DeepSeek‚Äôs large language models (LLMs) in clinical diagnostics and medical decision support. The researchers warned that DeepSeek‚Äôs tendency to generate ‚Äúplausible but factually incorrect outputs‚Äù could lead to ‚Äúsubstantial clinical risk.‚Äù They also noted that hospitals may lack comprehensive cybersecurity infrastructure, despite choosing private, on-site deployment of DeepSeek models to mitigate security and privacy risks.</p>

Hungria's research focused on isolating useful strains of bacteria called rhizobia, which capture nitrogen from the air and convert it into a form that feeds plants. Her work has contributed to Brazil becoming an agricultural superpower and has enabled farmers to reduce their reliance on chemical fertilizers. She plans to use the prize money to fund a new award recognizing women in agriculture, microbiology, communications, or for the benefit of people with special needs.</p>

The FDA claims that ingested fluoride changes the human microbiome in a concerning way, even though the research it cites is inconclusive, which contradicts years of research and best practices established by professional medical groups. The move is seen as a contradiction to recommendations from the CDC and professional medical associations, which recommend low doses of fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water and at high risk of cavities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed he wouldn't allow Medicaid to be cut, but House Republicans' bill to fund his agenda aims to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the program. Despite his promises, the bill plans to slash Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements, making more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposal would save $715 billion over the next decade, but at least 8.6 million more Americans will go uninsured. The legislation has received pushback from both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing down inflation to a 2% rate. Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, and energy costs also ticked higher, despite lower gasoline prices. Economists are looking for early signs that Mr. Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households. With inflation still expected to pick up later this year, the Fed may decide to cut rates twice in 2025, rather than the three cuts Daco had earlier expected. (not investment advice)</p>

Russia and Iran appear to be honing their strategies after watching Trump in action, hinting at investment opportunities for Americans if the United States eases off its demands. The article suggests that Trump's goals in imposing tariffs are to use them as a cudgel and to make his minimum 10 percent tariff on all foreign goods look like a bargain.
