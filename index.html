          <p>A new report accuses big tech firms like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of enabling the widespread piracy of premium video services, particularly live sports. The research by Enders Analysis points to the Amazon Fire Stick as a key device used to access illegal streams, costing broadcasters revenue and exposing users to cyber-crime risks. Sky and DAZN executives have warned that piracy is causing a financial crisis in the broadcast industry, while the report highlights the risk of malware and phishing scams for users of illegal streams. Amazon states it is vigilant in combating piracy and has made changes to Fire devices to hinder illegal streaming.</p>

          <p>Paul Doyle, a former Royal Marine, appeared in court accused of deliberately driving his car into a crowd following Liverpool FC's trophy parade, injuring 79 people.

The incident involved six victims, including two children, and occurred just off the parade route where jubilant fans celebrated Liverpool's Premier League win. Doyle did not apply for bail and will appear in court again in August for a plea hearing, with a trial provisionally set for November.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure steering President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has ended, though Trump suggests Musk will continue to assist the administration. Musk's DOGE aimed to overhaul and downsize the federal government, resulting in significant cuts to federal spending and the workforce. While DOGE claimed $175 billion in savings through asset sales and contract cancellations, many of its staffing cuts were challenged in court. Despite praise from Trump, Musk's controversial methods and criticism of Trump's "big beautiful bill" caused friction, and Democrats plan to target Musk's influence in upcoming elections.</p>

While interest rates for these options are lower than other borrowing methods, caution is advised due to the current economic climate.

Borrowers should carefully calculate monthly payment costs and factor in potential changes in interest rates and inflation to ensure affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ban on single-use vapes in the UK is unlikely to significantly reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to teenagers, according to Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). Chief executive Hazel Cheeseman argues that new reusable vapes are very similar to disposables, maintaining the appeal due to bright colors, low prices, and easy availability. While welcoming the legislation, Cheeseman believes stronger actions, such as regulating packaging and advertising, are needed to deter young people who have never smoked. The government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill aims to address these issues.</p>

While she has released four re-recorded albums, she had delayed remaking 2017's Reputation, citing its specific connection to that period of her life; however, she promised that vault tracks from the record would be released at a future date.</p>

While a network of satellites and communication systems could track inbound missiles, the capability to eliminate them using space-based weapons is not expected to be ready, and the technology to kill ballistic missiles in their early launch phase remains in development.</p>

          <p>A suspected drone attack by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan hit a hospital in El-Obeid, resulting in six deaths and at least twelve injuries. An army source reported that the RSF attack targeted residential areas with heavy artillery, impacting a second hospital. The hospital was rendered out of service due to the attack. The conflict between the RSF and the Sudanese army has caused a humanitarian crisis, with thousands killed and millions displaced, leading to famine conditions in parts of the country.</p>

          <p>Local governments in Brevard County, Florida, will ban lawn fertilizing from June 1 to September 30 to protect the Indian River Lagoon from nutrient pollution. The ban aims to reduce the influx of nitrogen and phosphorus, which fuel toxic algal blooms that harm marine life. Violators could face fines up to $500, though the focus is on educating the public. While advocates cite seagrass gains in other estuaries after similar bans, some argue that depriving grass of nutrients can worsen leaching at other times of the year.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant about becoming parents, citing factors beyond financial concerns. The author suggests a shift in the understanding of harm and trauma has created an impossibly high standard for parenting. Millennials expect parents to provide not only basic needs but also to ensure their children's career success and mental well-being into adulthood. This cultural shift contributes to a fear of causing harm and a reluctance to perpetuate intergenerational patterns of misery.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve signaling that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers are advised to take proactive steps to manage their finances. Experts recommend paying down high-interest credit card debt, locking in high-yield savings rates, and improving credit scores. By switching to a zero-interest balance transfer card, consolidating debt with a lower-rate personal loan, or negotiating with lenders, borrowers can reduce interest payments. Consumers can also benefit from moving their money into high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit before rates potentially decrease.</p>

The study contradicts claims made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.
