          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has voiced concerns over President Trump's recent strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities. Himes characterized the strikes as a "massive gamble" undertaken without Congressional approval, which he argues is a violation of the Constitution. He cautioned against premature celebration, citing historical precedents of U.S. military interventions in the Middle East leading to unfavorable outcomes. Himes also highlighted potential worst-case scenarios, including Iranian retaliation and the continued development of nuclear weapons in secret.</p>

          <p>Iran's parliament has reportedly approved a measure to block the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that could alienate neighbors and trade partners. The decision now rests with the country's national security council. Experts suggest that such a closure could lead to higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions, with the U.S. urging China to intervene. Disrupting supplies through the Strait would also negatively impact Iran's market in Asia, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports (not investment advice).</p>

Rahmani questions why Gina, identified as Victim 3 in the indictment, did not testify, speculating about potential reasons for her absence, including fear or bribery. He also questions why Diddy's chief of staff, Kristina "KK" Khorram, wasn't called to testify, despite testimony suggesting she played a central role. Rahmani further raises questions about why Diddy's ex-girlfriends didn't leave if they were sexually assaulted and trafficked, suggesting the jury must separate emotions from facts during deliberation.</p>

          <p>The National Terrorism Advisory System has issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While there are no specific, credible threats at this time, the bulletin cautions about potential low-level cyber attacks and possible attacks by Iranian-affiliated cyber actors. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators. The bulletin also notes the possibility of violent extremists independently mobilizing in response to the conflict if Iranian leadership calls for retaliatory violence.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have discovered the first evidence suggesting that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may impact the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. By monitoring superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays, they observed quasiparticle bursts leading to correlated errors. The findings could be significant for scaling quantum processors and designing fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The team proposes that their detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection, opening new avenues for research.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Russia's response to Iran's call for help is being closely monitored, but Moscow is unlikely to offer significant assistance. While Iran has provided military drones to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine, analysts suggest that Russia has limited capacity and willingness to reciprocate. Russia must also balance its relationship with Iran against its desire to improve ties with the U.S., particularly under a potentially more Russia-friendly Trump administration.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), as the U.S. pushes for greater financial commitment. This increase is driven by ongoing conflict in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East. While some member states are close to or willing to meet the target, others lag behind the previously agreed 2% threshold. The success of these pledges hinges on whether member states follow through with concrete action, which the U.S. and President Trump are keen to see (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Despite being the most sanctioned nation on Earth, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

However, the economy faces challenges including high inflation, rising interest rates, and worker shortages.

One firm near Chicago's O'Hare airport helped import millions of these illegal vapes in 2024, despite FDA regulations. These vapes, often appealing to children with fruit and candy flavors, are sold by distributors to smaller wholesalers and retailers nationwide. While the FDA and CBP have seized millions of illegal vapes, the supply chain continues to operate largely in plain sight.</p>
