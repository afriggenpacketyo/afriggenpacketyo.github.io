          <p>A police officer in Jacksonville, Florida, has been suspended following the emergence of viral video showing him punching a driver during a traffic stop. The driver, William McNeil Jr, posted footage of the officer smashing his car window and striking him. Police later released bodycam footage showing McNeil refusing commands to exit his vehicle after being stopped for traffic violations. While a state prosecutor found no criminal misconduct, the officer faces an internal review for potential policy violations.</p>

Trump also stated that Japan would invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The agreement, which was confirmed by Japanese officials, aims to rebalance trade and is expected to create a large number of jobs in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prisoners who were relocated from Iran's notorious Evin Prison following an Israeli airstrike one month ago are reporting inhumane and unbearable conditions in their new facilities. Families of detainees describe severe overcrowding, lack of beds and air conditioning, and insect infestations in prisons like Fashafouyeh. The Israeli attack on Evin, which Israel claimed was used for intelligence operations, killed 80 people and has been condemned by Amnesty International as a potential war crime that requires a criminal investigation.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company is set to implement a 'low double-digit' price increase across its candy portfolio, citing the unprecedented spike in global cocoa costs. The price of cocoa has skyrocketed due to poor harvests in West Africa, which have been impacted by climate change and disease. Hershey stated the change is unrelated to trade policy and is a direct reflection of rising ingredient costs, as the company also plans to pivot towards products that are less reliant on cocoa.
