          <p>Defense Secretary John Healey anticipates the UK's defense spending will rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, a target underpinning the government's upcoming strategic defense review. The review, a 130-page document, will address priorities for military and security spending, warning of emerging threats like drones and AI, and describing Russia as an immediate danger and China as a sophisticated challenge. Meeting the 3% target, however, would require an additional Â£17.3 billion in 2029-30, according to the OBR, while the Ministry of Defence plans to allocate over Â£1.5 billion to improve military housing conditions following a critical report on service family homes.</p>

While reassuring that "America First" does not mean "America alone," he cautioned against dual alignment with China, highlighting the risks of economic dependence on China deepening its malign influence and complicating defense decisions during times of tension. </p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against a Kansas law that nullifies a pregnant woman's advance medical directive regarding end-of-life treatment. Three women and two physicians are challenging the law's constitutionality, arguing it violates rights to personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment, and freedom of speech. The lawsuit asserts the law forces doctors to provide a lower standard of care to pregnant patients and exposes them to legal penalties for disregarding their patientsâ€™ clearly expressed end-of-life decisions. The plaintiffs seek to ensure pregnant women have the same rights as others to make healthcare decisions.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a Â£2 billion upgrade project. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project, initially conceived in 1990, faced significant overspends, delays, and environmental challenges, including the planting of 285,000 trees to offset CO2 emissions and relocating wildlife. While Welsh ministers tout the upgrade's benefits, critics question the project's cost and duration.</p>

          <p>BBC Sport has launched an interactive game called UEFA Champions League Squares, allowing participants to earn edit tokens by answering trivia questions before each matchday. These tokens can be used to make changes to the gamecard, such as marking a square as correct, flipping a team, or swapping a square for another randomly selected tile. Points can be scored in various ways, with extra time considered during the knockout stages, but not penalty shootouts, and more details about game instructions can be found in the How to Play section within the game itself.</p>
