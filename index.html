          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a long-standing dispute between the two countries. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea after South Korean authorities arrested thieves and confiscated the statue. Buseoksa Temple in South Korea filed a lawsuit claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, but South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023, leading to the completion of return procedures in January.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its intention to release Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American hostage, as part of efforts to achieve a ceasefire agreement and facilitate humanitarian aid to Gaza. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, and direct negotiations between Hamas and a US administration official in Qatar. The Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire or the release of any Palestinian prisoners, stating that preparations were being made to intensify fighting, and the release of Mr Alexander had been made possible because of military pressure on Hamas. The release is intended as a goodwill gesture before Trump's arrival, with further negotiations expected to follow.</p>

          <p>After four days of intense hostilities, the US played a decisive role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir region. Foreign policy experts from both countries believe that though the de-escalation might mark the end of the two countries' worst military confrontation in 25 years, the foreign-brokered ceasefire will not easily lead to an enduring peace. The US leveraged IMF conditionalities to hasten the end of hostilities, with India establishing a new doctrinal normal of zero tolerance to terrorism. While the involvement of the US was important, Saudi Arabia and Iran also emerged as key mediators due to their strong economic and diplomatic ties with both India and Pakistan.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, including English language tests for adult dependents of foreign workers and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad, to control immigration levels. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasizes that new immigrants must earn the right to stay, viewing settlement as a privilege rather than an automatic right. The government aims to seize the narrative from Reform UK, a party gaining traction by criticizing current immigration policies. The new measures also include prioritizing residency rights for migrants who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, or volunteer in the community, while increasing the waiting period for citizenship to ten years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 00:08:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traders have rebranded over $1 billion of Venezuelan oil shipments to China as Brazilian crude over the past year to circumvent US sanctions and reduce logistics costs. This practice allows tankers to sail directly from Venezuela to China, avoiding stops in Malaysia, which has traditionally been a trans-shipment hub. Shippers are also tampering with tankers' location signals to make it appear as though vessels are departing from Brazilian ports when they are actually sailing from Venezuela, a practice known as spoofing. Chinese customs data indicates significant imports of mixed bitumen from Brazil, a product Brazil rarely exports, further supporting the claim of rebranded Venezuelan oil.</p>

          <p>The US and China have reported substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, with both sides expressing optimism about de-escalating trade tensions. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng called them "in-depth" and "candid". The talks, the first face-to-face meetings since the US imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, have raised hopes for a reduction in trade barriers and a more stable global economy. A joint statement with full details is expected, potentially including cuts to tariffs that have caused turmoil in financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who faces International Criminal Court charges for crimes against humanity, remains popular in the Philippines, as evidenced by the outpouring of support following his arrest and extradition to The Hague.

His sudden arrest has divided the Philippines, with some polls showing majority support for the international investigation, while many supporters view him as a victim of political persecution. The upcoming midterm elections could be pivotal for his daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who faces impeachment charges.</p>

          <h2>Former Malaysian PM Mahathir Warns Tariffs Will Harm the US More</h2>

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad argues that President Donald Trump's tariffs will hurt Americans more than targeted countries, increasing the US cost of living. He suggests that American products cannot compete with cheaper products from the rest of the world, leading to economic suffering for the US. Mahathir believes ASEAN can weather the tariff impact through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States. He advocates for peace and dialogue rather than retaliation in response to the US tariffs.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, based in San Fernando, CA, voluntarily recalled several premade food items after federal regulators found a strain of listeria on its equipment linked to an outbreak first identified last year. The recalled food was distributed in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington between April 18 and 28. The company took this action as a precautionary measure to ensure the continued safety of consumers. This outbreak was originally identified in 2024 when officials at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started investigating a cluster of people sickened by listeria.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tie what Medicare pays for medications administered in a doctor's office to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to lower drug costs in the United States, but the proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. The plan would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office, such as infusions that treat cancer and other injectables.</p>
