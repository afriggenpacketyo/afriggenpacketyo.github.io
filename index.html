          <p>High-speed trains between Cologne and Berlin have been canceled for two weeks due to upgrades at Cologne railway station, a major European transport hub serving around 180,000 passengers daily. Network operator Deutsche Bahn is installing a new electronic signal box until May 19, causing disruptions to several regional and suburban railway lines. Trains to Brussels are being diverted via Krefeld, while services connecting Hamburg, Bremen, and Cologne will operate normally. The upgrade impacts connections to Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria, affecting six regional express lines and suburban routes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease, specifically metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The study involved 800 participants across 37 countries who received weekly semaglutide injections or a placebo. After 72 weeks, 62.9% of the semaglutide group showed less inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers, compared to 34.3% in the placebo group. The semaglutide group also experienced improvements in liver fibrosis, liver enzymes, and weight loss, though some adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an article in The Guardian, global press freedom is declining due to vaguely worded laws that criminalize organizations and individuals receiving foreign funding. Countries in eastern Europe, central Asia, and South America have adopted such laws, impacting independent media and NGOs. Russia's "foreign agent" law, for example, has forced at least 93 independent media outlets into exile, requiring them to include disclaimers on all published materials. The article highlights the need for legal representation and guidance for journalists facing these challenges, as these laws can be weaponized to stifle dissent and limit the ability to report freely.</p>

          <p>Ed Miliband's climate change team is under scrutiny due to alleged ties to extremist groups like Extinction Rebellion (XR).

Rachel Kyte, the UK's climate envoy, has also expressed support for XR. Critics argue that Miliband's team's radical views could lead to disastrous energy policies, while supporters maintain that bold action is necessary to address climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Catholic Church is experiencing a decline in Latin America, with a significant shift towards evangelical churches. In Lima, Peru, evangelical services attract thousands, contrasting sharply with dwindling attendance in Catholic churches. A Pew Research Center study indicates that only 69% of Latin Americans identified as Catholic in 2013, down from 94% in the 1950s. This trend is attributed to rapid social changes, rural-to-urban migration, and changing attitudes on social issues, with evangelical churches offering a more direct and charismatic approach that resonates with the working and lower middle classes.</p>

The NAHT is seeking a judicial review of plans for new school report cards, arguing they amount to "another crude grading system." This decision follows concerns raised by the sister of Ruth Perry, a head teacher who took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, who called for a delay in implementing the new system. Ofsted maintains that the changes support mental health and that the union's legal claims are untenable.</p>

Former President Nana Akufo-Addo spent around $58 million of public money on the $400 million project, which has now become a symbol of economic mismanagement. The new government has ceased funding and dissolved the agency managing the project, which is now a target of the anticorruption initiative, Operation Recover All Loot.

          <p>Analysts are skeptical about Ukraine's capacity to rival China as a top source of critical minerals for the U.S., despite a recent deal between Washington and Kyiv. Most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are located in Russian-occupied territories, and extracting the remaining deposits will take years due to a lack of processing infrastructure. China controls about 60% of the world's rare earth element reserves and 90% of all refining, making it difficult for Ukraine to compete in the near future. The U.S. Geological Survey considers 50 minerals to be critical, including the 17 rare earth elements.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding a general election amidst concerns over rising living costs, housing availability, and potential economic fallout from trade tensions with the United States. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test against a rejuvenated opposition, with the People's Action Party (PAP) seeking a strong mandate to navigate the country through economic uncertainty. The PAP has ruled since 1965, but the opposition is appealing to voters for a stronger voice in Parliament and greater scrutiny of government policies. US President Donald Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on Singapore-made goods, currently paused for 90 days.</p>

          <p>Europe is exploring ways to reduce its reliance on U.S. credit card firms like Visa and Mastercard due to security concerns. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), has expressed alarm over the region's dependence on foreign-owned payment platforms. While some experts argue that the ECB's warnings are overstated, others highlight the growing dominance of American tech firms in mobile payments. The ECB is promoting the idea of a digital euro as a potential solution, while projects like the European Payments Initiative (EPI) and Wero are working on homegrown alternatives.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the U.S. economy is off to a chaotic start, with the first quarter showing a contraction in GDP after three years of growth. The decline is attributed to trade distortions and weaker consumer spending, with the administration's new tariffs adding to the uncertainty. While Trump blames the previous administration for any negative numbers, he credits his policies for positive economic indicators. The erratic rollout of tariffs has created widespread confusion and uncertainty, impacting businesses and consumers alike, and raising concerns about a potential recession.</p>

Voters are primarily focused on bread-and-butter issues, with both major parties offering small-scale measures to alleviate economic pressures. The election also reflects a shift away from the two major parties, with voters increasingly turning to independent candidates and minor parties. The campaign has seen cultural clashes and comparisons to President Trump, with voters expressing concerns about the tone of political discourse.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species. This could lead to a universal antivenom, which is significant because current therapies must match the specific snake species. The research identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin, offering protection against 13 of 19 deadly elapid species in mice experiments.</p>

          <p>Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms are experiencing a decline in advertising revenue due to the elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods. The loophole had enabled the rise of low-cost online retailers like Temu and Shein, which heavily invested in digital advertising. President Trump's elimination of the exemption now subjects these companies to tariffs of up to 145 percent. Temu has already stopped shipping products directly from China, and both Temu and Shein have reduced their advertising spending, impacting Meta's revenue from Asian retailers.</p>
