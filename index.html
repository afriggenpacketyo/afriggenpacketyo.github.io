          <p>China's ambitious Guo Wang broadband mega constellation project faces potential delays following the recent failure of a LandSpace Zhuque-2E rocket. The privately developed rocket, which had successfully launched two satellites previously, reportedly lost four experimental Guo Wang satellites after takeoff from the Gobi Desert. This incident occurred shortly after LandSpace was selected as a preferred launcher for the Qianfan constellation, a rival initiative. The setback impacts China's goal of having 400 Guo Wang satellites in orbit by 2027, with only 72 currently launched.</p>

The attacks, largely occurring in late-night or early-morning hours, followed a similar modus operandi where the assailant approached victims from behind. Police identified 37-year-old Dynel Walker as the alleged perpetrator, arresting him three days after the last reported incidents. Walker faces multiple charges, and authorities are investigating if he is responsible for other cases, while the community seeks to restore a sense of safety.</p>

          <p>Microplastics, tiny plastic particles, are increasingly detected in human bodies and the food supply, with recent studies showing a significant rise in plastic content in human brains. Derived from petrochemicals, a profitable segment of the fossil fuel industry, microplastics pose a growing concern, challenging industry claims of their harmlessness. As oil demand from transportation declines due to electrification, major oil and gas companies are heavily investing in petrochemical production, making any pushback on plastics a direct threat to their future profits. Scientists emphasize the lack of widespread monitoring for these minute particles in our environment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has significantly expanded the qualified education expenses for 529 college savings plans, making them more versatile for families. Funds can now cover vocational programs, professional licensing, continuing education, and K-12 expenses beyond tuition, including tutoring and test prep. Despite these benefits, a Vanguard survey indicates that only 10% of parents utilize 529 plans, with most preferring traditional savings accounts. The new law also introduces "Trump Accounts" starting 2026, allowing annual contributions and a $1,000 federal seed contribution for newborns, though experts advise prioritizing 529s due to their immediate tax advantages.

          <p>Health experts are recommending that foods such as pine nuts and goat's milk be added to mandatory allergy labeling lists in the UK and EU, citing increased allergic reactions. An article in Clinical & Experimental Allergy, based on European anaphylaxis cases from 2002–2023, identified goat/sheep milk, buckwheat, peas/lentils, and pine nuts as top candidates for inclusion due to their frequency and severity. This move would expand the current list of 14 common allergens, aiming to improve food safety and consumer awareness. Allergy UK also advocates for full ingredient labeling and expresses concerns about unclear labeling on platforms like TikTok Shop.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's inflation rate rose to 3.8% in the year to July, its highest since January 2024, primarily due to significant increases in air fares and food prices. This figure, released by the Office for National Statistics, remains above the Bank of England's 2% target and strengthens expectations for a slower pace of interest rate cuts. The jump in air fares is attributed to school holiday timing, while food price rises include beef, chocolate, coffee, and orange juice. Economists note the ongoing struggle for households with rising living costs, with concerns about future food production due to dry summers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kate Riley's debut novel, "Ruth," offers a sympathetic yet nuanced portrayal of life within a cloistered Anabaptist Christian community, the Dorf, where personal autonomy is virtually nonexistent. The story follows Ruth, a creative and witty woman whose life choices, from education to marriage, are dictated by the community's elders. Despite these restrictions, the novel explores the possibility of finding happiness in small joys and frustrations, rather than focusing on escape. It contrasts with other narratives of isolated communities by delving into the universal human experience of longing within a collective that shuns individual desires, making Ruth's journey relatable.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that grilling cured meats like hot dogs and bacon, which contain nitrite curing salt (sodium nitrite, E 250), can lead to the formation of dangerous carcinogenic nitrosamines. While nitrite preserves meat and gives it color, high heat triggers a chemical reaction with naturally occurring amines, increasing these harmful compounds. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has classified ten nitrosamines in food as carcinogenic and genotoxic, stating current intake levels pose a public health risk. Although the EU will reduce permitted nitrite levels from October 2025, some experts advocate for a complete ban, citing safer alternatives like natural fruit extracts.</p>

Advocates attribute this to long-standing socio-economic disparities, language barriers, and a recovery focus on owner-occupied homes, despite most Filipino survivors being renters.

The authors warn this doctrine threatens free speech and could lead to widespread book destruction based on political agendas.</p>

          <h2>Tick Migration and Scant Surveillance Hinder Diagnosis of Tick-Borne Illnesses Amid Climate Change</h2>

          <p>Biologist Grant Hokit's research in Montana reveals ticks are migrating to new areas, potentially introducing new diseases, a trend exacerbated by climate change's shorter winters. The discovery of deer ticks in northeastern Montana, known carriers of Lyme disease, underscores the challenge for doctors who often see patients only after illness symptoms appear, without knowing the tick species involved. A 2023 survey found only a quarter of U.S. health departments conduct tick surveillance, and funding shortages limit comprehensive monitoring. This lack of data leaves medical providers in the dark, hindering effective patient treatment and public health responses to emerging threats.</p>

          <p>Lowe's reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, driven by increased demand for home projects, and announced the acquisition of Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion. This acquisition, along with an earlier one, is part of Lowe's strategy to expand its services for home professionals, a more stable and lucrative customer segment amidst weaker DIY demand. The retailer revised its full-year sales outlook upwards, though comparable sales are expected to remain flat to up 1%. This move mirrors rival Home Depot's strategy of acquiring pro-focused businesses to drive growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Legionnaire's disease, a deadly bacterial pneumonia, is increasingly spreading beyond New York City, with recent outbreaks in Midwest states like Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Climate change exacerbates its spread by creating warmer, more humid conditions favorable for bacteria reproduction in cooling systems and degrading natural water quality. The illness, which causes severe lung infections with a 10% death rate, disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in low-income housing with poorly maintained infrastructure. Experts emphasize the need for vigilant maintenance of community water systems and public health warnings, as individual efforts offer limited protection against this public health challenge.</p>
