          <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is reportedly evaluating a potential acquisition of some of BP's assets, particularly its liquefied natural gas (LNG) holdings, fueling speculation about a possible takeover of the energy giant. While a full takeover is considered less likely, ADNOC's interest underscores BP's underperformance and strategic reset, which includes increasing investment in oil and gas while divesting $20 billion in assets. BP is attempting to restore investor confidence after a period of volatility, and analysts suggest that breaking up the company is not the solution shareholders seek. The strategic reset involves increasing annual oil and gas spending to $10 billion through 2027 while cutting spending on renewables. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is under curfew for a second night following nearly a week of unrest sparked by US immigration raids, with multiple arrests made for curfew violations. Approximately 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines have been deployed to help quell the unrest, with some National Guard troops authorized to detain people until police can arrest them. Mayor Karen Bass blamed the demonstrations on US President Donald Trump's immigration raids, which she said "provoked" residents by causing "fear" and "panic". The military deployment to the LA area is estimated to cost $134 million, as Trump described the protests as a "full-blown assault on peace and public order."</p>

          <p>China's military mouthpiece, the PLA Daily, is advocating for the large-scale and centralized deployment of unmanned combat forces at key locations to maximize their potential in future conflicts. The article emphasizes the importance of innovative organization and application of unmanned systems, highlighting their decisive role in conducting precision strikes. Citing efforts by Russia, Ukraine, and the US, the PLA Daily argues that mass deployment of unmanned systems has become a consensus in military modernization. The competition will focus on which side can rapidly concentrate systems, personnel, and pioneer new models of organization and deployment.</p>

Referencing Hannah Arendt's work, the article suggests that the state risks creating volatile situations when it loses public trust, as seen in the government's response to the protests.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced his ambition for France to manufacture the most advanced chips globally, positioning the country as a key tech hub in Europe. Macron's comments came as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that Nvidia's first GPU was manufactured in France, though current French capabilities are not at the leading edge. Macron is pushing for France to produce semiconductors in the 2nm to 10nm range, potentially requiring partnerships with companies like TSMC or Samsung to establish local factories. This initiative aligns with France's broader efforts to build out its AI infrastructure, including a partnership between Nvidia and Mistral AI to create an "AI cloud."</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States are scheduled to hold a sixth round of negotiations in Oman this Sunday to discuss Tehran's nuclear program. This announcement, made by Oman's Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, comes amid heightened regional tensions, prompting the U.S. to reduce its non-essential staff presence in the Middle East. The talks aim to reach an accord that could see the U.S. lift some economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limitations on uranium enrichment. Failure to reach an agreement could escalate tensions in the region, potentially leading to further unrest or military action.</p>

          <p>A juror in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes has sparked credibility concerns, potentially leading to severe problems, including a possible mistrial. The prosecution requested the juror's removal due to a "lack of candor," suggesting the juror may have been biased or untruthful during the selection process. Experts highlight the importance of ensuring jurors are impartial and capable of adjudicating the case based on facts, not personal biases. The defense objects to the juror's removal, while the trial continues with testimony regarding alleged incidents involving Diddy.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called on officials to enhance their ability to anticipate challenges and accurately implement policies amid a turbulent geopolitical environment. Li emphasized the importance of innovative governance during a swearing-in ceremony for newly appointed central government officials. His comments come as China faces rising tensions with the West over trade and technology issues, including ongoing negotiations with the United States and preparations for a major trade summit with the European Union. Despite these challenges, American and Chinese officials have agreed in principle to a framework designed to de-escalate a feud over rare earths and strategic technologies.</p>

          <p>China is joining the global push to mass-produce high-performance photonic chips, with the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) announcing the production of 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips. This development is expected to position China for major advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. While Europe and the US are already established in the field, China's pilot production line, built on the new TFLN material, is showing gains in technical performance by overcoming limits for high-speed optical links. The stable production line is the result of nearly 15 years of effort.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), plans to tighten regulations on overseas remittances by resident Indians, preventing them from holding foreign currency deposits with lock-in periods. The RBI aims to prevent overseas transfers from being used to passively park money in interest-bearing accounts abroad, considering it a red flag in a still-controlled capital regime. The proposed changes reflect India's cautious stance on outward remittances and full convertibility of the rupee, as authorities seek to protect foreign exchange reserves and manage currency volatility. The move is part of a comprehensive review of the legal framework governing the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) to simplify regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

Former staff at Ticketmaster-owned resale sites claim they worked closely with touts, who were considered "VIPs" and offered financial incentives.

This move follows South Korea's resumption of daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June of the previous year in response to North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South.
