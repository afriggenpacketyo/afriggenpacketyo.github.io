            <p>A shooting at Florida State University in Tallahassee resulted in at least two fatalities and five injuries. The suspect, identified as a current FSU student, was taken into custody after being shot by police. The incident occurred near the Student Union, prompting a campus-wide shelter-in-place order, which has since been lifted. Law enforcement has secured the campus, and classes have been canceled through Friday as authorities continue their investigation. Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the Parkland shooting, noted that some of her classmates now attend FSU and were present during the incident.</p>

            <p>Maine Representative Laurel Libby has publicly condemned Governor Janet Mills' response to a Department of Justice lawsuit concerning transgender athletes in girls' sports. Libby argues that Mills' claim of consistently supporting women's rights is false, citing the lawsuit as evidence. The lawsuit stems from Maine's refusal to comply with Title IX and President Trump's executive order on keeping men out of women's sports. Libby has been a vocal critic of the state's transgender inclusion policies, particularly after identifying a biologically male trans athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition, leading to federal investigations and her own censure.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Munchkin, a baby product manufacturer, has warned of potential disruptions to the availability of essential baby products due to tariffs on goods from China. The company is struggling to absorb the increased costs, which have risen to 145 percent. Munchkin is unable to move production to the U.S. due to a lack of necessary tooling, manufacturing expertise, automation, and skilled labor. The CEO fears that these tariffs will force the company to halt orders, cut jobs, and prevent them from delivering essential baby products to parents nationwide.</p>

            <p>Andrew Ahn's reboot of Ang Lee's 'The Wedding Banquet' presents a more complicated plot with multiple couples navigating modern relationship dynamics. The film explores themes of love, marriage, and cultural expectations through the lens of two gay men and two women who consider unconventional solutions to their problems. While the cast is strong, the film is criticized for its contrived plot, lack of emotional depth, and inauthentic portrayal of wealth. The reviewer finds the original film's cultural and character-driven wit to be missing.</p>
