          <p>Deion Sanders celebrated the impressive NFL preseason debut of his son, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Playing for the Cleveland Browns, Shedeur demonstrated strong performance by throwing for 138 yards and two touchdowns against the Carolina Panthers. The successful outing has generated significant buzz around the league and earned him praise from his father, who is the head coach for the Colorado Buffaloes. Head coach Kevin Stefanski has already confirmed that Shedeur will receive substantial playing time in the next preseason game.</p>

          <p>A large anti-immigration protest took place in Nuneaton, England, with hundreds marching through the town center. The demonstration was organized following a local council leader's statement, which has not been independently verified, that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. While the protest was mostly peaceful, Warwickshire Police confirmed one arrest for suspected threats. The event was one of several similar demonstrations occurring across England on the same day.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon resulted in the deaths of six Lebanese soldiers. The incident occurred near the Israeli border in the city of Tyre while an army unit was inspecting the facility and dismantling its contents. This event takes place amid ongoing efforts by the Lebanese army, in cooperation with the UN, to dismantle Hezbollah's military infrastructure as part of a ceasefire agreement with Israel. The blast highlights the persistent volatility in the region and the dangers associated with disarming the powerful Iran-backed group.</p>

De Gea, who left the club in 2023 after 545 appearances, received a standing ovation from the crowd, providing a farewell he was not previously afforded. The match also highlighted United's current goalkeeping situation, with his replacement Andre Onana injured and backup Altay Bayindir saving a penalty to secure a shootout victory. The event underscored the ongoing debate among fans about the decision to replace the long-serving goalkeeper.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15. The announcement came as a deadline Trump set for Putin to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine passed, with uncertainty remaining about potential new sanctions on Russia. Trump hinted that a peace deal could involve a "swapping of territories" to benefit both Ukraine and Russia, a complex proposal that raises questions about Ukraine's sovereignty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated his readiness to work toward a lasting peace but emphasized that any deal must respect Ukraine's position.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is facing severe environmental challenges, including overwhelming plastic pollution, overfishing by industrial trawlers, and sewage discharge. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report drastically reduced catches, finding their nets filled with plastic instead of fish, threatening their livelihoods. While international agreements like the High Seas Treaty and national plans in Egypt and Algeria aim to address these issues, local fishermen and activists remain skeptical. They feel their direct experience is overlooked in favor of high-level promises from governments and corporations they see as major polluters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical overview of how gerrymandering, particularly by the Republican party, has reshaped American politics over the last 15 years. It traces the origins of the modern strategy to the 2010 "Redmap" project, which used sophisticated data and mapping to secure legislative control and draw favorable congressional districts. This has entrenched conservative lawmakers, insulated them from majority public opinion on key issues, and given the GOP a durable advantage in the House. The piece explains how these actions have led to the current political landscape where electoral maps, rather than voters, often determine outcomes.</p>

          <p>During a recent visit to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous award to President Trump's special envoy, intended for a senior CIA official whose son was killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The son, Michael Gloss, 21, was the child of Juliane Gallina, the CIA's deputy director for digital innovation. Gloss, who had expressed pro-Russian views online, enlisted with Russian forces in 2023 and was killed in April 2024. The unusual gesture occurred as the envoy was in Moscow to discuss plans to end the war, adding a strange and personal dimension to US-Russia relations.</p>

Under the plan, claims would be assigned points based on the severity of the abuse, with a sexual assault claim worth significantly more than other forms of misconduct. However, the monetary value of each point remains unknown, and many survivors are hesitant to approve the settlement, which is valued between $180m and $235m.

In his new book, he argues that a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, can support a higher initial withdrawal rate, closer to 4.7% or even higher for current retirees. Bengen's research indicates that most retirees are overly conservative with their spending and could enjoy more of their accumulated wealth.

This plan has been widely condemned by humanitarian agencies and many world leaders, who fear it will cause immense further suffering to a beleaguered population already facing a dire humanitarian crisis and potential famine.</p>

          <p>A 3D-printed robot crab named "Wavy Dave," designed to study mating behaviors, met a premature end when it was attacked and dismembered by real fiddler crabs. Researchers from the University of Exeter were using the robot in a Portuguese nature park to observe how male crabs react to rivals waving their large claws to attract females. The experiment revealed that male crabs adjust their own signaling behavior in response to competition. The real crabs only confronted the robot after females appeared to recognize it as an impostor, leading one male to tear off the robot's claw.</p>

          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, is re-emphasizing the long-held scientific consensus that there is no mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle. He argues that the high volume of ship and plane traffic in the region means the number of disappearances is statistically normal on a percentage basis. This view is supported by institutions like Lloyd's of London and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). NOAA explains that most incidents can be attributed to natural causes, such as the Gulf Stream's volatile weather and complex navigation, combined with human error, rather than any supernatural or paranormal phenomena.</p>

Speaking at a panel, Robbins shared her personal experience of realizing her own phone habits were mirrored by her kids, leading to a loss of connection. She advises parents to be conscious of their own screen time, suggesting they put their phones away after work and avoid bringing them to the dinner table. By modeling "phone-life balance" and showing curiosity about their kids' online activities, parents can foster better habits and stronger family relationships.</p>

This direct, private appeal represents a distinct strategy for a Democratic leader navigating a relationship with the Republican president to protect state interests. While Trump offered no specific commitments, the meeting itself was a notable instance of bipartisan, state-federal dialogue on a critical economic issue.</p>

Despite the high monetary benchmark, many respondents define wealth more broadly, including happiness, health, and relationships.

The move follows a similar action by the South, which had halted its own anti-Pyongyang broadcasts shortly after the new, more conciliatory government of President Lee Jae Myung took office. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare, which involved blasting K-pop and news from the South and unsettling noises from the North, had been a source of irritation for border residents.
