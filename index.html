          <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) shares experienced their largest intra-day drop since August 2024, falling over 8% after the company announced a 59% plunge in net profit for its first fiscal quarter. The decline to S$186 million was primarily attributed to lower interest income and a share of losses from associated companies, notably Air India, in which SIA holds a 25.1% stake. While operating profit also fell, the airline noted that underlying demand for both passenger travel and cargo services remains strong despite the challenging financial results and broader geopolitical uncertainties.

          <p>A gunman wearing body armor killed four people, including an off-duty police officer, in a shooting at a Midtown Manhattan office building that houses the headquarters for Blackstone and the NFL. The incident occurred on Monday evening, prompting a massive police response and a lockdown of the area. The suspect, who had barricaded himself on an upper floor, was later found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. A motive is currently under investigation, and witness accounts describe a chaotic scene as employees hid for safety.</p>

          <p>Two children, ages seven and thirteen, were killed after a barge collided with a small sailboat carrying summer campers in Biscayne Bay, near Miami Beach. The crash threw all six occupants of the sailboat, five children and one adult counselor, into the water. In addition to the fatalities, two other children remain in critical condition at a local hospital. Witnesses described a horrific scene, with some children reportedly trapped under the barge after impact.

          <p>The Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management has issued new guidance affirming the right of federal employees to express their religious beliefs in the workplace. The memo states that workers can discuss their faith, display religious items, and even politely attempt to persuade colleagues to reconsider their own beliefs, provided they stop if asked. This policy, which builds on similar Clinton-era guidance, is part of a broader push by the administration to protect religious expression. Critics, such as the Freedom From Religion Foundation, argue the guidance unconstitutionally encourages proselytizing and could lead to workplace harassment.</p>

          <p>A court in Bogotá has found former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe guilty of witness tampering and fraud, making him the first ex-president in the country's history to be convicted of a crime. The 73-year-old was convicted of attempting to bribe witnesses in a separate investigation concerning his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010 and was known for his aggressive stance against leftist Farc rebels, has consistently maintained his innocence and is expected to appeal the verdict. The charges each carry a potential sentence of up to 12 years in prison.</p>

While House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune deferred to the president's authority, they stopped short of endorsing or rejecting the idea. This article explores the political complexities and potential fallout of such a move, questioning whether it is a genuine possibility or a strategic maneuver to influence Maxwell. A pardon for Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role with Jeffrey Epstein, would be highly controversial and politically risky.</p>

In return, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make substantial investments. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American industry, some economists forecast a negative impact on the EU's GDP, though the agreement does reduce the uncertainty of a full-scale trade war.

          <h2>USC Offensive Lineman Sues NCAA Over Eligibility Denial</h2>

          <p>Offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver request to play his final season of college football for USC. The suit challenges the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," which limits athletes to four seasons of competition within a five-year period. Wingfield's collegiate career was disrupted by the pandemic and a significant knee injury. The denial of his waiver prevents him from taking advantage of a significant name, image, and likeness (NIL) opportunity and a starting role, prompting him to seek injunctive relief in federal court.</p>

The system aims to level the playing field for reservations, which previously would sell out within minutes of becoming available online. Would-be campers can enter a free drawing for a chance to book a site months in advance, with unsuccessful applicants receiving points to increase their odds in future lotteries. The move is part of a broader effort to make the state's natural resources more accessible.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has suggested that the stock market's muted reaction to the new U.S.-EU trade agreement is due to investors focusing on more immediate catalysts. He argues that Wall Street is currently preoccupied with this week's major earnings reports from tech giants like Apple and Amazon, as well as the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting and Friday's employment data. According to Cramer, investors may be experiencing "tariff ennui," as many of the administration's trade negotiations follow a similar pattern, making the announcements less impactful until other major economic events have passed.

          <p>A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel appeared skeptical of the Trump administration's arguments defending aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in Southern California. The hearing concerned a lower court's injunction that blocked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from conducting indiscriminate "roving patrols" and using factors like race or location as the sole basis for detention. Judges fiercely questioned the Justice Department's lawyer about the constitutionality of the sweeps, suggesting they may uphold the block on practices that civil rights groups argue violate the 4th Amendment. The case is likely headed for a Supreme Court showdown.</p>

While the case did not set new legal precedent, it served as a powerful cultural moment that reinforced privacy rights in the digital age. Legal experts note the case demonstrated that even if information about a public figure is newsworthy, publishing explicit content without consent constitutes a significant invasion of privacy.</p>
