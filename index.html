          <p>California's economy has surpassed Japan's, making it the fourth-largest in the world with a nominal GDP of $4.1 trillion. Governor Gavin Newsom attributed the state's thriving economy to investments in people, sustainability, and innovation. California's growth rate in 2024 was 6%, outperforming the US, China, and Germany. However, Newsom cautioned that the Trump administration's tariff policies threaten California's economic interests, leading the state to sue the federal government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has granted an interview to Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, despite past criticisms and a recent controversy over a Signal chat. Trump claimed Goldberg and other Atlantic writers would be interviewing him for a story entitled "The Most Consequential President of this Century." Goldberg has been a frequent critic of Trump, particularly regarding a 2020 article about Trump's refusal to visit an American cemetery in France and the Signal chat leak.</p>
