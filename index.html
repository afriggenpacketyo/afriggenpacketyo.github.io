          <p>Nintendo has announced it will be raising the U.S. prices for its original Switch family of systems, including the standard, Lite, and OLED models, effective August 3rd. The company cited unspecified "market conditions" for the price hike, which comes amid shifting U.S. tariff policies. This move impacts hardware and some accessories, but the new Switch 2 console and all game prices will remain unchanged for now. Nintendo noted, however, that future price adjustments for games may become necessary depending on economic factors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added a mere 73,000 jobs in July, falling well below forecasts and signaling a notable slowdown in the labor market. The report was further weakened by substantial downward revisions for May and June, which cut a combined 258,000 jobs from previous estimates. With the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2%, analysts suggest that escalating trade tensions and new tariffs are impacting hiring decisions. This disappointing data increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell over 7% despite the company reporting second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations on revenue and profit. Investor sentiment soured due to a weaker-than-expected profit forecast for the current quarter and concerns over massive capital expenditures on artificial intelligence. While the company's advertising sales showed strong growth, its cloud computing unit, AWS, grew at a slower pace than rivals Microsoft and Google. CEO Andy Jassy addressed concerns by emphasizing AWS's market leadership and the long-term potential of its AI investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As a near-total Israeli blockade severely restricts official aid, small, independent mutual aid funds are providing a critical lifeline to starving families in Gaza. Individuals and small groups are using personal networks and social media to raise money, which is then wired to trusted contacts on the ground for distributing food, water, and cash. These grassroots efforts operate with agility but face immense challenges, including exorbitant prices for scarce goods and high fees for cash conversion. While these initiatives offer moments of relief, organizers stress they are no substitute for a ceasefire and open borders. </p>

These false claims were then amplified by users to dismiss the severity of the ongoing famine in Gaza. The incidents highlight the dangers of relying on AI tools for rapid fact-checking, as they can confidently generate and spread harmful misinformation during sensitive global events.</p>

The number of paid business users for ChatGPT has also climbed to five million, up from three million just a few months ago.

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff visited a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) aid distribution site. Huckabee praised the U.S.-backed organization on social media, claiming it successfully delivers over a million meals daily and circumvents Hamas from looting supplies. The visit is part of an effort to provide President Trump with a direct assessment of the humanitarian situation on the ground. Huckabee also dismissed claims that Israel lacks evidence of Hamas stealing aid and criticized the United Nations for not collaborating with the GHF system.</p>

          <p>A deeper analysis of the weak July jobs report reveals that the healthcare and social assistance sector was almost solely responsible for all net job gains. The sector added 73,300 jobs, effectively masking losses in other areas and preventing the overall monthly number from being negative. In contrast, sectors like professional and business services, manufacturing, and government all shed jobs. This heavy reliance on a single sector for growth underscores the fragility of the current labor market and raises red flags about the sustainability of hiring momentum across the broader economy.</p>

The attacks came just before a dismal jobs report was released, which Trump used as further evidence that the central bank's policies are harming the economy.

          <p>This article explores the complex public health debate surrounding nicotine as products like Zyn pouches and vapes become mainstream. While these alternatives are safer than combustible cigarettes, the long-term health effects of nicotine itself remain largely unknown and a subject of scientific debate. Some experts argue for harm reduction, viewing them as a better choice for adults, while others worry about creating a new generation addicted to a highly potent drug. The piece highlights that while nicotine may not be the primary villain in smoking, its addictive nature still carries significant financial and psychological costs.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that family offices, the private wealth management firms for the ultra-rich, are formalizing and increasing compensation to compete for top executive talent. A majority now use long-term incentive plans, with median total pay for CEOs at investment-focused firms reaching $825,000 and over $1.2 million for those managing more than $1 billion. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities, allowing executives to invest alongside the family in exclusive deals, and carried interest plans. This trend reflects a shift from informal agreements to more structured, performance-based compensation packages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, although profits were down significantly from last year due to lower crude oil prices. The energy giant's net income was bolstered by record production output. The company recently completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation after winning a lengthy arbitration battle against Exxon Mobil. Chevron expects the Hess deal, which adds valuable assets in Guyana and the U.S., to begin contributing to its earnings by the fourth quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old zookeeper at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has died after being attacked by a Sumatran tiger that had escaped its enclosure. The tragic incident occurred while the employee, head of the carnivores team, was preparing for a behind-the-scenes tour for visitors. The zoo confirmed the tiger entered an inner courtyard but stated that visitors, who were behind a glass window, were never in physical danger. The zoo is now closed as it works with Israeli police to investigate how the critically-endangered animal managed to escape.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Adapt Ancient Armor Technique to Extend Artillery Barrel Life</h2>

          <p>Scientists in China have reportedly doubled the service life of modern artillery barrels by adapting an ancient anti-corrosion technology. The technique is an advanced version of the chromium plating process found on 2,000-year-old weapons of the Terracotta Army, which remained sharp and untarnished for millennia. By refining this method, researchers created a new coating that better withstands the extreme heat and pressure inside cannon barrels. This innovation addresses the significant challenge of barrel erosion and microcracking in high-velocity artillery systems.</p>

          <p>Qatar has warned it may halt liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries to Europe if the European Union does not revise a new directive on corporate accountability. The CSDDD law requires large firms to scrutinize their global supply chains for human rights and environmental issues, with heavy fines for noncompliance. Qatar argues the rules are too burdensome and conflict with its national energy strategy, potentially exposing state-owned QatarEnergy to massive penalties. The threat jeopardizes a key 2022 deal to supply Germany with LNG, a pact made to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian gas.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, demonstrating resilience despite a 23% drop in net income compared to the previous year. The decline in profit was attributed to lower global oil prices. However, the company's performance was bolstered by its highest second-quarter production volume in over 25 years, driven by record output in the Permian Basin and Guyana. Exxon also continued its aggressive shareholder return program, buying back $5 billion in shares and paying over $4 billion in dividends during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>
