        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent social media images and state media hints suggest that China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned. New satellite images reveal 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, exceeding the capacity of China's existing carriers. Military commentator Song Zhongping suggests the Fujian is preparing for commissioning and will undergo trial service to test adaptability and coordination with aircraft and weapon systems. Further sea trials and carrier group coordination exercises may occur before the Fujian formally enters service by the end of the year, marking a significant advancement in China's naval capabilities.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Ventura County, California, battled two brush fires on Monday night, with the Howe fire being the larger of the two, having burned approximately 40 acres in steep terrain near the Santa Clara River. Helicopters were deployed to make water drops on the flames, and additional air tankers and helicopters were called in to assist the 140 firefighters on scene or en route. Simultaneously, firefighters contained the Maria fire, which burned about 15 acres along the river bottom south of Santa Paula, with about 140 firefighters, three helicopters, and one dozer involved in the effort. Clean-up operations continued into the evening after the Maria fire was contained.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City police are investigating two self-described "peacekeepers" following a fatal shooting at a "No Kings Day" protest that resulted in one death and one injury. The incident occurred when the "peacekeepers" confronted Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who allegedly brandished a rifle, leading one of the peacekeepers to open fire, killing Arthur Folasa "Afa" Ah Loo and wounding Gamboa. The protest, organized by 50501, did not have organized or armed security listed on its permit, prompting questions about unauthorized security at public demonstrations, and police are working with the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office to determine the legality of the use of deadly force under state law.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) democracies convened in Canada to discuss global trade amidst tensions arising from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and unilateral actions. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the importance of cooperation and economic prosperity in a divided world. Trump reiterated his discontent over Russia's exclusion from the group and suggested including China, overshadowing discussions on the global economy and economic security, including supply chains for critical minerals, and regional affairs. The summit concluded without a detailed joint statement, instead opting for brief, action-oriented statements due to difficulties in reaching consensus.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made limited progress in resolving tariff disagreements during their summit, raising doubts about a swift, mutually beneficial agreement to protect Japan's auto sector. Ishiba emphasized that any potential deal should benefit both nations, with ongoing ministerial talks aimed at achieving such an agreement. The U.S. granted Japan a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but Ishiba did not confirm discussions about a possible extension. Despite the tariff policy, Japan has been increasing investment and production in the United States, a point the Japanese side has been seeking to convey to Trump, and Japan exported around 1.38 million vehicles to the United States in 2024.</p>

Initially, the Dodgers planned to delay Ohtani's pitching return until after the All-Star break, but Ohtani's impressive live batting practice sessions and concerns about the toll of simulated sessions led to an accelerated timeline, and the Dodgers are open to having him pitch one or two innings initially.</p>

          <p>The UK House of Commons is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with Labour MPs Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. The current law in England and Wales deems abortion illegal but permits it up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain conditions, requiring approval from two doctors. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent the investigation, arrest, or imprisonment of women who terminate their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside of the existing law, and her amendment has received support from 176 MPs and main abortion providers.</p>

Healthcare providers are particularly concerned about this vulnerable population, as they often suffer from multiple complex chronic medical conditions that are not being adequately addressed. Experts highlight that the aging homeless population has been growing for 30 years, and the trend is impacting healthcare systems as these individuals end up hospitalized at high rates.</p>

          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on the global arms exports market, driven by security concerns rather than solely profiting from rising global defense spending. The shift aims to deepen ties and improve interoperability with allies and partners by standardizing maintenance processes and creating joint training opportunities. Japan also seeks to develop its defense industrial base, which has been in poor condition, and exports will enable economies of scale needed to make domestic production more viable, and the Trump administration's more transactional approach will oblige them to pay for much more of their own defense, or defense equipment supplied by the U.S.</p>

The situation has raised concerns about the potential for the U.S. to be drawn into the conflict or for it to trigger a broader war in the region, and the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group was rerouted to the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Donald Trump's megabill to fund his second-term agenda has raised concerns, potentially leading to a clash with the House. While most Senate Republicans remained optimistic, some senators expressed serious concerns about the bill, particularly regarding Medicaid changes and their impact on rural hospitals. Key sticking points include differences in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid provisions, and the debt limit, and the House Speaker Mike Johnson has warned the Senate to make minimal changes to the bill to ensure it can pass, given the razor-thin margin in the lower chamber.</p>

          <p>In response to immigration raids by masked federal officers, California lawmakers have proposed a state law to ban law enforcement from concealing their faces while on duty. The bill would make it a misdemeanor for local, state, and federal law enforcement officers to cover their faces, with exceptions for SWAT teams and medical or health reasons, and it also encourages them to wear a form of identification on their uniform. Supporters argue the bill promotes transparency and discourages impersonators, while opponents claim it endangers officers by identifying them and subjecting them to retaliation, and the bill is being offered as an amendment to Senate Bill 627, a housing measure.</p>
