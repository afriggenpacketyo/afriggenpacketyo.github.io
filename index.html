          <p>The House Oversight Committee, led by Republican Chairman James Comer, has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, as part of its investigation into the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The committee is also demanding the Department of Justice provide all unredacted files related to the Epstein case. This move follows the Trump administration's decision not to release more federal files on the financier, which has fueled speculation about the extent of his network. The subpoenas extend to several former high-ranking Justice Department officials as the committee seeks to scrutinize the government's handling of the investigation and prosecution of Epstein and his associates.</p>

          <p>A grand juror involved in the high-profile Karen Read murder case has pleaded guilty to criminal contempt for disclosing confidential information. The juror, Jessica Leslie, admitted in a Boston federal court to willfully violating court rules by sharing details about the proceedings, including witness names and testimony, with unauthorized individuals. Read was recently acquitted of murder in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe. Leslie has agreed to a sentence of one day of incarceration and 24 months of supervised release, highlighting the serious legal consequences of breaching the secrecy of grand jury proceedings in a case that has drawn significant public attention.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to do business with him, forcing him to use smaller banks for his finances. In a CNBC interview, Trump stated that JPMorgan gave him a short deadline to move hundreds of millions of dollars and that Bank of America subsequently denied his request to open an account. These allegations have intensified a debate over whether financial institutions are unfairly 'de-banking' clients for political reasons. The Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to investigate and potentially penalize banks for such practices, while industry groups point to regulatory pressures as the root cause.

Luhn, an experienced outdoorsman, was expected to return to the U.K. but failed to arrive for his flight, prompting his family to contact the authorities. His wife reported that his last communication was a picture sent from his location in Odda. Rescue efforts have been challenged by difficult weather conditions, and his family is appealing for any information from other hikers who may have been in the same area.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner over significant downward revisions to recent jobs data, experts are clarifying that such adjustments are a standard part of the reporting process. The BLS initially releases preliminary figures based on incomplete survey responses to provide timely information, later refining them as more data becomes available. While the recent 258,000-job downward revision for May and June was unusually large for a non-recessionary period, former officials and analysts stress it is a feature of the methodology, not a sign of manipulation. The controversy has led to calls for legislation to protect the independence of federal statistical agencies.</p>

          <p>Tennessee has carried out the execution of Byron Black, a death row inmate, without deactivating his implanted heart defibrillator, a move believed to be a first in the U.S. The execution proceeded after courts rejected appeals from Black's attorneys, who argued the device could deliver painful electric shocks during the lethal injection process, constituting cruel and unusual punishment. State officials contended that Black would be unconscious and unable to feel any potential shocks. The case highlighted complex ethical questions for medical professionals and the legal system regarding executions involving inmates with advanced medical implants. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic escalation of a political standoff, Republicans in the Texas House of Representatives have voted to authorize the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent a vote on a controversial redistricting plan. The plan would heavily favor Republicans by creating five new GOP-leaning congressional seats. By leaving Texas, the Democrats denied the House the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state troopers to locate and return the absent members to the chamber, though the arrest warrants are only enforceable within Texas, making the move largely symbolic while the Democrats remain out of state.</p>

Over the past two decades, the share of college-educated women in the labor force grew by nine percentage points, while participation for women without a degree increased by less than one point. The study from think tank Third Way suggests that the rise of flexible work arrangements and improved benefits like child care subsidies, which are more common in white-collar professions, have disproportionately benefited women with higher education. This trend highlights a growing economic divide and challenges the narrative of broad-based progress for all working women.</p>

Drummond faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder and one count of aggravated kidnapping.</p>

          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations, largely due to declining sales at its Pizza Hut and KFC chains in the United States. Both brands saw a 5% slide in U.S. same-store sales as they struggled with increased competition and value messaging that failed to resonate with consumers. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to be a strong performer, reporting a 4% increase in same-store sales globally, driven by new product launches. The company has responded to the challenges at KFC by shaking up its U.S. and global leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has implemented a new phone-sharing system that is reportedly causing significant problems for people seeking assistance. Under the new system, calls to local field offices are being rerouted to available staff nationwide to reduce wait times. However, employees and advocates warn that callers are often connected with staff who lack the proper jurisdiction to resolve their specific cases, leading to further delays and frustration. This creates a cumbersome process where the public must be referred back to their original servicing office, undermining the goal of providing efficient, first-contact resolution and eroding confidence in the system.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly endorsed the Texas Republican effort to redraw the state's congressional map, stating that the party is 'entitled' to the five additional seats the plan would likely create. His comments came as Texas Democrats remained in Illinois to block a vote on the new maps, which they argue are a form of gerrymandering designed to suppress minority voters. Trump dismissed these concerns, instead making unsubstantiated claims that Democratic-controlled states like California and Illinois are heavily gerrymandered against Republicans. The standoff continues as the Texas governor threatens to have the absent Democratic lawmakers arrested and returned to the state.</p>

          <p>Civic groups and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms that the new congressional maps proposed by Texas Republicans would unconstitutionally dilute the voting power of the state's growing Latino population. The plan, which is part of an unusual mid-decade redistricting effort, would alter districts in ways that critics say violate the Voting Rights Act by 'cracking' and 'packing' minority voters to secure more seats for Republicans. For example, the district represented by Austin's first Latino congressman would be dramatically reshaped, a move seen as a direct attempt to suppress the influence of Latino voters in a state where they are the largest demographic group.</p>

Citing the examples of other European nations like Italy and Norway that have already accepted small numbers of children, the politician argued that Germany is well-prepared for such a mission.
