            <p>Rivers like the Beaver Kill, a tributary of the Delaware River in New York's Catskill Mountains, are warming due to climate change, threatening fish populations and the local economies that depend on them. Fly fishing, a $750 million industry in the U.S., is particularly at risk, as warmer waters affect insect hatches and the entire food chain. Organizations like Friends of the Upper Delaware River are working to restore water flow by removing sediment and old dams, aiming to cool the water and make it more hospitable for fish, which in turn supports recreational activities and local economies. This collaborative effort highlights the interconnectedness of environmental health and community well-being.</p>

            <p>Economists are increasingly concerned about the potential for stagflation, a combination of rising inflation, slow economic growth, and high unemployment, with some attributing the risk to recent tariff policies. This economic environment could lead to uncertainty in consumer confidence, affecting spending and investment. While stagflation may not mirror the 1970s, experts advise consumers to prioritize paying down high-interest debt and building an emergency fund to prepare for potential economic challenges. For investors, the advice is to consider allocating cash towards equities and riskier assets while rebalancing portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

This case is part of Operation Take Back America, which aims to combat ongoing threats and risks.

            <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear a case involving a Maryland school district's use of children's books featuring LGBTQ+ characters, which some parents object to on religious grounds. These parents seek to opt their children out of classes using the books, arguing that the content violates their faith, while the school system maintains the books are not sex education materials but rather everyday tales about diverse characters. The school system discontinued the opt-out option, citing disruptions, leading to the legal challenge. The outcome of this case could have implications for religious freedom and curriculum choices in public schools.</p>

            <p>While most Americans pay Social Security taxes throughout the year, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos meet their obligations almost instantly due to the income cap. In 2025, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security tax are $176,100, resulting in a maximum tax of $10,918.20 for employees and employers each. Self-employed individuals pay both portions, totaling 12.4%. The disparity in the time it takes for billionaires to fulfill their Social Security tax obligations raises questions about the fairness of the system, especially given the funding challenges faced by the Social Security trust fund.</p>

Elliott's involvement could lead to improved management, efficiency, and shareholder value, especially regarding HPE's pending acquisition of Juniper Networks.

            <p>Thirty years after the Oklahoma City bombing, the ideology that motivated Timothy McVeigh, a far-right radical, appears to have resurfaced in mainstream American politics. McVeigh's anti-government sentiments and white supremacist views find echoes in current political rhetoric, particularly in the context of the 'Deep State' narrative and anti-immigration stances. The parallels between McVeigh's beliefs and some contemporary political discourse raise concerns about the normalization of extremist ideologies. While the nature of the threat has evolved, the underlying sentiments of disillusionment and rage remain relevant in understanding the current political landscape.</p>

            <p>The rising cost of hobbies, dubbed 'hobby inflation,' is making recreational activities increasingly exclusive, impacting social connections and communities. From shooting to bourbon collecting and fishing, many once-accessible pastimes are becoming out of reach for the working and middle classes. Factors such as supply-chain issues, increased popularity, rising raw-material costs, and tariffs contribute to the price hikes. This trend has ramifications beyond economics, potentially leading to shrinking social circles and increased social isolation as people from different backgrounds have fewer opportunities to connect through shared interests.</p>

            <p>Servers in Denver are suing a group of restaurants, Culinary Creative Group (CCG), alleging that 30% of the automatic 20% service charge went to management instead of employees, violating Colorado hour and wage laws. The lawsuit claims CCG was not transparent with customers about the distribution of service charges and reduced front-of-house employee pay to a tipped minimum wage. CCG CEO Juan Padro argues the charges are service fees, not tips, and can be distributed at the restaurant's discretion, but Colorado law distinguishes between mandatory service charges and tips. The lawsuit is currently paused as both sides attempt to reach an agreement outside of court.</p>

            <p>Tasneem Sharif Abbas, a 16-year-old from Gaza who lost her arm in an Israeli bombing, is receiving medical treatment in Philadelphia with the support of the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF). After evacuating to Egypt, Abbas traveled to the US for a prosthetic arm and further medical care, with the costs covered by Shriners Children's Philadelphia. A community of volunteers in Philadelphia is assisting Abbas and her sister with transportation, tutoring, and hosting dinners during their six-month stay. While Abbas's story is one of hope, it highlights the challenges faced by many children in Gaza with limited access to medical care.</p>

There should be improvements to the H-1B visa program and an expansion of the number of H-1Bs offered, as well as easier access for spouses of people on H-1B visas to work in the US.

Nasal rinses and medications like antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays can also help manage symptoms, with proper nasal spray technique being crucial for effectiveness.</p>

Even with contempt convictions, the administration could potentially thwart any attempts to bring officials into compliance with the law. The Constitution provides for impeachment as a remedy, but its success is unlikely given the current political climate. Ultimately, holding Trump and his subordinates accountable will require the courts or Congress to exercise their authority in ways that Trump cannot stop.</p>
