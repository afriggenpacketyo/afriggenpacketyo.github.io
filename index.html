        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia launched a record 6,443 drones and missiles into Ukraine during July, marking the highest monthly total since the full-scale invasion began. This represents a significant escalation in aerial bombardments, with an average of over 200 drones deployed daily to terrorize cities and target vital infrastructure. Despite Ukrainian air defenses intercepting a high percentage of these projectiles, the sheer volume has led to increased civilian casualties and placed immense strain on defense resources. Analysts warn that Russia's expanding domestic drone production could soon enable even larger-scale daily attacks, posing a severe long-term threat to Ukraine and European security.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has deployed over 7,000 military and security personnel to popular tourist destinations like Cancún and the Riviera Maya to combat rising cartel-related crime. This initiative, "Operation Summer Vacation 2025," aims to protect the two million tourists expected in the region through extensive land, air, and sea patrols. While intended to provide reassurance, some security experts suggest the heavy military presence might instead heighten travelers' sense of danger. The U.S. State Department maintains a Level 2 travel advisory for the area, urging visitors to exercise increased caution, particularly after dark and in downtown areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the "Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act," has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, potentially altering federal boxing laws. Backed by TKO Holdings Group, the parent company of UFC and WWE, the legislation proposes alternatives to traditional sanctioning bodies, which would benefit TKO's new boxing league created in partnership with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Critics argue this move guts key protections from the original Ali Act, allowing promoters to control rankings and titles, similar to the UFC's controversial business model. This could centralize power, suppress fighter pay, and facilitate a Saudi-led takeover of professional boxing.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to leave the NFL and return to rugby union, ending his 18-month pursuit of an American football career. The 24-year-old, who had been on the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad and active roster, stated it was the right time to come home and focus on what he does best. Before his departure in January 2024, Rees-Zammit had earned 32 caps for Wales. His return is anticipated to be a significant boost for the Welsh national team under its new head coach, Steve Tandy.</p>

          <p>Nintendo reported that its revenue more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter, driven by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company sold 5.82 million units of the new device, which was released on June 5, helping push quarterly revenue to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion), far exceeding market expectations. Despite the strong performance, Nintendo has kept its full-year financial forecast unchanged, projecting 15 million Switch 2 sales for the fiscal year. Analysts view this target as conservative, even with potential impacts from U.S. tariffs on the horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, Germany has reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the Atlantic region, which includes areas along the North Sea coast. Officials documented 209 wolf packs and approximately 1,600 individual animals, noting significant positive population growth in recent years. This new designation could pave the way for controlled hunting in these areas to manage the population, a move supported by farmers concerned about livestock protection. The conservation status for the rest of the country remains under review, pending further assessment by federal and state governments.</p>

          <p>The BBC is under increasing pressure to pull the latest series of MasterChef from its schedule after hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode were sacked following misconduct allegations. Broadcast union Bectu and women's rights charities have argued that airing the pre-filmed series would be inappropriate and distressing for the complainants. The controversy stems from a report that upheld over 40 complaints against Wallace and a claim of racist language use by Torode. Despite the backlash and one contestant asking to be edited out, the BBC stated it decided to broadcast the series after consulting with the chefs involved to recognize their efforts.</p>

Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, the primary entry route into the civil service. The move is part of a broader government effort to diversify its workforce and make better-informed decisions by harnessing a wider range of talent and perspectives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced a new wave of tariffs targeting imports from more than 60 countries, set to take effect next week. An executive order detailed the new rates, which range up to 41% and will apply to nearly all trading partners, with few facing duties below 10%. The tariff levels are reportedly based on the size of the U.S. trade deficit with each nation. Additionally, duties on Canadian goods will increase to 35%, while Mexico has received a 90-day extension. This move marks a significant escalation in the administration's trade policy, aimed at what it calls rebalancing global commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The legislative assembly in El Salvador has approved constitutional reforms that remove presidential term limits, allowing for indefinite reelection. The changes, passed with a strong majority by supporters of President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party, also extend the presidential term from five to six years and eliminate the need for a second-round runoff in elections. This move solidifies Bukele's power, following a controversial 2024 reelection that was enabled by a Supreme Court ruling. Opposition lawmakers condemned the reforms as a death blow to democracy in the country, passed while the public was distracted by a holiday period.</p>

          <p>Florida's Division of Emergency Management has released a heavily redacted hurricane evacuation plan for the "Alligator Alcatraz" detention center, prompting demands for greater transparency from lawmakers and advocates. The 33-page document outlines protocols for relocating detainees, but critical details, including the locations of alternate facilities, have been blacked out. Officials state the facility can withstand a Category 2 hurricane, but requires evacuation for stronger storms. Critics, including Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, argue that the blacked-out information is unacceptable and that a clear, confirmed plan is needed to ensure the safety of the detainees.</p>

          <p>Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has formally requested a trade after negotiations for a contract extension stalled. McLaurin, who is entering the final year of his current contract, had previously sat out the first four days of training camp in a "hold-in" to protest the lack of progress on a new deal. The 30-year-old two-time Pro Bowl selection is a crucial part of the team's offense, coming off a career year with over 1,000 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns. His trade request adds significant uncertainty for the Commanders as they look to build on their successful previous season.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores the widespread financial precarity and burnout experienced by millennial women, who were encouraged to pursue their passions with the promise it would lead to success. The author argues this has left many in creative and freelance fields overworked, underpaid, and facing a systemic gender pay gap that puts them at risk of poverty in old age. The article critiques an economic system that relies on women's flexibility and unpaid labor, especially in the arts. It reflects on the personal anxiety of this reality, contrasting it with the greater financial stability often achieved by male peers and previous generations.</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait are deepening their military relationship, highlighted by the imminent opening of a joint ammunition factory in the Gulf state. According to Kuwait's deputy minister of defence, the project, which will reportedly produce light and medium ammunition, is a "milestone" in their cooperation. The announcement was made at a Chinese embassy event celebrating the founding of the People's Liberation Army. This development signifies Beijing's growing influence and engagement in the Middle East, strengthening ties with Kuwait, which was the first Gulf nation to sign a military cooperation agreement with China in 1995.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tariff is a tax imposed on goods imported from other countries, typically calculated as a percentage of the product's value. The U.S. administration under President Trump has increasingly used tariffs as a tool to pursue its trade policy goals, arguing they protect American jobs and encourage domestic manufacturing. The stated aim is to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by making foreign goods more expensive for importers, who may pass the cost to consumers or reduce imports. Critics, however, argue the policy creates economic uncertainty, leads to retaliatory measures from other countries, and can result in higher prices for American consumers.

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen nearly $200 million in federal research grants for UCLA, citing the university's alleged failure to combat antisemitism and its use of race in admissions. The move, affecting an estimated 300 grants from agencies like the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health, is a significant escalation in the administration's scrutiny of higher education institutions. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk called the decision a "far-reaching penalty" that defunds life-saving research and is a loss for the entire nation. The action follows a Justice Department finding that UCLA violated the civil rights of Jewish students.</p>

The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident.

The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, some of whom have lived and worked legally in the U.S. for decades. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the terminations were "preordained" and potentially "motivated by racial animus."

Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh noted that as presidents use more executive orders to bypass a gridlocked Congress, more legal challenges inevitably reach the high court for emergency intervention. He acknowledged criticism about the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency orders but stated the court has improved its process, including by writing more and scheduling oral arguments. He emphasized the importance of collegiality among the justices, even amid strong disagreements on difficult issues.</p>
