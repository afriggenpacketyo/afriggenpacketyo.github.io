          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 05:39:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has approved its 18th sanctions package against Russia, aiming to further curtail the Kremlin's war funding. A key measure includes lowering the price cap on Russian crude oil, a G7-led initiative designed to limit Moscow's revenues while keeping its oil on the global market to prevent shortages. The new package also targets Russia's banking, energy, and military-industrial sectors, and for the first time, sanctions a major Russian-owned refinery in India. This move signals a continued European push to pressure Russia economically over the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps defended the decision to keep a major data breach secret, stating the primary focus was on saving lives. The breach inadvertently leaked the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had worked with the British, putting them at risk of Taliban retribution. A super-injunction was used to block reporting on the incident, which Shapps argued was a necessary measure to prevent potential murders. The government has since established a resettlement scheme for those affected, with an estimated cost of £850 million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting next July, shoppers in the UK using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services will face stricter affordability checks under new regulations. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is introducing these rules to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and unexpected late fees. This means some users may be denied credit, and the process for making purchases could be slowed down. The move aims to bring the rapidly growing, currently unregulated BNPL sector in line with other forms of credit, following concerns from debt charities about the financial risks to consumers.

          <p>Following the deaths of children and staff at a Texas summer camp, experts are urging parents to ask camps specific questions about their safety protocols for extreme weather. With climate change increasing the risks of heatwaves, floods, and wildfires, the lack of consistent federal and state regulations for camps is a growing concern. Parents should inquire about heat mitigation strategies, such as shade structures and hydration schedules, and ask for detailed emergency action plans for floods and wildfires. This proactive approach is crucial for ensuring child safety in an environment with varying oversight and heightened natural dangers.</p>

          <p>According to the Environment Agency, serious water pollution incidents caused by water companies in England surged by 60% in 2024, reaching a record high. There were 75 incidents categorized as posing 'serious or persistent' harm, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the primary offenders. Critics and a parliamentary committee have described the situation as a 'national disgrace,' blaming years of underinvestment and weak regulation for the ecological damage. The industry acknowledges poor performance but now plans a £104 billion upgrade, which will lead to higher consumer bills.</p>

          <p>Swedish defense manufacturer Saab saw its shares jump significantly after reporting second-quarter profits and sales that exceeded market expectations. The company's operating income rose by 49% year-on-year, driven by a broad push across Europe to increase defense spending in an 'era of rearmament.' Saab's CEO noted that activity in the European defense market is extremely high, and the company is ramping up production to meet demand. The stock's performance reflects a larger trend benefiting the European defense industry as NATO members increase their security budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veteran MP Diane Abbott has been suspended by the Labour Party for a second time and stated that she believes the party's leadership wants to force her out. The suspension and a new investigation were triggered by comments she made in a BBC interview, where she reiterated controversial views on racism. In 2023, she was suspended for a letter suggesting Jewish people and Travellers experience prejudice but not racism in the same way as people of colour. Despite a past apology, her recent remarks doubling down on this distinction have led to renewed disciplinary action.</p>

          <p>The recent ban of high-frequency trading firm Jane Street by India's market regulator has brought the gray area between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation into sharp focus. Arbitrage involves exploiting price differences across markets, while manipulation involves intentionally distorting prices for unfair gain. Experts suggest the key distinction lies in intent and market impact; creating an artificial price discrepancy to profit from it crosses the line into manipulation. The case alleges the firm deliberately moved India's Nifty 50 index to profit from large options positions. (not investment advice)</p>
