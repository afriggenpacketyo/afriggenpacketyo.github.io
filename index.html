        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock market experienced a significant rally following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signals of potential interest rate cuts, a move largely prompted by a dramatic deceleration in hiring. This policy shift is expected to fuel bullish trends in housing, mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings, as investors align with the "don't fight the Fed" sentiment. Conversely, the article identifies enterprise software and healthcare as vulnerable sectors, anticipating a challenging September with rising prices and increased joblessness. Investors are encouraged to consider specific industrial and housing-related retail stocks, while remaining cautious about certain tech giants and the ongoing impact of tariffs.

          <p>Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, recently debuted significantly lighter blonde hair, leading an expert to suggest it symbolizes a fresh start after her cancer treatment. A British psychologist posits that this change could be a conscious effort to draw attention to her hair, reclaiming agency and visibility after a period of illness and potential hair loss from chemotherapy. The article frames this style evolution as reflecting a desire for a "brighter and more energetic" outlook, signifying her intention to leave the health ordeal behind. This public appearance follows her announcement of being cancer-free and coincides with her family's preparations for a new residence.</p>

          <p>A small contingent of National Guard members in Washington D.C., numbering fewer than 50, has been authorized to carry their service weapons, marking an escalation in federal intervention. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued this directive, despite local officials' reports of declining violent crime in the city over the past 18 months. These armed troops will operate under strict Rules for the Use of Force, permitting weapons only as a last resort against imminent threats. The deployment, initiated by President Trump to combat a perceived "epidemic of crime," has faced strong opposition from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other local leaders who consider it an unwarranted federal overreach.</p>

          <p>France has formally summoned US Ambassador Charles Kushner to address a letter he sent to President Emmanuel Macron, which alleged insufficient efforts by France to combat rising antisemitism. The French foreign ministry vehemently rejected these accusations as "unacceptable" and a breach of international law concerning non-interference in sovereign internal affairs. This diplomatic spat occurs amidst existing strains in US-French relations, including ongoing trade disputes and differing views on the future of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon. The article underscores the sensitivity of the issue, especially after Macron previously dismissed similar criticisms from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding France's plan to recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Copper Manufacturer Benefits from US Tariffs with New Texas Plant</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 21:10:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese copper flat wire manufacturer Wellascent is turning US import tariffs into a "golden opportunity" by building a new factory in Grand Prairie, Texas. This strategic investment, expected to produce 3,000 metric tons of copper flat wire annually by 2028, shields its US customers, including Stellantis, from the 50% tariff on imported copper wire. The article highlights this as a rare instance where a Chinese company benefits from tariffs designed to counter China's industrial dominance, despite broader US ambivalence towards Chinese investments. The company plans to invest $100 million, expecting the plant to generate over half its overseas revenue within three years, navigating complex trade relations and temporary tariff hurdles.

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a definitive end to its spectacular collapse under a mountain of debt. Once China's largest real estate firm, its shares were suspended after a winding-up order in January 2024, following years of struggling to meet interest payments on $300 billion in liabilities. The company's founder, Hui Ka Yan, was fined and banned for life for overstating revenue. The article explains that Evergrande's downfall has significantly impacted China's economy, contributing to a property slump, mass layoffs, and reduced consumer spending, with no clear end in sight for the broader crisis.

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify sending federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, overriding local leaders. This follows Trump's deployment of armed Guard members to Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the plan as a "flagrant violation of our constitution," citing significant drops in city shootings. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also asserted Trump was "abusing his power," as the National Guard is typically under state authority. The article highlights the contentious political debate over federal intervention in cities, particularly those led by Democrats and Black mayors, despite reported declines in crime.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director, with no official reason provided, sparking significant concerns about the politicization of intelligence within the administration. This dismissal occurred after a DIA assessment of military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities contradicted President Trump's public statements regarding the extent of the damage. Democratic Senator Mark Warner criticized the move, characterizing it as treating intelligence as a "loyalty test" rather than a safeguard for national security. The article highlights that DIA employees were surprised and voiced widespread apprehension about their work being influenced by political motives, noting that this incident is part of a pattern of recent removals of senior military officials.</p>

          <p>The first human case of the flesh-eating New World screwworm parasite in the United States has been confirmed in a person in Maryland who had traveled from Guatemala. This marks a critical development as the parasite, known to infest warm-blooded animals and be fatal if left untreated, has been escalating northward from Central America. The affected individual received treatment, and immediate prevention measures were implemented in Maryland. The article underscores significant concerns for the US beef and cattle futures market, which is already experiencing record-high prices due to tight supplies. Critics are questioning the US Department of Agriculture's speed in establishing sterile fly production facilities, a proven method for eradicating the pest, to prevent further spread and economic impact.</p>

          <p>Four individuals tragically lost their lives in a fiery crash on Interstate 15 in Temecula, California, when a BMW M4, driven recklessly, veered over the concrete median into southbound traffic. The BMW collided head-on with a Nissan Sentra, instantly bursting into flames. Three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—were killed, along with the 35-year-old driver of the Nissan. The 25-year-old BMW driver survived with major injuries and was pulled from the wreckage by good Samaritans.

His legal team views the proposed deportation to Uganda as a punitive tactic designed to coerce a guilty plea, and they express concern it could ultimately lead to his re-deportation to El Salvador.
