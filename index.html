          <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs triggered significant market turmoil in Europe.  Luxury goods, autos, and banking sectors suffered heavy losses due to increased import duties. Conversely, European currencies like the euro and the British pound saw a temporary surge.  The long-term economic consequences remain uncertain, with widespread predictions of slowed growth and fractured trade ties.</p>
