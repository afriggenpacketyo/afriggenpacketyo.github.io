          <p>Numerous airlines have announced the suspension and diversion of flights to and from Israel, rerouting aircraft to avoid the region's airspace after recent Israeli missile strikes on Iran. Delta Air Lines has suspended its Tel Aviv service until at least September, reversing its recent resumption of flights, while United Airlines has halted its Tel Aviv flights through Saturday. El Al, Israel's national airline, has also suspended its services and cautioned customers against traveling to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport until at least the end of June. These disruptions reflect growing concerns over safety and security in the region, leading airlines to prioritize passenger safety by altering flight paths and schedules.</p>

          <p>Israel has acknowledged conducting strikes on a nuclear facility located in Isfahan, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing tensions between the two nations. The strikes reportedly targeted the core of Iran's nuclear program, resulting in the deaths of several nuclear scientists and high-ranking military officials, according to Israeli sources. In response, Iran launched approximately 100 drones in an aerial attack, but Israel claims to have successfully intercepted and neutralized all of them before they reached their intended targets. A U.S. official stated that the United States did not participate in or provide assistance for the Israeli strike, maintaining a position of non-involvement in the operation. The event highlights the volatile geopolitical landscape and the potential for further conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is planning to attend the Iowa State Fair this summer, signaling his continued focus on the state that played a key role in his return to the White House. The visit, with dates still under discussion, is seen as an effort to bolster Republican support in farm country and commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary. Trump last attended the fair in August 2023, drawing large crowds and relishing the spectacle, and he later won the Iowa caucuses by a significant margin. During his previous visit, Trump also proposed hosting a year-long exhibition at the Iowa State Fairgrounds for the nation's semiquincentennial in 2026, showcasing pavilions from all 50 states.</p>

          <p>A $50,000 annuity can supplement retirement income, providing consistent monthly payments for life, but the exact amount varies based on several factors. For a 65-year-old man, a $50,000 immediate fixed annuity might yield around $325 per month, while a woman of the same age could receive about $313 per month, according to Annuity.org analysis of Cannex data. These figures are influenced by age, gender, annuity type (joint life annuities pay less), interest rates, and optional features. Deciding if a $50,000 annuity is suitable depends on prioritizing guaranteed income over potential investment growth, with considerations for liquidity and opportunity costs.

The match, characterized by fluctuating fortunes, saw Australia initially gain the upper hand before South Africa's strong batting performance shifted the momentum.

          <p>Kim Gordon, co-founder of Sonic Youth, has released a new version of her song “Bye Bye,” titled “Bye Bye 25,” featuring terms the Trump administration has attempted to minimize from public discourse. These terms, including “mental health,” “electric vehicle,” and “Gulf of Mexico,” are among at least 350 phrases that federal authorities have scrubbed from government websites and materials. Gordon's song highlights the absurdity of controlling policy by controlling language, avoiding sloganeering and presenting a ridiculous jumble of terms for listeners to reflect on. The song is one of the few outright protest songs responding to recent events, cutting across topic areas and emphasizing the dark absurdity of ascendant political tactics.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee, one week after being brought back to the U.S. from detention in El Salvador. Federal prosecutors allege that Abrego Garcia conspired to transport undocumented migrants within the U.S. in exchange for thousands of dollars. The case has involved a prolonged legal battle, as Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation. Prosecutors argue that Abrego Garcia's alleged MS-13 ties pose a risk of obstructing justice, while his attorneys claim the government's arguments for detention are meritless.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has lost his bid for an appeals court to rehear the E. Jean Carroll case, six months after a three-judge panel upheld a 2023 verdict ordering him to pay Carroll $5 million in damages.

Two judges on the 2nd Circuit, both nominated by Trump, dissented from the decision. Trump's legal team indicated they would appeal to the Supreme Court, while Carroll's attorney expressed satisfaction with the decision, stating that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 sitting members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a move that stunned doctors and scientists across the country. On Wednesday, Kennedy appointed eight new members to the committee, who are skeptical of the Covid-19 vaccines. Kennedy framed his decision to clear out the members as necessary to restore public trust in the government’s vaccine recommendations. The deepening divide between Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement and mainstream medicine could make it harder for people who want vaccines to get them, while encouraging more doubt about the value and safety of shots among the general public.</p>
