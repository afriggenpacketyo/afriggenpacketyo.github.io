          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting deaths of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, is in federal custody and is expected to face federal charges in addition to state charges. Boelter is also accused of wounding State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Authorities believe Boelter acted alone and are investigating a motive after a target list of dozens of Minnesota Democrats, including Governor Tim Walz and U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, was found in his car. The shootings prompted a massive manhunt, and Boelter was apprehended without incident in a rural area. The officers who confronted the suspect likely prevented other shootings from occurring. The suspect's motive is still under investigation.</p>

          <p>The Women's Super League (WSL) will expand from 12 to 14 teams starting in the 2026-27 season. The Football Association (FA) is expected to formally approve the changes, which will include adjustments to the promotion and relegation system between the WSL and WSL 2. Currently, only the WSL 2 winners earn promotion, but the expansion will introduce a play-off between the second-bottom WSL team and the WSL 2 runners-up. All clubs must meet the license criteria to play in the WSL 2 and the WSL, and the FA will decide on the next steps for the lower tiers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear a copyright lawsuit alleging Ed Sheeran's "Thinking Out Loud" infringed on Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," effectively ending the legal battle in Sheeran's favor. Structured Asset Sales (SAS), which owns a portion of the rights to Gaye's song, argued that Sheeran copied the melody, harmony, and rhythm. A lower court previously dismissed the case, finding the musical elements in question too common to warrant copyright protection. This decision follows Sheeran's victory in a separate copyright lawsuit over the same song, marking a significant legal win for the artist.</p>

Short-term CDs are currently offering the highest interest rates, making them attractive for maximizing returns. Long-term CDs provide security and predictability, but may have lower rates relative to short-term options. A CD ladder, which involves opening multiple CD accounts with varying terms, offers a balance of high rates and flexibility.

          <p>Vance Luther Boelter has been arrested on suspicion of killing Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, after a two-day manhunt. Boelter is also accused of shooting and wounding State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who are recovering in the hospital.

Boelter faces multiple charges, and authorities are investigating a potential political motive behind the attacks, as the governor is calling this a "politically motivated assassination".</p>

          <p>Israel's Defense Ministry reports that Israeli defense industry exhibitions at the Paris Air Show have been blocked after failing to comply with a directive to remove offensive weapons. The ministry condemned the move as "outrageous and unprecedented," citing political and commercial considerations. French authorities reportedly instructed the sealing off of exhibits after Israeli firms did not comply with the removal of offensive weapons. The air show organizer is in talks to find a resolution, but the French government has not commented.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin dairy farmer is suing the Trump administration, alleging discrimination against white farmers through the continuation of programs favoring minorities. The lawsuit claims that the USDA's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs disadvantage white male farmers. The farmer, Adam Faust, participates in USDA programs but faces higher administrative fees and lower loan guarantee percentages compared to minority and female farmers. The lawsuit contends that these policies violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal treatment.</p>
