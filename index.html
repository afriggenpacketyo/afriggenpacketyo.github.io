          <p>The Trump administration faced criticism after attempting to deport eight migrants with criminal records to South Sudan, a move a federal judge deemed a violation of court orders. The migrants, from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan, and Vietnam, were part of what DHS called a "diplomatic and military security operation." Lawyers argued the deportation violated due process rights, as the detainees had little time to object. The judge ordered the administration to retain custody of the deportees, and the Justice Department cited security concerns for ICE employees due to the detainees' criminal records. </p>

          <p>Columbia University's commencement ceremony was marked by protests and boos directed at acting President Claire Shipman, reflecting student anger over campus lockdowns, arrests, and administrative decisions. Graduates voiced their discontent regarding the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, an international student activist held by ICE. Shipman defended the rights of international students to free speech amid the Trump administration's clampdown on pro-Palestinian activism. Demonstrators outside the ceremony protested with chants and diploma burnings, resulting in a few arrests. Eliana Goldin, head of a pro-Israel student organization, expressed relief at leaving Columbia due to antisemitism on campus. </p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to advance President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act" due to significant disagreements among GOP members. The Freedom Caucus is pushing for steeper Medicaid cuts and the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, while moderates seek a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT). Despite pressure from Trump, who threatened to primary dissenting votes, a White House meeting aims to bridge the divide, with the OMB calling failure to pass the bill a "betrayal". The bill, which includes changes to Medicaid, SNAP, and immigration policy, faces an uncertain future as hard-liners pledge to vote against it. </p>

          <p>ICE officials and a prison contractor have denied a request for Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist, to have a contact visit with his newborn son and wife. The ACLU condemned the decision as a deliberate act of cruelty. ICE cited a blanket no-contact visitation policy and unspecified security concerns, despite federal policies encouraging contact visits between children and detained parents. Khalil was taken into custody in early March at his Columbia-owned apartment in New York City and was a vocal member of campus protests over the war in Gaza. </p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing a bill through Congress that could reignite international tax and trade wars by punishing foreign companies operating in the U.S. if their home countries enforce the global minimum tax agreement. The legislation would increase tax rates on companies from "discriminatory foreign countries" by up to 20 percentage points, giving the U.S. discretion over imposing new taxes on foreign firms. This looming tax fight is expected to be a key topic at the upcoming G7 meetings, potentially straining relations between the U.S. and other nations. Experts warn the bill could violate international tax treaties and deter foreign investment. </p>

Richard Drawe, a Texas farmer, recounts how the government took his land for the wall, disrupting his life despite his support for border security. Trump's history of using government-sanctioned land grabs highlights a contradiction between his criticism of South Africa and his actions at home. </p>

          <p>The United States has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar to potentially serve as a new Air Force One for President Trump, a decision that has ignited controversy. While the Qatari prime minister denies any improper influence, members of Congress worry about rushed security upgrades and potential listening devices. The Air Force is tasked with retrofitting the plane, estimated to cost over $1 billion, raising questions about funding and operational expenses. Senator Schumer intends to block the gift, citing national security concerns. </p>

However, pressure to abolish the IRA from the president, who is a fan of drilling, baby, drilling and denounced the law as the Green New Scam, pointed instead to brute force.
