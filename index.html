          <p>A shooting at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulted in one fatality and one injury. The suspect, a 31-year-old man, recklessly drove to the church and began firing a long gun and handgun at the building. A parishioner struck the suspect with their vehicle, and two staff members, one a security guard, returned fire, killing the attacker. One staff member was shot in the leg and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, while authorities investigate the motive behind the attack.

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is under renewed scrutiny as Japan approaches its first period without giant pandas in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. relations strained, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize ties with Tokyo. The first panda arrived in Japan in 1972, symbolizing friendship, and China last sent pandas in 2011. As current pandas are set to return to China, experts speculate whether new loans will be announced, potentially during a high-level visit, though the diplomatic weight of such gestures may have diminished.

Despite the release order, Abrego Garcia is expected to be immediately detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Abrego Garcia faces a federal trial on human smuggling charges, but prosecutors have indicated that ICE would take him into custody and potentially deport him before the trial. The judge acknowledged that the release is largely symbolic, as ICE will likely detain him, but upheld the presumption of innocence. Optimism score is not included in this summary.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests avoiding phrases like "Because I said so" and "Stop crying" to foster better communication. Instead, parents should explain their reasoning, acknowledge children's feelings, and invite problem-solving. The expert emphasizes creating conditions where cooperation feels natural, and responding with empathy and leadership.
