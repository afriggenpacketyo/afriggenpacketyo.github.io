          <h2>Harvard University Files Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over Funding Freeze</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, alleging that the freezing of billions in federal funding is unlawful and infringes upon the university's constitutional rights. Harvard claims the administration's actions are part of a pressure campaign to control academic programs and punish the university for protecting its rights, particularly concerning diversity and inclusion policies. The lawsuit argues that the funding halt will impede critical research and diminish economic innovation. Harvard's president emphasizes the severe and long-lasting consequences of the government's overreach, affecting patients, students, and the standing of American higher education.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, delivered her closing argument in Arizona, defending herself against charges of conspiring to murder her fourth husband. Daybell maintained that her brother acted in self-defense when he shot her husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019, denying any premeditation. Prosecutors argued that the shooting was a ploy to obtain a $1 million life insurance policy and to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, invoking religious beliefs to justify the murder. The jury is deliberating the verdict in this complex case involving accusations of twisted religious beliefs and conspiracy.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia, concluding a trade case initiated by American manufacturers.

Dumping duties range from 6.1% to 271.28%, while anti-subsidy duties are between 14.64% and 3,403.96%, depending on the company and country.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump stated that the US cannot provide trials for everyone it seeks to deport, estimating it would take 200 years, as his administration increases deportations of Venezuelan migrants, including those without criminal records. Lawyers have argued that the administration is deporting migrants without judicial review, potentially violating Supreme Court orders. This is happening under a 1798 law historically used only during wartime. The situation raises concerns about due process and the rights of immigrants in the United States.</p>

          <p>Following a fatal crash involving Xiaomi's SU7 electric vehicle (EV), the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) has urged its members to improve driving safety and avoid exaggerating the capabilities of self-driving systems. The CAAM outlined initiatives for standardizing the promotion and application of driver-assistance systems. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has also warned companies against using terms like "autonomous driving" in promoting existing systems. The crash, which claimed three lives, has prompted increased scrutiny and regulatory action within the Chinese EV industry.</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on open trade between China and the U.S., are facing significant challenges due to Trump's tariffs and policy changes. The current 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese goods is putting pressure on profit margins. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, further compounds the issue. Many dropshippers are now focusing on the European market and diversifying their supply chains to mitigate the impact of these trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
