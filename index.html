          <p>Major cities in China's Guangdong province, a global manufacturing hub, have entered a "combat-ready" state for Super Typhoon Ragasa. A Level 1 emergency alert has been issued, leading to the closure of schools, factories, and transportation systems, including airports in Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Residents have been advised to stay indoors and have been stockpiling essential supplies like food and water, causing shortages at some online grocery stores. The typhoon previously impacted the northern Philippines, causing over 10,000 evacuations before heading towards the Chinese coast.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially labeling the left-wing Antifa movement as a "domestic terrorist organization." The White House stated the designation is due to a perceived "pattern of political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity." This order directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle the movement, which is described as a decentralized, anti-fascist, and anti-racist political entity without a national leader. The action follows the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, although investigators have not publicly linked the suspect to any specific groups.</p>

Perdue noted that the relationship between the two presidents is currently "very good and very encouraging." The discussions occurred during a rare visit to Beijing by a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation aimed at improving communication, particularly on military issues.</p>

          <p>The main airports in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway, were forced to suspend operations for nearly four hours on Monday night due to multiple drone sightings. Danish police reported that the drones were likely flown by a "capable operator" and activated an armed forces response, though there was no indication of intent to cause harm. The closures affected approximately 20,000 passengers in Copenhagen alone, with at least 35 flights diverted. While authorities have not linked the incidents or confirmed the drones' origin, the event has raised security concerns across the region.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mike Freelander, a pediatrician with nearly 40 years of experience, has authored an opinion piece reinforcing that paracetamol is safe for use during pregnancy. This comes in response to recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting a link between the medication and autism. Dr. Freelander emphasizes that while the causes of autism are complex and often unknown, major studies have disproven a causative link with paracetamol. He urges the public to trust regulatory bodies like Australia's TGA, which have deemed the medication safe, and warns against the distress that can result from unscientific claims.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed the large-scale black market for Premier League football tickets, where unauthorized resale websites sell tickets for vastly inflated prices. At a recent Brighton vs. Tottenham match, over a hundred fans, including one who traveled from South Korea and paid £900, were turned away because their touted tickets had been deactivated. Brighton is using new technology to identify and cancel these tickets, blocking an estimated £100,000 in illicit transactions for that single match. The Premier League is also introducing new digital ticketing rules to combat this widespread issue.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that modern football tactics are increasingly mirroring the direct, set-piece-focused style famously employed by manager Sam Allardyce over 20 years ago. Premier League teams are showing a renewed emphasis on long balls, physical strikers, and goals from dead-ball situations, moving away from the possession-based game that has dominated recently. Allardyce, once criticized for his methods, notes that many coaches are now adopting his data-driven approach, including analyzing games from the stands for a better overview. The trend reflects a pragmatic shift, as statistics show giving the ball away in one's own half is a high-risk strategy.</p>

The article highlights the wear-and-tear on facilities not designed for long-term occupancy and the emotional toll on residents, particularly children.

This leaves European nations to grapple with difficult questions regarding trade, technology, and security on their own.

          <p>Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 season. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and was expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday night. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for land, the storm is generating large swells that are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward. Officials in the Azores are also monitoring the hurricane's progress.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced that U.S. doctors will soon be advised against prescribing Tylenol (paracetamol) to pregnant women due to a disputed link to autism. The administration plans to issue a physician's notice, initiate a safety label change, and launch a public health campaign. This move has been met with significant pushback from medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, who point to a large body of scientific evidence confirming the drug's safety and its status as one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Stephen Miller's Eulogy for Charlie Kirk Reveals Stark, Divisive Rhetoric</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes a eulogy delivered by White House adviser Stephen Miller for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, describing it as a "battle cry" that encapsulates the pure ideology of the Trump administration. The speech framed the political landscape as a Manichean struggle between the administration's supporters, who embody good, and their opponents, who are depicted as "wickedness and evil." The author contrasts Miller's divisive and confrontational rhetoric with Barack Obama's eulogy for Clementa Pinckney, which focused on forgiveness and reconciliation. Miller's speech is presented as an effort to use a tragedy to delegitimize all political opposition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jack Thorne, the writer of the upcoming ITV drama "The Hack," has praised the journalists who exposed the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World. The series, starring David Tennant, chronicles the work of Guardian reporter Nick Davies in uncovering the troubling relationship between the press, politics, and the police. Thorne, who also wrote the acclaimed "Mr Bates vs The Post Office," noted that unlike the Post Office case where journalism struggled to gain traction, the hacking story is a celebration of journalists successfully holding their own industry to account. He called their willingness to potentially damage their own industry "quite remarkable."</p>

          <p>Tesla has introduced the Megablock, a significant upgrade to its grid-scale battery storage offerings designed to speed up the deployment of large renewable energy projects. Each Megablock combines four of the company's existing Megapack batteries around a central transformer, simplifying the connection process to the grid. Tesla claims this new design will allow developers to deploy one gigawatt-hour of storage in just 20 days. This innovation comes as Tesla's energy storage division has become a major bright spot for the company, with Megapacks being used in major clean energy projects worldwide.

          <p>China's decision to halt purchases of Nvidia's stripped-down B40-series AI chips marks a significant turning point in the global tech landscape. The U.S. strategy was to allow the sale of less powerful chips to slow China's progress while maintaining its dependence on American suppliers. However, Beijing has interpreted this as an attempt to enforce technological inferiority and has instead opted to accelerate its push for indigenous innovation and self-sufficiency. This rejection signals that what was once seen as a distant goal of creating a domestic semiconductor industry has now become a national necessity for China.</p>

          <p>France has officially recognized a Palestinian state, with President Emmanuel Macron declaring at the UN that "the time for peace has come." This decision follows similar moves by the UK, Canada, Australia, and others, signaling a wave of international pressure on Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The recognition comes as the U.S. and other G7 nations were absent from a French-Saudi summit focused on a two-state solution. In his address, Macron urged an end to the war, the release of hostages, and the preservation of a two-state solution where Israel and Palestine can exist side-by-side in security.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old boy in Sacramento County, California, is accused of stealing his parents' truck and leading sheriff's deputies on a high-speed pursuit. The chase reportedly reached speeds of up to 70 mph before the boy crashed the truck into a patrol car and another parked vehicle. Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident. The boy was taken into custody and booked on multiple suspicions, including vehicle theft and assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer. As he is over the minimum age of criminal responsibility, his case will be reviewed by a county probation officer.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that comedian Jimmy Kimmel will return to his late-night talk show on Tuesday, ending a suspension that sparked a nationwide debate on free speech. The show was pulled after Kimmel made jokes about the reaction to the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which led to threats from the FCC chair to revoke ABC's broadcast licenses. The suspension was widely condemned as censorship by free speech advocates, Hollywood figures, and politicians. Disney stated the decision to reinstate the show came after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel, though some affiliate groups are still evaluating whether to air the program.</p>

          <p>An ancient tradition known as pannage has begun in England's New Forest, involving the release of hundreds of pigs to roam the woodland. This practice serves a vital ecological purpose: the pigs feast on fallen acorns, which are poisonous to the forest's free-roaming ponies and cattle. The season was initiated in mid-September due to a particularly heavy acorn crop this year. This centuries-old form of ecological stewardship helps maintain the health of the local livestock and the forest ecosystem. Officials remind visitors to drive carefully and keep a safe distance from the animals during this period.</p>
