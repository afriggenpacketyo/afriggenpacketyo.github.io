          <h2>US Gas Prices Expected to Decline, Potentially Reaching Cheapest Summer Levels Since 2021</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy analysts predict that U.S. gas prices will continue a slow decline throughout the summer, potentially offering the most affordable fuel costs since 2021. Following a temporary spike due to Middle East tensions, prices are expected to fall, possibly dropping below $3 per gallon by September. This trend is attributed to factors like increased refinery production, the stabilization of summer-blend gasoline costs, and softening consumer demand after early travel peaks. Despite recent fluctuations, experts note that when adjusted for inflation and rising incomes, Americans are spending a smaller portion of their income on fuel than in previous years.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claiming a significant military victory over Iran, recent polling suggests his domestic popularity has not seen a major boost. Many Israelis remain critical of his handling of the Gaza war, with a majority favoring an end to the conflict in exchange for hostages. Surveys indicate that a significant portion of the public believes Netanyahu is prolonging the war for personal political survival, and trust in his leadership remains below 50%. His political future is further complicated by ongoing corruption trials and international pressure, making the prospect of calling early elections a considerable risk.</p>

          <p>Activists and supporters are moving forward with the Budapest Pride march despite threats of legal consequences from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event defies a new "child protection" law that restricts gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality, with organizers hoping for a record turnout. While Orban downplayed the risk of violence, he warned attendees could face fines of up to â‚¬500. EU officials and the liberal mayor of Budapest have shown support for the march, highlighting the growing tension between Hungary's nationalist government and proponents of LGBTQ rights.</p>

          <p>A series of decisive military actions by Israel against Iran and its allies, including Hamas and Hezbollah, has significantly altered the strategic landscape of the Middle East. Following the Hamas attack of October 2023, Israel has reasserted its military dominance, culminating in a recent 12-day conflict that heavily targeted Iran's military and nuclear infrastructure. This has decimated Iran's "axis of resistance," but analysts note that military success has not resolved underlying political issues, particularly the Palestinian conflict. Israel's international standing has also been damaged by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, creating a complex and volatile regional situation.</p>

          <p>Countries across Southern Europe, including Italy, Greece, and Spain, are experiencing an intense heatwave, with temperatures predicted to surpass 40Â°C (104Â°F). Authorities have issued health warnings, advising residents to stay indoors during peak heat and placing emergency services on standby for heatstroke cases. The extreme heat, driven by hot air from North Africa, is considered unusual for June and has already contributed to wildfires in Greece. Scientists link the increasing frequency and intensity of such heatwaves to climate change, noting these events are now significantly more likely than in pre-industrial times.</p>

The 21-year-old claimed border officials interrogated him and sent him home after finding the meme on his phone, a claim the Department of Homeland Security has denied, stating the refusal was due to admitted drug use. Regardless of the truth, the article argues that the story's believability reflects a perception of the U.S. as increasingly authoritarian and intolerant of dissent. The incident has also, ironically, led to a resurgence in the popularity of JD Vance memes.</p>

          <p>Deciding whether to pay for a laundry service involves weighing convenience against cost, and financial experts suggest a structured approach to the decision. Key considerations include calculating your personal hourly rate to see if outsourcing the chore is cheaper than the value of your own time. It is also important to assess the emotional benefit; if laundry is a major source of stress, outsourcing it could improve your overall well-being and productivity. Experts also advise confirming you are comfortable with the premium price and ensuring that such convenience spending does not compromise long-term financial goals like retirement savings.

While denying closure plans, Lotus admitted it is "actively exploring" global market options, a move prompted by the business challenges posed by US tariffs on imported cars.

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Republican leaders are using the Democratic socialist's win as a new line of attack. At events like the Faith and Freedom Coalition summit, figures like RNC Chair Michael Whatley have pointed to Mamdani's progressive platform as evidence that the Democratic Party is embracing "radical socialism." Some Republicans have also launched personal and what critics call Islamophobic attacks against Mamdani, who is a Muslim of Indian descent. In response, Mamdani has focused on his platform's appeal to New Yorkers concerned with inequality, while some Democrats have defended him against the attacks.</p>

          <p>Jon Hallford, a Colorado funeral home owner, received a 20-year federal prison sentence for wire fraud after a gruesome discovery revealed he had improperly stored nearly 190 bodies. Instead of performing cremations, Hallford gave grieving families fake ashes and allowed the bodies to decay in a decrepit building. He and his wife also fraudulently obtained nearly $900,000 in COVID-19 aid, spending it on luxury goods. During the sentencing, victims, including a young boy, described the profound and lasting trauma of learning their loved ones' remains were desecrated, which the judge cited in delivering the maximum sentence.</p>

          <p>With a record heat wave sweeping parts of the U.S., child safety advocates are urgently warning parents and caregivers about the lethal danger of leaving children in hot vehicles. So far this year, nine children have died from heatstroke in cars, with an average of 38 such deaths occurring annually. Experts stress that a vehicle's interior can heat up by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes, and a child's body temperature can rise three to five times faster than an adult's. To prevent these tragedies, advocates recommend creating routines, such as leaving a personal item in the backseat, and immediately calling 911 if a child is seen unattended in a car.</p>

When he put on the Islanders jersey, which featured a pink ribbon patch in his mother's honor, he was visibly moved. Schaefer is a highly-regarded two-way player known for his puck-moving and defensive skills, making him the fifth defenseman to be selected first overall since 2000.</p>

          <p>In a landmark 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has ended the practice of federal courts issuing nationwide injunctions, which block government policies across the entire country. The ruling came in a case challenging a Trump administration executive order on birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion argued that these broad injunctions have no historical basis and that judicial remedies should be limited to the parties in a lawsuit. However, the court left open other avenues for broad relief, such as class-action lawsuits and orders providing "complete relief" to plaintiffs.</p>

          <p>England forward Lauren James is poised to make her return to the pitch in a friendly match against Jamaica after a three-month absence due to a hamstring injury. The 23-year-old Chelsea star has not played since April but has been training well and is expected to come on as a substitute. Her return is a significant boost for England's preparations as they begin the defense of their European title on July 5. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated that James's minutes will be carefully managed to ease her back into game fitness ahead of the tournament.</p>

          <p>A county in China's southwestern Guizhou province is on high alert as it braces for another round of heavy rain, just days after record-breaking floods killed at least six people. Authorities in Rongjiang county have ordered evacuations in several areas due to the new forecast. Earlier in the week, "exceptionally large floods" swept through the region, setting new records for rainfall and water levels. The deluge inundated low-lying areas, damaged infrastructure, and submerged the county's largest shopping center before the waters began to recede.</p>

          <h2>UK Labour Leader Keir Starmer Calls Fixing the Welfare System a "Moral Imperative"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 07:06:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has described fixing the country's "broken" benefits system as a "moral imperative." Speaking at a party conference, he addressed a recent U-turn on welfare cuts, which was forced by a backbench rebellion within his party. While promising not to remove the safety net for vulnerable people, Starmer stated he could not allow benefits to become a "snare" for those who are able to work. The government's modified plan, which now applies stricter criteria only to new claimants of a key disability benefit, still faces criticism from some MPs and the Unite union.</p>
