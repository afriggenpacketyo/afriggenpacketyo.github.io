          <p>A hit-and-run boat crash in Clearwater, Florida, resulted in one death and ten injuries, prompting a mass casualty declaration by the city's fire department. The Clearwater Ferry, carrying 45 people, was struck by a recreational boat that fled the scene but was later identified. The operator of the recreational boat is cooperating with authorities, and a breathalyzer test indicated they were not intoxicated at the time of the incident. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, with assistance from the Coast Guard, is investigating the crash, which occurred on the final day of a local sand sculpture festival.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations that the law journal was selecting articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. This action follows a recent freeze on $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard due to concerns about antisemitism and other issues on campus, which prompted a lawsuit from the university challenging the legality of the freeze. The Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services will investigate potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs.</p>

          <p>Oleksandr Usyk believes Daniel Dubois displayed "weakness" by pushing him during their face-off, promoting their rematch for the undisputed world heavyweight champion title. Usyk, holding the WBA (Super), WBO, and WBC belts, is set to fight IBF champion Dubois at Wembley Stadium on July 19. Usyk is undefeated in 23 fights and won against Dubois via a ninth-round stoppage in August 2023. Dubois, however, claims that the push was a sign of a 'new me' and that 'the fear of acting in a particular way is not there any more'.</p>

          <p>In Mesa, Arizona, police apprehended an arson suspect who allegedly set fire to a newly delivered Tesla Cybertruck at a dealership, after writing "THEIF" (sic) on the side of the building. Ian Moses, 35, was arrested and booked into jail for arson of a structure and property, with additional charges pending as federal authorities collaborate on the investigation. This incident is part of a broader national trend of vandalism targeting Musk's companies, driven by activists protesting his involvement with the Trump administration.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson met with President Donald Trump to strategize on the GOP's approach to budget reconciliation, aiming to reshape federal spending in line with Trump's domestic agenda. Following the meeting, Johnson and top administration officials expressed optimism about reaching a budget deal focused on Trump's priorities, with the goal of passing the tax portion of the package by July 4. Republicans are working to cut at least $2 trillion from federal spending over the next decade, but polling shows the public is souring on Trump's job performance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's increased scrutiny of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, including a request for a new clinical trial after full approval, has introduced uncertainty regarding updates to other vaccines.

The election outcome will determine who leads Canada in its relationship with the United States under Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>The government is consulting on plans to extend the sugar tax, known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to include milkshakes and other milk-based drinks in an effort to tackle obesity. This proposal would end the current exemption for dairy-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes, and reduce the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before they are subject to the levy. The Treasury believes this will incentivize manufacturers to reduce sugar in their recipes, while industry representatives have expressed their willingness to share their views in the consultation.</p>

The US president has increased tariffs on some Chinese imports to a staggering 245 per cent , reigniting a trade war with real economic consequences.
