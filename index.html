This event marked the first time the Weather Service in Romeoville had issued a dust storm warning for Chicago, recalling similar conditions during the Dust Bowl era.

Nelson, despite a reported cold, delivered heartfelt renditions of his classics, while Dylan offered radically transformed versions of his hits. John Stamos, surprisingly, played percussion in Nelson’s band, adding to the night's unique moments. The concert was part of the annual Outlaw Music Festival, showcasing the enduring appeal of these legendary artists and their influence on younger roots-music acts. (optimism score 85)</p>
