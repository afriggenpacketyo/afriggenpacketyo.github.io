          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied a request from the Department of Justice to unseal grand jury transcripts connected to the criminal investigation of Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell was previously convicted for her role as a procurer for the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Justice Department had pushed for the release of the materials following significant public criticism regarding the handling and lack of transparency in the original Epstein investigation. This ruling means the detailed proceedings from the grand jury will remain confidential for the time being.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is set to hold a news conference to unveil a plan he claims will significantly reduce violent crime in Washington, D.C. This announcement follows his recent threats to deploy the National Guard and potentially federalize the city's law enforcement to address crime, cleanliness, and homelessness. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has countered these claims, pointing to data showing a decrease in crime and criticizing the president's narrative as hyperbolic and false. The move comes after a former government employee was assaulted in the city, escalating Trump's focus on the capital's condition.</p>

          <p>Everton is reportedly making progress in negotiations to sign Manchester City winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old England international, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, has seen his playing time diminish significantly over the past two seasons. A move to Everton would provide Grealish with an opportunity to secure regular first-team football and revitalize his career ahead of the World Cup. While an agreement is not yet finalized, the potential transfer represents a major signing for Everton as they prepare for their first season in a new stadium.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has surged to nearly $120,000, approaching its all-time high, while Ether has climbed past the significant $4,000 mark for the first time since December 2021. This rally in the cryptocurrency market has been largely attributed to buying activity during Asian trading hours, potentially fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt. Analysts suggest this trend acts as a tailwind for hard assets like Bitcoin and gold, positioning the market for further potential gains. The surge has also boosted the stock prices of related companies like Coinbase and various crypto miners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of enterprise artificial intelligence firm C3 AI dropped by 30% after it released preliminary first-quarter financial results that CEO Thomas Siebel described as "completely unacceptable."

Siebel attributed the poor performance to a disruptive sales reorganization and his own health issues, which limited his involvement in the sales process.

This "boring" method allows investors to harness average market returns over extended periods, a strategy that historically outperforms most active fund managers. The core principle is that achieving sustainable, long-term growth is more effective than chasing high-risk, short-term gains. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead, the country now employs a more diverse toolkit to manage volatility while allowing for more market-based pricing.

          <p>Major U.S. automakers are recalibrating their electric vehicle strategies following the Trump administration's moves to eliminate EV mandates and subsidies. With the $7,500 tax credit set to expire and the market for regulatory credits disappearing, companies like Tesla, GM, Ford, and Rivian are facing new financial realities. On recent earnings calls, executives discussed anticipating short-term demand rushes before the credits end, followed by a slowdown, and adjusting production plans accordingly. Ford, for instance, is now placing a greater emphasis on its hybrid vehicle lineup as a more viable long-term strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysts Warn Trump's Trade Policies Could Exacerbate Wealth Inequality in Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 08:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While some Southeast Asian nations secured lower-than-expected tariffs in recent trade negotiations with the U.S., analysts are concerned about the long-term economic impact. The revised trade policies could widen the wealth gap by harming labor-intensive sectors like garment manufacturing, which employ millions of low-skilled workers. Additionally, the influx of cheap Chinese goods being diverted from the U.S. market may suppress local wages and industries. A major worry is the U.S. plan to impose heavy tariffs on 'transshipment' goods from China that are routed through Southeast Asia, potentially devastating entire supply chains.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused widespread flooding across several midwestern states, including Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa, leading to road closures and power outages for thousands. The Milwaukee area was particularly hard-hit, receiving up to 14 inches of rain and recording its second-wettest day in history. The severe weather forced motorists to abandon vehicles, prompted hundreds of emergency calls, and led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair.

This article suggests that Trump's steadfast support for Israel, a potential war with Iran, and other actions have stirred anger among white supremacists and neo-Nazis who view him as insufficiently dedicated to their cause. Experts note the irony that these groups are freer to organize than ever due to changes under his presidency, yet their online rhetoric increasingly frames him as an enemy, highlighting a complex and fractured relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A law in Ohio is creating a transportation crisis for public school students in cities like Dayton, as it legally requires public school districts to provide busing for private and charter school students. Due to a shortage of drivers and buses, and facing heavy fines for non-compliance, districts are forced to cut transportation for their own high school students. This leaves thousands of families to find and pay for alternative transport, such as expensive ride-sharing services or relying on public transit, which has raised safety concerns. The situation highlights a broader political push towards funding private education at the expense of public school resources.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Osita Nwanevu's book, "The Right of the People," which argues that achieving true democracy in America requires transforming both political institutions and the economy. The reviewer finds Nwanevu's proposals, such as ending the filibuster and raising taxes on wealth, to be a familiar progressive wish list rather than a new founding. The critique centers on the book's failure to engage with the complexities of right-wing populism or explain why working-class voters often lean conservative. Ultimately, the reviewer suggests the book's vision of democracy is too abstract and disconnected from the political realities of many Americans.</p>

The continued closure of Pakistani airspace to Indian carriers has also compounded operational challenges for its long-haul routes. Passengers will be offered alternative travel options with partner airlines via layovers in other U.S. cities, but the suspension removes the only direct flight between the two capital cities by an Indian airline.</p>
