          <h2>Los Angeles Dodgers' Offensive Rally Falls Short in Loss to Milwaukee Brewers</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense showed signs of life by scoring seven runs, but it was not enough to overcome pitching struggles in an 8-7 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite a three-RBI day from Shohei Ohtani and back-to-back home runs late in the game, the team failed to capitalize on key opportunities. This defeat marks the Dodgers' ninth loss in their last eleven games, continuing a frustrating period for the high-priced roster. The team's inability to deliver timely hits remains a significant concern amid their ongoing slump.</p>

          <p>Violent sectarian clashes have continued in southern Syria, resulting in over 900 reported deaths in the past week despite a ceasefire announcement from the country's interim president. The conflict between Druze fighters and Bedouin gunmen in Suweida province has drawn international concern, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanding an end to the "rape and slaughter of innocent people." Tensions escalated after the abduction of a Druze merchant, leading to widespread violence that has also involved Israeli military intervention against Syrian government forces accused of attacking the Druze community.</p>

          <h2>Number of Individuals Missing After Texas Floods Substantially Decreases in Kerr County</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Kerr County, Texas, the number of people reported missing following severe floods earlier this month has dropped from nearly 100 to just three. Officials attribute the significant reduction to diligent follow-up work by local and state agencies, which verified that most individuals were safe. The devastating July 4 floods resulted in a statewide death toll of 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County alone. The update provides a measure of relief amid the ongoing recovery efforts from the widespread natural disaster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are disproportionately affecting small, rural radio stations that serve as vital sources of local news and information. Allegheny Mountain Radio in West Virginia, for example, relies on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for up to 65% of its budget and now faces potential staff cuts or closure. These stations provide essential community services, from reporting on local government to broadcasting obituaries and lost pet announcements in areas with limited internet and phone access. The funding reduction is seen by some as a politically motivated attack that hurts the very communities it claims to support.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Global Moral Decay Hinders Peace Efforts in Modern Conflicts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece by Simon Tisdall posits that the failure to achieve peace in conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine stems from a global crisis of morality, not just political deadlock. The article argues that a collapse of a shared "permanent moral order" allows atrocities and the deliberate targeting of civilians to become commonplace. This moral relativism is exemplified by figures like Donald Trump and the public's tolerance of actions by leaders in Russia and Israel. The author contends that without a collective commitment to universal ethical standards, as defined by international law and shared responsibility, the cycle of violence will continue unabated.</p>

DNA evidence from the scene eventually identified George Steven Burch, a man with no prior connection to the victim, who was tracked by his phone's Google Dashboard data to the crime scenes.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges the newspaper defamed him by publishing a story about a purported birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein that the paper claimed was signed by Trump. Trump has vehemently denied the report and called the letter a fake. This legal action comes as Trump faces pressure to disclose more details about his past association with Epstein.</p>

          <h2>Use of High-Strength Nicotine Pouches Is a Growing, Unregulated Trend Among UK Teens</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There is a rising trend of nicotine pouch use among young people in the UK, with some teens using products containing up to 150mg of nicotine. These smokeless pouches, often called "snus," are sold without age restrictions and come in appealing flavors, making them easily accessible to children. Dentists are reporting an increase in patients with severe gum damage, including lesions and shredded tissue, caused by the pouches. Health experts and Trading Standards officials are calling for urgent regulation, as the pending Tobacco and Vapes Bill would make it illegal to sell these highly addictive products to minors.</p>

          <p>An initiative promoted by the UK government to install "Great British Energy solar panels" on schools has been revealed to have used panels manufactured by two Chinese firms. This has drawn criticism from MPs concerned about supporting Chinese industries, given allegations of forced labor in the country's solar panel supply chains, particularly in the Xinjiang region. While the government and its state-owned company, GB Energy, insist that all contracts comply with modern slavery rules, the revelation highlights the difficulty of avoiding Chinese dominance in the global solar market and the ethical challenges it presents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travelers at Edinburgh Airport are increasingly avoiding the official drop-off zone to evade fees that can reach £6 for a ten-minute stay. Drivers are instead waiting in nearby lay-bys and on side streets, coordinating with arriving passengers by phone to arrange a quick pickup and avoid the charges. This behavior highlights public frustration with rising "kiss-and-fly" fees, which have increased at more than half of the UK's busiest airports in the last year. Critics call the charges "extortionate" and "greedy," especially for those with mobility issues who cannot use the distant free drop-off area.</p>

          <p>In occupied areas of Ukraine, Russia is conducting a comprehensive campaign to erase Ukrainian national identity and indoctrinate children with pro-Russian ideology. This effort involves rewriting school curricula, forcing students to sing the Russian anthem, and holding "bravery lessons" with soldiers who depict Ukrainian forces as neo-Nazis. State-sponsored youth groups like Yunarmia (Youth Army) provide military-style training to children as young as eight. Furthermore, thousands of Ukrainian children have been forcibly deported to Russia for "re-education," an act that has led to an ICC arrest warrant for President Putin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The traditional six-week summer holiday for schools in the UK is the subject of a growing debate, with arguments for and against shortening the break. Proponents suggest a shorter holiday could help prevent learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for working parents, and potentially lower holiday travel prices. However, many teachers oppose the change, arguing the long break is essential for them to rest and prepare for the new school year. While some schools have already moved to a five-week summer and two-week October half-term, recent consultations in Wales show the public remains deeply divided on the issue.</p>

          <p>The global transition to renewable energy is driving a massive demand for lithium, but its extraction is causing a severe environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama Desert, home to the world's largest reserves. Lithium mining, which involves pumping vast amounts of brine from beneath salt flats, is depleting water resources in the drought-prone region. This has devastated local ecosystems, shrinking lagoons, harming wildlife like flamingos, and threatening the livelihoods of indigenous communities who have lived there for generations. Locals express deep concern that the global push for green technology is sacrificing their environment and future.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has stated that savers are missing out on financial rewards due to an overly negative perception of investing in stocks and shares. She announced plans to encourage investment, including sending information about opportunities to those with money in low-interest accounts. The government is also considering changes to the popular tax-free Individual Savings Account (ISA) system to incentivize a shift from cash savings to investments. Experts note that women in particular invest less than men and caution that any policy changes must be handled carefully to avoid deterring new investors. (not investment advice)</p>

While still luxurious and expensive, these new spaces prioritize personal accomplishment over family pedigree, providing a networking and social haven for India's self-made elite.

          <p>A widely circulated image that appears to show Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein with a young girl has been determined to be a fake, created using artificial intelligence. The image, which resurfaced in July 2025, contains numerous tell-tale signs of AI generation, such as deformed hands, a distorted jacket sleeve on Trump, and malformed faces in the background. While authentic photos of Trump and Epstein together do exist, this specific viral image is not one of them.
