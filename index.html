          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate a program that had permitted over 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States while a legal challenge to the program's termination proceeds. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, expressing concern about the potential human suffering resulting from the decision. The administration argues that the program, known as CHNV, violated immigration law and incentivized illegal immigration, while opponents contend that ending the program would cause immense hardship.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that premium TV content, particularly live sports, is being pirated at an "industrial scale" due to a lack of action by major tech companies. The report accuses Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of "ambivalence and inertia," leading to revenue losses for broadcasters and increased cybercrime risks for users. The Amazon Fire Stick is identified as a key enabler of piracy, while illegal streams often require users to provide sensitive information, making them vulnerable to malware and phishing scams.</p>

          <p>France will extend its smoking ban to beaches, public gardens, and areas near schools starting July 1st, aiming to protect young people from tobacco and reduce the influence of smokers. The health ministry emphasizes that the freedom to smoke ends where children's right to breathe clean air begins. The expansion is part of a national plan to achieve a tobacco-free generation by 2032, with non-compliance potentially resulting in a fine. The new measure has strong public support, with 78% of respondents favoring eliminating cigarettes in new public spaces.</p>
