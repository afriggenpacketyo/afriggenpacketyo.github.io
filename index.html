          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has limited the ability of federal judges to issue sweeping nationwide injunctions that block government policies. The ruling came in a case challenging a Trump administration executive order on birthright citizenship, which the court did not rule on directly. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion argued that such broad orders likely exceed the authority Congress granted to federal courts, while the dissent warned that the decision leaves important rights vulnerable.</p>

          <p>For a 65-year-old retiree, a $300,000 immediate fixed annuity could provide a guaranteed monthly income of approximately $1,942 for a man or $1,861 for a woman. This article explains that these insurance products offer predictable income streams, with payouts influenced by age, gender, prevailing interest rates, and the specific type of annuity chosen. While annuities can reduce retirement uncertainty, prospective buyers should consider the trade-offs, such as limited liquidity and potential inflation risk. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Supreme Court's decision limited the use of nationwide injunctions, this analysis argues the impact may be narrower than it appears. The opinion leaves open the possibility for broad injunctions when necessary to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs, such as states arguing a policy is unworkable if not blocked everywhere. The article suggests that opponents of the policy could also pursue a class-action lawsuit to achieve a similarly broad effect, meaning the ruling does not fully eliminate powerful judicial checks on executive power.</p>
