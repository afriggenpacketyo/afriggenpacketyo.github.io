        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump declared his intention to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. This move, announced on Truth Social, marks an unprecedented attempt to exert presidential influence over the independent monetary body. Cook, however, stated she would not resign, arguing that the President lacks the legal authority to remove her 'for cause' under the Federal Reserve Act. This dispute is expected to lead to a significant legal battle, challenging the long-standing tradition of Fed independence and potentially impacting US monetary policy. The situation underscores a growing tension between the executive branch and the central bank.</p>

          <p>Australia has expelled two Iranian diplomats, accusing the Islamic Republic of orchestrating recent antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that credible intelligence from ASIO confirmed Iran's direction of at least two incidents, including attacks on a restaurant and a synagogue. This diplomatic action also included the withdrawal of Australian diplomats from Iran and plans to designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. The move follows a rise in antisemitic incidents in Australia since October 2023 and comes after Australia's announcement to recognize Palestinian statehood, drawing sharp criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a significant policy shift, stating the US would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, more than double the current number. This message came shortly after the Chinese embassy in the US warned its students about 'unjustifiable questioning and harassment' at Houston airport. Trump expressed a desire for improved relations with China, indicating his administration aims to 'get along good' and acknowledging an invitation to visit China from President Xi. The move suggests a potential de-escalation in US-China educational and diplomatic tensions, despite recent reports of student scrutiny.</p>

His plea, which came after prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty, is hailed as a landmark victory by US Attorney General Pam Bondi.

This technique aims to obscure the directional origin of the aircraft's emissions, effectively making the platform behave like a 'phantom' to adversaries.

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing mortgage fraud allegations, is seen as a major escalation in his efforts to control the independent central bank. Cook's refusal to resign and the President's repeated attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates highlight a significant challenge to the Fed's venerated independence. Economists widely prefer an independent central bank to make unpopular decisions, like raising interest rates to combat inflation, free from political pressure. This move could lead to financial market instability, with potential stock price drops and bond yield spikes, increasing borrowing costs for consumers and the government.</p>

This 'insect robot factory' concept focuses on industrializing production to reduce time and cost for practical applications. The enhanced precision and potential for mass production could enable these hybrid robots to navigate complex environments, offering a novel approach to locating survivors and assessing damage in hazardous disaster zones.</p>

          <p>A Utah district court judge has ruled that the state's Republican-controlled legislature unlawfully drew congressional boundaries in 2021, mandating a redrawing of the map for the 2026 midterm elections. The current map divided Salt Lake County, a Democratic stronghold, among four districts, all of which subsequently elected Republicans. The ruling found the legislature circumvented a voter-established commission designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering. While Republican lawmakers have promised appeals, the decision creates uncertainty for the GOP's slim House majority, potentially impacting national political dynamics. The new maps will need to be finalized quickly, ideally by November, to allow time for the electoral process.</p>

This restriction is due to the combustible nature of these power sources, which can overheat and pose a fire risk. If such devices ignite in checked baggage within the cargo hold, detection and intervention would be significantly delayed. Plug-in tools remain unrestricted, but for cordless versions, a safety cover must be securely fitted over the heating element.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Alabama's Dauphin Island is slowly disappearing due to ongoing erosion from storms and sea-level rise, with some residents still paying taxes on submerged land. Katrina severed the island's west end, destroying over 300 homes and permanently washing away their foundations. Mayor Jeff Collier highlights the dire existential crisis, noting homes are perilously close to the Gulf. Despite efforts to rebuild beaches with oil spill settlement money, constant maintenance is critical, and the town faces a multi-million dollar funding challenge.

The withheld money, intended for after-school programs, teacher training, and English-learner support, had left many communities uncertain about sustaining vital services for approximately 1.4 million children, primarily from low-income families.
