          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation introducing a new travel ban impacting a dozen countries with full restrictions and partially restricting travelers from seven others, citing national security concerns and inadequate vetting procedures. The ban, set to take effect on June 9th, applies to foreign nationals from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The partial ban affects individuals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela, raising concerns about its impact on legal immigration pathways, especially for those who have assisted the U.S. government. The action follows Trump's campaign promise to restore a travel ban he claims was successful in preventing terrorist attacks.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study examining dinosaur feathers preserved in Burmese amber has provided insights into the evolution of flight feathers, a key development that allowed birds to excel over their dinosaur relatives in aerial dominance. Researchers analyzed the structure of 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, discovering details about feather evolution during this time. The development of feathers capable of generating thrust and lift was critical for the advancement of birds. While modern birds descended from dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the ability to fly in the same manner, although some could glide or achieve powered flight.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed an investigation into the Biden administration's potential use of an autopen to sign presidential documents, including pardons, citing concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities. Trump's memo instructs Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to investigate what he alleges is a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline through the use of an autopen. He argues that if Biden's advisors secretly used the mechanical signature pen, it could have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions. Presidents have used autopens for decades, and the Justice Department under President George W. Bush stated that it is legal for a president to use an autopen to sign bills into law.</p>

The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Columbia's accrediting institution, of the alleged violation. According to federal regulations, accreditors must notify member institutions of noncompliance findings and establish a plan for compliance.

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may offer protection against dangerous infections, specifically reducing the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns in their first week of life, tracking their health for the subsequent two years. They found that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum in early infancy appeared to have a protective effect. Babies with this species were significantly less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections, suggesting a crucial role for early microbial encounters in immune system development.</p>

Sable officials stated the decision would force them to push back their restart timeline to August 1, 2025.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to implement stricter measures to address unpaid medical bills incurred by foreign tourists during their stay. The measure, to be included in the forthcoming annual basic policy on economic and fiscal management, will clearly state that the government will "review insurance coverage for foreigners." This initiative aims to mitigate the financial burden on healthcare providers due to unpaid medical expenses by tourists.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his opposition to Donald Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill, criticizing it in numerous posts on his social media platform X. He rallied voters to contact lawmakers, urging them to "KILL the BILL" due to concerns about its impact on the national debt. Musk's opposition comes as the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the U.S. debt over the next decade. The bill includes tax cuts and increased defense spending, facing pushback from various factions.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is establishing a commission to examine whether the UK should withdraw from international legal agreements, including the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The commission, chaired by Tory peer Lord Wolfson of Tredegar, will assess if these agreements and domestic legislation are binding the hands of British governments. The review will also consider the impact of the ECHR on asylum claims and the deportation of foreign criminals, as well as laws such as the Climate Change Act and the Human Rights Act.
