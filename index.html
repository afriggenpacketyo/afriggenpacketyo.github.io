          <p>A New Jersey man, Navin Khanna, has pleaded guilty to masterminding a nationwide catalytic converter theft ring that generated over $600 million. Khanna admitted to conspiring to purchase stolen converters from multiple states and reselling them to a metal refinery, Dowa Metals & Mining, for the extraction of precious metals like platinum and palladium. The large-scale operation was uncovered following a 2021 traffic stop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, during a national surge in such thefts. Khanna now faces a potential prison sentence of up to 17.5 years for conspiracy and money laundering.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence industry experienced a massive influx of capital, raising $104.3 billion in the first half of 2025, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Major players like OpenAI and Anthropic secured huge investments, driving over two-thirds of all U.S. venture funding into AI. However, this investment boom contrasts sharply with the exit market, where there were only 281 venture-capital-backed exits totaling $36 billion. Analysts note a trend of frequent but lower-value acquisitions, as larger companies buy smaller startups to enhance their capabilities, while high-value IPOs remain scarce.

          <h2>New Federal Student Loan Repayment Plan Introduced Under Recent Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 16:47:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently passed legislation has established a new income-driven student loan repayment option called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), set to be available by July 2026. The plan calculates monthly payments as a percentage of a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a minimum payment of $10. Unlike previous plans, RAP does not shield a portion of income but offers a $50 monthly credit per dependent and leads to loan forgiveness after 30 years. After its implementation, new borrowers will only have the choice between RAP and a standard repayment plan.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic heavy metal pioneer who co-founded Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. His family confirmed his death, though the exact circumstances were not detailed. Osbourne had publicly battled Parkinson's disease and other health issues, leading to his retirement from touring in 2023. Known for his distinctive wail and theatrical stage presence, he defined the sound and image of heavy metal, both with Black Sabbath and as a successful solo artist, earning two inductions into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. His career was marked by legendary excesses, enduring music, and a late-career resurgence as a beloved reality TV personality.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's recent activity on Truth Social, suggesting a shift towards more unusual and defensive posting, particularly in response to the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Over a recent weekend, Trump shared a high volume of posts, including AI-generated images of political rivals in prison and a strange, contextless montage of extreme stunts. The author likens this behavior to "soft-brain scrolling" common on other platforms and suggests it may be a coping mechanism or a sign of rage and paranoia. The piece posits that as Trump faces political pressure he cannot easily control, his posts are retreating from influencing reality into a fantasy world of retribution.</p>

Lee later stated he removed the post "out of an abundance of caution" after being unable to verify its legitimacy.

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations but revealed a significant $1.1 billion negative impact from U.S. auto tariffs.

CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives. The company's stock fell following the announcement, reflecting investor concern over the tariffs' effect on profitability, with its North America margin dropping to 6.1% from 10.9% a year ago.

Industry data suggests that manufacturers have so far absorbed most of these increased costs rather than passing them on to consumers, who are already facing high new car prices.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism from "China hawks" for its decision to rescind a ban on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China. The reversal was part of a broader trade deal in June where the U.S. eased some export controls in exchange for access to Chinese rare earth minerals. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the move, stating the U.S. is selling a lower-tier chip to keep Chinese developers reliant on the American technology stack. However, critics are concerned that any sale of advanced technology could bolster China's capabilities, highlighting ongoing tensions within Washington over the right approach to economic competition with Beijing.</p>

          <p>An analysis by the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) suggests that recent federal immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles County overwhelmingly targeted Latino communities. The group's data, based on verified reports to its rapid response network, shows that the zip codes with the highest number of raids have predominantly Latino populations. CHIRLA's executive director described the operations as a "surgical attack meant to provoke panic" and an example of blatant racial profiling. The report adds to widespread concern and a recent lawsuit claiming that ICE and DHS agents have unlawfully targeted individuals based on race and ethnicity.</p>

          <p>Life sciences firm Danaher reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's lowered expectations, with revenue and adjusted earnings per share both topping consensus estimates. The company saw modest core revenue growth, driven by solid performance in developed markets like North America and Western Europe. However, its business in China remains a significant challenge, posting a mid-single-digit decline due to the country's cost-control policies in healthcare. While the company raised its full-year earnings target slightly, the ongoing uncertainty in China and a cautious outlook led to a mixed market reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges in New Jersey has voted to replace interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, at the end of her 120-day term. Invoking a federal statute, the judges appointed career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace to the position instead. The move rebuffs the Trump administration's wishes and sets up a potential conflict between the judiciary and the White House. Habba's tenure had been marked by politically charged prosecutions against Democrats, and her allies in the administration accused the judges of acting on a "left-wing agenda."</p>

The powerful footage shows the ground suddenly dividing and shifting horizontally in opposite directions. Seismologists analyzed the video using pixel cross-correlation, determining the fault slipped 8.2 feet in just 1.3 seconds at a speed of up to 10.5 feet per second. This unprecedented visual data confirms long-held theories about pulse-like ruptures and provides a new benchmark for understanding the physics of how large earthquakes occur.</p>

The decline was driven by significant drops in the production of feature films and commercials, which fell by 21.4% and 15.3% respectively. Television production was a lone bright spot, showing a 17% increase in shoot days, largely due to gains in TV dramas and reality shows. The overall production level remains 32.5% below the region's five-year average, though recent expansions to California's film tax credit are hoped to boost future activity.</p>
