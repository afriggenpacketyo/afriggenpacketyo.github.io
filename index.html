          <p>Karla Flores, experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, but an MRI revealed a second tumor on her spine. Neurosurgeon Dr. Mohammed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center devised a plan to remove both tumors. The first tumor was removed through traditional neurosurgery, but the second required a novel approach through Flores' eye socket. After weeks of preparation and practice on cadavers, Labib and his team successfully removed the spinal tumor, and Flores is now cancer-free and undergoing rehabilitation. </p>

          <p>A monument to Joseph Stalin has been replicated and reinstalled in a Moscow metro station, decades after the original was removed during de-Stalinization. The statue, depicting Stalin with children and workers, was initially taken down in the 1960s. While President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged the tragic period of Stalinist purges, an estimated 105 statues honoring the dictator have been erected since he came to power. The reappearance of the statue has elicited mixed reactions, with some praising it as a piece of art and culture, while others condemn it as a reminder of the suffering under Stalin's rule. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempt to reassure international students has created further confusion after the announcement of plans to "aggressively revoke" visas for Chinese students, especially those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.

The scope of the visa crackdown remains unclear, with the State Department declining to specify the criteria for visa revocation or define "critical fields."

          <p>A reduced National Weather Service is facing significant staffing gaps as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches, raising concerns about the accuracy of forecasts. The agency has lost at least 10% of its workforce due to budget cuts, leading to understaffed regional forecast offices. Meteorologists and former agency leaders warn of potentially catastrophic consequences if the agency enters its busiest period without adequate resources. The Weather Service has updated service level standards to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. </p>

          <h2>Debate Over Women in Combat Roles Continues Amidst Fitness Standard Changes</h2>

          <p>The debate over women in combat roles persists as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mandates gender-neutral fitness standards for all combat jobs. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer, shared her experience attending Ranger School, emphasizing that she met the same standards as men. Hegseth's insistence that standards were lowered for women in combat roles is challenged, with Vanasse arguing that lethality extends beyond physical fitness. She believes Secretary Hegseth's message discounts the accomplishments of women in combat and is based on assumptions about their abilities. </p>

Raising the retirement age is effectively a benefit cut, and it would take time to phase in the change.

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and a Â£2 billion upgrade. The project, designed to boost prosperity and cut journey times, involved significant overspends, delays, and closures. Welsh ministers claim the upgrade will benefit the region, while opponents criticize the cost and duration. The upgrade includes 70 structures, 40 new bridges, and 285,000 trees planted to mitigate environmental impact. </p>
