          <p>North Korea has detained shipyard officials, including the chief engineer, following a failed launch of a new warship that resulted in damage to the vessel. Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un reportedly expressed distress over the incident, attributing it to carelessness and unscientific practices.

          <p>Venezuelans are participating in elections for lawmakers and governors amidst rising government repression and calls for a boycott from the opposition. The vote is the first major electoral event since last year's presidential election, which incumbent President Nicolas Maduro won despite widespread evidence of fraud. Opposition leaders, led by Maria Corina Machado, argue that participation legitimizes Maduro's rule, while a smaller faction contends that boycotts only strengthen his control. Recent detentions of opposition figures have further fueled concerns about the fairness and credibility of the electoral process.</p>

She argues that engaging with fictional apocalypses provides a distraction from the anxieties of the real world. Feintzeig recounts how horror movies helped her cope with a past miscarriage, offering a temporary escape from grief. She concludes that while terrifying, these fictional worlds offer a strange sense of perspective and control, a reprieve from the relentless nature of reality.</p>

They highlight the shift in public opinion, increased investments in community safety, and the introduction of radical budget and policy proposals. The movement forced what was once considered a fringe position into the mainstream, inspiring protests worldwide and securing substantial cuts from US police departments. The authors emphasize the importance of sustained organizing and perseverance in the face of backlash, urging unity and fierce resistance to protect civil and human rights.</p>

The survey also revealed that 44.7% believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than the Prime Minister's pledge.

          <p>A virologist at the University of Nottingham urges calm after West Nile virus was detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time. Fragments of the virus, which can cause serious illness, were found in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire. Professor Jonathan Ball believes climate change will likely increase the range of mosquito-borne diseases. He noted that while the discovery is not something to be overly concerned about, it is important to be aware of the increasing risk of tropical viral diseases becoming established further north.</p>
