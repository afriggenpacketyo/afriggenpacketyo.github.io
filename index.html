          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna to Hamburg were stranded inside a tunnel for over six hours due to a power failure. The outage disabled the air conditioning and lighting, creating a hot and dark environment for those on board. The evacuation was delayed when some passengers attempted to walk out of the tunnel, forcing a secondary power-down for safety. Ultimately, all passengers were safely evacuated by bus back to Vienna, with only two requiring on-site medical treatment.</p>

          <p>The Cincinnati Bengals have ended a protracted contract dispute by signing their first-round draft pick, defensive end Shemar Stewart. The standoff, which centered on the structure of future guarantees in the rookie contract, had kept Stewart from participating in training camp. The newly signed deal is reportedly worth $18.97 million, fully guaranteed, with a $10 million signing bonus, making Stewart the final 2025 first-round pick to sign. His addition is a crucial step for the Bengals as they look to improve their defense from last season.</p>

          <p>The Cincinnati Bengals have signed first-round draft pick Shemar Stewart, ending a prolonged and tense contract dispute. The defensive end from Texas A&M was the last 2025 first-round pick to sign his deal, which is reportedly worth a fully guaranteed $18.97 million. The standoff stemmed from the team's attempt to restructure rookie contract guarantees, a move Stewart publicly resisted. With Stewart now signed, the Bengals can focus on improving a defense that struggled last season.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with July's average temperature running about a degree below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system, which has allowed a low-pressure system to persist over the region, leading to more cloud cover and cooler weather. This has also increased coastal upwelling, where cold ocean water is brought to the surface, further lowering land temperatures. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, forecasters caution that the Bay Area's hottest days often occur in September and October.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight en route to Las Vegas from Burbank, California, executed a sudden dive of several hundred feet to avoid a potential mid-air collision. The incident occurred shortly after takeoff when an onboard alert warned pilots of another aircraft, a decommissioned Hawker Hunter fighter jet, in their vicinity. The FAA is investigating the event, which caused no serious injuries among passengers, though one flight attendant was hospitalized for minor injuries. A passenger described the "aggressive" maneuver, stating that people were lifted from their seats by the rapid descent.</p>

          <p>President Trump's extensive use of tariffs is facing a critical legal test in a federal appeals court, which is set to hear arguments challenging his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The administration has used this law to justify wide-ranging tariffs, but a lower court previously ruled this an overreach of presidential power. Legal experts and policy analysts suggest the tariffs are at significant risk, and a loss for the administration in the Supreme Court could invalidate numerous trade deals and policies enacted during his term. The White House maintains it is legally using its authority to protect American workers. (not investment advice)</p>

The visit comes after Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected on an anti-India platform, sought to align more closely with China. However, facing economic struggles, Muizzu has softened his rhetoric, calling India a "most trusted partner." During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects, signaling India's commitment to maintaining its influence in the strategically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

          <p>England's hopes of securing a victory against India in the fourth Test are clouded by uncertainty over captain Ben Stokes's fitness. After taking five wickets in the first innings and scoring a century, Stokes did not bowl on day four due to being "stiff and sore," according to assistant coach Marcus Trescothick. Stokes, who has a history of injury issues, appeared weary in the field, raising concerns about his ability to contribute with the ball on the final day. His absence from the bowling attack would be a significant blow to England's chances of winning the match.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's response to a question about a potential pardon for convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has drawn sharp criticism. When asked, Trump stated, "It's something I haven't thought about," a reply that CNN legal analyst Elie Honig called an answer to "the easiest question in human history." Honig expressed bewilderment that Trump did not immediately reject the idea of pardoning Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse minors. The exchange occurred as Trump faces increasing pressure over his past association with Epstein.</p>

Trump said he spoke with the leaders of both nations and suggested that peace seems to be a "natural" outcome. He also linked the cessation of hostilities to the finalization of trade agreements, warning he would not move forward with deals if the conflict continues. The fighting, which has killed at least 33 people, is the worst between the Southeast Asian neighbors in over a decade, stemming from long-standing border disputes.</p>
