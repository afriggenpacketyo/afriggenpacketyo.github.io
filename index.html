        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the rise in online hate directed toward TV weather forecasters, who are often seen as visible communicators of climate change. Meteorologist Chris Gloninger experienced severe harassment, including a death threat, after including climate change in his weather reports. The article attributes this hate to the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, fueled by political actors and vested interests. Experts emphasize the importance of education and building trust to combat misinformation and support those facing abuse, as Gloninger was diagnosed with PTSD after the death threat, leading him to leave his job rather than stop mentioning climate change. The situation highlights the challenges of communicating climate science in a politicized environment and the need for meteorologists to stand firm. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmaceutical firms are increasing pressure on the UK to improve drug pricing ahead of President Trump's state visit, threatening investment withdrawals. Companies like AstraZeneca, Merck, and Eli Lilly have paused or scrapped planned investments in the UK, citing a lack of competitiveness and undervaluation of innovative medicines. Analysts suggest this is a negotiating tactic to influence the Trump administration's drug pricing order, which requires companies to lower US prices to match those in other advanced nations. The UK government acknowledges the need to attract more funding but faces broader questions about its investment landscape and a decline in foreign direct investment in the pharma sector.

          <h2>UK State Pension Set to Rise by 4.7% Next Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 03:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is likely to increase by 4.7% next year, potentially raising payments by over £500 annually for recipients. This increase is driven by the "triple lock" policy, which raises the state pension by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that total pay, including bonuses, grew by 4.7% in the three months leading up to July, making it the likely figure for the annual increase. However, rising pension amounts are pushing more pensioners into the tax net, as the standard rate of the new state pension is creeping closer to the frozen personal tax allowance, which currently stands at £12,570 and is set to remain at the same level until 2028.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to mitigate the fallout from an immigration raid at a South Korean-owned battery plant in Georgia, which led to the arrest of 475 workers and sparked concerns about foreign investment. President Trump emphasized that foreign workers are "welcome" to train the domestic workforce for companies building complex products. Washington has reportedly agreed to establish a new "visa working group" for South Korea, and Seoul is reviewing potential human rights violations during the enforcement. The incident, the largest enforcement operation in Homeland Security's history, has raised concerns among foreign businesses about their workforces in the U.S., with LG Energy Solution postponing the commencement of its Georgia EV battery plant. </p>

This action follows a similar $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, as well as previous settlements with ABC and CBS. Last week, the paper published a note bearing Trump's signature that appeared in a "birthday book" for the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The note is sexually suggestive, leading to renewed conversation about how much the president knew about Epstein's criminal behavior.</p>

          <p>A UN commission of inquiry has released a report accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The report cites actions such as killing members of a group, causing serious harm, deliberately inflicting conditions to destroy the group, and preventing births. It references statements by Israeli leaders and the conduct of Israeli forces as evidence of genocidal intent, which Israel vehemently denies. The report also singles out three Israeli officials for inciting genocide, including Yoav Gallant, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Isaac Herzog. The findings are expected to intensify international condemnation of Israel's actions amid the ongoing conflict, although proving genocide legally is difficult.</p>

          <p>Following the murder of Charlie Kirk, President Trump has rejected the notion that right-wing extremism is a problem, instead blaming "the left" for political violence. Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox called for de-escalation and lowering the temperature, while Democrats condemned the assassination. Kari Lake attributed the alleged shooter's actions to being "brainwashed" by the college he attended, while Elon Musk tweeted "the left is the party of murder." The article criticizes this blame-shifting as depicting all liberals as culpable, even those shocked by the murder. Ultimately, the author suggests that anyone plotting to kill for political reasons is insane, and that constant attacks on the president foster an atmosphere where violence is more likely.</p>

The report points to statements by Israeli leaders and the pattern of conduct by Israeli forces as evidence of genocidal intent, including intentionally killing and harming Palestinians, attacks on religious and cultural sites, and imposing a siege. Israel's foreign ministry has rejected the report, calling it "distorted and false" and accusing the commission of serving as "Hamas proxies."

Trade will also be a focus, with meetings at Chequers to discuss tech partnerships, energy deals, and lower tariffs on steel and aluminum exports, as Starmer seeks to boost his approval ratings and solidify the "special relationship" between the two countries.</p>

The study found 39,232 opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022, significantly higher than previously reported, and the Liberal Democrats are calling for an urgent investigation into the error.

          <p>President Xi Jinping has urged for increased efforts to develop a unified domestic market in China, emphasizing its importance for gaining a competitive edge internationally and achieving development goals. In an article published in Qiushi, Xi outlined six key tasks, focusing on measures to address excessive competition. He highlighted the need for industry associations to guide companies in improving product quality and opposing low-quality products. This follows calls from officials at a Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission meeting in July for a crackdown on excessive price competition and phasing out obsolete industrial capacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and China have reached a "framework" agreement regarding TikTok's US operations, potentially leading to American ownership. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the deal after negotiations in Madrid, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to finalize the terms on Friday. China confirmed the framework but emphasized that no deal would compromise its firms' interests, as a Wednesday deadline looms for TikTok's Chinese owner to find a buyer for US operations to avoid a ban. However, some experts are skeptical about issues including who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm, as the data TikTok collects from Americans could help train the models that power China's military and intelligence capabilities tomorrow.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has appointed Mike Liberatore, formerly the finance chief at Elon Musk's xAI, as its business finance officer, responsible for overseeing infrastructure spending. Liberatore's hiring is the latest development in the escalating rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Elon Musk, former friends who co-founded OpenAI. Musk sued Altman and OpenAI last year for breach of contract and has tried to thwart the company's restructuring into a for-profit entity. Liberatore's previous experience includes almost nine years at Airbnb and senior finance roles at SquareTrade, eBay, and PayPal.</p>

          <p>Teenagers from Bradford participated in a project where they removed all technology from their bedrooms for five days, revealing both challenges and unexpected benefits. The project, part of Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize Study Support's Teen Summit, aimed to explore the impact of technology on teenagers' lives. Participants like Elizabeth and Henry found that removing tech led to more family time, improved sleep, and engagement in new activities like baking. The experiment also highlighted the social aspect of online gaming and the importance of parental boundaries for screen time, but it did not last for long.</p>

          <p>Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. if a framework deal between the U.S. and China is finalized. The precise structure of the deal remains unclear, including the level of involvement from Chinese firms and control over TikTok's algorithm. The US Congress passed a law last year requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest from the app or face a ban in the U.S. due to national security concerns. The potential deal is part of ongoing trade discussions between the US and China.</p>

Other Chinese missiles were also named with Mao's influence.</p>
