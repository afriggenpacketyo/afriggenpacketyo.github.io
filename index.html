          <p>Canada's election is heavily influenced by U.S. President Trump's threats of annexation and tariffs, voters are choosing between Liberal Leader Mark Carney and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Trump's remarks have stirred debate about Canada's sovereignty and economic independence. Voters expressed concerns about affordability, immigration, and Canada's relationship with the U.S., with some fearing Poilievre's similarities to Trump. Trump himself has encouraged Canadians to elect a leader who would facilitate Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state.</p>

          <p>A massive power outage impacted Spain and Portugal, disrupting daily life for millions as subways and trains halted, phone service was interrupted, and traffic lights ceased functioning. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez attributed the outage to a problem within the European grid, possibly a "strong oscillation," while ruling out no theories about the cause of the outage. Power restoration efforts are underway, with electricity being drawn from Morocco and France. The outage also affected the Madrid Open tennis tournament and prompted widespread disruptions to transportation and daily activities.</p>

          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax to milkshakes and other milk-based drinks in an effort to combat obesity. The proposal aims to end the exemption for dairy and non-dairy substitutes, and reduce the maximum sugar content allowed before the levy applies. While some argue the tax disproportionately affects lower-income families, the government believes it will incentivize manufacturers to reduce sugar content in their products. A consultation period will run until July 21 to gather feedback on the proposed changes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed the scientists and experts who were working on the National Climate Assessment, the federal government's report on the impacts of global warming. The move puts the future of the report, which is required by Congress, in jeopardy. Researchers were informed that the scope of the report is being re-evaluated and that all contributors were being dismissed. The National Climate Assessment is used by state and local governments and private companies to prepare for climate-related events.</p>

The administration aims to reduce the division's traditional focus on issues like voting rights and police misconduct, instead prioritizing cases against the Ivy League and liberal cities. The administration has reopened its “deferred resignation program,” allowing employees to resign but continue to be paid for a period of time. The new head of the division welcomed the turnover, emphasizing the need to enforce federal civil rights laws, not "woke ideology."</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes that continued strong job growth may help ward off a recession, despite concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff hikes. Cramer asserts that recessions revolve around employment, and the abundance of job openings suggests that companies are not inclined to lay off employees. He predicts a robust labor report, making it difficult to slip into a full-blown recession soon. While tariffs may lead to higher prices, Cramer expects consumers to adapt and switch to budget-friendly retailers. (not investment advice)</p>
