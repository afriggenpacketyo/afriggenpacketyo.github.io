          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, marking a significant strengthening of the nation's nuclear capabilities. These jets will join NATO's airborne nuclear mission, which involves allied aircraft equipped with US-made B61 bombs stockpiled in Europe. Prime Minister Starmer emphasized the investment in national security due to an era of radical uncertainty, and Defence Secretary Healey highlighted the strengthening of NATO's collective deterrent. The decision has been praised by NATO Secretary-General Rutte and is expected to support 20,000 jobs across the UK supply chain, with the jets based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang urged countries to collaborate on trade, despite increasing tariffs and barriers. Speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China, he emphasized that globalization is irreversible and cautioned against turning trade into a political or security issue. Li added that engaging in the international economy is a way of reshaping the rules and order, calling on countries to keep to the "right" path. His comments come amid ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's governing doctrine of unpredictability, characterized by volatile inconsistency and a penchant for keeping everyone guessing, is creating tension in international affairs. His approach, while effective in controlling his inner circle, is poorly suited to dealing with foreign leaders who have competing national interests. This tension is evident at the NATO summit, where European leaders must navigate Trump's disdain for European democracies while preparing for the possibility of him abandoning the alliance. Trump's actions in the Middle East, particularly his military intervention in Iran, have further exacerbated uncertainty and raised concerns about his motives.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led study suggests that the world's energy demands in 2050 could be met by an interconnected global solar-wind energy system. This network would produce three times the amount of power needed at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The researchers emphasized that setting up such a system must navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease the economic burden of decarbonization, and be resilient against conflict and climate extremes.</p>

          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after a popular one went bankrupt, leaving many without treatment or refunds. These online concierge companies act as intermediaries between patients, donors, and doctors, but are not directly regulated by the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Patients have lost significant sums of money, and the HFEA is advocating for strengthened laws to protect patients. The closure of Apricity Fertility has highlighted the risks associated with these unregulated services, with patients facing financial losses and disruptions to their fertility journeys.</p>

The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, awarding her damages of A$70,000. The ABC has since apologized to Lattouf, acknowledging it had "let down our staff and audiences" in its handling of the matter.</p>
