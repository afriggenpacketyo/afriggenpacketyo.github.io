          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to reducing sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030. This is the first time a specific target has been set on the issue, following public anger over record-high pollution incidents and executive bonuses. The plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and cutting phosphorus pollution, though critics note the pledge is not legally binding. This announcement precedes a major review of the water industry, which is facing scrutiny for its environmental and financial performance.</p>

          <p>Five days of torrential rainfall across South Korea have led to significant loss of life, with at least 14 people confirmed dead and 12 others reported missing. The severe weather caused landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, particularly in southern regions like Sancheong and the town of Gapyeong. Authorities have evacuated nearly 4,000 people from their homes as a precautionary measure. While the rain has now stopped and alerts have been lifted, the country is grappling with the aftermath of receiving up to 800 millimeters of rain in some areas.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao, age 46, returned to the ring after a four-year retirement, fighting WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios to a majority draw. The fight, held in Las Vegas, was scored 115-113 for Barrios by one judge, while the other two scored it an even 114-114. Despite showing flashes of his former speed, Pacquiao's performance faded in the final rounds, though he believed he had won the fight. Pacquiao has expressed a desire for a rematch, citing a shortened training camp as a factor in his performance.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly reduced the number of individuals listed as missing following devastating floods, from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies verifying the safety of those initially reported missing. The county was the hardest-hit area in the statewide flooding event, which has resulted in 134 fatalities across Texas. While the news of locating most of the missing is positive, the community continues to recover from the tragic event.</p>

          <p>A CBS "48 Hours" report details the strange case of Linda Duffey Gwozdz, who was convicted of murdering her husband, Patrick Duffey, in 2007. Duffey initially claimed the shooting was an accident that occurred while the couple was playfully mimicking the cartoon character Elmer Fudd, with her husband allegedly saying "no more buwwets" to indicate the gun was unloaded. Investigators became suspicious after discovering two gunshot wounds and inconsistencies in her story about "fan firing" the weapon. After a mistrial, a second jury found her guilty of second-degree murder, leading to a sentence of 40 years to life.</p>

The investigation then pivoted, using DNA evidence and Google Dashboard location data from another man's phone to identify and track the real killer, George Steven Burch.

          <p>An opinion piece by Simon Tisdall argues that the persistent failure to achieve peace in conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine stems from a deeper crisis of morality. The article suggests that the world is ethically fractured, lacking a "permanent moral order" or universally accepted principles by which to judge actions. This moral relativism allows atrocities to be justified or ignored, hindering mediation and peaceful settlements. The author posits that without a collective recommitment to shared ethical standards, as defined by international law and social contracts, the cycle of violence will continue unabated.</p>

          <p>Players in the WNBA All-Star Game made a collective statement by wearing warmup shirts that read "Pay us what you owe us" ahead of Saturday's game. The protest comes after the players' union and the league failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) during recent negotiations. The players, who opted out of their last CBA, are seeking a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. Key players have indicated that a walkout is a possibility if a new agreement is not reached by the October deadline.</p>
