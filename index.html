            <p>Former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean suggests the central bank should cut interest rates to at least 4% in May to combat financial turmoil caused by Donald Trump's tariffs. He believes an aggressive strategy is necessary to counter the fallout from Trump's trade war, which has undermined business and consumer confidence. Another former rate setter, David Blanchflower, advocates for an emergency meeting to consider a deep reduction in borrowing costs to bolster confidence and prevent an economic downturn. Financial markets have priced in smaller rate cuts, but Bean argues for a more significant response to the disinflationary shock.</p>

The Treasury Department says the MOU protects the privacy of law-abiding taxpayers while assisting law enforcement.

            <p>European and Asian defense stocks are outperforming their U.S. counterparts, fueled by increased defense spending and a reduction in trust in the U.S. as an ally. President Trump's realignment with Russia and his "betrayal" of Ukraine have led some countries to question their reliance on the U.S. for defense. European countries are increasingly inclined to buy from European firms or firm allies like South Korea, as they share strategic goals. This shift is boosting the order books of companies like ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and Rheinmetall. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, announced that the city will pursue more free trade agreements to mitigate risks from "ruthless" U.S. tariffs. Lee criticized the U.S. for undermining international trade rules and damaging global trade. Despite the impact of U.S. tariffs on Hong Kong, the city will remain a free port and does not plan to impose retaliatory tariffs. Hong Kong will focus on strengthening trade and business linkages with other regions, including Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and will establish new trade offices in Egypt, Turkey, and Cambodia.</p>

            <p>A former PLA officer, Zhou Bo, argues that China's rise and influence in the international order are "unstoppable" as the US becomes less inclined to police the world. Zhou believes that while the Taiwan issue remains a potential flashpoint, China's military build-up, particularly its navy, is driven by the need to safeguard overseas interests and shoulder international responsibilities. He suggests that the US is growing tired of its role as a global police force, creating opportunities for China to expand its influence.</p>

            <p>President Trump is facing increased criticism as global stock markets continue to fall following his tariff rollout. Despite the economic turmoil, Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China unless the country rescinds its retaliatory tariffs. Top officials in the administration have dismissed fears of a recession and reiterated the tariff policy will be implemented as planned. The EU has said it offered the US a “zero-for-zero” tariff deal weeks ago, but Trump appeared to quash any such discussions.</p>
