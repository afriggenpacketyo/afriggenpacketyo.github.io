          <p>The New York Knicks kept their season alive with a 111-94 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 32 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns added 24 points and 13 rebounds. The win, which was the first at home in the conference finals, cut Indiana's series lead to 3-2, forcing a Game 6 in Indianapolis. The Knicks are attempting to become the 14th team in NBA history to overcome a 3-1 series deficit. The Knicks' strong offensive performance and defensive effort allowed them to dominate the game and avoid elimination. The game's high stakes and the team's determination to stay in the playoffs contributed to the intensity of the match. The Knicks' success in Game 5 has given them a chance to potentially make a historic comeback in the series. </p>

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined this year due to tariffs and tightened border policies, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association. Positive sentiment dropped from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025, with many business travel professionals expressing pessimism about the industry's outlook. The survey indicated that nearly 30% of business travel buyers anticipate their companies will reduce employee trips this year, and 27% expect business travel spending to decrease. Concerns about rising business travel costs and visa processing problems are contributing to this uncertainty, although global airfares have slightly decreased. (not investment advice)</p>

After several rounds, Faizan correctly spelled "Ã©claircissement" to win the Bee, marking his success after being last year's runner-up.

          <p>An Alaska man, Kell Morris, survived being pinned by a 700-pound boulder in an icy creek for three hours with only minor injuries, thanks to his wife's quick thinking and a stroke of luck. Morris's wife, Jo Roop, held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while waiting for rescuers to arrive after the boulder crashed onto him during a hike near Godwin Glacier. A sled dog tourism company overheard the 911 dispatch and offered its helicopter to ferry rescuers to the scene, which was inaccessible by all-terrain vehicles. After rescuers arrived, it took seven men and inflatable airbags to lift the boulder off him as he drifted in and out of consciousness.</p>

          <p>A recent court ruling challenged President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, leading to a legal battle that could limit his economic influence. The US Court of International Trade initially ruled that Trump exceeded his emergency powers, but a federal appeals court has temporarily stayed the ruling, allowing the tariffs to remain in place for now. The administration argues that a ruling against Trump would cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals and respond to national emergencies. Trump has used tariffs extensively, raising and lowering rates seemingly based on his mood, which has caused uncertainty in markets and warnings of rising consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for their approaches to welfare policies, accusing them of "fantasy economics." Badenoch argues that both leaders are engaging in a "race to the bottom" by considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy introduced by the Conservatives. She contends that this would force taxpayers to fund unlimited child support, which the country cannot afford. Her remarks come after Labour indicated it was looking at potentially scrapping the two-child benefit cap, while Reform UK has pledged to remove the cap without detailing how they would fund it.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily allowed President Trump to continue collecting import taxes, suspending a lower court's order that deemed the tariffs illegal. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened trade negotiations. The initial ruling from the US Court of International Trade would have voided tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, as well as a blanket 10% import tax on goods from other countries. The appeals court's decision allows the tariffs to be used while the case is litigated, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has left his position in Washington, concluding a period marked by disruption and efforts to revamp government efficiency. Despite his departure, Musk maintains powerful connections within the administration, which may benefit his companies by reducing oversight. His time in government was characterized by ambitious cost-cutting measures and controversial decisions, raising questions about conflicts of interest given his companies' extensive contracts with the government. Musk's influence and connections are expected to continue shaping policy and business landscapes even after his formal departure.</p>

          <p>The coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is expected to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of reinforcement work due to landslides and coastal erosion. Crews placed 5,900 tons of large boulders along the rail to stabilize potential runoff and constructed a 1,400-foot-long catchment beside the rail. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction after several sections of the rail were deemed unstable and at risk. The OCTA estimated the total cost of the projects to be about $300 million, acknowledging recurring interruptions to passenger rail service over the past four years.</p>

          <p>A 43-year-old woman with advanced cancer, Natalie Phelps, reports that her life-saving treatment is being delayed due to cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) made by the Trump administration's DOGE initiative. Phelps, who has stage 4 colorectal cancer, is part of a cell-based immunotherapy trial at the NIH, but staff reductions have caused delays in her treatment. Despite passing initial medical steps, she was told that the process to engineer T-cells for her treatment would now take eight weeks instead of four.

Key challenges included training the AI using sensitive nuclear data, ensuring the system would not leak tech secrets, and persuading skeptical nations to abandon Cold War-era verification methods. The CIAE team noted that specific data could not be disclosed due to the classified nature of nuclear warheads.</p>
