          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, has lost his appeal against a defamation judgement that found he committed war crimes in Afghanistan. The original 2023 ruling stated that news articles alleging he murdered four unarmed Afghans were true. Roberts-Smith sued three newspapers over the articles, claiming they ruined his life, but the court upheld the original verdict. The civil trial, dubbed "the trial of the century," assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces for the first time. </p>

          <p>Lawyers are increasingly seeking out federal jurisdictions with sympathetic judges to address divisive political issues, a practice known as venue shopping. A CBS News analysis reveals that conservatives often file cases against the Biden administration in small Texas courts, ensuring rulings from Republican appointees. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions. The Judicial Conference has recommended a random case-assignment policy to limit judge selection, though some districts have yet to adopt it fully.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura faced a rigorous cross-examination in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, with defense attorneys using text messages to challenge her credibility and portray her as a willing participant in their sexual activities. Combs' lawyers argued that Ventura willingly engaged in a lifestyle of swinging at drug-fueled orgies, attempting to undermine her claims of sexual assault and trafficking. Ventura acknowledged loving Combs for over a decade and hoping to build a life with him, but testified that his personality became violent and coercive over time. The trial continues with concerns about Ventura's pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, due to a sharp fall in exports. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, influenced by uncertainties related to U.S. trade policies. Despite this, domestic demand showed a positive trend, growing by 0.6%. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current monetary policy, anticipating a moderate economic recovery and one rate hike later in the year, while remaining cautious about global trade policies.</p>

The court is considering the Justice Department's argument that "nationwide injunctions" issued by federal judges unfairly restrict presidential power.

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on China, the company may be forced to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that President Trump's tariffs are hindering Walmart's ability to maintain low prices for customers. Despite efforts to control costs, the higher tariffs will likely result in increased prices later this month. Walmart joins other major retailers in warning about potential price hikes due to rising tariff costs.</p>

          <p>COVID-19 vaccine recommendations may shift to a risk-based strategy, targeting older Americans and those with chronic health problems, as scientific advisers debate the necessity of universal immunization. New requirements for clinical testing of vaccines could delay the availability of updated shots this fall. The FDA has requested additional clinical data for Novavax's COVID vaccine. Officials are also questioning the vaccine's impact on children under 12, potentially leading to a change in recommendations for that age group.</p>
