          <p>During President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom, protesters projected images of him with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the walls of Windsor Castle. The incident, which also included Trump's Georgia mugshot, led to the arrest of four individuals on suspicion of malicious communications. Thames Valley Police stated they take unauthorized activity around the royal residence extremely seriously and are conducting a thorough investigation. The protest occurred as Trump began a visit filled with royal pageantry and high-level political discussions, highlighting ongoing public controversy surrounding the president.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-anticipated contraction in August, falling just 0.1% year-on-year, marking the fourth straight month of decline but an improvement over July's 2.6% drop. This figure was significantly better than the 1.9% contraction forecast by economists. Meanwhile, imports shrank by 5.2%, a softer pace than the previous month but more than expected. The data, which shows a steep 13.8% drop in exports to the United States, arrives just ahead of the Bank of Japan's upcoming interest rate decision, where the central bank is expected to maintain its current policy.</p>

After being acquired by eBay in 2007, co-founder Eric Baker reacquired the company in 2020 through Viagogo. StubHub's public debut follows several delays and comes amid a recent resurgence in the IPO market, which has seen successful offerings from other tech and finance companies.</p>

          <p>A candlelight vigil held at Arizona State University honored the legacy of conservative leader Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. Attendees and speakers, including close friends and colleagues from Turning Point USA, used the event to channel grief into a call for political action. Tyler Bowyer of Turning Point Action declared that upcoming elections would be influenced by Kirk's memory and encouraged attendees to register to vote. The event highlighted Kirk's significant influence, particularly among young conservatives, with organizers framing the tragedy as a potential catalyst for increased conservative engagement and activism ahead of future elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab has found that Russia is holding thousands of abducted Ukrainian children in at least 210 facilities for forced "reeducation" and militarization. The report details how children are subjected to pro-Russian indoctrination and, in some cases, combat and paratrooper training, with some even producing military equipment. This systemic effort to erase Ukrainian identity has been labeled a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy plans to address the issue at the upcoming UN General Assembly.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed the two state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. While the defense's request to have all state charges dropped was denied, the judge ruled the terrorism counts were legally insufficient. The court found no evidence of a desire to terrorize the public or engage in a broader campaign of violence beyond the targeted killing of one person. Mangione still faces nine other state charges, including second-degree murder and multiple weapons counts, in addition to separate federal charges.</p>

          <p>Robert Redford's career is remembered not just for the iconic roles he played, but also for the conventional, easy-money parts he consistently rejected. Despite his classic Hollywood good looks, he actively sidestepped being typecast as a simple hero, instead choosing complex and often flawed characters in films like "Downhill Racer" and "The Candidate." This article argues that Redford used his all-American appeal as a Trojan horse to make audiences question their own ideals and confront uncomfortable truths. His work, from political thrillers to directing, consistently explored the frustrated idealism lurking beneath a polished surface, leaving a legacy of challenging complexity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has arrived in the United Kingdom for his second state visit, a trip that will combine royal pageantry with discussions on trade and international policy. Upon his arrival, a major £31 billion technology investment in the UK by US firms was announced. The visit will feature a ceremonial welcome at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles, a military inspection, and a state banquet. While the UK government aims to reinforce ties and encourage US commitment to NATO, the visit is also being met with protests, highlighting the mix of diplomacy and public controversy.</p>

          <h2>The Atlantic Analysis: Political Allies Use Charlie Kirk's Murder to Justify Suppressing Dissent</h2>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic explores the irony of how Charlie Kirk's assassination is being used by his political allies to call for a crackdown on free speech. The article notes that Kirk built his career on championing debate and using the First Amendment as a shield for his controversial ideas, particularly on college campuses. However, now that his allies are in power, some are calling for censorship of "hate speech" and demanding social media companies ban users who speak ill of Kirk's death. This shift highlights a tension within the MAGA movement, which is now vowing to use the tragedy as a pretext to target political opponents.</p>

          <p>Two Labour Members of Parliament, Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley, have been denied entry into Israel while traveling on a parliamentary visit to the occupied West Bank. The MPs, who are both doctors, were part of a delegation intended to observe medical and humanitarian work in the region. They described the decision as "deeply regrettable," and the UK Foreign Office called the action "totally unacceptable and deeply concerning." This is not the first time British MPs have been barred from entry, raising concerns about the ability of parliamentarians to assess the situation on the ground.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Utah prosecutors have presented evidence suggesting the alleged motive behind the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Text messages from the suspect, Tyler Robinson, to his partner reportedly stated he had "enough of his hatred" and that "some hate can't be negotiated out." The charging documents also note that Robinson's political views had recently shifted to be more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights, contrasting with his family's conservative leanings and Kirk's public stances. This evidence was presented as prosecutors filed capital murder charges and announced their intent to seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, in the U.S. to help build an electric car battery plant in Georgia, were detained in a large-scale immigration raid. Several engineers told the BBC they were treated like criminals, handcuffed, and put in chains by armed officers despite having valid short-term visas or being under a visa waiver program. They described being held in freezing, unsanitary conditions for days without understanding why they were arrested. The incident has strained U.S.-South Korea relations, with Seoul investigating potential human rights violations and U.S. officials expressing regret over the matter.</p>

          <p>Prominent sports investor Josh Harris believes that major sports teams and ownership groups are unlikely to go public, despite their soaring valuations. Speaking at a conference, the co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment argued that sports assets have historically been valued more highly in private markets. He pointed out that publicly traded teams, like those under Madison Square Garden, often trade below their intrinsic value. Harris emphasized that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which may not align with the short-term expectations of public markets. (not investment advice)</p>
