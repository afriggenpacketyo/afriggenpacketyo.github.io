          <p>A judge has ruled that advanced DNA evidence, specifically whole genome sequencing from degraded hair samples, will be admissible in the trial of accused serial killer Rex Heuermann. This marks a significant legal precedent for New York state courts, as it is the first time this cutting-edge forensic technology has been approved for use in a trial. Prosecutors consider the decision a major victory, allowing them to connect Heuermann and his family to hair found on multiple victims. The defense has challenged the ruling, arguing the lab used is not licensed in New York, with a final decision on that challenge pending.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that there are no immediate plans to send the National Guard to Chicago, clarifying recent comments from President Trump suggesting federal forces would be sent to the city. While Vance affirmed the president's legal authority to act, he emphasized a preference for working with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who has strongly opposed such a deployment as unnecessary and unconstitutional. The statements come amid reports of expanded immigration enforcement operations planned for the city and follow recent National Guard deployments in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles under the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked the Trump administration from freezing nearly $2 billion in federal grants to Harvard University, ruling the action was an unlawful violation of the university's First Amendment rights. The judge determined that the administration used campus antisemitism as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" on the university, jeopardizing decades of important research. While acknowledging Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism, the court found the grant terminations were arbitrary and procedurally flawed. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have escalated their attacks on the outskirts of Gaza City, resulting in dozens of Palestinian casualties, including women and children, according to hospital officials. The Israeli military's chief of staff has vowed to continue the offensive until Hamas is defeated and all hostages are freed. The United Nations and various aid organizations have issued stark warnings about the "horrific humanitarian consequences" for the hundreds of thousands of displaced families sheltering in the city. These developments coincide with protests in Israel demanding the government prioritize a hostage release deal over continued military action.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House has voted along party lines to create a new subcommittee dedicated to reinvestigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Chaired by Representative Barry Loudermilk, the panel has been tasked with uncovering what Republicans describe as overlooked facts and security failures, with a final report due by the end of 2026. Democrats have widely condemned the move as a politically motivated attempt to exonerate former President Donald Trump and rewrite the narrative of the event. The formation of this new panel follows President Trump's recent pardoning of individuals involved in the attack.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell sharply in extended trading following its first earnings report since going public in July. The company's second-quarter revenue of $249.6 million slightly exceeded expectations, showing a 41% increase year-over-year, and it reported a small net income. However, investors reacted negatively, seemingly concerned about future growth prospects despite guidance for the third quarter that was above analyst consensus. The company is also navigating the integration of AI features into its products and preparing for the expiration of an employee share lockup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Salesforce stock dropped after the company released a disappointing revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, overshadowing its better-than-expected earnings for the fiscal second quarter.

The company has faced pressure on Wall Street this year, lagging behind other tech giants despite its investments in artificial intelligence. Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook but the weak short-term forecast contributed to the negative market reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

The introduction of an operational air-launched missile suggests China has successfully established a nuclear triad, which consists of land, sea, and air-based delivery systems. The JL-3, with a reported range exceeding 10,000 km, is considered a cornerstone of China's sea-based deterrent, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive tariff-based trade policies are seen as scrambling global alliances and potentially creating new risks for the United States.

This geopolitical shift is occurring as China projects its growing military power, which was on display during a recent parade in Beijing. Meanwhile, Trump's trade actions face domestic legal challenges, with an appellate court recently ruling that many of his tariffs were based on a faulty interpretation of federal law.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, Britain's deputy prime minister and housing secretary, has admitted that she underpaid stamp duty tax on the purchase of a flat in Hove. She attributed the "mistake" to initial legal advice that did not properly account for complex provisions related to a family trust established for her disabled son. Rayner stated she deeply regrets the error and has contacted tax authorities to pay the outstanding amount. She has also referred herself to the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial interests for an investigation, while facing calls from the opposition to be sacked.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of House members has introduced the Restore Trust in Congress Act, a new bill aimed at banning members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The legislation combines several previous proposals into a single vehicle, which supporters hope will create a tipping point for passage. The bill would require lawmakers to sell their stocks soon after taking office and imposes a 10% penalty on the value of any illicit investment. The effort has gained momentum from across the political spectrum, reflecting growing public pressure to address potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that Americans continue to hold a negative view of the U.S. economy, with ratings dipping slightly over the past month. The most commonly chosen words to describe the economy were "uncertain" and "struggling," with far more respondents calling it "unfair" than "fair." The primary driver of this pessimism remains the cost of living, as two-thirds of those surveyed report that prices are still rising and expect them to continue to do so. While personal financial ratings vary by income, the overall economic outlook remains predominantly negative, with a majority believing conditions are getting worse.</p>

          <p>Ten years after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's welcoming "wir schaffen das" (we can do it) declaration during the 2015 migrant crisis, the political landscape in Europe has shifted dramatically toward restriction. This article analyzes how concerns over security, economic strain, and disillusionment with governing parties have fueled the rise of far-right movements and pushed mainstream governments to adopt tougher anti-migration policies. Countries from Hungary to Sweden have implemented stricter border controls, reduced asylum quotas, and made family reunification more difficult. This marks a profound change from the more optimistic and open approach that characterized the response a decade ago.</p>

The news follows a difficult period for the company, with Siebel attributing a recent sales slump to an internal reorganization and his own ongoing health issues, which he disclosed had resulted in significant visual impairment.
