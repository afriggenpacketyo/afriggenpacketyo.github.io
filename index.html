          <p>The FBI is dedicating additional resources to three high-profile cases: the leak of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, the undetonated pipe bombs near the DNC and RNC headquarters on January 5, 2021, and the discovery of cocaine at the White House in 2023. Deputy Director Dan Bongino announced the renewed focus on X, stating that these cases point to potential public corruption. The FBI's investigation into the Dobbs decision leak was previously unable to identify the responsible party, while the pipe bomb case has remained open for over four years despite extensive efforts. The Secret Service closed the White House cocaine case due to a lack of physical evidence.</p>

          <p>Online travel booking data indicates that tourists from countries heavily impacted by Donald Trump's trade tariffs are increasingly avoiding travel to the United States. Trivago reports double-digit percentage declines in bookings to the US from Japan, Canada, and Mexico, with Germany also showing a significant decrease. Simultaneously, UK and US travelers are opting for domestic holidays amid economic uncertainty. The US tourism industry is concerned about a "Trump slump," with overseas visits falling by 11.6% in March compared to the previous year, and bookings show Americans are spending less on trips, favoring cheaper hotels.

He emphasized that sharks are essential apex predators for a healthy ocean ecosystem and that around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day. Pugh was accompanied by safety personnel and a "Shark Shield" device to deter sharks without harming them during his 12-day swim.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress revoked California's authority to set electric vehicle mandates, viewing it as a check on the state's outsize influence and liberal agenda. The move reflects long-standing resentment from Republican states dependent on the fossil fuel industry. While California leaders see fossil fuels as outdated, Republicans argue electric vehicles are impractical for rural constituents and that California's policies should not dictate national standards. Governor Gavin Newsom vowed to fight the decision in court to preserve the state's autonomy in setting emissions rules.</p>
