            <h2>IDF Inquiry Reveals 'Professional Failures' in Gaza Medics' Deaths</h2>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces inquiry has concluded that "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders," led to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The IDF stated that troops opened fire believing they faced a threat from enemy forces, claiming that six of the casualties were Hamas members. However, video footage from a medic's phone showed the ambulances were clearly marked and had their lights on, contradicting initial claims. The deputy commander involved has been dismissed, and another officer will be reprimanded, while the Red Crescent Society has dismissed the report as invalid. The UN has suggested the investigation did not go far enough.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for Xiamen Airlines in China has been returned to Boeing's U.S. production hub due to increased tariffs imposed by both the U.S. and China. The jet, painted with Xiamen livery, had been waiting at Boeing's Zhoushan completion center for final work and delivery. Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% and China's retaliatory 125% tariff on U.S. goods made the delivery economically unfeasible. The situation has caused confusion and potential delays in aircraft deliveries, with some airlines considering deferring deliveries rather than paying the duties.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, as strong macro data allows the bank to focus on stabilizing the yuan amid trade tensions with the U.S. The 1-year LPR remains at 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision comes as China reported better-than-expected economic data for the first quarter, including a 5.4% GDP increase. The PBOC's decision reflects confidence in the current economic situation, but analysts anticipate potential rate cuts if economic data weakens in the future.</p>

            <p>China has issued a warning to countries considering trade deals with the United States that could harm Beijing's interests, threatening countermeasures against those who appease Washington. This statement follows reports that the U.S. plans to pressure nations to curb trade with China in exchange for avoiding new tariffs. China's Commerce Ministry insists that "appeasement will not bring peace" and that Beijing will take reciprocal actions against any nation acting against its economic interests. The warning highlights the escalating tensions and complexities in global trade relations.</p>

His "cinematic and melancholic" music serves as a therapeutic outlet to explore his feelings about being adopted and themes of identity, grief, and mortality. Fennel visited Wales in 2019 and embraced his Welshness, getting a Welsh tattoo and connecting with his roots.</p>

These networks, which emerged in Southeast Asia, operate sprawling compounds where trafficked workers are forced to scam victims worldwide. Despite crackdowns in Southeast Asia, the syndicates have adapted and moved operations to areas with weak governance and high corruption. The UNODC estimates that hundreds of large-scale scam farms generate tens of billions of dollars annually and calls for increased international cooperation to disrupt the gangs' financing.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that Chinese universities have a greater supply of postdoctoral positions compared to the number of young researchers seeking jobs. The study, analyzing over 24,000 university job postings, found that for every five postdoctoral vacancies, there was only one job seeker. This gap between vacancies and demand is most significant among postdocs, suggesting a favorable job market for young researchers in China. This trend may attract scientists, including those who previously worked abroad, to return to China due to increased research funding and opportunities.</p>

            <p>American-style restaurants in Beijing, such as Home Plate BBQ, are switching from U.S. to Australian beef due to the escalating U.S.-China trade war. Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on U.S. goods, in addition to existing tariffs, have made American beef unaffordable. Home Plate BBQ, which uses 7-8 tonnes of brisket monthly, will now source its beef from Australia, which is 40% cheaper. The restaurant is also changing its pork rib supplier to Canada. This situation reflects the broader impact of the trade war on businesses and consumers.</p>

            <p>Approximately 60,000 Americans risk losing their rental assistance and facing eviction due to a funding shortfall in the Emergency Housing Vouchers program. Launched in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan, the program assists individuals and families fleeing homelessness and domestic violence. Funding is expected to run out by the end of next year, leaving many scrambling to pay rent. The program's future depends on Congress allocating additional funds, but prospects are uncertain due to budget constraints.</p>
