          <h2>Artist Defends Trump Portrait After President's Criticism</h2>

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind a portrait of Donald Trump displayed in the Colorado state Capitol, has defended her work after Trump criticized it. Trump called the portrait "the worst" and said Boardman must have lost her talent. Boardman responded that Trump's words have negatively impacted her business of over 41 years, putting it in danger of not recovering. The portrait was later removed by state Republicans, and Boardman maintains that she created the rendering without political bias or any intention to distort or caricature the president.</p>

          <p>China is attempting to rally American companies to lobby Washington against tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Beijing implored multinationals like Tesla and GE Healthcare to "deliver voices of reason" and address the "root causes" of tariff tensions. This move comes after China retaliated against the latest US tariffs. Vice-Minister Ling Ji emphasized that China's retaliatory measures protect the interests of all firms, including American companies, and urged US compliance with multilateral trade rules.</p>

          <p>US Treasury yields have fallen as President Trump's tariffs spurred a flight to safety, causing investors to move away from riskier assets. The 2-year Treasury yield dropped to its lowest level since September 2022. Investors are concerned about the impact of the tariffs, which have led to fears of a global trade war. China has already retaliated with tariffs on US goods, and the EU has vowed countermeasures. Traders are now anticipating multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025.

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession.

Worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, which in turn could slow down economic activity and reduce demand for oil.

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided not to press criminal charges against a police officer who followed two teenagers on an e-bike before their fatal crash in Ely, Cardiff.

Malcolm McHaffie, head of the CPS Special Crime Division, stated that a thorough review of the evidence led to the decision.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's anti-union actions are reportedly encouraging US employers to adopt a more hostile stance toward unions, potentially reversing recent labor movement progress. Labor leaders fear that Trump's moves will embolden companies to fight harder against unions. Actions such as ending collective bargaining for airport screeners and federal employees, along with the appointment of anti-union figures to the NLRB, signal a broader assault on workers' rights. Some companies have already taken steps to limit union power, inspired by Trump and Elon Musk's approaches.</p>

Lanier also expresses concern about AI accelerating social media's tendency to pull people away from the physical world and reduce others to crude avatars.

          <p>Billionaire Bill Ackman, a supporter of Donald Trump, is urging the US president to temporarily halt his newly announced trade tariffs. Ackman warned that the tariffs risk causing a "self-induced, economic nuclear winter". He suggests a 90-day pause to allow for renegotiation of trading relationships with the US. JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon echoed this sentiment, warning that the tariffs could increase prices for Americans. Despite the market turmoil, Trump defended his new import taxes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariff policy is unpopular among key voters who helped him win the 2024 election, including young voters, voters of color, and independents. These voters prioritized economic concerns and the price of goods. Polls indicate that voters think Trump isn't focusing enough on the economy. The data suggests that Trump risks losing support from non-MAGA voters due to his economic policies. These voters are increasingly disapproving of the tariff policy and expect prices to rise.</p>
