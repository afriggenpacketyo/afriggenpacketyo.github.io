          <p>A recent New York Times article explores the debate surrounding the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I.), a technology that matches human-level intelligence. Tech executives like Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, and Elon Musk predict its imminent arrival, driving significant advancements in A.I. technologies, while other experts, including Nick Frosst and Steven Pinker, remain skeptical, citing the limitations of current systems in replicating human intellect and adaptability. The article highlights that A.G.I. claims are based on statistical extrapolations and wishful thinking, as machines still struggle with tasks like recognizing irony or feeling empathy. It emphasizes that achieving A.G.I. requires a new, currently unimagined idea, making its timeline uncertain.</p>

          <p>Charter Communications and Cox Communications, two of the largest cable companies in the U.S., have agreed to merge in a deal valuing Cox at $34.5 billion. The merger aims to enhance their competitiveness against rivals like Comcast and Verizon, as the broadband industry faces increasing competition from wireless providers. Both companies have been grappling with customer losses in traditional cable TV, leading them to focus on their mobile businesses. Charter, the second-largest publicly traded cable company, was up roughly 8% in premarket trading from its previous close. This deal marks one of the largest in corporate America this year, reflecting efforts to consolidate amidst economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine, expressing his belief that progress is unlikely until such a meeting occurs. Trump criticized Putin's decision to skip peace talks in Turkey, stating that direct engagement is necessary to resolve the conflict, where an average of five thousand young people are reportedly being killed each week. The Kremlin responded, indicating that a meeting between Putin and Trump would require careful preparation but is deemed necessary for serious conversation on international issues. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, though Russia has not signed on.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent Middle East trip resulted in multibillion-dollar technology investments, particularly in artificial intelligence. Nvidia and AMD are now permitted to sell advanced chips to Saudi, Emirati, and Qatari customers, including a massive new A.I. campus in Abu Dhabi. This move has raised concerns among security officials who fear the technology could end up in China, as the Biden administration previously restricted such exports. Despite these concerns, investors are optimistic, with shares in Nvidia and AMD soaring after the deals were announced. The article underscores a rift within the Trump administration regarding A.I. and its potential security implications.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers went on strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday, effectively shutting down all NJ Transit rail service and Metro-North's west of Hudson service due to stalled negotiations over pay raises. The union, representing about 460 engineers, claims they haven't received a pay raise in five years and that their compensation lags behind competitors. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri maintains that any deal must be fair and fiscally responsible. The strike is expected to impact over 300,000 daily commuters, prompting NJ Transit to suggest working from home and offering limited alternative bus services starting Monday, which can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is set to review the Trump administration's attempt to keep details secret in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador. The administration is invoking state secrets privilege to withhold information from Abrego Garcia's attorneys. The case involves accusations that the administration failed to follow court orders to facilitate his return, with lawyers seeking additional depositions, including from someone with first-hand knowledge of efforts to return Abrego Garcia from the White House. The Justice Department argues that the request is unreasonable and invokes attorney-client and executive privileges.</p>
