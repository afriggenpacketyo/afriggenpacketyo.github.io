          <p>The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a 25-year trade agreement providing duty-free access to the US market for 35 sub-Saharan African nations, is expiring. While the deal boosted sectors like textiles and created jobs, its overall impact has been mixed, with some experts arguing it served US interests and created dependency. The expiration is now seen by some as a historic opportunity for Africa to diversify its trade relationships, strengthening partnerships with China and the EU, and bolstering the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to foster economic sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has announced a phased resumption of manufacturing at its UK facilities, starting with its engine plant, after a cyberattack forced a complete halt to operations. The shutdown has placed immense financial pressure on the company's supply chain, with many smaller firms at risk of bankruptcy. While the restart is welcome news, suppliers emphasize that financial assistance is still crucial to recover from the significant losses incurred during the stoppage, even with a £1.5 billion government-backed loan guarantee intended to support the supply chain.</p>

          <p>According to Vice President JD Vance, the Trump administration is considering Ukraine's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles, which have a range capable of reaching Moscow from Kyiv. The potential sale aligns with a US policy where European NATO allies would finance the weaponry, a strategy designed to increase Europe's investment in the conflict. The Kremlin has responded by stating it is carefully analyzing the possibility, questioning whether US or Ukrainian forces would operate the missiles, while US officials have suggested Ukraine should have the ability to strike deep into Russian territory.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has warned that a potential government shutdown this week could lead to permanent mass layoffs of federal employees, a significant departure from the typical practice of furloughing workers. In an interview, Trump stated his administration would "cut a lot of the people that... we're able to cut on a permanent basis" if Congress fails to reach a funding agreement by the deadline. The White House has already instructed federal agencies to begin preparations for these potential mass firings, escalating the stakes in the ongoing budget negotiations.</p>

          <p>The fashion accessory chain Claire's has secured a partial rescue in the UK, with investment firm Modella Capital agreeing to purchase 156 of its stores, saving approximately 1,000 jobs. However, the fate of the remaining 145 stores and their employees remains uncertain as they are not included in the deal. The administrators will continue to trade from the excluded stores while they explore other options for the business, which collapsed into administration in August, putting over 2,000 jobs at risk across the UK and Ireland.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's plans to overhaul the H-1B visa program by imposing hefty fees, this article highlights that many prominent leaders in the US tech industry began their careers on this very visa. Figures such as Elon Musk of Tesla, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and Eric Yuan of Zoom all utilized the H-1B program, which allows US companies to hire foreign talent in specialized fields. While some of these leaders have advocated for reforms to the system, their stories underscore the program's historical role in attracting and retaining talent that has been foundational to major American companies.</p>

          <p>The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) will hold a vote in November to decide whether Israel's public broadcaster, KAN, can participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest. The decision follows widespread calls to exclude Israel from the event due to the war in Gaza, creating a deeply divisive situation for the organization. Several countries, including Spain and Ireland, have threatened to boycott the contest if Israel participates, while others like Germany and Austria have voiced their support, setting the stage for one of the most significant political crises in the competition's history.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's upcoming term is set to address several contentious issues, with cases on President Trump's tariffs, racial gerrymandering, and LGBTQ rights already on the docket. While the legality of the tariffs presents an uncertain question, legal analysts widely expect the court's conservative majority to further weaken the Voting Rights Act by striking down safeguards against racial gerrymandering. The court is also likely to hear challenges to state laws regarding transgender athletes and conversion therapy, signaling a term with potentially far-reaching consequences for election law and civil rights.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a cable car crash at a forest monastery in Sri Lanka has risen to eight after one of the injured Buddhist monks died in the hospital. The accident occurred when a makeshift cabin carrying 13 monks plunged down a mountainside after its cable reportedly snapped. Seven monks, including three foreign nationals from Romania, Russia, and India, were killed instantly in the incident, which is being described as the worst of its kind in the country's history.</p>

However, swells generated by both Imelda and the more powerful Hurricane Humberto are expected to affect much of the U.S. East Coast, creating hazardous and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions throughout the week.</p>

          <p>In a forceful speech, former Vice President Kamala Harris described Donald Trump as an "unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president" and called for his opponents to adopt a more aggressive strategy to counter him. Speaking at a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation event, Harris criticized the Trump administration's policies on healthcare and the economy, and condemned what she called the "capitulation" of major institutions to a "tyrant." She urged Democrats to rally behind leaders who are prepared to "fight fire with fire" to enforce checks and balances on the presidency ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>According to sources familiar with the matter, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has taken a leading role in directing U.S. military strikes against boats in the Caribbean suspected of carrying drugs from Venezuela. Miller, in his capacity as homeland security adviser, has reportedly superseded other top officials in orchestrating the campaign through the Homeland Security Council. The legal justification for these strikes, which some critics have called extrajudicial killings, is reportedly based on the administration's controversial designation of the Tren de Aragua cartel as an arm of the Venezuelan government.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that a recent Supreme Court decision on its "shadow docket" has dangerously eroded the 4th Amendment by permitting police to conduct seizures based on racial and ethnic profiling. The author contends that by allowing law enforcement to stop individuals who appear Latino, speak Spanish, and seem to be low-wage workers without any other suspicion, the court has removed critical guardrails against discriminatory policing. This decision, the article warns, green-lights an oppressive police state where the constitutional rights of people of color and immigrants are severely diminished.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Amanda Shires' new album, "Nobody's Girl," is a deeply personal and honest exploration of the grief and rebuilding process following her high-profile divorce from musician Jason Isbell. The album deviates from typical heartbreak narratives by focusing on the immediate, messy aftermath of a breakup, capturing the rawness of being erased from a shared history and the difficult quest for personal closure. Through songs that are both vulnerable and resilient, Shires transforms her pain into a work of art that serves as a relatable guide for navigating profound loss.</p>

The author argues that while every film in his body of work demonstrates an exceptionally high level of craft and a deep humanism, they can be ordered based on their relative impact and artistic achievement. The list places early works like "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia" in the middle, while crowning his epic story of American capitalism, "There Will Be Blood," as his most accomplished and visionary film to date.</p>
