          <p>A police officer is set to face a gross misconduct hearing following an e-bike crash in Cardiff in May 2023 that tragically resulted in the deaths of two teenagers, Kyrees Sullivan and Harvey Evans. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found the officer has a case to answer regarding the accuracy of accounts provided to colleagues and potential inconsistencies, along with concerns about their driving and language used at the scene. These actions may have been outside the officer's level of training and authority, potentially breaching professional standards of honesty and integrity. Although no direct contact between the police vehicle and the e-bike was indicated, the fatal incident sparked widespread unrest and riots in the Ely area, leading to numerous arrests and significant property damage.</p>

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its recent quarter, reporting a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, marking its highest growth in three years. This recovery was partly driven by strong demand for mobile phones, video gaming equipment, including the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, and computing items. Despite this positive trend, CEO Corie Barry maintained the full-year forecast, citing significant uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on both consumers and the business, which could lead to a slowdown in the third quarter. The retailer is actively launching a third-party marketplace and testing new in-store experiences to spur growth, while also planning to enhance slower categories like appliances and home theater through sharpened pricing and adjusted merchandise.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The relationship between the United States and India has significantly deteriorated following the imposition of new US tariffs on Indian goods, with some rates now reaching 50%. This escalation occurred after failed trade talks and an additional 25% tariff related to India's purchases of Russian oil. Experts suggest India stands to lose more economically, as the US is its largest trade partner, with predictions of a substantial decline in Indian exports and potential job losses in key sectors like textiles and jewelry. However, the dispute also threatens US plans to diversify manufacturing away from China to India, and carries geopolitical risks if India aligns more closely with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Martin Rafferty, a musician from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, has successfully broken the Guinness World Record for the longest busk, performing for over 24 hours straight. Despite enduring the challenge with a broken thumb, Rafferty continued beyond the official record, aiming for a total of 30 hours, all while raising money for a local Christmas toy appeal. The demanding feat, held at Armagh's Market Street, required adherence to strict rules, including not repeating songs within four hours and ensuring each song lasted over two and a half minutes. This impressive display of endurance and commitment highlights Rafferty's unwavering persistence and dedication to both his music and a worthy charitable cause.</p>

Cook's suit, also naming Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the Board of Governors, asks the court to declare Trump's firing order unlawful and affirm her continued board membership. This legal challenge follows months of Trump's complaints about Cook and other board members not cutting interest rates as he desired, setting the stage for a significant legal battle.</p>

          <p>Christopher Barbour, an Alabama death row inmate, has been granted a new trial after 31 years following a federal judge's ruling. New DNA testing from 2021 revealed that semen on the victim's body belonged to another incarcerated individual, not Barbour or the man he initially implicated in the 1992 murder of Thelma Bishop Roberts. The judge cited prosecutorial misconduct, as bench notes from the initial forensics report excluding Barbour were not turned over, which could have cast doubt on his confession. Barbour has consistently maintained his innocence, claiming his confession was coerced, and his attorneys argue his innocence is now "patently clear."</p>

          <p>Neighbors of Robin Westman, the suspected Minneapolis Catholic school shooter, told Fox News Digital that Westman appeared to be a typical tenant, showing no behavior that would have raised suspicion prior to the deadly incident. The mental health professionals living in the same complex observed Westman engaging in ordinary activities like going to work, ordering takeout, and occasionally having friends over, and noted the absence of any public criminal record or documented mental health issues. This perceived normalcy made the tragic attack at Annunciation Catholic School, which killed two children and injured 17 others, particularly shocking. The article offers a unique, personal perspective on the shooter's background, underscoring the challenges in identifying potential threats.</p>

          <p>France, Germany, and the UK have formally initiated the "snapback" mechanism to reimpose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, notifying the UN Security Council of their intent. This critical move comes as the October deadline approaches for the automatic reinstatement of penalties, which were originally lifted as part of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal. In response, Iran has warned it would cease cooperation with the UN's nuclear agency (IAEA) if sanctions are reimposed, potentially impacting crucial nuclear inspections. The European powers, despite previous diplomatic efforts, cited a lack of sufficiently tangible commitments from Iran, especially after the US had unilaterally withdrawn from the deal earlier.</p>

This data indicates continued resilience in consumer and business activity, even amidst tariff volatility. The unusual impact of tariffs was also reflected in trade numbers, with a sharp decline in imports contributing nearly 5 percentage points to the overall GDP increase.

Experts suggest Canada's stability stems from its larger banks' collective economic strength, though some caution against market domination due to potential loss of competitive pricing and innovation.

          <p>A legal challenge regarding a High Court ruling to remove 138 asylum seekers from The Bell Hotel in Epping, UK, is currently before the Court of Appeal. Lawyers for the Home Office and the hotel owners argue that the injunction, granted after Epping Forest District Council cited planning law breaches, could set a damaging precedent. They warn it risks sparking further protests around other asylum accommodations and creating "hardship" for asylum seekers with no clear alternative housing. The case highlights tensions between local planning regulations, government asylum policies, and community reactions, including protests linked to a prior sexual assault charge against a migrant housed there.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, highlighting their appeal as a safe investment in an inflationary economy where money can lose buying power. While national averages are modest, top high-yield CDs, often from online banks, offer significantly higher returns, with short-term CDs currently yielding more than longer terms due to an inverted yield curve. The article advises potential investors to compare rates from online banks, consider short-term options for higher returns, and explore strategies like CD laddering to maximize earnings over time. CDs are generally insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC or NCUA, offering a secure way to grow savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US corporate profits rebounded by $65.5 billion in the second quarter, following a decline in the previous period, according to the Commerce Department. This positive development occurred alongside an upward revision of the US GDP growth to an annualized rate of 3.3% for the same quarter. However, the article emphasizes that tariffs on imports are significantly raising costs for businesses, potentially limiting future profit gains and hampering economic growth. Major companies like Caterpillar and General Motors have already reported substantial financial hits due to these duties, underscoring the complex interplay between profit recovery, economic expansion, and trade policy challenges.

          <p>This article details today's average mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates, noting that while rates are higher than a few years ago, favorable options remain available for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. Current national averages for a 30-year mortgage are around 6.62%, with refinance rates slightly higher, making affordability a challenge for some. Strategies for securing better rates include strengthening one's credit profile to achieve mid- to high-700s scores, shopping around extensively for different lenders, and carefully comparing loan terms and associated fees. The article also suggests that potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2025 could offer some relief for borrowers, easing the current elevated interest rate climate. (not investment advice)</p>

The US has imposed tariffs up to 50% on some Indian goods, impacting key export sectors, despite deepening strategic ties. Meanwhile, India's significant purchases of discounted Russian oil have saved it billions, but drawn US criticism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also preparing for a visit to China, signaling a willingness to keep communication lines open despite unresolved border tensions and trade imbalances.

          <p>The Welsh government has proposed changes to its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, aiming to offer more flexibility to property owners. Since 2023, properties needed to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower non-domestic rates instead of higher council tax. The new proposal suggests allowing an average of 182 days let over several years and counting up to 14 charity days towards the target. While intended to support businesses, the changes face criticism from Welsh language groups concerned about the housing crisis and tourism associations arguing the 182-day threshold remains too high and damaging for the industry, potentially leading to significant backdated tax bills.</p>

This growth highlights the private sector's resilience and improved quality, profitability, and core competitiveness despite "heightened external pressures and increasing internal challenges." The report underscores the vital role of private firms in China's economy, contributing over half of the country's total tax revenue, 60% of its GDP, and 80% of urban jobs.

          <p>A new book, "The Origin of Language" by Madeleine Beekman, proposes a novel theory placing the challenges of early human child-rearing at the center of language evolution. Beekman argues that the need to care for vulnerable, large-brained offspring, who emerged from the womb less mature than other species, spurred the development of vocal communication. This perspective shifts focus from male-dominated evolutionary theories to emphasize familial care and cooperation. The article highlights how early humans who could verbally express needs and coordinate care for their children would have gained a significant survival advantage, shaping both language and human social structures.</p>

It satirizes modern relationship dynamics, focusing on career pressures, childcare clashes, and petty jealousies that ultimately lead to their dissolution. Despite the dark subject matter and the characters' despicable actions, the article suggests the film successfully makes the couple relatable, offering a compelling and hilariously sad exploration of love and hate.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is reportedly considering significant property tax reforms ahead of the November Budget to address government borrowing shortfalls. Options include introducing National Insurance tax for landlords, adjusting Capital Gains Tax (CGT) relief for pricier homes, or abolishing stamp duty in favor of a national proportional property tax. The National Insurance proposal, potentially raising £3bn annually, is gaining traction, while changes to CGT could be lucrative but controversial. Abolishing stamp duty, a major barrier to housing movement, would require a replacement tax to offset lost revenue. These proposals aim to raise billions but face various economic and political downsides. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights a missed opportunity to celebrate the city's rich history and reflect on the factors that have contributed to its enduring greatness.
