          <p>The Leo Baeck Institute (LBI), founded in 1955 by German-speaking Jewish intellectuals like Hannah Arendt, commemorates its 70th anniversary, dedicated to preserving and showcasing German-Jewish cultural heritage that the Nazis sought to destroy. Named after Rabbi Leo Baeck, the institute has branches in New York, London, and Jerusalem, serving as vital research hubs. The LBI's extensive digitized collections, comprising over 3.5 million pages of books, letters, photos, and art, are accessible online, aiding scholars and descendants of Jewish survivors worldwide. Despite facing threats from attacks on academic life and the rise of right-wing ideologies, the LBI continues to promote German-Jewish culture through podcasts and other initiatives, ensuring remembrance and combating antisemitism. </p>

          <p>A goods train from China arrived in Tehran via a new 10,400km rail corridor, reducing delivery times significantly, amidst rising US-Iran tensions and Israeli strikes. This ambitious route, traversing multiple Central Asian countries, aims to enhance Iran's economic resilience by diversifying trade routes and reducing reliance on vulnerable maritime channels. The corridor also positions Iran as a central transit hub, connecting China and Central Asia with Europe via Turkey, enabling Iran to evade sanctions and bolster its regional influence. However, the project faces challenges due to ongoing geopolitical instability and potential interception efforts by the US and Israel, who are wary of Iran's nuclear ambitions. </p>

          <p>Rents in major German cities have nearly doubled in the past decade, despite laws aimed at limiting rental costs in regions with tight housing markets, according to a Housing Ministry analysis. Berlin experienced the highest increase in new rental prices at 107%, followed by Leipzig and Bremen, while Munich remains the most expensive city overall. While German laws restrict landlords from demanding new lease rents exceeding the local comparative rent by more than 10%, enforcement relies on tenants reporting suspected violations. The data underscores the ineffectiveness of current rent control measures in curbing rising housing costs in Germany's urban centers.</p>

Sjogren pointed out that US legislation since 1973 has aimed to prevent reliance on countries like China for critical materials in the aerospace and defense sectors. This call to action underscores growing concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities and the importance of diversifying sources for essential resources.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government by altering materials or dimensions of products to fit into lower-tariff categories. This practice involves strategic design choices to reclassify products under different harmonized system codes, which can result in significant duty savings. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and adding fuzzy-felt fabric to sneaker soles to classify them as slippers. While generally legal, companies must avoid fraudulent misrepresentation of product classifications, as illustrated by Ford's case involving Transit Connect vans. </p>

Economists speculate that businesses are passing on increased employer National Insurance payments to customers. Chocolate prices are particularly affected by poor harvests in cocoa-producing regions, with stocks falling to all-time lows, resulting in a 17.7% increase in the year to May.</p>

          <p>R. Kelly was hospitalized after his lawyers claimed he was given an overdose of medication by prison officials as part of an ongoing assassination plot. Kelly, serving time for sex trafficking and racketeering, is allegedly being targeted by the Bureau of Prisons, according to court documents. His legal team previously accused the Bureau of instructing another inmate to kill him, allegations prosecutors have dismissed as "repugnant." The Bureau of Prisons has declined to comment on the specific claims, citing privacy and safety concerns.</p>

          <p>North Korea plans to dispatch thousands of military construction workers and deminers to Russia's Kursk region to assist in reconstruction efforts, according to Russian officials. This move signifies deepening cooperation between the two nations, with North Korea already providing troops and weapons to support Russia's war in Ukraine. Kim Jong Un expressed his unwavering support for Russia's efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have raised concerns among the U.S., South Korea, and their allies about potential technology transfers that could advance North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Southern California are experiencing heightened fear due to increased ICE raids, fulfilling campaign promises made by President Trump. These operations have become more aggressive, targeting various cities and disrupting daily life for undocumented individuals.

While deportations have not been as massive as initially feared, the anti-immigrant policies have reduced the flow of migrants to the U.S., with many now avoiding the country as a destination.</p>

While stock levels have normalized, the cyber attack disrupted deliveries and led to empty shelves, costing the company millions in lost sales.
