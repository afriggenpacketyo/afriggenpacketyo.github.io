        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vinted, the popular online marketplace for secondhand clothing, originated from a simple problem faced by its co-founder, Milda Mitkutė: too many clothes in a small apartment. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, quickly developed a website to sell her unwanted items, which rapidly gained popularity through word of mouth. Despite early challenges, including a disastrous attempt to add commission fees, the platform expanded internationally and became Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup. The company, now profitable with over 16 million UK users, is a key player in the growing sustainable fashion movement.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that Russia launched its largest drone and missile attack of the war, striking multiple locations including the cabinet building in Kyiv. Ukraine's air force stated that Russia deployed 810 drones and 13 missiles, with Ukrainian defenses intercepting the majority. The attacks resulted in at least eight civilian deaths and 59 injuries across the country, prompting Zelenskyy to call for more international military aid. The barrage also led NATO to scramble fighter jets in neighboring Poland as a precautionary measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans are moving closer to altering the chamber's rules to confirm a large number of President Trump's sub-Cabinet level nominees. The proposed change, ironically based on a previous Democratic suggestion, would allow for a group of nominees to be confirmed with a single "en bloc" vote. This strategy aims to bypass what Republicans describe as unprecedented obstruction by Democrats, who have blocked fast-track procedures for 149 pending nominations. While Republicans prefer a bipartisan solution, they have indicated a willingness to use the "nuclear option" if necessary to overcome the stalemate.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Trump's Apparent Support for Chinese Students is a Strategic Negotiation Tactic</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political science experts are skeptical of President Trump's recent proposal seemingly favoring Chinese students, viewing it as a strategic maneuver rather than a genuine policy shift. According to Professor Dennis Lu-Chung Weng of Sam Houston State University, the move is likely part of a broader negotiation strategy with China, aimed at fostering a more positive atmosphere before potential talks with President Xi Jinping. He cautioned that the overall political climate in the U.S. remains highly skeptical towards China, and there are no signs that visa processes will be streamlined. The article suggests students should not interpret this as a fundamental change in U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>The New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite eradicated from the U.S. decades ago, is making a comeback, with a recent human case reported in Maryland from a traveler. This signals a larger threat as the parasite resurges through Central America and Mexico, threatening the multi-billion dollar American livestock industry. For years, a biological barrier of sterile flies at the Panama-Colombia border contained the pest, but that firewall has now cracked.

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has voiced concerns about the regional and ideological balance of the UK cabinet following a reshuffle triggered by Angela Rayner's resignation. Rayner stepped down as deputy prime minister and housing secretary, prompting a contest for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party. Burnham suggested this contest is an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and advocated for a new deputy leader from the north of England to counter a "London centricity." The reshuffle saw key figures like David Lammy and Yvette Cooper moved into new senior roles.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second-term economic strategy shows striking parallels to the Peronist policies that historically damaged Argentina's economy. His approach includes "import substitution" via high tariffs, exerting direct government control over private companies by taking equity stakes, and undermining the independence of the Federal Reserve. Like Juan Perón, Trump centralizes economic decision-making, personally negotiating deals and using executive power to reward allies and punish adversaries. This shift away from market capitalism towards a state-controlled, personality-driven model risks entrenching cronyism and creating long-term economic instability in the United States.

Many companies incorporating AI report no tangible impact on profits, yet the stock market's growth is heavily reliant on a few AI-associated tech giants.

          <p>Ahead of a recent record-breaking drawing, an analysis of Powerball data highlights how a winner's location significantly impacts their take-home prize. Due to varying state tax laws, a jackpot winner in a state with no lottery tax, such as Florida or Texas, would receive a substantially larger payout than a winner in a high-tax state like New York. Federal law requires a 24% withholding on winnings over $5,000, with more due at tax time, but state taxes can further reduce the final amount. The article provides a breakdown of after-tax payouts, showing the stark financial differences for winners across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

Her initial life sentence was overturned in 2018 by a federal judge who cited an unfair trial, leading to her release after nearly nine years.

          <h2>The 'Alligator Alcatraz' Migrant Detention Center Exemplifies Trump's Performative Security Policies</h2>

          <p>The controversial migrant detention center in a Florida swamp, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," highlights President Trump's strategy of "security theatre." The facility, which has faced legal challenges over environmental rules, serves as a potent symbol of his administration's hardline immigration policies. Regardless of its ultimate legal fate, the name and concept of the grim detention center have become a memorable part of the political landscape. The article suggests that such projects are designed as much for their political messaging and shock value as for their practical application in immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will resign, succumbing to mounting pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The calls for his departure followed a significant defeat for the ruling coalition in July's parliamentary election, where it lost its majority in the upper house. Ishiba, who took office less than a year ago, had initially resisted stepping down, citing the need for political stability amid key national challenges. His resignation preempts a party vote that was widely seen as a no-confidence motion, triggering a leadership election to choose his successor.</p>

          <p>In honor of National Grandparents Day, NPR collected advice from seasoned grandparents for those new to the role. Key themes included embracing a supporting role, being present, and not interfering with the parents' choices, even if they differ from one's own methods. Many shared that becoming a grandparent offered a "second chance" at parenting with less stress and more joy, allowing them to simply love and support the new generation. Practical tips included keeping backup supplies like diapers and snacks at their house and cherishing the unique, less-structured love that defines the grandparent-grandchild relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices hitting record highs above $3,600 an ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for most people to gain exposure to gold is through low-cost, liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the physical price. Owning physical gold coins or bars is generally considered less efficient due to higher transaction and storage costs. Despite the current rally, financial advisors typically recommend limiting gold allocation to a small portion, under 3%, of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The men's final of the 2025 US Open will feature the third successive Grand Slam title match between rivals Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Their rivalry, which began to capture public attention with a classic quarter-final match at the same tournament three years ago, has now become the defining contest in men's tennis. This year, world number one Sinner defended his Australian Open title, while Alcaraz defeated him at the French Open before Sinner took revenge at Wimbledon.

          <p>Observations from four major telescopes, including the Hubble and James Webb, have confirmed that the third known interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is highly unusual. While believed to be a comet, data reveals it has the highest carbon dioxide-to-water ratio ever observed in such an object. It also became active much farther from the sun than typical comets and displays a teardrop-shaped dust cocoon instead of a distinct tail. These strange characteristics are providing scientists with a wealth of new data on objects formed outside our solar system, though its exact origins and composition remain a deep mystery.</p>

          <p>An advocacy group, Rainbow Railroad, reports a 760% surge in inquiries from LGBTQ+ Americans seeking to relocate to Canada following President Trump's re-election. This increase is driven by fears over the current political climate, which includes hundreds of anti-LGBTQ+ bills at the state level and executive orders targeting transgender rights. The organization states that for the first time, the U.S. has become the top country from which people are requesting help to escape persecution. While legal pathways to Canada remain limited, recent Canadian immigration cases are being watched closely as potential precedents for asylum claims.</p>

Unlike the more common Alzheimer's, FTD often strikes earlier in life and primarily affects personality, behavior, and language. Through conversations with Marc and his wife, Julia, the article explores the internal experience of the disease, including Marc's own sense of losing his identity. It details the couple's journey from misinterpreting early symptoms as personality flaws to navigating the daily challenges of caregiving and grappling with the slow, heartbreaking loss of the person he once was.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has invalidated the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of the voters. In 2018, Utah citizens approved a proposition to create an independent redistricting commission, but lawmakers subsequently ignored its work and passed their own heavily gerrymandered map. The court order requires the legislature to draw a new, fairer map, representing a significant victory for voting rights advocates. The ruling pushes back against a growing trend of legislatures ignoring voter-led initiatives and could create a more competitive political landscape in the reliably Republican state.</p>

Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the shorter week as unaffordable.

The core of Mandelson's speech was a call for a deep U.S.-UK technology partnership in areas like AI and quantum computing to compete with China.
