          <p>This opinion article discusses China's increasing geopolitical influence, citing examples like Kenya's de-dollarization and new energy deals as signs of a shifting global dynamic. The author suggests that for the first time since the Cold War, the world is between orders, presenting Beijing with a unique opportunity to rewire international systems. However, the piece also notes China's own economic challenges, such as slowing export growth, which complicates its path forward. It ultimately questions how Beijing will leverage its newfound momentum on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has linked the killing of a Dallas motel manager to current immigration policies, blaming the administration for not deporting the suspect, a Cuban national. The suspect, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, was under a final deportation order, but Cuba reportedly refused to accept him due to his criminal record. While Trump highlighted the suspect's arrest history, court records show some serious charges were dropped or resulted in acquittal. The incident has intensified the political debate over immigration enforcement and national security.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have established a framework for a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a potential ban. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the development, stating that the commercial terms between private parties have been agreed upon. President Trump is scheduled to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize the agreement, which aims to resolve national security concerns by potentially shifting the app's ownership. The deal addresses the politically sensitive issue of the app's 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a second strike on a vessel in international waters, alleging it was operated by "violent drug trafficking cartels" from Venezuela. The strike resulted in three fatalities, and Trump claimed there was recorded evidence of cocaine and fentanyl on board. The action follows a previous deadly strike and has escalated tensions with Venezuela, whose President Nicolás Maduro condemned the U.S. for its "aggression" and asserted his country's right to self-defense. Legal experts have raised questions about the strikes' compliance with international law.</p>

          <p>Valentino Luchin, a 62-year-old distinguished chef from the Bay Area, has been arrested on suspicion of robbing three separate San Francisco banks on the same day. Police allege Luchin passed notes demanding money to tellers at each location before being identified and apprehended. This is not his first encounter with such charges; in 2018, he admitted to robbing a bank, citing severe financial struggles after his restaurant closed. He now faces multiple new charges for robbery and attempted robbery.</p>

          <p>A jury has awarded $13.6 million to five women who were sexually assaulted in the 1980s by their former high school teacher, Garry Poe. The lawsuit successfully argued that the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District was negligent in allowing the abuse to occur. The women testified that Poe, an English teacher and coach, groomed them before assaulting them during post-graduation European trips he chaperoned. The verdict holds the school district financially accountable for failing to prevent the teacher's predatory behavior.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth approximately $900 billion. The plan is contingent on Musk leading the company to an unprecedented $8.5 trillion valuation and meeting other operational goals. This proposal comes as Musk's attention is divided among his many other companies and political activities. The board argues that the massive incentive is necessary to secure his focus on Tesla, reflecting a belief that his personal involvement is critical to the company's valuation.

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Vice President JD Vance has publicly urged citizens to "call out" and contact the employers of anyone celebrating the killing. This call is part of a broader campaign by some Republicans to police speech related to the event, which has led to investigations and firings of teachers and military personnel. Critics, including free speech organizations, have warned that government involvement in targeting individuals for their comments inches toward McCarthyism and risks creating a chilling effect on expression.

          <p>Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has voiced strong criticism of the club's recent performance, attributing its poor start to the season to a flawed summer transfer strategy. Scholes argues that despite spending £200 million on forwards, the team lacks the necessary quality in midfield to suit manager Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He believes the priority should have been a controlling midfielder and a top-tier goalkeeper. With United facing a tough schedule, Scholes fears that without a change in tactics from Amorim, the pressure on the manager will intensify significantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a cloud provider for AI, jumped nearly 8% following the disclosure of a major deal with Nvidia. According to a filing, Nvidia is obligated to purchase at least $6.3 billion of CoreWeave's residual unsold computing capacity through April 2032. CoreWeave, which is backed by Nvidia, is a massive customer for the chipmaker's GPUs, renting out the high-demand hardware to its own clients. The agreement underscores the immense demand for AI computing power and highlights the pivotal role CoreWeave plays in the rapidly growing AI ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, just before the central bank's upcoming meeting on interest rates. Miran, who currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisors, has stated he would take an unpaid leave of absence rather than fully resign if confirmed. This has intensified concerns among critics about the Federal Reserve's political independence, particularly as Trump continues to pressure the institution to cut rates. Miran's term would be short, lasting until the end of January 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed five new members to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel he purged of previous appointees in June. The new members, which include a pharmacist, a pediatric cardiologist, and an epidemiology professor who has questioned government COVID-19 risk assessments, join the influential committee just before it votes on recommendations for this season's COVID vaccines. The overhaul has drawn criticism from major medical organizations, who express concern that the panel now lacks critical expertise and that its decisions may be based on ideology rather than science.</p>

          <p>In a recent address, Reverend William Barber, a prominent progressive pastor, condemned the "brutal, ugly" assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and called for a universal denunciation of political violence. However, he also challenged the narrative that such violence only comes from the left and criticized what he termed "religious nationalism," which he described as using faith to "sanctify wrong." Speaking on the anniversary of the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, Barber argued that any true faith must stand against injustice and not be used as a cover for immoral public policy, an implicit critique of Kirk's political-religious movement.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, driven largely by voters' concerns over the city's unaffordability. The poll reveals a strong desire for a candidate who can bring change, which outweighs the preference for experience. Mamdani performs especially well among voters whose top issue is the cost of living and those who want a mayor who will oppose former President Trump. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trails significantly, with voters giving him low job approval ratings amid a widespread feeling that things in the city are going badly.</p>

          <p>Costco has issued a dangerous product recall for its Kirkland Signature Prosecco Valdobbiadene due to a risk of the bottles spontaneously shattering. The company is advising customers who purchased the item in several Midwestern states between April and August 2025 not to return it to the store. Instead, they are instructed to dispose of it safely by wrapping the bottle and placing it in the trash, after which they can receive a full refund. The unusual step of asking customers to discard the product highlights the severity of the injury risk involved.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the recent deployment of federal forces to Washington, D.C., may ultimately worsen crime despite short-term declines. The author suggests the surge is disrupting the city's economy, with restaurant traffic and tourism down, and immigrant workers staying home out of fear of ICE. Furthermore, the crackdown could erode the long-term trust between communities and local police, making residents less likely to report crimes or cooperate with investigations. By undermining community-based violence prevention programs and creating a hostile environment, the federal presence could backfire once the deployment ends.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, an idea he previously floated during his first term. In a social media post, he argued the change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The proposal, which would require SEC approval, has reignited a debate on corporate reporting standards. While supporters have criticized the focus on quarterly guidance, others argue that frequent reporting provides essential transparency for investors. (not investment advice)</p>
