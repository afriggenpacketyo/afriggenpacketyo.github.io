          <p>BYD, along with other Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers like Zeekr and Deepal, are expanding into South Korea to boost growth and profits amidst intense competition in China. This move aims to enhance the global image of Chinese EVs, with BYD planning to double its showrooms in Korea by the end of 2025. The South Korean market, dominated by Hyundai and Kia, is seen as a crucial proving ground for Chinese EVs, offering a chance to demonstrate their design and manufacturing capabilities. BYD recently launched its Seal sedan in South Korea, competing with Kia's EV4 and Hyundai's Elantra, with a focus on ultra-fast charging technology and a long driving range.</p>

Putin used the occasion to connect the World War II victory to Russia's ongoing actions in Ukraine, emphasizing national unity behind what he termed a "special military operation." The parade featured a display of military hardware, including combat drones, reflecting their increased use in the conflict in Ukraine. Western leaders largely avoided the event due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but leaders from Brazil, Venezuela, Serbia, and Slovakia were also present.</p>

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) made the decision after consulting with stakeholders, considering player concerns and broader safety.

          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have agreed to a trade deal that includes tariffs, signaling that President Trump intends to maintain tariffs as a key trade policy. The agreement allows the UK to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% tariff rate, with higher duties for additional vehicles, while eliminating tariffs on British steel and aluminum. Trump indicated that the 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain for most trading partners, though some sector-specific deals might be negotiated. Analysts suggest the deal reflects the balanced trade relationship between the US and UK, but also highlights the potential for continued trade tensions and economic impacts.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin presided over a Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany, with leaders from China, Brazil, and other states in attendance. The event, used to highlight Russia's past glories and justify the war in Ukraine, comes amid faltering attempts to end the conflict. Ukraine rejected a unilateral cease-fire announced by Putin, and increased its attacks on Moscow leading up to the parade. The parade symbolizes Russia's national pride and the Kremlin's attempt to legitimize its actions in Ukraine, but it has become a point of division in Russia and beyond.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in what is being described as the world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbors, marking a dangerous escalation in their decades-old rivalry. India accused Pakistan of launching drone and missile attacks on military bases, which Pakistan denied, claiming to have shot down 25 Indian drones. Experts say this new phase of conflict involves unmanned weapons across a volatile border, prompting calls for restraint from global powers. Both sides are employing drones for surveillance, targeting, and direct attacks, signaling a shift in military tactics and potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>Volvo is bringing back the XC70 name for a new long-range plug-in hybrid SUV, designed primarily for the Chinese market. The new XC70, slightly larger than the XC60, will offer a pure-electric range of up to 124 miles, more than double that of the XC60 PHEV. Based on a new Scalable Modular Architecture (SMA), the XC70 aims to cater to the growing demand for extended-range hybrids, and Volvo is considering launching it in other markets as well. This move reflects a broader industry trend toward range-extenders amid slowing demand for pure-electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is collaborating with Israel on a plan to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, aiming to end Israel's two-month blockade on food and fuel deliveries. The plan involves establishing distribution zones where aid workers can distribute food without direct military involvement, but the UN has raised serious doubts about its feasibility. The UN argues that reducing distribution points would leave many without essential supplies and potentially displace civilians. Aid workers have warned of increased risks of detention, interrogation, and looting under the proposed system.</p>

He expressed hope that the UK-US deal would be the first of many, but acknowledged that overall tariff levels are likely higher than before.</p>

While maintaining neutrality in the Ukraine war, Beijing has benefited from discounted Russian oil and gas, and Chinese support is vital for Russia's economy and military efforts.</p>

          <p>Chinese government data reveals a shift in trade patterns as President Trump's tariffs impact shipments to the United States. Exports to the US plunged by 21% in April, while exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21%. This redirection suggests a front-loading of the supply chain and a strategic shift by Chinese factories to complete orders destined for the US through other countries. Despite the trade war, overall shipments of goods from China jumped, but economists warn of potential unemployment spikes if factory orders decline.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed, breed, and maintain ecosystem health. Rising global temperatures, floods, and extreme weather events are impacting coastal stopover sites and food sources for migratory birds.

The Slender-billed Curlew was declared extinct in 2024, highlighting the challenges migratory birds face in adapting to human activity.
