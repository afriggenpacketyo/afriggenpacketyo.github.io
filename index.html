          <p>Former allies President Trump and Elon Musk have publicly clashed over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Trump criticized Musk for opposing the bill after initially supporting it, attributing Musk's change of heart to the removal of electric vehicle tax credits. Musk, in turn, claimed he helped Trump win the election and accused him of ingratitude. The feud escalated with Trump threatening to terminate Musk's government subsidies and contracts, while Musk denied prior knowledge of the bill and called it a "disgusting abomination," expressing concern about the national debt. Tesla's stock price dipped amidst the ongoing exchange. Optimism is low considering the public disagreement between two very influential figures and the economic implications of the budget bill. </p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a significant drop following President Trump's threat to withdraw government contracts from Elon Musk's companies. The conflict stemmed from Musk's criticism of the spending bill, which he labeled a "disgusting abomination."

The escalating feud has raised concerns about the future of Tesla and its relationship with the government.

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk's relationship has deteriorated, marked by public accusations and threats. The conflict began over Musk's opposition to the Republican tax and budget bill, which he criticized for increasing the deficit. Musk claimed Trump couldn't have won the election without him, while Trump threatened to cancel Musk's government contracts. Musk further escalated the situation by alleging Trump's name appeared in the Jeffrey Epstein files, though the president did not immediately respond to this accusation.

          <p>A private Japanese company, ispace, attempted to land its Resilience lander on the lunar surface, carrying cameras, scientific instruments, and a rover. The mission aimed to explore the moon's northern hemisphere and deploy a tiny rover called Tenacious to collect data and lunar regolith. The lander also carried a small model of a Swedish house as a symbolic payload. This attempt follows a previous failed landing by ispace in 2023, highlighting the challenges of private lunar missions. Success would mark a significant milestone in commercial space exploration, but this article does not confirm the success or failure of the landing itself. </p>

This surge follows a similar rally in gold prices, indicating a broader trend in precious metals markets. The increase in silver prices may be attributed to various factors, including economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and increased industrial demand.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued a new travel ban affecting 12 countries, aiming to avoid the legal challenges faced by his initial 2017 ban. Unlike the previous ban, which targeted predominantly Muslim countries, the new restrictions are framed around national security risks and perceived failures to accept removable nationals. Legal experts suggest the new ban is more legally robust due to its wider scope and clearly defined exemptions. While some similarities exist with the 2017 ban, the absence of an explicit focus on Muslim-majority states may increase its chances of being upheld by the Supreme Court. </p>

          <p>The announcement of President Trump's latest travel ban has been met with a less intense reaction compared to his initial attempt during his first term. While condemnation exists, it lacks the same level of shock and outrage, possibly due to a desensitization to the administration's policies. The ban, targeting citizens of a dozen countries, is occurring against a backdrop of increasing authoritarianism and attacks on civic institutions. Experts believe legal challenges to the ban are less likely to succeed this time, given the administration's learned lessons from previous litigation. </p>

          <p>The LA Phil has turned to the South Korean capital for an eight-day Seoul Festival as a follow-up to its revelatory Reykjavik and Mexico City festivals, with Unsuk Chin as the curator. The Green Umbrella concert of new music at Walt Disney Concert Hall was an exceptional event. Korean, European and American traditions can serve as sources for reinvention, such as Juri Seo’s Concertino for Piano and Chamber Orchestra and Sun-Young Pahg’s austerely formal “L’autre moitié de Silence”. The conductor Soo-Yeoul Choi favors transparency and sensuality at the same time with expressive gestures that seem to magically mold sound.</p>
