          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, Donald Trump urged Tehran to negotiate a nuclear deal before it's too late, stating the U.S. possesses the best military equipment and Israel knows how to use it. He claimed to have given Iran numerous chances to make a deal, but they failed to act. Iranian state media reported the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard was killed in the attack, but this could not be independently verified. Trump warned circumstances will worsen, and Iran must save what remains of its empire. Optimism remains low given the escalations, but Trump's call for a deal offers a glimmer of hope.

India's aviation regulator has ordered additional safety inspections on Air India's Boeing 787 fleet, while U.S. authorities are reviewing information on the crash. The sole survivor, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, contacted his family after the crash, expressing concern for his missing brother. The disaster is India's worst aviation accident in over 25 years, prompting assistance from U.S. and British authorities, and Prime Minister Modi inspected the crash site.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's attack on Iran, Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group in Lebanon, issued a statement condemning the attack but did not offer to retaliate. Analysts suggest Hezbollah may be prioritizing internal restructuring, including appointing new leadership and focusing on local arms production. Despite a ceasefire with Israel, tensions remain, with Israel frequently attacking sites connected with Hezbollah. Lebanon's government has also increased efforts to contain Hezbollah, dismantling military positions and arms depots.

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a downturn, while oil prices rose significantly after Israel launched a military strike on Iran. S&P 500 futures contracts fell, and U.S. benchmark crude oil jumped by 7.3%. Markets in Asia and Europe also saw declines, with analysts suggesting the escalation could impact the global economy through higher oil prices. The key risk for global energy markets is the potential for Iran to block the Strait of Hormuz. A sustained increase in energy prices could hinder U.S. efforts to lower inflation, potentially impacting the Federal Reserve's target. (not investment advice)</p>

The abusers, who worked on the town's market or as taxi drivers, plied the girls with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. Police admitted they should have done more at the time, and the force has since improved its handling of such investigations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Atlanta has blocked President Donald Trump's election executive order, siding with Democratic state attorneys general who argued it was unconstitutional. The order sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day, and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. The attorneys general argued that the directive usurped the states' constitutional power and sought to amend election law by fiat.

The faster hiring process could help Chipotle open more than 300 locations this year. While AI offers upsides like automating administrative tasks, it may also lead to a sour impression if the chatbot can't answer specific questions, and it poses cybersecurity risks.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the rise of the tech right and its support for Donald Trump, arguing that the tech world's left-libertarian leanings have shifted due to factors like the Great Awokening, macroeconomic changes, and liberal opposition to big tech. It suggests that the tech right's bet on Trump's administration to bring about deregulation, tax cuts, and anti-woke policies has largely failed. The author contends that the Democrats should consider which of Trump's voters can be won back as his coalition fractures, with the tech right being a potential target.</p>

          <p>This article explores President Donald Trump's growing frustration with judges appointed with the help of the Federalist Society, particularly after the US Court of International Trade ruled against his tariffs. The author, David French, suggests that Trump is baffled by the fact that these judges are not automatically supporting his demands, unlike congressional Republicans. French argues that Trump's relationship with the Federalist Society was always likely to be temporary, as their commitment to originalist legal philosophy clashed with Trump's lawless demands. The rift is expected to affect how Trump appoints judges going forward.</p>

          <p>The New York mayoral debate featured heated exchanges between Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, with Cuomo dismissing Mamdani as unqualified and Mamdani criticizing Cuomo's controversies. Candidates discussed handling immigration issues, with Cuomo vowing to defend New York City as a sanctuary city. Cuomo faced criticism for his past actions as governor, including allegations of sexual harassment. Moderators also questioned Cuomo on his outreach to Muslim communities and Mamdani on his support for Jewish New Yorkers, adding complexity to the debate.</p>

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, with judges rejecting arguments that the policy was discriminatory and breached human rights law. The policy, introduced on January 1, aims to raise Â£1.8 billion a year to support pupils in state schools. The court found that while the legislation interferes with some human rights, the government was entitled to prioritize revenue for public services. Head teachers have indicated they plan to appeal the judgment, signaling continued resistance to the VAT changes.</p>

          <p>Zornitsa Gyutsova, a Bulgarian influencer, has sparked outrage with misogynistic online content that incites violence against women, claiming women prefer men who physically assault them. Despite complaints filed with the prosecutor's office and the Commission against Discrimination, no charges have been brought against Gyutsova because gender discrimination is not defined as a crime in Bulgaria's criminal code. While her social media profiles were briefly deactivated, they were later reactivated. Experts believe that a lack of consequences for perpetrators of abuse contributes to the problem, and call for society to speak out against such content.</p>

She claimed the Tory party had made a mistake with the tax and that there has been no windfall to tax for months.
