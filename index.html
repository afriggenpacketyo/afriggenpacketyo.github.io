          <p>President Trump announced a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since pausing reciprocal tariffs. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and reduce non-tariff barriers. Britain will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, setting a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% after the announcement, with further trade deals in the works with other countries like Canada, Italy, India and Japan.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a three-year plan to modernize the U.S. air traffic control system, replacing outdated infrastructure with state-of-the-art technology. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that this initiative aims to enhance safety, reduce delays, and unlock the future of air travel. The plan involves replacing radar, software, hardware, and telecommunications networks, along with building six new air traffic control centers and upgrading existing facilities. The proposal seeks emergency supplemental funding to address critical infrastructure needs, as officials emphasize the FAA's struggle to manage a rapidly growing and complex aviation sector.</p>

Strategies to manage collection debt include negotiating a higher settlement offer, working with a debt relief expert, considering a debt management plan, or exploring bankruptcy. Documentation of attempted payments and communication with the debt collector is crucial for evidence of efforts to resolve the debt.</p>

September is emerging as the most plausible time for the Fed to restart rate cuts, with some economists anticipating a larger-than-usual half-point cut.

          <p>A key Senate vote on the GENIUS Act, a landmark crypto regulation package for stablecoins, faces uncertainty after several Democrats withdrew their support. The bill, which requires 60 votes to advance, aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Senator Ruben Gallego led a group of Democrats citing concerns over anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, and national security as reasons for their changed stance. The outcome of Thursday's vote is now in question due to the lack of support.</p>

The specifics of pharmaceuticals and food standards are still being negotiated. Car industry leaders worry that the quota on cars could put a ceiling on their exports.</p>

However, uncertainty remains, with some fund managers viewed as overly optimistic to avoid spooking investors.

          <p>Political scientists argue that the U.S. has entered a state of competitive authoritarianism, where the cost of opposing the government has significantly increased. They cite the Trump administration's weaponization of government agencies, punitive actions against critics, and threats against Republican politicians as evidence. This has led to self-censorship and retreat among civic leaders and societal organizations, undermining the checks and balances essential for a functioning democracy. The scholars call for a collective defense of democracy by civil society leaders to resist the administration's authoritarian offensive.</p>
