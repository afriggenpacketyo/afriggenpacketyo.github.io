          <p>Ukraine has claimed responsibility for a large-scale drone attack on Russian airbases, stating that it destroyed a significant portion of Russia's strategic bombers and surveillance planes. The operation, dubbed "Spider's Web," was reportedly planned over 18 months and involved drones smuggled into Russia. According to Ukrainian sources, the attacks hit airfields across multiple regions, causing substantial damage and disrupting Russia's ability to launch long-range missile attacks. Russia has confirmed the attacks, calling them a "terrorist act," but has downplayed the extent of the damage and the White House claimed to have not been informed in advance of the attack. The impact of the operation on the conflict's trajectory remains to be seen. </p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was a student at the University of Michigan, has fled the United States after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao allegedly admitted to registering and casting a vote despite being a non-citizen. After being ordered to surrender his passport, Gao reportedly used another passport to board a flight to Shanghai, China. The FBI has charged him with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. The case is among a small number of instances of non-citizens voting in federal elections. </p>

          <p>Six people were injured in Boulder, Colorado, during a pro-Israel demonstration when a suspect allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw an incendiary device at the crowd.

The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" and believes it was ideologically motivated. The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, were hospitalized with burns, and the attack has sparked outrage and condemnation as an act of antisemitism.

          <p>The New York Yankees defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers, preventing a series sweep after a shaky start from Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto struggled with his command, allowing multiple runs early in the game. The Dodgers' offense, missing Mookie Betts due to injury, couldn't capitalize, and Ryan Yarbrough, a former Dodger, pitched effectively for the Yankees. Despite late home runs from Pages and Muncy, the Dodgers couldn't overcome the early deficit, inviting more scrutiny over their inconsistent start to the season. The Yankees' victory highlighted the Dodgers' ongoing struggles with consistency. </p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado believes that Nicolás Maduro will likely respond to U.S. restrictions on Chevron's operations with increased internal repression. Machado, who is in hiding, describes the economic situation in Venezuela as unsustainable and irreversible, with the regime increasingly isolated internationally. She cites projections of economic contraction and dire conditions for Venezuelans, including a minimum wage of $1.50 per month. Despite Maduro's claims of victory in recent legislative elections, Machado asserts that only a small percentage of the electorate participated. </p>

          <p>The article suggests that market volatility is being driven by unpredictable trade policies under the Trump administration. The author points to President Trump's shifting stances on tariffs with China and other countries, noting that these actions create uncertainty and discourage investment. The author also highlights specific sectors, such as retail, pharmaceuticals, and technology, as being particularly vulnerable to the "Trump discount." The author concludes that the lack of predictability is causing investors to look elsewhere, despite the strength of many U.S. companies.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report by Universities UK warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more effectively to deliver courses. The report suggests greater collaboration between universities could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it wants to support collaboration where possible, recognizing the financial challenges facing the sector. University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and rising costs. </p>

The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, leading to displacement and disruption in their education. The government says it is investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation. </p>
