          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, a decision aligned with economists' expectations. The central bank cited the need to monitor high housing prices in Seoul and household debt levels, even as it noted modest economic improvement. Concurrently, the BOK raised its 2025 forecasts for both inflation to 2% and GDP growth to 0.9%, signaling cautious optimism about domestic demand while remaining wary of the impact of U.S. tariffs on exports.

A Chinese tugboat was sighted just five nautical miles from the BRP Sierra Madre, and Chinese ships intercepted Philippine coastguard vessels heading toward the shoal. This renewed friction follows a period of relative calm, signaling a return to heightened maritime disputes between the two nations over the contested territory.</p>

Pitching a full five innings for the first time this season since his recovery from surgery, he allowed only one run and recorded nine strikeouts. Ohtani achieved this by diversifying his pitch selection, relying more on his curveball and splitter, demonstrating an ability to navigate a lineup multiple times and solidifying his value as a crucial two-way player for the team's postseason ambitions.</p>

          <p>The University of Southern California has proposed a new multi-year extension to continue its century-old football rivalry with Notre Dame, addressing public concerns about its potential end. USC's athletic director, Jennifer Cohen, expressed optimism for a resolution, noting that the offer accommodates Notre Dame's preference for a long-term deal. The primary remaining obstacle in negotiations is the scheduling of the game, as USC seeks to move it to earlier in the season to better manage its Big Ten travel demands.</p>

          <h2>Resale Value of Used Tesla Cybertrucks Plummets in 'Unprecedented' Market Trend</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market value for pre-owned Tesla Cybertrucks has experienced a significant decline, with the average used price dropping nearly 30% over the past year to just over $84,000. This trend is part of a broader downturn for all used Tesla vehicles and coincides with a decrease in new car sales for the company in 2025. Experts suggest various factors, including the vehicle's high initial release price compared to early estimates and a potential decline in public perception, have contributed to the sharp depreciation.

          <p>Nvidia announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its AI chips. Despite the positive overall results, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue of $41.1 billion fell slightly short of analyst estimates. Nvidia's outlook remains robust, with an expected $54 billion in revenue for the next quarter, signaling that the global AI infrastructure buildout continues unabated. (not investment advice)</p>

Under expanded presidential authority, local police are now working alongside federal agencies, leading to scenes of immigration raids on residential streets that have drawn condemnation from local residents. Critics view the actions as a political "dominance performance" by the Trump administration that makes communities feel more policed rather than safer.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that intense dust storms known as haboobs are becoming a growing threat in Southern California and the Central Valley due to factors exacerbated by climate change. Conditions such as widespread drought, water overuse, and wildfires are creating more dry, loose soil that can be swept up into massive dust walls. These storms pose significant health risks, as the airborne particles can carry toxic materials like pesticides and disease-causing fungal spores, and they also reduce visibility and damage infrastructure.</p>

The suspended employees were placed on paid administrative leave, a move that follows a statement from FEMA dismissing the signatories as "bureaucrats" resistant to necessary reform.</p>
