          <h2>New Forensic Methods Using Genetic Genealogy Help Solve Cold Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:45:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details how genetic genealogy, a technique combining DNA analysis with family tree research, is revolutionizing crime-solving. It highlights the work of Barbara Rae-Venter, who famously identified the Golden State Killer, Joseph James DeAngelo, from her home. The method, which involves building family trees from public DNA databases, has also been used to solve other cold cases, such as identifying a serial killer and finding the real identity of a kidnapped child. While this powerful tool brings justice to victims, it also raises significant privacy concerns as millions of people upload their genetic data to public sites.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:44:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for enhanced security for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The requests included additional counter-sniper teams and drone defense systems. The report, led by Senator Rand Paul, accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress and highlights significant communication failures between the Secret Service and local law enforcement. It concludes these failures contributed to a preventable tragedy, though it found no evidence of political animus behind the denials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has introduced significant security upgrades. The agency is now equipped with a fleet of military-grade drones for improved aerial reconnaissance, a direct response to the failure to detect a commercial drone flown by the shooter before the attack. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct and seamless communication with local law enforcement. These changes aim to rectify the communication breakdowns and technological gaps identified during the Butler incident to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Several Philadelphia Phillies players have publicly criticized the decision to include Milwaukee Brewers rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski in the MLB All-Star Game. Phillies star Trea Turner called the selection "terrible," suggesting the game is becoming more about social media popularity than rewarding the season's best performers. Teammate Nick Castellanos echoed the sentiment, referencing a comment that the event is turning into a spectacle like the "Savannah Bananas." Despite the backlash, Misiorowski has received support from his manager and others who believe his exciting, high-strikeout performances add value and excitement to the game.</p>

          <p>An investigation has been launched in France after a 20-year-old inmate successfully escaped from the Lyon-Corbas prison by hiding inside a large bag belonging to his cellmate, who was being officially released. The prison service confirmed the escape, stating the inmate took advantage of his cellmate's departure to conceal himself in his luggage. The escaped prisoner was serving multiple sentences and was also under investigation for organized crime. A prison administration director described the incident as an "extremely rare event" resulting from an "accumulation of errors" and "serious malfunctions," prompting internal and prosecutorial investigations.</p>

          <p>The UK's transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will soon reveal plans to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers. While she did not confirm reports of a £700 million subsidy program, she guaranteed that new measures would reduce the upfront cost of purchasing an EV. The government is also investing £88 million in charging infrastructure, including funds for councils to install "cross-pavement gullies" for homes without driveways. The move aims to boost EV adoption, which is currently lagging behind mandated targets ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to financial planners, generating passive income is a crucial strategy for achieving a comfortable retirement, offering more than just reliance on savings. Experts identify three primary advantages: it provides a predictable and steady cash flow, effectively replacing a regular paycheck and reducing reliance on investment withdrawals. This stability helps retirees navigate market volatility without being forced to sell assets at a loss. Furthermore, passive income sources like rental properties or stock dividends often grow over time, providing a valuable hedge against inflation and ensuring long-term financial resilience.

His approach involved purchasing cash-flowing rental properties in stable, working-class neighborhoods and reinvesting the profits to acquire more properties, which he says accelerated his wealth-building by over a decade.

According to Zheng, this "self-centred" approach is essential for accurately explaining China's practices to the world and predicting its future trajectory.

Prioritizing a short period of daily, distraction-free "us time" and ending the day with a quiet emotional check-in are also key habits that help prevent small issues from escalating and maintain intimacy.</p>

It traces her journey from being discovered at a football game to her iconic roles in Playboy and "Baywatch," and the profound violation of her stolen private tape, an event that predated modern internet shaming. The piece highlights her intellectual curiosity, her advocacy work, and her recent career resurgence, including a Golden Globe-nominated film role and her widely discussed decision to stop wearing makeup. It portrays her as a triumphant figure who has navigated immense public scrutiny with grace and vulnerability.</p>

          <p>A funeral was held for Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American from Florida, who was killed during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. According to his family, he was protecting his family's land when the incident occurred; Israel's military stated that Palestinians had been throwing rocks. Musallet is the fifth American killed in the West Bank since the war began, and his family is demanding a U.S.-led investigation. The killing comes amid escalating violence in the region and as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, aimed at pausing the 21-month war, show no signs of a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>The UK continues to experience a heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 31C on Sunday before cooler, wetter weather arrives on Monday. On Saturday, England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all recorded their warmest day of the year so far, with a high of 33.1C in Herefordshire. The intense heat has led to amber health alerts in southern and central England, an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland, and hosepipe bans for millions in Yorkshire, Kent, and Sussex. While the heat is expected to break for most of the country on Monday, the southeast may see warm temperatures persist until Tuesday.</p>

          <p>While conducting a sonar survey of the Fox River in Wisconsin, researchers accidentally discovered the shipwreck of a wooden paddle wheel steamer that sank in 1880. The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society was originally mapping other known cultural sites when their high-resolution sonar detected the partially buried 90-foot hull. The wreck is believed to be the L.W. Crane, a vessel used for transporting passengers and freight that caught fire and sank over 140 years ago. The discovery highlights the potential for new archaeological finds, and further investigations are underway to learn more about the L.W. Crane and other wrecks in the area.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully developed a method to synthesize sucrose, or white sugar, from methanol, which can be derived from captured carbon dioxide. The process, developed at the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, uses a system of enzymes for biotransformation, bypassing the need for traditional agriculture like growing sugar cane. This breakthrough offers a potential solution to both environmental and food security challenges by creating a pathway to turn a greenhouse gas into essential food products. The researchers stated their method could also be adapted to produce other complex carbohydrates, such as fructose and starch.</p>

          <p>The medical community is starting to take the significant pain associated with IUD insertions more seriously, following years of patients sharing their experiences and feeling their discomfort was minimized. In the last year, both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have issued new recommendations urging doctors to discuss and offer pain management options. While IUDs are a highly effective and popular form of long-term birth control, the insertion process can be intensely painful for many. Experts now advise patients to proactively discuss pain relief, such as topical anesthetics or nerve blocks, with their providers before the procedure.</p>

Technology Secretary Peter Kyle is reportedly examining how to address the "addictive habits" associated with social media, with potential proposals including app time limits and curfews.
