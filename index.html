          <p>A recent study by the ACS’ Environmental Science & Technology has revealed that certain beers brewed in the United States contain elevated levels of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as 'forever chemicals,' exceeding EPA limits. Researchers modified an EPA testing tool to analyze 23 beers, discovering a correlation between PFAS concentrations in municipal drinking water and levels in locally brewed beer, with North Carolina, California, and Michigan showing particularly high levels. The study found PFAS in 95% of the beers tested, primarily perfluorooctanesulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid, while international beers from Holland and Mexico were less likely to have detectable PFAS. The research team concluded that drinking water is a primary route of PFAS contamination in beer.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 34 years, Japan has relinquished its position as the world's leading creditor, now surpassed by Germany, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite Japan's net external assets reaching a record high, gross external assets totaled 533.05 trillion yen, falling short of Germany's 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets when converted, while Germany benefited from a substantial current account surplus. Japan's net external credit has risen for seven consecutive years, driven by direct investment in the United States, but the country now ranks second behind Germany in net external assets.</p>

          <p>Shares of China's BYD experienced a decline following the company's announcement of price reductions on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June. The price cuts, including a 20% reduction on the Seagull hatchback, aim to boost sales amid growing competition in the electric vehicle sector. Analysts from Citi anticipate a significant increase in foot traffic at BYD's dealerships as a result of the price adjustments. While other Chinese automakers also saw share declines, Citi analysts remain optimistic about the sales growth of new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan, citing relatively mild competition in that segment.</p>

While this would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams, impacting current owners as well.

Trump's demand that retailers "eat the tariffs" contradicts the reality that expenses cannot consistently exceed revenue. While some retailers may attempt to comply, the impact on earnings is inevitable, and small businesses are already passing on the costs to consumers. The author criticizes the denial of economic realities and the pressure on businesses to avoid using the word "tariff," emphasizing the self-defeating nature of such tactics.</p>

          <p>Janet Jackson, a music legend and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, received the Icon Award at the 2025 American Music Awards, marking her first TV performance in seven years. She performed a medley of her hits "Someone to Call My Lover" and "All For You" before accepting the award, expressing gratitude and humility. Jackson, an 11-time AMA winner and five-time Grammy winner, has had a decades-long career, with "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814" being the only album to generate seven top five-charting songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Her career suffered fallout from the 2004 Super Bowl incident, for which Justin Timberlake later apologized.</p>

          <p>CNN anchor Jake Tapper asserted that the cover-up of former President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline during his time in the White House was “maybe even worse than Watergate”. Tapper argued that the concealment of Biden’s health issues was more significant because Richard Nixon was in control of his faculties when sober. Tapper highlighted signs of Biden's cognitive decline, including forgetting names of aides and celebrity supporters, and implicated key figures like Jill Biden and Hunter Biden in maintaining the secrecy. He promoted his new book, "Original Sin," which explores the alleged cover-up.</p>

          <p>King Charles III's visit to Canada is being interpreted as a subtle rebuke to President Trump, who has threatened the country’s sovereignty. Invited by Prime Minister Mark Carney, the visit is intended to emphasize Canada’s distinct heritage and independence from the United States. The king's speech to the Canadian Parliament, written by Carney's office, is expected to affirm Canada's sovereignty in a diplomatic manner. The visit is rich with symbolism, reflecting Canada's commitment to its own identity amid external pressures.</p>
