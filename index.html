          <h2>Dispute Arises Between UK's NHS and Doctors' Union Over Strike Safety Protocols</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:06:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant disagreement has emerged between NHS England and the British Medical Association (BMA) regarding patient safety during an upcoming five-day doctors' strike. NHS England has instructed hospitals to avoid canceling non-urgent care except in emergencies, a departure from previous strikes where routine procedures were widely postponed. The BMA warns this new approach will stretch non-striking senior doctors too thin, potentially compromising emergency services and putting patients at risk. This conflict unfolds as the government and the BMA continue negotiations to avert the walkout, which centers on the union's demand for pay restoration to 2008 levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is reportedly considering its 'Anti-Coercion Instrument' (ACI) as a potential countermeasure if the U.S. imposes a threatened 30% tariff on EU imports. This powerful tool, created in 2023 but never used, would allow the bloc to restrict U.S. suppliers' access to public contracts, limit imports and exports, and curb foreign direct investment. While the EU hopes to negotiate a deal with a lower baseline tariff, the ACI represents a significant escalation, described as a 'trade bazooka' that would be deployed as a last resort. The instrument is designed to deter economic coercion and protect the EU's trade and investment interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The death toll from a Bangladeshi air force training jet crashing into a school in Dhaka has climbed to 31, including 25 students and a teacher. The incident has triggered widespread grief and anger, leading to student protests demanding accountability, compensation, and a halt to training flights using what they call outdated aircraft. The Chinese-made F-7 BGI jet reportedly suffered a technical malfunction shortly after takeoff, and an investigation is underway. The nation observed a day of mourning as dozens of injured victims remain hospitalized in critical condition, with many families awaiting the identification of remains.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is now seen as possessing greater political influence in Washington than other tech leaders like Apple's Tim Cook or Tesla's Elon Musk. This shift is attributed to Nvidia's central role in the AI revolution, making its technology critical to U.S. strategic interests. Huang's successful lobbying, which aligned with some White House officials' views, reportedly contributed to the recent reversal of restrictions on exporting H20 AI chips to China. His ability to navigate complex U.S.-China relations and secure major deals, such as a massive AI partnership with the UAE, highlights his growing stature as a key figure in global technology policy.</p>

          <p>New research from the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests a path for Democrats to regain support among working-class voters, including a specific segment of Donald Trump's base. The study indicates that while these voters are often socially moderate, they hold economically egalitarian views, favoring policies like a higher minimum wage, stronger unions, and infrastructure spending. The analysis identifies that approximately 11% of Trump's working-class supporters hold this combination of socially moderate and economically progressive views. The article argues that by adopting a 'social populism' platform that reflects these attitudes, Democrats could potentially sway enough of these voters in key states to win future elections.</p>

          <p>A new case, *Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe*, is being viewed as a significant threat to the 1965 Voting Rights Act. A lower court ruling, based on a narrow interpretation suggested by Justice Neil Gorsuch, found that private citizens and groups cannot bring lawsuits to enforce the act, a method responsible for the vast majority of successful voting rights cases over the past four decades. If the Supreme Court upholds this decision, it would effectively gut the landmark civil rights law, leaving enforcement solely to a potentially partisan Department of Justice. This legal challenge follows a decade of Supreme Court decisions that have already weakened the statute's protections.</p>

          <p>The projected cost for constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, UK, has surged to £38 billion, a significant increase from the previous £20 billion estimate. To fund the project, the government has confirmed it will take a 44.9% stake and has secured investments from private companies, including Centrica. The increased cost will reportedly add about £1 per month to household energy bills during the construction phase, which is expected to last over a decade. Proponents argue the investment is crucial for the UK's energy security and will create thousands of jobs, while critics express alarm over the escalating costs and financial risks to taxpayers.</p>

Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the policy as a first-of-its-kind initiative to combat the criminal enterprises that prey on vulnerable people.

This rise in borrowing puts additional pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with economists suggesting that tax hikes or spending cuts may be necessary in the upcoming Autumn Budget to meet fiscal targets.

          <p>Scientists who monitor Earth's rotation have observed that recent days have been slightly shorter than the standard 24 hours, with July 22 predicted to be about a millisecond short. This phenomenon is caused by minor, natural variations in the planet's spin, influenced by factors like the moon's gravity, atmospheric winds, and the movement of Earth's liquid core. While the long-term trend is for days to lengthen due to tidal braking from the moon, the last decade has seen a number of shorter days. This has sparked discussion about the unprecedented possibility of a 'negative leap second' to keep atomic time synchronized with Earth's rotation.</p>

The picture, taken by photographer Josh Shinner in Norfolk, shows the young prince smiling in a rural setting. The accompanying message from his parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales, wished him a happy birthday. Prince George, who is second in line to the throne, has been increasingly visible at public events, including Wimbledon and Trooping the Colour.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University argued in federal court that the Trump administration illegally cut $2.6 billion in federal research funding as a politically motivated act of retaliation. The university claims the cuts were imposed after it resisted demands to change its policies on admissions, student conduct, and diversity to align with the administration's ideology. The government contends it has the authority to cancel grants with institutions that are out of compliance with presidential directives, specifically citing an order to combat antisemitism. A ruling in Harvard's favor could restore hundreds of critical scientific and medical research projects and set a precedent for other universities facing similar pressures.</p>

The warning identifies state employees, workers in classified roles, and academics as prime targets for these 'modified travel souvenirs,' which could be used by foreign spy agencies.

          <p>Annie Farmer, a key witness and accuser in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, is urging the U.S. government to release information related to the case. She expressed exhaustion and a feeling of being 'used' as the case becomes increasingly politicized, particularly regarding the Trump administration's shifting stance on declassifying files. Farmer remains skeptical of the administration's motives, given President Trump's past association with Epstein. She is also disturbed by fringe calls to pardon Maxwell and was concerned by the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey, who was instrumental in securing Maxwell's conviction.</p>

The migrants had been deported there from the U.S. in March under a rarely used law targeting alleged gang members, before being sent back to Venezuela in a recent prisoner exchange. Venezuelan officials presented videos of former detainees describing abuses including beatings and denial of medical care, and announced they would investigate Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and other officials.

          <p>A review of global film distribution reveals the extensive modifications Hollywood movies undergo to comply with censorship rules in countries like India, China, Russia, and Turkey. Censors frequently shorten or alter scenes involving intimacy, LGBTQ+ themes, nudity, or drug use, as seen in recent films like 'Superman' and 'Oppenheimer'. In some cases, studios self-censor or create alternate versions to gain access to lucrative but restrictive markets, such as China. This practice has led to criticism from free expression advocates who warn that Hollywood is making 'troubling compromises' that flatten narratives and disrupt filmmakers' artistic vision.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in the Ukraine war show Russia making minor but steady territorial gains, particularly in the Sumy and Donetsk regions, largely through an intensified use of drone attacks. In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump has reversed his earlier stance, resuming arms shipments to Ukraine and facilitating the transfer of advanced NATO air defense systems. This change comes as Trump's diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin have failed, leading to a soured relationship and threats of severe U.S. economic penalties against Moscow. Meanwhile, Ukraine has escalated its own drone attacks, disrupting airports in Moscow.</p>
