            <h2>Drone Attacks Resume in Ukraine Following Easter Truce</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Ukraine reported a surge in Russian drone attacks across multiple regions shortly after the conclusion of a 30-hour Easter truce declared by Moscow. Air raid alerts were issued for Kyiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhzhia, with explosions reported in Mykolaiv. Russia has not commented on the reported attacks, and both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. The attacks underscore the fragility of temporary truces in the ongoing conflict and the continued reliance on drone warfare. The Easter truce was an attempt to observe a period of peace during the religious holiday, but the subsequent resumption of attacks highlights the deep-seated tensions and lack of lasting resolution. </p>

            <p>US Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss a potential bilateral trade deal. This visit occurs against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions between the US and China, with the US seeking to strengthen ties with India as an economic powerhouse. Discussions are expected to focus on fairness in two-way trade and expanding the defense partnership, building on the agenda set during Modi's visit to the US in February. The US is currently India's largest trading partner, and India hopes to secure a favorable trade deal within a 90-day pause on tariffs declared by President Trump.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire after reports surfaced of a second Signal group chat in which he shared details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The chat included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer and contained flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets involved in the pending attack. This revelation follows an earlier incident where Hegseth inadvertently shared similar details with the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information. The Pentagon's inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app to determine compliance with DoD policies. The situation has led to internal turmoil within the Pentagon, with some officials calling for Hegseth's resignation.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned countries against appeasing the US in trade talks concerning President Donald Trump's tariffs. This warning comes in response to reports that Washington plans to pressure governments to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from US import taxes. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson stated that appeasement cannot bring peace and compromise cannot earn respect. The spokesperson emphasized that all parties should stand on the side of fairness and defend international economic and trade rules. The US Treasury Department and the US Trade Representative have been asked for responses to the report.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has proposed a humanitarian agreement to Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported by the US and imprisoned in El Salvador in exchange for the release of the same number of political prisoners. Bukele also mentioned nearly 50 prisoners of other nationalities, including US citizens, as part of the proposed swap. The US has been deporting Venezuelans accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang to El Salvador, paying the country to detain them. Maduro has condemned the US deportations, describing them as "kidnapping" and a "massive abuse" of human rights.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has decided to keep its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision appears to be aimed at stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The PBOC's move follows better-than-expected economic data from China, including first-quarter GDP growth of 5.4%, which allows the central bank to maintain its current rates. The LPRs influence corporate and household loans, as well as mortgage rates, and have remained steady since October of last year.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to pull another $1 billion in federal grants and contracts for health research from Harvard University, escalating a dispute over institutional oversight and independence. This follows an earlier announcement that the administration would freeze $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in multi-year contract value after Harvard refused to comply with policy demands from the administration. The demands included banning masks at campus protests, reforming merit-based hiring and admissions, and reducing the power held by faculty and administrators deemed more committed to activism than scholarship. Harvard has strongly rejected these demands, asserting its independence and constitutional rights.</p>

The firm anticipates that Trump's tariff blitz will result in some trade deals, but that effective tax rates will still increase significantly, likely landing between 10% and 20%. While this scenario is expected to slow economic growth and increase unemployment and inflation, JPMorgan does not foresee a full-blown recession. The firm recommends that investors consider structured notes and hedge funds in diversified portfolios to mitigate risk and capitalize on market volatility (not investment advice).</p>

The season has been criticized for its unrelenting cheerlessness and emphasis on undiluted pain, particularly in the extended sequence depicting Joel's death. While subsequent episodes include moments of ingenuity, the show's limited imagination becomes more glaring as the season progresses. The series struggles to balance its exploration of animosity with the emotional journey of its characters, leading to a more circular and suffocating narrative.</p>

            <p>Shanghai welcomed a record-high 220,000 spectators for the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix, projected to bring over 5 billion yuan in economic benefits. This event is one of over 170 international and national sports events scheduled in Shanghai this year, reflecting a broader trend of local policymakers turning to the sports industry to stimulate consumption and drive growth. While traditional growth drivers like real estate are slowing, the sports industry is becoming a focus for local governments amid growing public enthusiasm and central government support.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for a Chinese airline has been returned to Boeing's US production hub due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Trump recently raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting China to impose a 125% tariff on US goods. This makes it economically unviable for the Chinese airline to take delivery of the jet, given its market value of around $55 million. The decision highlights the tangible impact of the trade war on specific industries and the potential for confusion and disruption due to changing tariffs.</p>

            <p>Despite government promises to reform the childcare system, many parents in Britain still face significant challenges in accessing affordable and available nursery places. "Childcare deserts," areas with persistently low access to childcare, disproportionately affect deprived communities. While the rollout of "free hours" aims to provide subsidized childcare, experts are concerned about a widening gap between eligible and ineligible families. A lack of sufficient nursery places and staffing shortages further exacerbate the problem, leaving many working families struggling to balance work and childcare responsibilities.</p>

While Gatwick has implemented plans to improve on-time performance in 2025, passengers may not be entitled to compensation due to ATC issues being considered "extraordinary circumstances."

            <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), in collaboration with Pakistan's Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), has developed AI-powered cameras to detect snow leopards and warn villagers via text message to move their livestock to safety. Snow leopards are often killed in retaliation for livestock losses, contributing to a decline in their population. The cameras are being tested in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, where they have shown promising results in differentiating between humans, other animals, and snow leopards. This initiative aims to reduce human-wildlife conflict and protect the endangered snow leopard population.</p>
