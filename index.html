          <p>UK betting company Betfred has stated that all 1,287 of its high street shops could close if the government proceeds with a significant tax hike on the gambling industry. Co-founder Fred Done warned this would endanger 7,500 jobs, calling the proposed tax increases the "biggest threat" in the company's history. The potential policy change, advocated for by figures like former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, aims to raise revenue for social programs but has been labeled "economically reckless" by industry groups who fear it will push gamblers to unregulated offshore markets.</p>

          <p>Over the past four decades, China has made remarkable progress in combating the expansion of the Mu Us Desert in the Ningxia region. Through extensive sand control and afforestation efforts at the Baijitan National Nature Reserve, authorities have stabilized vast areas of drifting sands. This initiative has not only protected the regional capital of Yinchuan and the vital Yellow River but has also pushed the desert back by more than 20 kilometers. The project has successfully reclaimed a massive expanse of land, leaving only a small portion of dunes for research purposes.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor details her personal and professional journey investigating the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski. The case led her back to her small Pennsylvania hometown, where she discovered the victim's ex-wife, Heather Snyder, was a former classmate and high school homecoming queen. The article explores the complex dynamics between Shymanski, Snyder, and her boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, who was convicted of the murder. Snyder, who was never charged but invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege at trial, provides an exclusive interview addressing suspicions about her potential involvement.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has strongly condemned the United States, accusing it of committing "murder" and violating Colombia's sovereignty. The accusation follows a U.S. strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters that killed a fisherman, Alejandro Carranza, who Petro insists had no connection to the drug trade. This incident is part of a series of recent U.S. attacks on vessels in the Caribbean, which the Trump administration defends as necessary to combat drug trafficking. The strikes have drawn criticism from UN experts, who have described them as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack against civilians within Gaza, which would constitute a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The State Department has informed other international mediators and stated that measures will be taken to protect Gazans if the attack proceeds. This development comes as the ceasefire's first phase is underway, with hostage exchanges and prisoner releases occurring. Meanwhile, tensions remain high, highlighted by a recent Israeli tank shell incident that killed 11 members of a Palestinian family.</p>

          <p>A notorious photograph from the Holocaust, long titled "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa," has been re-examined, leading to the identification of the Nazi gunman with 99% certainty. German historian Jürgen Matthäus, aided by public tips and AI-based facial recognition, identified the perpetrator as Jakobus Onnen, a member of the Nazi Einsatzgruppe C. Research also corrected the location of the mass execution from Vinnytsia to Berdychiv, Ukraine, based on a Wehrmacht soldier's war diary. While the identity of the victim remains unknown, the breakthrough demonstrates how interdisciplinary collaboration and technology can advance historical understanding of the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir and recent comments, former Vice President Kamala Harris described the Biden administration's decision to exclude Elon Musk from a 2021 White House electric vehicle event as a "big mistake." Harris argued that despite Tesla's non-unionized workforce, it was illogical to snub the nation's leading EV manufacturer. She believes the move, widely seen as a gesture to support the United Auto Workers, alienated Musk and potentially influenced his subsequent political shift and financial backing of Donald Trump. Harris emphasized that presidents should prioritize technological innovation over political loyalties.</p>

The developments add to the ongoing fallout from his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations made against him, settling a civil case with Ms. Giuffre in 2022.</p>

The return is part of a ceasefire agreement, but delays in locating and returning all deceased hostages have caused frustration in Israel.

          <p>Despite significant summer spending, Liverpool's recent run of losses is being analyzed in the context of Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure to Real Madrid. The article suggests his absence has impacted the team's ability to build up play from the back and bypass high-pressing opponents. Alexander-Arnold's unique skill set, including his ambidextrous long-range passing and ability to play through central midfield, created tactical advantages that the team now lacks. His replacements have not been able to replicate his effectiveness, forcing tactical compromises like using midfielder Florian Wirtz in deeper roles to facilitate play.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Accenture, Lufthansa, and Klarna, have recently announced job cuts, attributing the restructuring to the increased adoption of artificial intelligence. However, some critics and academics argue that AI is being used as a "good excuse" or scapegoat for more conventional business decisions, such as correcting overhiring that occurred during the pandemic. Research from institutions like Yale University and the New York Fed suggests that AI has not yet caused widespread job disruption, and many firms are using it to retrain staff rather than replace them. This trend is fueling employee anxiety, even if the direct impact of AI on mass layoffs remains unproven. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>It is common for sexual frequency and desire to decrease in long-term relationships, a phenomenon driven by both psychological and biological factors. According to therapists, the initial passion is fueled by a specific hormonal cocktail that shifts over time towards bonding hormones like oxytocin, which can dampen sex drive. For heterosexual women, a disconnect between physical and psychological arousal, often influenced by societal messaging and a lack of prioritized pleasure, can also contribute. Experts emphasize that open communication, mutual satisfaction, and maintaining non-sexual physical affection are crucial for sustaining intimacy over many years.</p>

          <p>UCLA secured a dramatic 20-17 comeback win against Maryland, thanks to the resilience of quarterback Nico Iamaleava. After appearing to suffer a serious knee injury with just over two minutes remaining, he was cleared to return and promptly led a game-tying touchdown drive. Following a quick defensive stop and another swift offensive push, he positioned the Bruins for a game-winning 23-yard field goal with only two seconds left on the clock. The victory marks UCLA's third consecutive win, continuing an impressive midseason turnaround under interim coach Tim Skipper.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the Trump administration after a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire exercise forced the temporary closure of a major section of Interstate 5 on Saturday. Newsom called the event, which involved firing live munitions over the busy highway, an "absurd show of force" and accused the president of "putting his ego over responsibility." The event at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance, celebrated the Marines' 250th anniversary. State officials cited "extreme life safety risk" for the closure, while Marine officials claimed it was unnecessary, highlighting growing tensions between the state and federal governments.</p>
