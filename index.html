          <p>Following a U.S.-brokered peace deal, the last living hostages held by Hamas have been released, prompting widespread relief and emotional homecomings. The agreement also includes the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Amid these developments, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to address the Israeli Knesset, adding a significant political dimension to the fragile situation. The deal marks a pivotal moment in the two-year conflict, though the path to lasting peace remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Twenty members of the Barrio 18 gang, which the United States has designated a foreign terrorist organization, have escaped from a prison southeast of Guatemala City. The escape prompted a sharp condemnation from the U.S. embassy, which urged the Guatemalan government to act swiftly to recapture the fugitives. The incident highlights the significant security challenges posed by powerful gangs like Barrio 18 and MS-13 in Central America, which are blamed for high homicide rates and widespread violence in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average mortgage rates in the UK have risen slightly for the first time since February, signaling a cautious approach from lenders heading into the winter. The average two-year and five-year fixed rates now stand around 5%, a minor increase that may still disappoint new borrowers and those looking to remortgage. Analysts attribute the halt in falling rates to volatile swap rates and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming government Budget, suggesting a period of stabilization rather than a sustained rise in borrowing costs.

          <p>In the wake of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians are returning to northern Gaza to find their homes and neighborhoods in ruins. The two-year war has destroyed an estimated two-thirds of Gaza's buildings and killed over 67,000 people, leaving survivors to grapple with immense loss and psychological trauma. Despite the halt in fighting, residents express deep uncertainty about the future, the durability of the peace, and who will ultimately govern the devastated territory.</p>

          <p>Two men, Rashid Gedel and Samuel Dodsworth, have appeared in court charged with the murder of convicted paedophile Ian Watkins at Wakefield Prison. Watkins, the 48-year-old former frontman of the band Lostprophets, was serving a lengthy sentence for a series of horrific child sex offenses. The incident has drawn attention to conditions at the high-security prison, where a recent report noted that violence had "increased markedly" and the infrastructure was in a poor state of repair.</p>

This case, described as the largest in English and Welsh legal history, could eventually involve 1.6 million car owners seeking compensation, with a judgment not expected until the summer of 2026.</p>

          <p>Political scientist Barbara Walter, an expert on how civil wars begin, argues that the current moment of political violence in the U.S. is uniquely dangerous. She identifies three key differences from past eras: leaders now weaponize violent events for political gain instead of unifying the country, violence is becoming reciprocal between the far-left and far-right, and top law enforcement agencies have become politicized. These factors, she warns, are creating a self-sustaining cycle of instability and pushing the country into a high-risk zone.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has urged UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "directionless tinkering" in the upcoming Budget and instead focus on broader tax system reforms. While acknowledging the pressure to raise revenue, the think tank warns against harmful options and suggests that principled changes to areas like property tax and capital gains tax would be fairer and better for economic growth. The IFS argues that a reform-based approach can create a better system overall, rather than simply raising taxes through piecemeal adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At 50 years of age, Welsh snooker player Mark Williams is on the verge of making history after taking a dominant 7-1 lead over Shaun Murphy in the Xi'an Grand Prix final. If he secures the victory, Williams will become the oldest winner of a ranking tournament, breaking a record that has stood since 1982. This potential 27th ranking title would also place him just one behind the legendary Steve Davis on the all-time list, cementing his status as one of the sport's greats.</p>
