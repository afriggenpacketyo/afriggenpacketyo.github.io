        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating earnings, falling to $9.64 billion due to a significant decrease in insurance-underwriting profit, which was impacted by Southern California wildfires. The company also cited a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange as the dollar weakened. Buffett cautioned that potential tariffs could further negatively affect the conglomerate's profits, adding uncertainty to the financial outlook. The conglomerate's insurance-underwriting profit plunged nearly 50%, signaling a rough start to the year for this segment of the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber is simultaneously battling the Trump administration's attempts to cut federal funding while addressing campus culture issues, including concerns about free speech and antisemitism. Garber is fighting the Trump administration's demands, which Harvard views as violations of the First Amendment, while also agreeing that Harvard has a campus culture problem needing urgent fixing. He aims to reform the university by changing how it handles student discipline, manages protests, and addresses antisemitism. Garber has also rolled back policies related to diversity and race, sparking criticism from some students who argue these changes prioritize optics over values.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Labor is experiencing a significant workforce reduction, with approximately 20% of its staff having left, raising concerns about the agency's ability to protect workers' rights and provide essential services. Remaining employees fear further cuts due to White House-ordered reorganization plans, potentially leading to a reduction in force. The attrition has forced attorneys to take on administrative tasks, reducing the services available to workers.

This decision marks a shift from previous resistance by Druse militias to be incorporated into the national military. The violence, incited by a debunked audio clip, resulted in at least 101 deaths and prompted Israeli airstrikes in the name of protecting Syrian Druse.

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to compel the New Jersey state police to allow mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, which occurred 93 years ago. Researchers believe that saliva on the stamps and glue of the envelopes could help determine whether Bruno Hauptmann acted alone or with co-conspirators. Despite Hauptmann's conviction and execution, questions about his sole involvement have persisted, and researchers aim to access over a quarter-million documents and evidence items. The state police cite concerns about damaging the artifacts, but plaintiffs argue that the potential for clarifying the case justifies the testing.</p>

          <p>Steep tariffs on imports from China are raising costs for wedding dresses and threatening the small shops that sell them. The bridal gown and special occasion apparel business illustrates the damage duties can cause to small businesses ingrained in the global supply chain. An estimated 90% of wedding dresses are made in China, according to the National Bridal Retailers Association, though a growing number of brands have moved manufacturing to other parts of Asia, such as Myanmar and Vietnam. Some big names in bridal gowns have started an online petition, including Stephen Lang, the founder and CEO of Trenton, N.J.-based brand Mon Cheri.</p>

          <p>While stock markets provide one view of the economy, maritime traffic at ports like Los Angeles offers a more ominous perspective, as high tariffs on China disrupt supply chains. Cargo arrivals are expected to decline significantly, and the unpredictability of Trump's trade war has shaken global confidence in American economic policy. The logistics system is atrophying, leading to job losses and potential shortages. Unlike short-term shocks, the indefinite nature of the trade war is causing lasting damage to the economy.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how modern dating apps, despite their intent, can hinder genuine connection by providing too much information upfront, killing curiosity. Experts emphasize the importance of being curious about a date's life, thoughts, and emotions for a healthy relationship. Blind dates and relying on friends for setups can help maintain an air of mystery, and asking open-ended questions that encourage storytelling can spark engagement. The article suggests that the goal is to connect with another human as an end in itself, knowing someone simply to know them.</p>

          <p>Formula One racing's governing body, the FIA, is cracking down on drivers using profanity, leading to complaints about inhibited speech. Max Verstappen, a four-time world champion, expressed feeling unable to speak freely about penalties due to potential punishment for swearing. While the FIA considers easing the penalties, the situation raises questions about the balance between maintaining decorum and allowing drivers to express their emotions. The situation highlights the increasing sensitivity surrounding public discourse and the challenges faced by athletes in maintaining authenticity while adhering to regulations.</p>

          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, has stated that Japan will not strike a trade deal with the U.S. unless all tariffs are reviewed, highlighting a disagreement over which tariffs are negotiable. The U.S. is unwilling to back down from duties on automobiles, steel, and aluminum, while Japan seeks the elimination of these levies. The Japanese government is particularly concerned about the 25 percent duties targeting the auto industry. The announcement comes after Trump imposed tariffs on auto parts, further complicating trade relations.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, which is expected to increase prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier levies on imported cars. The move will have a broad impact, as even cars made in the U.S. often use imported components, and consumers will likely pay more for vehicles, contributing to overall inflation. While some companies may be exempt from a portion of the tariffs for two years, analysts predict car prices will still rise.</p>

          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) aims to reduce "elderspeak," a form of communication that sounds like baby talk and is often used with older adults, by educating caregivers to address older people as adults. Studies show that elderspeak, which includes inappropriate endearments and simplified language, can lead to resistance to care and other negative behaviors. The CHAT program has been shown to reduce the use of elderspeak and resistant behaviors in nursing homes. The article also emphasizes the importance of cultural sensitivity and open communication to ensure older adults are treated with respect.</p>

          <p>The Karen Read retrial, centered on the death of her boyfriend John O'Keefe, is underway with the same courtroom, judge, and many of the same players, but a different atmosphere. The retrial is shadowed by a botched police investigation and allegations of corruption, with the defense arguing that O'Keefe was killed inside a house party and the scene was staged. New to the case is special prosecutor Hank Brennan, who has the advantage of knowing the defense's arguments. The defense has also gained a new lawyer in Victoria George, who was an alternate juror in the first trial.</p>
