          <p>Poland initiated its presidential election amidst heightened security concerns due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and worries about the U.S.'s commitment to European security. The leading candidates include RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski, aligned with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and Karol Nawrocki, supported by the Law and Justice party. Polls suggest a likely runoff between Trzaskowski and Nawrocki, with a far-right candidate also potentially influencing the outcome.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed delaying the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charging current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027, citing budget deficits. These changes aim to address a $12 billion deficit attributed to President Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. The proposal would suspend access to comprehensive services for undocumented adults over 19, while those with "unsatisfactory" status would face monthly charges.</p>
