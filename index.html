          <p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko stated that Ukraine might have to cede territory to Russia for a temporary peace deal, amidst pressure from President Trump. This marks a significant shift in rhetoric from a senior Ukrainian politician, acknowledging a painful solution may be necessary. Klitschko also noted strained relations between Zelensky and Trump, suggesting sensitive discussions should occur privately, and emphasized his responsibility for the capital, which he described as the heart of the war-torn country. He also clarified that Zelensky is making the decision on peace terms himself, not involving the mayor in these discussions.</p>

          <p>Germany is contemplating phasing out 1 and 2-cent euro coins due to their limited economic value and the costs associated with their production and circulation. The National Cash Forum, supported by the Bundesbank, advocates for rounding cash payments to the nearest 5 cents, while electronic payments would remain precise. Several other European countries already employ similar rounding practices, and a Eurobarometer survey indicated support for eliminating these small denominations. While proponents highlight potential cost savings and environmental benefits, concerns remain about potential price increases and the gradual disappearance of cash.</p>

          <p>A debate is brewing over whether customers should tip at fast-food restaurants, with opinions divided on whether it's an obligation or a courtesy. Some argue that tipping should be tied to exceptional service, while others believe it's a polite gesture to appreciate the effort of workers. Etiquette experts note that tipping originated to ensure prompt service, but the practice has evolved, with some businesses now prompting customers to tip even for simple transactions. The discussion highlights the changing expectations surrounding tipping in the service industry.</p>

          <p>Apparel and textile executives in the US are expressing concerns over President Trump's tariffs on imported goods, warning that they will likely lead to higher prices for consumers and potential business failures. While supporting the goal of boosting domestic manufacturing, they argue that the tariffs are too broad and implemented too quickly, impacting not only finished goods but also essential supplies for US-based manufacturers. Concerns also exist about attracting American workers to clothing factories and the potential impact of immigration restrictions on labor shortages, which could hinder growth in the domestic apparel sector.</p>

Studies have shown that creatine can improve brain metabolism and ease depressive symptoms, particularly when used in conjunction with antidepressants and therapy. A recent study in India indicated that creatine could be helpful even without antidepressants. While researchers emphasize that the findings are preliminary, creatine's affordability and accessibility make it a promising option for improving mental health, but more research is needed.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly planning to move all iPhone production for the US market to India as it aims to reduce its reliance on China amidst trade tensions. The company intends to source over 60 million iPhones annually from India by the end of 2026. Apple has already been increasing production in India, with suppliers shipping nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the US in March. While the move would diversify Apple's supply chain, analysts do not expect iPhone production to return to the US due to cost considerations.</p>
