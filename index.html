          <p>A Los Angeles Police Department station in Pacoima was temporarily evacuated after a couple brought in military ordnance they discovered while cleaning a deceased relative's home. The bomb squad was called to assess the explosives, which were contained in a plastic box. After determining the items were safe to move, they were transported to a storage facility for collection by the U.S. military. The incident occurred shortly after three Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives were killed in a separate explosion involving explosives.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a new trade deal between the United States and the European Union, European leaders have offered their reactions. The agreement establishes a baseline 15% tariff on most EU goods, including automobiles, a rate higher than Europe's initial goal but lower than threatened levels. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof both acknowledged the deal provides stability and averts a more damaging trade conflict, though they conceded that a no-tariff scenario would have been preferable for their export-driven economies.

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, My Chemical Romance is performing its seminal 2006 album, "The Black Parade," in its entirety on a new stadium tour. A recent performance at Dodger Stadium showcased the band's enduring appeal, which is attributed to their theatricality and frank exploration of themes like depression and identity. The concert featured the full album performance, framed by a loose political satire, followed by a set of other fan-favorite songs. The review highlights the band's continued relevance and powerful connection with its large, dedicated fanbase.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his status as one of the sport's greats. Despite the final stage being neutralized for safety due to heavy rain, Pogačar characteristically launched an attack, though he did not win the stage itself. The 26-year-old finished the overall race 4 minutes and 24 seconds ahead of two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard. This victory marks another chapter in the intense rivalry between Pogačar and Vingegaard, who have finished first and second in the last five Tours.</p>

          <p>The England women's national team has won Euro 2025, retaining their European championship by defeating world champions Spain 3-1 on penalties after the final ended in a 1-1 draw. The victory marks the first time a nation has won back-to-back women's Euros since Germany's dominant run ended in 2013. England's path through the knockout stage was fraught with difficulty, with all three of their matches going to extra time. Captain Leah Williamson acknowledged they "rode their luck" but were deserving champions after a resilient tournament performance.</p>
