          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The beauty industry is increasingly targeting children and teens with skincare products, including those with potent ingredients like retinol. An article in Vox explores this trend, citing a significant rise in spending on skincare for young people and the influence of social media filters. Experts warn of potential physical harms, such as skin damage and allergies, as well as the psychological impact of internalizing exacting beauty standards and gender roles from a very young age. This cultural shift prompts a broader conversation about adult beauty standards and their effects on the next generation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed Yuliia Svyrydenko as the new prime minister, the first change in the role since Russia's full-scale invasion. The move is part of a significant government restructuring that also sees former Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal become the new defense minister. Svyrydenko, the former economy minister, is seen as a capable executive loyal to the president's office. The changes are viewed by some opposition figures as a consolidation of power by Zelenskyy during a critical period of the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>DeFi Development, a company focused on accumulating Solana (SOL), is launching an international expansion by franchising its treasury management model. The "DFDV Treasury Accelerator" initiative will allow partners to operate their own Solana treasuries with the company's support in exchange for an equity stake. This strategy, backed by investors like Pantera Capital, aims to evolve the crypto treasury model popularized by MicroStrategy's bitcoin investments. The company also plans to acquire validators to stake its SOL holdings, recently issuing guidance to reach 1 SOL per share by 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A satirical article from The Atlantic critiques the Department of Homeland Security's justification for detaining hundreds of individuals without criminal convictions in a new Florida facility. The piece lampoons the official statement that many non-criminals are actually "terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more" who simply lack a U.S. rap sheet. The author uses irony to highlight the logical fallacies and potential injustices of preemptively labeling and imprisoning people based on suspicion rather than evidence. The commentary suggests the government's actions create a self-fulfilling prophecy, defining people as criminals by the very act of placing them in a high-security prison.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Supreme Court Justices' Dissents Signal a Fundamental Shift in the Court's Dynamics</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the dissenting opinions from the Supreme Court's three liberal justices—Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—are doing more than just disagreeing with the conservative majority. Their writings increasingly suggest that the majority is no longer bound by established legal rules, precedent, or facts, effectively abandoning the traditional game of constitutional law. The dissents highlight the majority's alleged incoherence and complicity in wrongdoing, framing its decisions within larger systems of oppression. This shift in rhetoric signals a deep concern that the Court is operating as a political body rather than a legal one.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite an appearance of strength abroad, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is in a precarious position domestically, according to an analysis in The Atlantic. His coalition has effectively become a minority government after losing the support of two parties, leaving it unable to legislate and pushing Israel toward new elections. The unraveling is driven by two key conflicts: pressure to draft the ultra-Orthodox community into the military and demands from far-right partners to reject any Gaza ceasefire deal. Netanyahu is caught between these radical factions, the Israeli majority, and international pressure, forcing him to play for time to survive politically.</p>

          <p>An article in Vox argues that foldable smartphones, once seen as clunky novelties, are becoming an appealing evolution in a market dominated by static designs. Devices like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Flip series offer adaptable form factors, providing a smaller screen for basic tasks and a larger one for more immersive use. This design harkens back to the practicality of older flip phones while offering modern capabilities. As the industry seeks the next major innovation beyond the standard smartphone slab, foldables present a tangible bridge to the future, offering new ways for users to interact with their most essential gadget.</p>

The forward was a standout performer in the Bundesliga last season, scoring 15 goals and providing eight assists, demonstrating his ability as both a scorer and a creator. The potential transfer highlights the high-stakes summer transfer window, with Newcastle United having reportedly had a £70 million bid for the player rejected.</p>

          <p>Despite growing bipartisan calls to "release the Epstein Files," a full public disclosure of the investigation into the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein is improbable, according to a Vox analysis. The Department of Justice has a long-standing policy against releasing closed investigative files, which protects uncharged individuals but frustrates public demand for transparency. Attorney General Pam Bondi's conflicting statements and the administration's recent memo declaring the case closed have fueled conspiracy theories and criticism. The complex political dynamics, including President Trump's own past association with Epstein, create a situation where a complete release is unlikely, despite the intense public and political pressure.</p>

          <p>A Vox analysis indicates that the Trump administration is shifting its law enforcement priorities away from white-collar and corporate crime. This is evidenced by a series of presidential pardons for financial fraudsters, an executive order pausing enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and a decline in federal prosecutions of white-collar offenses. While the Department of Justice officially targets crimes that fit a national security narrative, such as those involving cartels, it appears less inclined to pursue corruption cases involving corporations or political allies. This approach contrasts sharply with the administration's tough-on-crime rhetoric concerning immigration and street-level offenses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's overhaul of the federal student loan system is raising concerns among consumer advocates that borrowers will face less affordable repayment options. The "big beautiful bill" has made the Biden-era SAVE plan defunct and will eventually limit new borrowers to just two repayment plans, including a new income-based option called RAP. Experts calculate that monthly payments under RAP will be significantly higher than under the previous SAVE plan. This shift is expected to increase the financial burden on borrowers and raise the risk of loan defaults for those who can no longer manage their monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>
