          <h2>London Talks on Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire Downgraded Amid Concession Speculation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 04:27:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine in London have been downgraded, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio no longer attending, signaling potential shifts in diplomatic strategy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected recognizing occupied Crimea as Russian territory, countering reports suggesting this concession might be on the table. Despite Putin's Easter weekend ceasefire claim, UK intelligence found no reduction in attacks, indicating stalled progress. The conflict, ongoing since 2014, has resulted in significant casualties and displacement, highlighting the urgent need for a resolution, though a concrete path forward remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk plans to decrease his involvement in the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) following a substantial drop in Tesla's profits and sales. Tesla reported a 20% decrease in car sales and a 70% drop in profits, attributing some of the decline to "changing political sentiment" and trade policies. Musk's political contributions to Trump's re-election have sparked protests and boycotts against Tesla. He has also clashed with Trump administration figures over trade policies, advocating for lower tariffs to support Tesla's global operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's review of US-funded international organizations is casting doubt on the US's future role in the IMF and World Bank, institutions vital for global financial stability. Project 2025, a hard-right Republican policy framework, proposes a US withdrawal from both, labeling them "expensive middlemen". A US exit could trigger liquidity crises, potentially benefiting China, which is expanding its global influence through alternative lending models.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents reportedly detained more than a dozen day laborers outside a Home Depot in Pomona, California. L.A.
