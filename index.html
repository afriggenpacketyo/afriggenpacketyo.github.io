          <p>A former waitress in Paris, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, reflects on a recent investigation by Le Parisien that confirmed tourists are often overcharged. Drawing from her own experiences on both sides of the service counter, she validates the existence of an unofficial "tourist tax" through tactics like upselling or charging for tap water. The article provides practical advice for travelers to avoid being ripped off, such as learning key French phrases, observing local customers, and carefully checking the bill before paying.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man allegedly stabbed eleven people in a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, leaving six in critical condition and five in serious condition. The attack, which occurred near the checkout area, appeared to be random, according to the Grand Traverse Sheriff's Office. A deputy arrived within three minutes of the 911 call and took the suspect into custody, with authorities crediting citizen involvement in apprehending the attacker. Governor Gretchen Whitmer called the incident a "brutal act of violence."</p>

          <p>Four individuals, including a married couple, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children aged 7 to 16. The victims were allegedly kept in plywood cages under bunk beds, beaten with canes, and sprayed with vinegar as punishment. According to the sheriff's office, the four adopted children in the home were treated unfairly compared to the biological children. The investigation began after a church member raised concerns, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has called for a confident retelling of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, reigniting a sensitive historical dispute with South Korea. The issue centers on the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms, which China claims as part of its history, while Korea knows them as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae and considers them part of its own heritage. The official's comments, linking this history to China's "century of humiliation," risk straining diplomatic ties by emphasizing a contested historical narrative.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly suppressing information about deadly mass attacks, such as vehicle rammings and stabbings, a shift from its previous practice of releasing basic details. This intensified censorship, which appears to have followed a particularly deadly attack in November, involves scrubbing photos and reports from the internet and releasing only vague police statements. This information control, aimed at preventing copycat crimes and local embarrassment, has led to public pushback online, with citizens demanding transparency and the truth about these incidents.</p>

The extreme heat, combined with strong winds and dry conditions, has fueled dozens of disastrous wildfires across the nation.
