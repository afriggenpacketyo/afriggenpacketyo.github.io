            <h2>Analysts Express Concern Over Trump's Trade Tactics Despite Temporary Tariff Pause</h2>

            <p>Analysts are warning against complacency despite President Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most nations, excluding China, indicating it's a tactical retreat rather than a shift in objectives. The move comes amid raised tariffs on Chinese imports, escalating the trade war between the two largest economies, which is expected to cause significant disruption to global supply chains. Experts highlight the potential for a much higher tariff world and express concerns over the impact on global economies, with one report suggesting China could halt exports to offset tariff burdens. This situation is described as chaotic and potentially damaging to businesses and consumers worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Newspaper front pages reflect on Donald Trump's decision to pause tariffs on most nations, while simultaneously increasing tariffs on China, which is interpreted differently across various publications. Some headlines suggest Trump is retreating, while others emphasize China's defiance and the potential for a trade war. The reports also cover King Charles III's visit to Italy and discussions about Brexit freedoms in light of global economic turmoil. Additionally, some papers discuss the possibility of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England and the impact of the trade war on supply chains.</p>

            <p>President Trump accidentally called his former national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, and proceeded to criticize him after realizing his mistake. The call was intended for South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. This incident occurred shortly after Trump publicly lambasted McMaster on social media for his skepticism about Trump's overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House declined to comment on the private call, but Trump's communications director issued a statement criticizing McMaster's book and reputation.</p>

            <p>With the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington, observers suggest that diplomatic backchannels could play a vital role in bringing the two leaders to the negotiating table.

            <p>China's consumer prices declined for the second consecutive month, while producer price deflation deepened, signaling rising deflationary pressures amid an escalating trade war with the U.S. The consumer price index slid 0.1% year on year in March, while producer prices fell 2.5%, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. Experts anticipate a divergence between consumer and producer prices due to trade disruption.

            <p>OpenAI has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, accusing him of an "unlawful campaign of harassment" and seeking punitive damages. The lawsuit claims Musk has used various means to harm OpenAI, including press attacks and a sham bid for the company's assets. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but later left, has been critical of its close alliance with Microsoft. OpenAI is asking the court to force Musk to cease his public attacks on the company.</p>

            <p>A group of UK MPs is calling for a levy on streaming services' revenue to fund British high-end TV production. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee suggests streamers pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance dramas with specific interest to British audiences. The report highlights the importance of distinctly British content and expresses concern that inward investment risks crowding out independent British producers. Netflix argues that levies diminish competitiveness and penalize audiences.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices fell in March as the trade war with the US intensifies, with US President Donald Trump imposing 125% import duties on Chinese goods. The national consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% year on year, reflecting the risk of deflation to the Chinese economy. Experts anticipate the trade war will intensify downward pressure on prices, leading the Chinese government to launch a stimulus to boost domestic demand and mitigate the deflationary pressure.

The decision was based on water testing and analysis conducted after the January Palisades fire. While the water is deemed safe, beachgoers are still cautioned to avoid fire-related debris. High tides can carry fire debris into the ocean, creating hazardous conditions, especially near burned properties.</p>
