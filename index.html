          <h2>Philippine Reforestation Program Faces Scrutiny Over Effectiveness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 15:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation reveals that the Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), intended to restore forests, is falling short of its goals due to deforestation events on NGP land and the prioritization of cash crops over native trees. Satellite data analysis indicates that deforestation occurs on some NGP sites, contradicting the program's aims. Communities with short-term land access are often compelled to grow single cash crops, leading to unsustainable practices and illegal logging. The program also struggles with poor site selection, limited community support, and weak long-term planning, hindering its effectiveness in regrowing native rainforests and achieving sustainable livelihoods for local communities. The NGP's complexity and lack of harvest rights frustrate communities, leading to illegal logging. </p>

U.S. Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff deemed Hamas' response "completely unacceptable," insisting on adherence to the U.S. framework proposal.

Experts emphasize the need for continuous rain to replenish groundwater levels, with concerns that summer rainfall will not be as effective. The country's water consumption is officially measured, but with climate change, water needs are predicted to increase, thus emphasizing water retention on land as a crucial solution. </p>

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned of an "imminent" threat posed by China to Taiwan, urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war. Hegseth accused China of seeking to become a "hegemonic power" and preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in Asia. In response, China accused the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace. The US aims to forge a strong shield of deterrence with allies to prevent war, emphasizing that "deterrence does not come cheap". </p>

          <p>The price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has risen at El Vacilon Grocery in Brooklyn due to soaring egg costs. Owners Freddy and Yovanna Melo had to increase the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, because egg prices more than doubled. The Melos closely monitor their costs and aim for a profit margin of 20-30 percent per item, necessitating price increases across the board. The bodega's revenue has declined over the years, but rental income from apartments above the store helps sustain the business. </p>

          <p>An expert argues that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism is misguided, contending that genetics play a more significant role. Kennedy, now leading the Department of Health and Human Services, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a research project to examine environmental suspects. However, scientists have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, supporting the theory that genetics are the most important driver. Researchers fear that Kennedy's fixation on toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of new therapies. </p>

Some doctors said there is no new evidence to support removing the recommendation that healthy pregnant women and healthy children should get the COVID vaccine.
