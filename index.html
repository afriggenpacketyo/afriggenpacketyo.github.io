            <h2>Trump Criticizes Fed Chair Powell Amid Interest Rate Debate</h2>

            <p>Former President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating Powell's "termination cannot come fast enough" due to his handling of interest rates. Trump believes Powell is too slow in lowering rates, contrasting the Fed's approach with the European Central Bank's rate cuts. Powell previously warned that Trump's tariff policies could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, further fueling the disagreement. Trump's comments underscore the ongoing tension between the executive branch and the independent Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren cautioned that the U.S. markets would face a "crash" if President Trump had the power to dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Warren, a frequent critic of Powell, emphasized the importance of the Fed's independence from political influence for maintaining market stability. She argued that allowing a president to arbitrarily control key economic levers would undermine the integrity of the U.S. economy, likening it to a dictatorship. Her comments came after Trump voiced his dissatisfaction with Powell's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is facing potential legal action if it fails to update its gender policies to align with a recent Supreme Court ruling. The ruling defines "woman" as biological sex under equalities law, potentially impacting single-sex spaces like hospital wards and changing rooms. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is set to provide updated guidance, expecting the NHS to revise its current practices of accommodating trans people based on dress, names, and pronouns. An NHS spokesperson stated the service is reviewing its guidance and will consider the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

            <p>The Texas Senate passed a bill that would ban most consumable hemp products containing THC, citing concerns about abuses and safety issues.

The author argues that Sanders is one of the most well-prepared quarterback prospects ever, having been mentored by his father, Deion Sanders, and other football experts.

            <p>Susanna Rustin argues that the UK Supreme Court's ruling, defining "sex" as biological sex under the Equality Act, is a significant step towards clarifying the gender debate and upholding the rights of women. The ruling, which favored For Women Scotland, has been praised for its emphasis on a consistent and predictable meaning of "sex" in the law. Rustin suggests that the ruling should bring an end to a wounding chapter in politics and promote a sharper awareness that equality law is always a balancing process. The ruling has given a voice to the women's movement in Britain.</p>

            <p>Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns that President Trump's tariff policies could lead to corruption and self-dealing within the administration. They argue that the implementation of new tariffs creates opportunities for undue influence and enrichment of administration officials and their allies. The Democrats have sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, requesting details on plans to prevent misuse of tariffs for personal gain. The effort is led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Judy Chu and Linda Sánchez.</p>

            <p>This article argues that the prolonged school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic were a foreseeable disaster, with damaging effects extending beyond loss of learning. The closures began with understandable panic, but continued despite evidence of the harm they were causing to children and families. The author points to academic literature from before the pandemic that warned of the potential social, economic, and political consequences of school closures. The article criticizes public health officials and teachers' unions for prioritizing fear over the well-being of children.</p>

            <p>The leader of the UK's largest teaching union, Daniel Kebede, has warned that teachers will rally against the Labour party if the government does not offer a fully funded, above-inflation pay rise. The National Education Union (NEU) is prepared to campaign in Labour constituencies and strike if its demands are not met. The government has recommended a 2.8% pay rise for teachers in England, which the NEU deems unacceptable. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that any industrial action would be indefensible.</p>

President Donald Trump rejected suggestions to use plastic eggs this year. The White House Easter Egg Roll tradition began in 1878 during Rutherford B. Hayes’s administration.

            <p>Turkey's central bank surprised markets by raising its key interest rate from 42.5% to 46%, ending its previous easing cycle. The decision comes amid economic disruption from U.S. tariffs and political turmoil following the arrest of Istanbul's mayor. The central bank cited the need to strengthen the disinflation process and maintain a tight monetary stance until price stability is achieved. The rate hike also aims to address foreign currency depletion and support the Turkish lira. (not investment advice)</p>
