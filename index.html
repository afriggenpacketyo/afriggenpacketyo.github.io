          <p>Republicans are pressing for a House vote on a domestic policy bill that would enact President Trump's agenda, but face divisions over tax cuts, Medicaid, and clean energy programs. The article reports that the legislation would slash taxes, steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement, and cut health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs to cover the cost. The bill is projected to cause millions of Americans to become uninsured. Republicans are using a special process known as budget reconciliation to push the package through Congress.</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that the Republican reconciliation bill, despite the current political climate, aligns with traditional Republican policies of tax cuts for the wealthy and spending cuts for the poor. The article reports that the bill's contents include trillions in tax cuts tilted towards the wealthy, hundreds of billions in spending cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps, and increased defense spending. The author contends that this pattern reflects the Republican party's economic and budgetary priorities since 1980, which have remained consistent despite deviations and strategic leaks.</p>
