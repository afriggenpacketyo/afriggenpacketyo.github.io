          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce announced that it is considering initiating trade negotiations with the United States after receiving repeated statements from senior US officials expressing a willingness to discuss tariff issues. The ministry spokesperson emphasized that for talks to be productive, the US must demonstrate sincerity by addressing its past wrong practices and removing all tariffs imposed on China. The spokesperson cautioned that China would not accept talks used as a cover for coercion or extortion, indicating a firm stance on fair and respectful negotiations. China's willingness to engage in discussions signals a potential shift in the ongoing trade war, contingent on the US taking concrete actions to build mutual trust. Optimism regarding a stable market as a result of the trade talks is moderate, but not insignificant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States' focus on 'beating China' is misguided and self-defeating, emphasizing that a clear alignment of purpose, goal, and means is essential for success in any conflict. The article criticizes the Trump administration's chaotic approach to trade relations with China, noting the lack of a coherent strategy. It points out that while Trump's approach may be extreme, fuzzy thinking regarding China is not unique to him. The article references a Democratic bill aimed at promoting trade and consumer protection between the US, Canada, and Mexico, suggesting that a more collaborative approach is needed rather than a combative one. While the topic is about trade, the author has an opinion about it, so the optimism score will be a neutral 50.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States held a second round of tariff talks, with discussions centered on Japan's proposals to increase imports of American agricultural products. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, aimed to narrow the scope of the talks and sought details about U.S. priorities. He was expected to urge the Trump administration to eliminate auto and other tariffs that have disrupted the global trading order. Akazawa offered a package of proposals, including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans, to help counteract the decline of U.S. exports to China. Japan is also considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The troubled rollout of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is complicating college acceptance for some seniors, with students facing delays, error messages, and glitches on the site. Unprecedented cuts to the Department of Education have further impacted the office responsible for managing FAFSA. Many students are struggling to navigate the system, leading to concerns that college dreams may be put on hold. Education equity groups are working to help underrepresented students, but the process remains grueling, with only 58% of eligible California high school seniors successfully submitting FAFSA applications. The situation is causing worry among students who rely on financial aid to complete their education.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz is departing from his role as National Security Advisor, with President Trump planning to nominate him as the U.N. Ambassador. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as the interim National Security Advisor.

While Trump respects Waltz, factors such as inadequate vetting of NSC staff and a lack of fit with the senior team contributed to the change. Waltz will face Senate confirmation for the ambassador role, with potential challenges due to the Signal incident.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton provides insights into President Trump's second term, describing it as incoherent and driven by a desire for attention. Bolton argues that Trump lacks a grand strategy and conceptual thinking, making his decisions reactive rather than philosophical. He points to instances of retribution and constitutional infringements, expressing concern for the state of the republic. However, Bolton believes that U.S. institutions are stronger than Trump and will ultimately prevail, tempering fears of an existential threat.

          <p>President Trump's approach to ending the war in Ukraine has shifted, with frustration now directed toward Vladimir Putin rather than Volodymyr Zelensky. After a tense meeting with Zelensky, Trump accelerated diplomacy with Putin, drafting a peace plan that offered major concessions to Moscow. However, Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin's demands, leading to a friendlier meeting with Zelensky at the Vatican. Analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions due to Trump's zigzagging approach and conflicting advice from aides. The article highlights the complexities of Trump's diplomacy and the challenges of achieving a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's state superintendent of schools, Ryan Walters, is at odds with Governor Kevin Stitt over a proposal requiring students to submit their immigration status during school enrollment. Walters intends to share the data with federal authorities, citing President Trump's executive order. However, Stitt believes the Trump administration is not requesting this information and has replaced three State Board of Education members in response. The governor is against gathering up 8-year-olds' immigration status. This disagreement highlights the tension between state and federal policies on immigration and the role of schools in enforcing them.</p>

          <p>Kohl's Corporation terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan for cause following an investigation that revealed violations of the company's conflict-of-interest policies.

Buchanan's dismissal requires him to forfeit his equity awards and repay a portion of his signing bonus. Michael Bender, the board chair, has been appointed as interim CEO.</p>

          <p>A federal report from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared that hormonal and surgical treatments for young people with gender dysphoria lack scientific evidence and expressed concerns about long-term harms. The report prioritized psychotherapy, an intervention that some equate with conversion therapy. Transgender rights advocates criticized the assessment as ideologically driven and misrepresenting the current medical consensus. The report may set the stage for additional restrictions on gender-affirming care and could be cited as justification for refusing to cover medical care for transgender young people.</p>

          <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks detailed the company's efforts to diversify its supply chain in response to President Trump's tariff hikes on China. Hasbro aims to shift 40% of its global sourcing out of China by the end of 2026, relocating manufacturing to countries including the U.S., Turkey, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. While China remains an important sourcing location, Hasbro expects to increase prices due to the tariffs. The company's sourcing flexibility and domestic revenue streams may help mitigate the impact on consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
