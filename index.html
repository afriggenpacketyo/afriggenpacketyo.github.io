            <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's plan to terminate the legal status of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who entered the U.S. legally under a Biden-era program. Judge Indira Talwani blocked the administration from revoking deportation protections and work permits, citing the lack of case-by-case justification for mass terminations. The ruling is a reprieve for over half a million migrants allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV policy, which the Biden administration argued dissuaded unlawful border crossings. The Trump administration has criticized the program, claiming it unleashed poorly vetted aliens into America. The ruling is another legal setback for the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle Biden-era immigration programs.</p>

            <p>Jordan Spieth expressed his frustration about not being able to openly discuss the impact of mud balls during the Masters Tournament. Spieth said that mud balls significantly affected his iron play, particularly on the 11th and 13th holes, but tournament organizers discourage public discussion about them. He noted that the course conditions, with the ball digging into the grain, exacerbate the issue. Spieth finished in a tie for 14th place at the Masters, attributing his struggles to the unpredictable nature of mud balls affecting his shots. Rory McIlroy won the Masters after defeating Justin Rose in a playoff.</p>

            <p>A federal judge is weighing a request to block President Trump's executive order targeting Susman Godfrey, the law firm representing Dominion Voting Systems. Susman Godfrey argues that the order, which seeks to restrict the firm's access to government buildings and contracts, is unconstitutional. The firm believes the order is retaliation for their work defending the integrity of the 2020 election and securing a settlement from Fox News over false claims about Dominion. Several major law firms have agreed to provide legal services to causes supported by Trump, while others are fighting the president's action in court.</p>

            <p>During Meta's antitrust trial with the FTC, an email from 2018 revealed that CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning off Instagram due to rising antitrust litigation concerns. Zuckerberg noted the possibility of forced separation of Instagram and WhatsApp and suggested that Instagram would be smaller if independent. The FTC alleges Meta monopolizes social networking through acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp and seeks to cleave the apps from Meta. Meta disputes the allegations, citing competition from rivals like TikTok and iMessage. The trial centers on whether Meta's acquisitions stifled competition in the social networking market.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's deportation efforts have expanded to include immigrants without serious criminal records, ensnaring individuals who believed they were not targets. Many of those affected have American-born children, pay taxes, and contribute to their communities. Despite promises to focus on criminals, ICE is arresting people who most Americans believe should be left alone. The deportation push is likely to intensify, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announcing that all immigrants without legal status must register with the government or face criminal consequences. The change has tempered support for Trump among some Republicans.</p>

Bukele's approach involves aggressive reactions to social crises and displays of strength, while Orbán uses subtle manipulation of laws to undermine democracy. Trump's policies blend both styles, but his strategic sloppiness could inflame resistance to his policies.

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is testifying in a landmark antitrust trial that could force the company to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC alleges that Meta maintained monopoly power by illegally acquiring rivals, suppressing innovation. Meta argues it faces competition from apps like TikTok and YouTube and that its investments fueled Instagram and WhatsApp's popularity. The outcome could disrupt Meta's ads business and reshape the social media landscape. Zuckerberg, who previously criticized Trump, has been trying to mend his relationship with the president.</p>

            <p>Despite Trump's recent actions that appear to defy a Supreme Court ruling, federal courts retain the power to constrain the administration's policies. A federal court could order the government to request the return of an individual wrongfully removed or impose sanctions for failing to take steps to procure their release. The courts could also ramp up pre-removal judicial review to prevent future cases of unlawful removal. The author argues that the case tests the rule of law and what the federal courts can do to prevent the government's actions.</p>

Legal experts have deemed the idea unconstitutional, but the White House stated it is a legal question the president is looking into.

Despite the increased choice, prospective buyers still face challenges due to the rising cost of renting and uncertainty over interest rates. Homes are also selling quickly, with sales agreed on half of homes within two months of listing.</p>
