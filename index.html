            <p>An immigration judge has ruled that Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported, siding with the Trump administration's claim that his presence threatens foreign policy. The ruling has sparked outrage from Khalil's supporters, who view it as a suppression of dissent and a violation of due process. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, was involved in protests against the war in Gaza and is accused of misrepresenting information on his green card application. His attorneys plan to appeal the decision, arguing that it infringes on his First Amendment rights. </p>

            <p>Following wildfires near Los Angeles, residents are crowdsourcing environmental testing data after insurers denied claims for smoke contamination testing. Many homes tested show elevated lead levels, prompting residents to create an online map to pressure insurance companies. The California Insurance Commissioner has urged insurers to thoroughly investigate smoke damage claims, but residents face challenges in getting coverage. This situation highlights the growing dispute over what fire damage insurance covers, especially when flames don't directly impact properties.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump underwent his annual physical examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, his first since beginning his second term. The White House press secretary stated that the president's physician will provide an update on the report in the interest of transparency, sharing as many results as possible. The public has not had a detailed look into Trump's health since 2018, when his physician reported him to be in excellent cardiovascular shape for his age, with only high cholesterol and being overweight as concerns. In July 2024, Trump sustained a gunshot wound to the ear at a campaign rally, but is reportedly recovering well.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate detained over his role in pro-Palestinian protests. The government cited a 1952 law claiming Khalil's presence poses unfavorable consequences for American foreign policy. The ACLU criticized the decision as "pre-written," noting the government's reliance on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Khalil's lawyers are challenging his arrest as unconstitutional in a separate federal court lawsuit.</p>

            <p>Facebook Marketplace has become a dominant force within the Facebook ecosystem, resembling a modern-day Craigslist with its focus on buying and selling used goods. The platform's success is attributed to factors such as supply chain disruptions and inflation, making used items more desirable. However, Facebook's primary function has shifted towards facilitating transactions rather than fostering genuine connections, with the platform heavily reliant on advertising and data collection. Despite this, community-driven initiatives like Buy Nothing groups offer a glimpse of genuine connection and mutual aid, highlighting the potential for social media to foster positive interactions.</p>

            <p>U.S. companies are responding to the Trump administration's tariffs by implementing "tariff surcharges" and raising prices on consumer goods. Some businesses are transparently adding the surcharge to customer's bills, while others are using the situation to promote pre-tariff sales. The tariffs are injecting uncertainty into the marketplace, leading consumers to stockpile necessities and accelerate purchases. The situation is evolving as the U.S. and China continue to engage in a trade war.</p>

The VA's return-to-office directive is causing panic and uncertainty among mental health clinicians, who fear they will be unable to provide quality care in an environment without guaranteed privacy. A memo obtained by NPR instructs therapists to inform patients that they cannot guarantee complete confidentiality due to shared office spaces. The American Psychological Association has criticized the policy, warning it could compromise access to care and ethical standards.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing significant budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), potentially impacting research, fisheries services, and satellite technology. The proposed cuts would slash NOAA's research operations budget by nearly 75% and eliminate funding for climate and weather research. These changes could significantly hinder the agency's ability to provide critical weather forecasting and climate research, as well as manage the country's ocean fisheries. The budget for the National Weather Service would remain intact.</p>
