          <h2>Republicans Aim to Dismantle Key Aspects of Biden's Climate Bill to Finance Trump's Tax Cuts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are pushing a tax bill that would significantly reduce climate-related funding and ease regulations, aiming to use the savings to finance President Trump's tax cuts. This legislation targets core climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, potentially impacting renewable energy projects, manufacturing, and electric vehicle adoption. The proposed cuts have sparked concerns from environmental groups and renewable energy companies, who argue that these measures could hinder the growth of clean energy industries and disrupt investments already underway, particularly in Republican districts where much of the IRA spending is directed. The bill's future in the Senate remains uncertain, with some Republicans expressing reservations about repealing tax credits that support renewable energy development. The cuts would include $6.5 billion of unspent Inflation Reduction Act funding that is earmarked for the Environmental Protection Agency's Green House Gas Reduction Fund, clean pollution reduction, clean ports, and environmental justice grants.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's capital markets are experiencing a resurgence, with Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, China's largest pharmaceutical company, initiating a billion-dollar IPO. The company aims to raise HK$9.89 billion (US$1.27 billion) through a share sale, signaling renewed confidence in the city's financial landscape. This development follows a period of market stagnation, with the total market capitalization of Hong Kong-traded stocks increasing significantly compared to the previous year. The IPO reflects positive earnings reports from some firms amidst ongoing US-China trade dynamics. Hengrui's earnings surged in 2024, and the IPO price offers a discount to attract investor interest in the offshore listing.</p>

          <p>This article charts the numerous unsuccessful attempts to establish a lasting ceasefire in Ukraine since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Despite efforts from Ukraine, European nations, and the United States, none have resulted in a sustained peace. The article details broken agreements like the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk agreements, alongside short-term ceasefires that collapsed quickly. Recent proposals, including one by Vladimir Putin, have been met with skepticism due to prior breaches of agreements. The history of failed ceasefires highlights the ongoing challenges in resolving the conflict, with both sides accusing each other of violations.</p>

          <p>US lawmakers are contemplating a restructuring of the State Department to better align economic and foreign policy objectives, as major economies begin to circumvent the United States due to Washington's deviation from established global trading rules.

The committee aims to draft legislation addressing concerns that economic security and policy are integral to foreign policy.

Two UK academics identified the document as one of the world's most valuable documents, highlighting its significance in constitutional history. The professors believe the document originated from Appleby, Cumbria, tracing its ownership through the Lowther family and abolitionist Thomas Clarkson before its auction at Sotheby's.

The expert found broken glass, scratches, and a dent on Read's SUV, along with blood and debris from O'Keefe's clothes, but the substance collected in the cups, described as "red-brown," was not identified as blood. The defense could request testing of the swabs if they still exist, while a retired NYPD investigator criticized the police for not properly collecting and documenting evidence. Read is charged with second-degree murder, drunk driving manslaughter, and fleeing the scene, but her lawyers argue she never hit O'Keefe.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has commenced exploring options for its China business, including a potential stake sale, as growth in the region faces macroeconomic and competitive pressures. The company has contacted private equity firms and technology companies to gauge interest and solicit views on expanding its presence in China. The transaction could value Starbucks' Chinese assets at several billion dollars. Starbucks, with over 7,750 stores in China, faces increasing competition from domestic players like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee.</p>

The votes in three key committees were crucial for the "big beautiful bill" Republicans aim to pass before the Memorial Day recess. The measure would extend Trump's 2017 tax cut and enact pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. However, Republican leaders face internal dissent that could delay or derail passage, with concerns about Medicaid cuts and the state and local tax deduction cap.</p>

However, these gains are threatened by proposed budget cuts to federal health programs. The data was released as Mr. Trumpâ€™s health secretary, Robert F.
