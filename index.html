          <p>Following the US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, China has called for de-escalation and adherence to international law, criticizing the US and Israel for exacerbating tensions. Chinese UN ambassador Fu Cong emphasized the importance of civilian safety and expressed concern over the impact on nuclear non-proliferation. While the UN Security Council discussed the conflict, divisions emerged along geopolitical lines, with China and Russia defending Iran and the US and its allies supporting Israel. China believes that the international community must uphold justice and restore peace and stability in the region. Optimism is tempered by the escalating conflict and the potential for further instability.</p>

          <p>A bride was fatally shot during her wedding night in Goult, near Avignon, France, after masked gunmen opened fire on the wedding party. The groom and a 13-year-old child were seriously wounded, and one suspected attacker was killed in an apparent exchange of fire. Authorities have launched a manhunt for the remaining suspects, with French media suggesting the violence may be linked to drug-related score-settling.

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan faces the potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. Amidst intensifying Sino-U.S. rivalry, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo, with announcements potentially coinciding with high-level bilateral talks. While pandas have historically symbolized friendship and brought economic benefits, their diplomatic weight may be diminishing. Some experts believe China's agreement with Tokyo to resume importing Japanese marine products signals efforts to improve relations, which a new panda allocation could support.</p>

However, ICE is expected to take Abrego Garcia into custody, potentially leading to his deportation before the trial. The judge acknowledged that determining Abrego Garcia's release is "little more than an academic exercise" due to ICE's likely involvement, but emphasized his right to the presumption of innocence. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges, which his attorneys argue are an attempt to justify the deportation mistake.</p>

These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, parents should explain their reasoning, give children agency, and validate their emotions. By shifting to language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, cooperation becomes more natural, fostering respect and emotional safety.</p>

          <p>Following US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial global trade passage connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil daily. Iran controls the northern side of the strait, making it a vital oil chokepoint. Interference with oil flows could disrupt international energy markets and economies, potentially driving up oil and gas prices.</p>

          <p>New satellite photos reveal the aftermath of US military strikes on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility and two other key locations in Iran's nuclear program. The stealth mission, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," involved B-2 Spirit bombers dropping multiple 30,000-pound "bunker-buster" bombs. Satellite images show damage to the mountainside where the underground nuclear site at Fordo is buried, with several large diameter holes or craters visible. At Isfahan, satellite images show extensive building damage, and at Natanz, a hole is visible directly over part of the underground military complex.</p>

Over 75 precision-guided weapons were used, and initial assessments indicate severe damage to all three sites.

Chinese consumers are drawn to EVs due to their affordability and environmental benefits, with government support making them financially attractive.
