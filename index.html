          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:00:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is introducing a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for nonimmigrant visa applicants, effective from fiscal year 2025. This fee is in addition to existing visa charges and is intended to be reimbursed if travelers comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, significant questions remain about the implementation and reimbursement process, with the U.S. Travel Association highlighting a lack of clarity. Immigration experts are advising clients to consider the fee nonrefundable due to the expected difficulty in getting money back from the government.</p>

          <p>A U.S. envoy has announced that Israeli and Syrian leaders have agreed to a ceasefire, with backing from Turkey and Jordan. The agreement follows recent Israeli airstrikes in Damascus, which Israel stated were to defend the Druze minority in southern Syria. The new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are party to the truce. The U.S. envoy also called for all factions in Syria to lay down their arms to build a new, united national identity.</p>

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the Department of Justice has filed a motion to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The request cites significant public interest and a commitment to transparency, while also promising to redact victim-related and other personal identifying information. This move comes after criticism from conservatives over the administration's initial decision not to release further files. The filing asks the court to release transcripts from both the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's training facility in East Los Angeles has killed three deputies, marking the deadliest day in the department's modern history. The deputies, who were part of the Arson-Explosives Detail, were handling an explosive device when it detonated. This incident follows other fatal training accidents, including a deputy's death from burns in a 2023 shooting range fire, which has led to a lawsuit and safety violation fines. The investigation into the latest explosion is expected to take months.</p>

Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter, which the paper described as featuring a drawing of a nude woman.

While many people dislike wasps, experts emphasize their crucial role as apex predators and natural pest controllers in the ecosystem. Unlike many other insect species facing declines, the common wasp population has remained stable. To coexist peacefully, people are advised not to swat at them and can distract them with a small offering of something sweet away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>A new study has identified a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. Researchers found that a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria over-activates an immune protein called STING in individuals with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene. This gene normally acts as a brake on the immune system, but when it fails, it leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The discovery could lead to more precise, personalized therapies for the disease, moving beyond broad immune-suppressing treatments.</p>

          <p>A new documentary from Spanish director Albert Serra, "Afternoons of Solitude," provides a stark and immersive look into the world of bullfighting, following star matador Andrés Roca Rey. The film avoids contextualizing or judging the controversial tradition, instead using a minimalist, observational style to capture both its ornate rituals and its gruesome reality. The review praises the film for its unflinching honesty in depicting the elemental and brutal contest between man and beast. It is described as a spellbinding work that intertwines meditation with the obscene realities of the spectacle.</p>

          <p>A prisoner swap involving the United States, Venezuela, and El Salvador has resulted in the freedom of ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela. In exchange, El Salvador repatriated 252 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. and held in a high-security Salvadoran prison. One of the freed Americans was identified as former Navy SEAL Wilbert Joseph Castaneda. The complex deal, which also saw the release of some Venezuelan political prisoners, was described by U.S. officials as a "down-to-the-wire" humanitarian agreement.</p>

          <p>Golfer Shane Lowry received a two-stroke penalty during the second round of The Open after officials determined his ball moved during a practice swing in the rough. Lowry maintained that he did not see the ball move, but accepted the penalty to avoid being labeled a cheat. The R&A, the sport's governing body, explained that video evidence showed the ball's movement was discernible to the naked eye and caused by the player's actions. The penalty changed Lowry's score on the 12th hole from a five to a seven, significantly impacting his position.</p>

          <h2>Public Media Leaders Warn of Devastating Impact from Federal Funding Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 18:03:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congress has approved a proposal to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS stations. Media leaders and filmmakers like Ken Burns warn the cuts will be devastating, forcing many local stations, particularly in rural areas, to reduce programming or shut down entirely. While larger urban stations are less dependent on federal money, they will also face significant budget shortfalls, leading to layoffs and fewer local news operations. The move fulfills a long-standing goal of conservatives who have criticized public media for a perceived liberal bias.</p>

          <p>Facing stiff competition in the AI race, Meta is restructuring its efforts by launching a new division, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), and hiring top researchers. Despite early investments in its FAIR research lab, Meta has fallen behind competitors like OpenAI and Google in developing advanced, consumer-facing AI models. The new strategy, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, aims to build "personal superintelligence for everyone," though it may also serve to enhance user engagement on its existing social media platforms. The company is also reportedly reconsidering its commitment to open-sourcing its most powerful models.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reassigning Vice Adm. Yvette Davids, the first woman to lead the U.S. Naval Academy, after about 18 months in the role. She is being succeeded by Marine Corps Gen. Michael Borgschulte, marking the first time a Marine will lead the institution. While officials stated the move was not a dismissal, it is part of a series of leadership changes under the Trump administration that have seen the removal of several high-ranking women and people of color. Davids has been nominated for a senior position on the chief of naval operations staff.</p>
