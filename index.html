          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a previous ruling that held former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. liable for damages related to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that the executives could not have foreseen the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 decision which ordered them to pay approximately 13 trillion yen in compensation. Separately, the Japanese government approved a 20 trillion yen plan to enhance disaster resilience across the country's infrastructure over the next five years, focusing on measures to address aging infrastructure. These measures are aimed at improving the country's readiness for future disasters.</p>

The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, a decrease from the 8.2% average in the first quarter of 2025.

Robert Agius and Jamie Vella were convicted of complicity in the murder, joining the three hitmen already sentenced for carrying out the bombing. The prosecution's key witness was Vince Muscat, who testified against Agius and Vella in exchange for a reduced sentence in this case and a pardon for a separate murder. The murder of Caruana Galizia, who reported on corruption within Malta's elite, drew international condemnation, and the Caruana Galizia family stated that the convictions brought them a step closer to justice.</p>

          <p>A security guard was shot and wounded during a struggle in the emergency room of Evanston Hospital, located in a suburb north of Chicago.

The man agreed to be checked out by paramedics and taken to the hospital, where he later became agitated during the intake process. During a struggle, the man lunged for his belongings, and an unknown number of shots were fired, wounding a security officer, and a handgun was recovered at the scene.</p>

          <p>Roads, railways, and bridges are increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat, leading to failures and disruptions in transportation. Rising temperatures cause asphalt to melt, rail tracks to buckle, and bridge joints to expand, necessitating adaptation strategies. Solutions include heat-reflective coatings for roads, lighter-colored pavements, and the use of more heat-resistant materials in railway construction. Bridges are being redesigned with better expansion joints and stronger bearings to withstand temperature fluctuations, ensuring the longevity and safety of critical infrastructure.</p>

This misunderstanding of AI can lead to dangerous relationships with machines that only seem to have ideas or emotions. The rise of AI therapists and AI companions raises concerns about replacing genuine human relationships with digital proxies, which could exacerbate social alienation and undermine the value of human connection.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has acknowledged conducting a strike on the al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, which resulted in at least one Palestinian death and injuries to 30 others. The admission came after an investigation by BBC Verify, which identified the strike in Khan Younis. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attributed the incident to "technical and operational errors," stating that troops had fired towards a target but the artillery deviated and wrongfully hit the Mawasi area. The strike impacted an area where displaced Palestinians were sheltering.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has called for Donald Trumpâ€™s impeachment and claimed the president was part of Jeffrey Epsteinâ€™s alleged child sexual assault ring, leading to an extraordinary social media exchange. Trump responded by threatening to end federal contracts and tax subsidies for Muskâ€™s companies. The feud originated from disagreements over a Republican spending bill that Musk criticized. The conflict caused Teslaâ€™s shares to plunge by about 14.2% at market close after the pair traded barbs.</p>
