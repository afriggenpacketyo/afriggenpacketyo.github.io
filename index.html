          <p>Meta has introduced its latest advancements in wearable technology with the launch of several new smart glasses, developed in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The flagship product is the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature a small digital display controlled by hand gestures via a neural wristband. The company also released the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard for athletes and an updated $379 Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) with improved battery life and a higher-resolution camera. These releases represent Meta's continued push into the augmented reality space, bridging the gap between audio-only glasses and more advanced AR headsets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has published a report strongly refuting the current administration's efforts to downplay climate change dangers, stating the evidence is "beyond scientific dispute." The report directly challenges the EPA's move to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," which classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat under the Clean Air Act. The Academies assert that scientific understanding of climate threats has only strengthened since 2009, warning that climate-induced harm will worsen without action. This scientific consensus is echoed by congressional Democrats who argue repealing the finding would be unlawful and harmful.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's show has been pulled off the air indefinitely by ABC following remarks he made about the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In his monologue, Kimmel criticized what he called the "MAGA gang" for attempting to score political points from the tragedy. The decision by ABC came after Nexstar Media, a major owner of TV stations, announced it would stop airing the program, calling the comments offensive. The move also drew praise from President Trump and the FCC chair, who had urged Disney to take action against the host for his controversial statements.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming book, former Vice President Kamala Harris reveals that her initial choice for a running mate in the 2024 election was Pete Buttigieg. She writes that she ultimately decided against it, believing it would be "too big of a risk" for a Black woman to run on a ticket with a gay man, despite considering him an "ideal partner." Harris instead selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and the ticket went on to lose to Donald Trump. This candid admission highlights the complex calculations of identity politics within the Democratic party as it looks toward future elections.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region had a mixed opening after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented an anticipated interest rate cut on Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell characterized the move as a "risk management cut," with the central bank signaling two additional cuts may occur by year's end. While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, Australia's ASX/S&P 200 declined, reflecting varied investor sentiment across the region. The decision comes as the Bank of Japan begins its own policy meeting, where it is expected to hold its rates steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day through their diet of fermented fruit. Researchers from UC Berkeley measured the ethanol content in figs and plum-like fruits eaten by the primates, finding an average alcohol content of about 0.3% by weight. While this steady, low-dose exposure is not enough to cause intoxication, it supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors, who were drawn to the scent of ethanol in ripe fruit.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is calling on the City Council to pass "Ryder's Law," legislation aimed at phasing out the horse-drawn carriage industry. The proposed law would halt the issuance of new licenses and increase regulations on existing ones, effectively sunsetting the practice. The renewed push follows the recent on-street death of a 15-year-old carriage horse named Lady and a 2022 incident where another horse, Ryder, collapsed in Midtown. The Transport Workers Union, which represents the drivers, strongly opposes the ban, with its president accusing the mayor of lying about the animals' treatment.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep its key interest rate at 4% during its upcoming meeting on Thursday. This follows a cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe that with UK inflation still at 3.8%, nearly double the 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk further cuts this year. The decision in the UK will come a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve chose to cut its own interest rates, highlighting differing economic pressures faced by the two central banks.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that the move does not fundamentally alter major market themes. He argued that the quarter-point cut was widely anticipated and that investors should not make significant portfolio changes based solely on Fed statements. Cramer noted that the mixed market reaction, with the Dow up slightly but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down, may have been due to some investors hoping for a more aggressive cut. He suggested that key sectors like technology and banking remain well-positioned. (not investment advice)</p>

According to an affidavit, Rogers admitted to making the video but claimed it was a "joke" sent to a small group of people.

          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has cut its base interest rate for the first time in 2025, lowering it by 25 basis points to match the recent rate reduction by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The move is intended to reduce funding costs for businesses and ease the financial burden on mortgage holders in the city. The Fed's decision was prompted by signs of a weakening labor market in the U.S., according to Chairman Jerome Powell. This initial cut is widely seen by market analysts as the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle that could continue into the next year. (not investment advice)</p>

Pittman was convicted for the 1990 murders of his estranged wife's parents and sister, after which he set their house on fire. In his final words, Pittman maintained his innocence, stating he was an innocent man being murdered by the state. His recent appeals, which were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court, focused on claims of intellectual disability that his lawyers argued should have made his execution unconstitutional.
