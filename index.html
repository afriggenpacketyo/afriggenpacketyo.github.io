          <p>The article details the legal saga of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man who was granted U.S. protection from deportation after fleeing gang violence. Despite a judge's order, the Trump administration mistakenly deported him to El Salvador, leading to a court battle for his return. Upon being brought back to the U.S. in June, he was immediately arrested on human smuggling charges. In the latest development, he now faces the threat of deportation to Uganda, a country with which he has no known connection, underscoring the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel experienced a sharp decline in its stock value, losing nearly $100 million in market capitalization after unveiling a new, more modern logo. The redesign, which removes the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel, is part of a broader effort to refresh the brand's image but has drawn criticism from some commentators and marketing experts. While the company stated its core values remain unchanged, the negative market reaction highlights investor concern over the strategic shift and the potential alienation of its traditional customer base.

The test reportedly demonstrated the "superior combat capability" of the improved weapon systems, though specific details about the missiles were not disclosed. This latest military action occurs amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, coinciding with joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang has repeatedly condemned as hostile and confrontational.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Announces Plans to Overhaul Asylum Appeals System</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce delays and decrease the number of migrants housed in hotels. A new independent body with adjudicators will be created to hear cases more quickly, as the current average wait time for an appeal is over a year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the goal is to end "unacceptable delays" for those appealing rejected applications. This move comes amid public protests and legal challenges from local councils regarding the use of hotels for asylum seeker accommodation.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy received a written warning from the country's Environment Agency for fishing without a license during a recent visit with US Vice President JD Vance. The incident occurred at Lammy's country estate, where the two held a bilateral meeting and a photo opportunity by a river. Lammy, who called the situation an "administrative error," belatedly purchased a license and reported himself to the agency. This action allowed him to avoid a potential fine of nearly $4,000 for the infraction.</p>

          <p>The immigrant population in the United States has decreased by more than one million people since January, reversing a growth trend of over 50 years. A new study by the Pew Research Center found that the number of immigrants dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including asylum restrictions enacted by the previous administration and the Trump administration's 181 executive actions targeting immigration and promoting mass deportations, altering the nation's demographic landscape.</p>

          <p>At the closed Marineland Antibes park in France, trainers are sexually stimulating an 11-year-old male orca named Keijo to prevent him from inbreeding with his mother, Wikie. The park shut down in January ahead of a new law banning whale shows, but the two orcas remain in limbo as authorities and activists have not agreed on a rehoming plan. While the park defends the practice as necessary to relieve Keijo's sexual urges and prevent aggression, animal rights activists have condemned it as a "perverse new low" for the captivity industry.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma coastal resort, but so far only organized Russian tour groups are permitted to visit the tightly controlled destination. Tourists describe an experience flanked by guides and security guards, with rules against photographing certain sites and interacting with locals. Despite the restrictions, visitors noted the pristine, nearly empty beaches of the resort, which was built near a missile testing site. This limited tourism reflects Pyongyang's strategy of generating revenue while minimizing foreign influence on its population.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered a halt to all work on the Revolution Wind project, an offshore wind farm off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut that was nearly 80% complete. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited the need to review the project for "the protection of national security interests," following a presidential order to re-examine existing wind energy leases. The Democratic governors of both states have vowed to fight the decision, which they and other critics have labeled as a corrupt move to favor the fossil fuel industry.</p>

The project, a collaboration between Madurai Kamaraj University and Face Lab in the UK, aims to understand the appearance of early inhabitants of a southern Indian urban civilization. The reconstructions reveal features predominantly of Ancient Ancestral South Indians, but also traces of Middle-Eastern and Austro-Asiatic ancestries. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of India's diverse and complex heritage.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have both been denied parole in their first eligibility hearings. The proceedings were marked by drama when an audio recording of Erik's hearing was inadvertently released by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, nearly derailing Lyle's subsequent hearing. The brothers' attorneys and family members reacted with anger to the release, calling it a violation of their privacy. The parole board ultimately rejected both petitions, with the brothers eligible to apply again in three years.</p>

          <p>Major European parcel carriers, including DHL and the national post offices of the UK, France, and Spain, are temporarily halting some shipments to the United States. The suspension is a response to the Trump administration's decision to end the "de minimis" rule, which allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. The postal services cite ambiguity in the new policies and an "extremely limited timeframe" to implement the necessary logistical systems for collecting customs duties and transmitting new data to U.S. authorities.</p>

Despite initial fears, retail executives have adopted a more measured tone, indicating that while costs are rising, they have so far blunted the most severe effects through various mitigation efforts.
