          <p>Prosecutor Maggie Cleary has been removed from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, marking the latest sign of upheaval within this high-profile Justice Department outpost. This office recently brought charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both of whom are known political adversaries of President Trump, who had publicly urged their investigation. Cleary's removal follows the resignation of a former acting U.S. Attorney amid concerns he could be fired, and the dismissal of two other high-level prosecutors. The situation has raised significant questions about political influence over federal prosecutions and the department's ability to maintain its independence, especially given the office's involvement in sensitive national security cases.</p>

          <p>Members of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber team have shared details of Operation Midnight Hammer, a successful 36-hour mission in June that struck three Iranian nuclear facilities. President Trump announced an order for 28 new B-2 bombers, emphasizing their critical role in U.S. air defense due to their unique combination of long-range, high payload, and stealth capabilities. Commanders lauded the mission's flawless execution, highlighting the deployment of Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs specifically designed for deep underground targets. This operation, which involved stealth fighter escorts into advanced enemy airspace, underscored the B-2's strategic importance and the military's confidence in its advanced capabilities against sophisticated threats.</p>

          <p>Instagram, through its parent company Meta, is implementing new content restrictions for teen accounts, aligning them with PG-13 movie ratings to ensure age-appropriate content by default. These automatic protections, set to be fully implemented by the end of the year, will block search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore" and prevent users under 18 from following or interacting with accounts posting age-inappropriate material. Opting out of the 13+ setting will require parental permission, and a "Limited Content" option offers even stricter filtering. This initiative aims to reassure parents and provide teens with a safer, more controlled online experience, also applying to AI interactions to avoid age-inappropriate responses.</p>

          <p>The ceasefire brokered by President Trump in Gaza continues to hold, bringing mixed emotions of joy and pain as living Israeli hostages and some deceased remains were returned in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. However, significant unresolved issues persist, including the urgent need for increased humanitarian aid into Gaza, which multiple organizations, including the Red Cross, are demanding through open border crossings. The return of only four deceased Israeli hostage remains, with 24 still outstanding, has become a critical sticking point, with Israel warning of consequences if Hamas fails to fulfill its agreement. The international community emphasizes the immense work required for lasting peace and rebuilding the devastated Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department revoked six visas from individuals across various countries, including Argentina and Germany, citing their social media comments celebrating the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. The department asserted that the United States is not obligated to host foreigners who express such sentiments, vowing to remove those who take advantage of American hospitality while celebrating the death of its citizens. This action coincided with President Donald Trump posthumously awarding Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, where he condemned "radical left violence" and blamed it for the assassination. Trump also announced an order classifying the Antifa movement as a terrorist group, linking it to the violence.</p>

These officers, including those from the FBI, DEA, and Border Patrol, are classified as "essential" and are currently required to report for duty without compensation. President Trump has already directed the Pentagon to utilize existing defense research and development funds to pay military personnel. Furthermore, officials are looking into using tariff revenue to fund critical programs like the Special Supplementation Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), although the National WIC Association warns this is not a permanent solution to the ongoing financial uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new tariffs on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets, and lumber have officially taken effect, imposing additional costs that economists predict will largely be absorbed by American consumers and businesses. These levies, ranging from 10% to 50%, were implemented to protect U.S. manufacturing and prevent foreign products from "flooding" the market. However, analyses, including one by Goldman Sachs, suggest consumers will ultimately bear approximately 55% of these added expenses, with businesses covering 22%. While the White House asserts tariffs stimulate domestic supply chains and benefit the economy, critics warn these measures are likely to increase prices for household goods and contribute to broader inflation, particularly for home building and remodeling projects.

The "Melodies for Mums" program, which incorporates lullabies, folk, and gospel songs, has shown to significantly reduce symptoms, with improvements lasting up to six months post-intervention. Researchers suggest the benefits stem from enhanced social connection among peers and the inherent relaxing effect of singing itself, with early cortisol measurements indicating reduced stress levels.

          <p>OpenAI is making an aggressive pivot towards vertical integration, aiming to control every aspect of its business from core models to infrastructure and hardware, a strategy reminiscent of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. The company has partnered with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators and plans to deploy them by late 2026, gaining deeper control over its technology stack. This move, part of the "Stargate" campaign, also includes massive investments with Nvidia and AMD, totaling hundreds of billions, and the acquisition of Jony Ive's startup to explore AI-native consumer devices. OpenAI's rapid expansion seeks to establish it as the dominant leader in the evolving AI ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler, plans to invest $13 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations over the next four years, creating over 5,000 new jobs and increasing domestic production by 50%. This substantial investment, part of CEO Antonio Filosa's turnaround strategy, will bring new vehicles to plants across Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. While President Trump's tariffs aim to boost U.S. manufacturing, Filosa downplayed them as the primary driver, emphasizing the company's long-term planning for growth in the largest market it operates. The plan includes a midsize truck for Toledo and new Jeep vehicles for Belvidere, marking a significant commitment to expanding the company's American footprint. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold recently surged to a historic high of $4,000 an ounce, marking its best year since 1979, a period also characterized by instability and recession. This "ominous" gold rush is driven by widespread geopolitical turmoil, a weakening U.S. dollar, and persistent inflation, leading investors to seek safe-haven assets. Central banks, especially in emerging markets, are also increasing gold purchases to insulate themselves from potential U.S. policy shocks, like those seen during President Trump's tariff sprees. The rally reflects a "Debasement Trade" as some investors lose trust in the dollar's stability and central bank governance, creating a bifurcated market where both gold and stock prices are rising due to differing investor outlooks.

The EU's concerns underscore a broader challenge for established markets navigating China's highly competitive industrial growth.

Since then, he has publicly demonstrated his changed allegiance, wearing rival Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers jerseys while the Brewers faced those teams in high-stakes postseason games.
