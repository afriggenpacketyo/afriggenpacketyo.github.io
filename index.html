          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck Tennessee on Saturday morning, with tremors felt in Atlanta, Georgia, and western North Carolina. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake originated about 12 miles from Greenback, Tennessee, which is south of Knoxville. Residents reported feeling the shaking, and while earthquakes are not uncommon in the region, this event reminded many of a similar quake in 2018. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast, extending across parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, during a joint visit to Kyiv, urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening further sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain emphasized that this effort, coordinated with the White House, presents Putin with an opportunity to demonstrate his commitment to peace. The European leaders' visit occurred shortly after Russia's celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, highlighting the shifting geopolitical landscape and the weakening of the trans-Atlantic bond since President Trump took office. Ukraine finds itself between an emboldened Russia and a Europe attempting to fill the void left by the United States.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Investing Club addresses the question of whether retirees should remain in the stock market, advising that pulling out entirely may not be the best approach. Jim Cramer suggests staying the course with good stocks to avoid missing upside recoveries, while tailoring a strategy to individual risk tolerance and liquidity needs. The article also explains the terms 'risk on' and 'risk off,' describing how investor sentiment and economic factors influence market behavior. Ultimately, Cramer cautions against making investment decisions solely based on risk-on or risk-off mindsets, instead focusing on investing in best-of-breed companies with solid management and long-term growth.</p>

          <p>A creative writing instructor describes the impact of losing her classroom at a Maine correctional center after the federal government revoked funding due to the state's policy of housing a transgender woman in a women's facility. The instructor highlights the transformative power of writing for incarcerated women, providing them a space to reclaim their identities and heal from trauma. The loss of funding has resulted in the suspension of vital programs, including substance use treatment and re-entry support, affecting the lives of incarcerated individuals and volunteers alike.

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, citing a lack of congressional authorization for large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. Judge Susan Illston sided with unions, non-profits, and local governments in blocking mass layoffs known as 'reductions in force' for 14 days. The ruling is the broadest against the overhaul led by Elon Musk's 'department of government efficiency' (Doge), which has faced numerous lawsuits. Illston scheduled a hearing for May 22 to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.</p>
