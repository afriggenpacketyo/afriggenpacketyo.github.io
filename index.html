          <p>The FDA will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups like seniors but will require vaccine makers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. FDA officials cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots and the need for evidence-based strategies. Vaccine makers are evaluating the details and engaging in ongoing talks with the FDA, while the agency is being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain.</p>

          <p>At least two members of SEAL Team 4 are facing discipline after racist memes, including one depicting slavery, were shared in a Signal chat to a Black fellow SEAL. The memes, initially shared several years ago, resurfaced after the targeted sailor reported them, citing racism and bullying; the Navy has since reinstated his revoked Trident. Platoon and team leaders are also facing administrative actions for not adequately addressing the sailor's concerns and for a flawed decision to revoke his qualifications. Naval Special Warfare Command is investigating the incident, underscoring racial concerns within the special warfare community, which tends to be less diverse than the military as a whole.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports slowed for a second straight month, with growth at 2%, in line with estimates but the slowest since October of the previous year, as the country reels under U.S. tariffs. Imports shrank 2.2% from a year ago, less than estimated, while Japan's real GDP contracted an annualized 0.7% in the first quarter due to stagnant private consumption and slowing export growth. Japan is currently charged a 25% levy on its auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S., and faces 'reciprocal' tariffs of 24% which have been temporarily suspended.</p>

          <p>George Wendt, the comedian and actor celebrated for his role as Norm on the NBC sitcom "Cheers," has died peacefully in his sleep at home at the age of 76. Wendt, a Chicago native and uncle of actor Jason Sudeikis, was best known for playing Norm Peterson on "Cheers," which ran from 1982 to 1993, earning him six consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations. He reunited with some of the cast of "Cheers" at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2024. Following his fame on the sitcom, Wendt continued acting and appeared in several TV shows and movies, including "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" and "Saturday Night Live."</p>

          <p>Japan is considering backing off from seeking a full removal of new U.S. tariffs and may concede lower duty rates to strike a trade deal with the United States, sources say. This idea has emerged as Japan's top tariff negotiator is arranging to visit the United States for the third round of bilateral ministerial-level talks. The Trump administration has already reached tariff-cutting agreements with China and Britain. In April, Chinese smartphone exports to the U.S. plunged about 70 percent from a year earlier amid a tariff dispute between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>The trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs has brought rap rivalries, sexual performances, and assault weapons into focus, as prosecutors build their racketeering and sex trafficking case against the rap mogul. Testimony included details of an encounter with Suge Knight, Regina Ventura's testimony about Combs blackmailing her daughter, and a male escort testifying about 'freak-offs'. Jurors also saw evidence of weapons with defaced serial numbers. Combs has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers argued that his private conduct in the bedroom does not amount of sex trafficking, alleging any violence was driven by love, jealousy and drug use -- not a desire to coerce anyone into sex.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has opened a criminal investigation of Andrew M. Cuomo, a front-runner in the New York City mayoral race, after Republicans accused him of lying to Congress about decisions he made during the coronavirus pandemic as governor, according to two people familiar with the matter. The inquiry, begun about a month ago by the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, comes after senior Justice Department officials in February demanded the dismissal of an indictment of the city’s current mayor, Eric Adams, on corruption charges. This puts the Trump administration in the unusual position of having ended a criminal case against the leader of the nation’s largest city and opened one into his chief rival in the span of a few months. The investigation raises the potential for the Justice Department to become even more enmeshed in city politics and further disrupted by internal disputes.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration won't force Medicaid to cover GLP-1s for obesity, a few states are doing it anyway, but access to GLP-1s, a class of expensive weight loss drugs, remains limited for many patients due to cost concerns among insurers. Only a small number of states cover these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries, and even in those states, stringent prerequisites limit access. South Carolina Medicaid, for example, estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the requirements for GLP-1 coverage. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suggested Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.</p>

Trump suggested any Republican who doesn't back the bill would be "knocked out so fast." Speaker Mike Johnson faces challenges in securing enough votes, with conservatives seeking steeper spending cuts and moderates opposing changes to Medicaid. A provision on state and local tax deduction is also facing pushback from blue state Republicans. Trump told the House GOP conference not to let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration approved a first of its kind waiver for Nebraska, allowing a ban on soda purchases through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, starting next year. This decision reverses two decades of federal rejections of state efforts to ban sugary drinks using food stamps, and is likely to pave the way for more state waivers, signaling a sharp shift in nutrition policy. Under the proposal, Nebraska will establish a program, beginning in January 2026 and affecting some 150,000 food stamp recipients in the state. A spokesperson for the Agriculture Department said the agency was reviewing and working with Iowa, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, West Virginia, Colorado, Idaho, and Utah on similar waivers.</p>

          <p>A new analysis found that red meat studies with industry links were more likely to report favorable results than those without them. The review, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, analyzed 44 clinical trials and found that industry-funded trials were nearly four times as likely to report favorable or neutral cardiovascular results after eating unprocessed red meat. The independently funded studies reported either worsened or neutral cardiovascular outcomes, and those with industry funding reported either favorable or neutral outcomes. Nutrition experts worry about the Trump administration’s proposed $18 billion in cuts to the National Institutes of Health, which could result in more industry-sponsored research.</p>

The cybersecurity company's revenue increased 15% year over year to $2.29 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to 80 cents.

          <p>The UK has suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel, summoned the country's ambassador, and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers, as Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the military escalation in Gaza "morally unjustifiable". Global experts have warned of a looming famine because the Israeli government has blockaded supplies of food, fuel and medicine to Gaza for the last 11 weeks. The move follows warnings of starvation in Gaza after Israel launched a new military operation over the weekend.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled plans for his “Golden Dome” missile defense shield on Tuesday, predicting that the ambitious plan to expand the country’s air defense system would be completed by the end of his term. U.S. officials have said the Golden Dome is necessary to protect against “catastrophic attacks,” but experts say it faces logistical and financial hurdles. Mr. Trump has said the project will cost $175 billion, although the Congressional Budget Office said it would likely cost far more, as much as $542 billion. Mr. Trump said he was confident that the United States could complete the project in about three years and be “fully operational before the end of my term.”</p>

Flights through Newark will be capped at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, and every weekend from September through December, while runway construction is ongoing. The hourly limits will restrict operations every day, typically during the busy morning and afternoon hours, according to a New York Times analysis of Newark flight schedules.
