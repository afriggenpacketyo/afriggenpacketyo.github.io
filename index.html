          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured its first direct images of a planet outside our solar system, identified as TWA 7b. This potential exoplanet, orbiting the young star TWA 7, is estimated to be similar in mass to Saturn. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare, a technique crucial for detecting such objects. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a previously unknown planet, potentially young, cold, and shaping its surrounding debris disk.</p>

          <p>Following recent military operations, Israel's Defense Minister stated that the strikes against Iran did not eliminate the country's entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium. He also revealed that there was an attempt to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but no operational opportunity arose. In response, Iranian officials are re-evaluating cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), citing the agency's failure to condemn the attacks on its nuclear facilities. Iran has also asserted that no new nuclear negotiations with the U.S. have been scheduled.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officer from Pennsylvania has been charged with bribery for his role in an alleged decade-long scheme. The officer, Amara Dukuly, is accused of soliciting and accepting payments from immigrants since 2015 in exchange for promises to help them obtain green cards, work permits, or visas. According to the criminal complaint, Dukuly did not actually possess the authority to fulfill these promises and converted the bribe money for his personal use.

          <p>The White House is intensifying its push for a major legislative package addressing President Trump's priorities on taxes, defense, border security, and energy ahead of a self-imposed July 4th deadline. The bill, already passed by the House, faces significant challenges in the Senate, where Republicans are grappling with internal disagreements and procedural roadblocks. Key provisions, including Medicaid restrictions and a tax on foreign-earned profits, have been struck down by the Senate parliamentarian for violating budget rules. Despite these setbacks, the administration remains adamant about passing the legislation, framing it as essential for the country.</p>

          <p>In his first public address since a ceasefire was established, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed that recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities "gained no achievements." He stated the attacks failed to significantly disrupt Iran's nuclear program, while describing Iran's retaliatory strike on a U.S. base as a "heavy blow." This declaration directly contradicts statements from Washington, where officials insist the operation severely set back Iran's nuclear ambitions by years.

          <p>The UK government is reportedly preparing to scale back its proposed welfare reforms following significant opposition from over 100 of its own backbench MPs. Sources suggest a deal has been reached to protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit from cuts. The planned changes, which aimed to save Â£5 billion annually, were part of the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill. This move represents a major climbdown for the government, which faced a potential defeat in the House of Commons on the legislation.</p>

          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats have publicly questioned the Trump administration's assertion that recent strikes "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities. Senators including Chris Murphy and Mark Warner stated they believe significant nuclear capability remains, suggesting the program was set back by months, not years. They accused the president of potentially misleading the public and criticized the lack of a coherent long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This contrasts with Republican senators who largely supported the administration's characterization of the mission's success.</p>

While digital sales saw a steep 26% decline, sales at Nike's physical stores showed a modest 2% increase, and the company expects the negative trends to moderate going forward.</p>

This "exposure therapy" involves appreciating the happiness of others instead of feeling jealousy, thereby raising one's own vibration.

          <p>Shares of backup generator company Generac are experiencing their best week since last November, with a nearly 12% gain.

The forecast for an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season is also fueling investor interest in the company.

          <p>Top Trump administration officials, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have launched a coordinated effort to defend the president's claims that recent U.S. strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. At a Pentagon press conference, Hegseth forcefully disputed a preliminary intelligence assessment that suggested a more limited impact, calling the leak politically motivated. CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard also issued statements confirming the program was "severely damaged" and would take years to rebuild. Despite the strong defense, key questions remain unanswered, particularly regarding whether Iran successfully moved enriched uranium before the attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sequel "M3GAN 2.0" reinvents the franchise as an action-comedy, moving away from the horror roots of its predecessor. The film introduces a new, more advanced military android named AMELIA, pitting two killer robots against each other in a bigger, though less scary, spectacle. The review notes that the film borrows heavily from influences like "The Terminator" but is elevated by director Gerard Johnstone's shaggy sense of humor. While the plot involves a familiar AI-takeover scenario, the movie's strength lies in its comedic exploration of the strange and unpredictable nature of its human characters, as much as its robot antiheroine.</p>

Experts suggest that stablecoins could represent an entirely new platform for money movement, potentially creating trillions in value, similar to the advent of credit cards. As major firms like Fiserv and Mastercard begin to integrate stablecoins, and private companies like ScaleAI and SpaceX use them for global payments, traditional financial institutions are positioning themselves to enter the market. Increased regulatory clarity is expected to further accelerate this adoption and expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal for a $5 million "Trump Card," an investment visa aimed at wealthy foreigners, is generating interest but also faces significant legal and practical challenges. Immigration attorneys note that the plan, which would purportedly replace the existing EB-5 visa program, requires congressional approval to be implemented and to change the tax code. A key hurdle is the proposal to exempt cardholders from taxes on their worldwide income, a benefit not available to U.S. citizens that could create tax loopholes.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that a pipeline operator's failure to act promptly was a primary cause of a massive crude oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. According to the NTSB's final report, operators at Third Coast waited nearly 13 hours to shut down the pipeline after data first indicated a pressure drop, allowing roughly 1.1 million gallons of oil to leak. The NTSB also found that the pipeline's owner failed to adequately address known geohazards, such as underwater landslides, which ultimately caused the leak. The spill resulted in an estimated $30 million in damages.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Signals Easing of Post-Crisis Bank Regulations Under Trump Administration</h2>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has proposed changes that would lower capital requirements for the largest U.S. banks, marking a significant step in the Trump administration's push to loosen financial regulations. The proposal would alter the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, allowing major banks to lend more freely and purchase more government bonds. This move, championed by the Fed's new Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, is seen by investors as the start of a broader rollback of rules implemented after the 2008 financial crisis. While proponents argue it will boost the economy, some Fed governors dissented, warning it could increase systemic risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>White House Clarifies No Meeting with Iran is Currently Scheduled, Contradicting Earlier Presidential Remarks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 15:54:55 EDT</div>

          <p>The White House has stated that no meeting between the U.S. and Iran is currently scheduled, walking back comments made by President Trump a day earlier suggesting talks would happen "next week." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that while the administration remains in close communication with Iranian intermediaries, nothing formal is planned. The clarification comes as the administration reportedly considers a range of options, including financial incentives and sanctions relief, to entice Iran back to negotiations for a civilian, non-enrichment nuclear program. The diplomatic situation remains fluid following recent U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.</p>
