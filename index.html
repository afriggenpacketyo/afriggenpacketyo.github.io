          <p>President Trump declared the commencement of direct negotiations with Iran, slated to begin on Saturday, during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump cautioned Iran about potential dangers if the talks falter, while Netanyahu pledged to address Israel's trade deficit with the U.S. The announcement coincided with the implementation of new tariffs on Israel and other nations, causing market fluctuations. Despite market turmoil, Trump dismissed the idea of pausing tariffs, asserting that many countries are seeking fair trade deals with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced significant volatility as President Trump intensified tariff threats against China, leading to increased concerns about a potential U.S. recession. Leading indexes initially fell sharply before briefly rebounding on unsubstantiated reports of a tariff freeze, then declined again. Goldman Sachs economists raised the odds of a recession to 45% due to the tariffs, policy uncertainty, and declining confidence. Overseas markets also suffered substantial losses, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng experiencing its steepest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Season 3 finale of The White Lotus disappointed viewers by delivering a predictable and anticlimactic ending that failed to deepen the psychological inquiries of its characters. One of the season's main storylines, focused on Rick's pursuit of his father's killer, concluded with a rushed and unsatisfying shootout. Other plotlines, such as Tim Ratliff's suicidal tendencies, were unresolved, leaving viewers with little emotional satisfaction. Despite the finale's shortcomings, a scene involving three childhood friends offered a moment of genuine connection and closure.</p>

          <p>Alexander Ovechkin, a star Russian ice-hockey player with the Washington Capitals, surpassed Wayne Gretzky's record for most goals scored in the National Hockey League. Ovechkin's new record is, adjusted for competition, much more impressive than the Wayne Gretzky mark that he surpassed. His accomplishment serves as a reminder that records, even those considered unbreakable, can be surpassed by exceptional athletes.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the country does not withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory 34% import fee on American products. This threat escalates the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. If implemented, the combined U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports would reach 104%. Economists warn that the growing trade war could harm economic growth and potentially trigger a recession. (not investment advice)</p>
