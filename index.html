          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second night of violent unrest involving protesters who threw fireworks and bottles at police, set cars ablaze, and smashed windows following demonstrations sparked by an alleged sexual assault. The police responded with baton rounds and water cannons, resulting in injuries to seventeen officers, and authorities have described the violence as "racist thuggery." Tensions have been rising in Ballymena, with some residents expressing concerns about immigration, and political leaders are urging calm and measured language to de-escalate the situation. The unrest has prompted a clean-up operation and heightened police presence in the area, as officials fear further escalation and potential fatalities. The situation is very unstable and tense, as authorities attempt to address both the immediate violence and the underlying social issues. The score is 20.</p>

          <p>GÃ¼nther Uecker, a prominent figure in postwar German art and a key member of the ZERO art movement, has died at the age of 95. Uecker was renowned for his nail reliefs, creating art by hammering thousands of nails into wooden boards and other objects, exploring the interplay of light and shadow. His work, deeply rooted in his experiences during World War II, addressed human rights violations and was exhibited in over 60 countries, making him the first Western artist to exhibit in Tehran since the 1979 revolution. Uecker's art is celebrated for its universal appeal, with many recognizing a humane character in his work that stirs emotions. The author reflects on the artist's career with a sense of celebration for the artist's prolific work, but the death of anyone is always tragic. The score is 55.</p>

          <p>Shares of Inditex, the owner of Zara, experienced a decline after the company reported quarterly revenues that fell short of expectations and indicated a slower start to summer sales due to broader economic uncertainty.

The company also noted a 6% increase in summer sales at constant currencies from May 1 to June 9, a decrease from the 12% growth observed during the same period last year.

          <p>Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and former advisor to President Trump, has publicly stated that he regrets some of his recent criticisms of the president, acknowledging that his posts "went too far." This expression of regret comes shortly after Trump threatened Musk with "serious consequences" if he were to fund primary challenges against Republicans supporting a controversial spending bill. The public falling-out between the two figures played out on social media, ignited by Musk's disapproval of Trump's spending bill. Musk's attempt to walk back his statements may indicate a desire to mend the relationship with the former president. The score is 50.</p>

          <p>Asian economies are increasingly reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, as ASEAN commits to boosting the use of local currencies in trade and investment.

Asian economies like Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China, with large foreign asset holdings, are positioned to repatriate foreign earnings back to their home currencies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An unearthed letter from the 1970s reveals a long-standing conservative animosity toward Harvard University and other liberal arts institutions, predating the Trump administration's recent attacks. The letter, written by a former Republican congressman, criticizes the perceived left-leaning bias of university professors and echoes sentiments later found in Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership. The Trump administration's actions against Harvard, Columbia, and other universities, including revoking visas for Chinese students and redirecting grants to vocational schools, align with the Project 2025 playbook. The attacks are seen as part of a broader effort to undermine universities for political reasons, particularly due to the trend of college-educated voters favoring the Democratic party.

          <p>Archaeologists at Colonial Williamsburg made a surprising discovery, unearthing the remains of four Civil War soldiers and three amputated legs near a Revolutionary War-era gunpowder magazine. The skeletons, dating back to 1862, belonged to Confederate soldiers who died during the Battle of Williamsburg and were found buried with their arms crossed in non-uniform clothing. Historians believe a makeshift hospital once operated nearby, and researchers are working to identify the soldiers, having narrowed down potential names from regiments in Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Virginia.
