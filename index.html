          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he is "taking away" Harvard University's tax-exempt status, a decision that is expected to face legal challenges. Harvard's president has stated that such a move would be unlawful and would jeopardize the university's educational mission. This action follows Trump's previous calls to revoke the status in response to Harvard's stance on antisemitism and DEI policies. The administration has also reportedly frozen over $2.2 billion in federal funding to the university. Optimism score must be multiples of 5 between 0 and 100.</p>

          <p>A ship named the Conscience, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, experienced explosions off the coast of Malta, resulting in a fire on board. The crew of 16 people were reported safe after a tug vessel helped extinguish the blaze, and the Maltese government is monitoring the ship in international waters. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which includes Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, believes the ship was hit by armed drones, causing a breach in the hull and a loss of power. The group has requested a forensic examination of the debris to determine the cause of the explosions, while Israel has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing expectations despite concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, and the labor force participation rate ticked higher. Health care led job creation, followed by transportation, warehousing, and financial activities, while the federal government saw a decline in employment. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% for the month, below forecasts, suggesting a stable but not overheating labor market. The strong job numbers have led traders to push back expectations for an interest rate cut.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates, although profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the impact of weaker oil prices. CEO Darren Woods noted that demand was strong, but higher supply depressed prices, and Trump's tariffs have raised uncertainty about future demand. The company's global production increased by 20%, and it returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</p>

          <p>Temu, the online marketplace, will cease selling goods imported directly from China to U.S. customers, transitioning to a model where sales are handled by locally based sellers and orders are fulfilled within the country. This change comes as the U.S. closes a duty-free rule for low-value packages, which Temu and Shein previously utilized to avoid duties and import taxes. Temu has been actively recruiting U.S. firms to join its platform to facilitate this shift, aiming to support local merchants and expand their reach. The move aligns with efforts to address concerns about illegal goods and potential damage to American businesses.</p>

However, federal employment declined due to cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

He argued that private bodyguards are insufficient, as they cannot carry guns or access government security networks, but the court concluded that his concerns did not constitute a legal argument for challenging the prior decision.</p>

          <p>Life has become more dangerous for Ukrainian civilians since cease-fire talks began in the war between Russia and Ukraine, with Russian strikes killing more civilians than in the same period last year. The United Nations reported a 46 percent increase in civilian deaths and injuries in April compared to the previous year. Russia has intensified its attacks on cities, while Ukraine launched a major drone assault on Moscow. Analysts suggest that the increase in violence is a tactic to gain advantage before a truce, leading to more casualties.</p>
