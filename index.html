            <p>A 38-year-old man, Cody Balmer, was arrested and charged with attempted murder, terrorism, and arson after allegedly setting fire to the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence in Harrisburg. Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were home at the time but were safely evacuated. Investigators are exploring the suspect's motive, including potential political grievances and mental health issues, as Balmer had previously expressed disdain for Democrats on social media. The fire caused significant damage to the residence, and a security review is underway to determine how Balmer gained access to the property.</p>

            <p>Mario Vargas Llosa, a prominent figure in Latin American literature and Nobel laureate, has died at the age of 89 in Peru. Known for his depictions of authoritarianism and violence, Vargas Llosa was a key member of the Latin American Boom literary movement. His works often explored political and social issues, and he was initially sympathetic to left-wing ideas before shifting to the center-right. He also famously had a decades-long feud with Gabriel García Márquez after an altercation in 1976.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense is struggling, contributing to a 4-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs and a third consecutive series loss. Despite a star-studded lineup, the team's hitting has been inconsistent, with several players in slumps. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the lack of quality team at-bats and the tendency to chase pitches. The team remains optimistic that the offense will rebound and return to its expected level of performance.</p>

            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time after reporting lower-than-expected GDP growth of 3.8% for the first quarter. The Monetary Authority of Singapore reduced the rate of appreciation of its policy band, known as the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER). The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its GDP forecast to 0%-2% for 2025, citing declines in manufacturing and some services sectors, as well as the impact of U.S. tariffs and the U.S.-China trade war.

            <p>Donald Trump's trade policies have created confusion after a cabinet official indicated new levies on semiconductors just days after the administration exempted computers and smartphones from tariffs. Trump contradicted this, stating no one was "getting off the hook" and promising further action.

The administration has also faced criticism regarding healthcare cuts for 9/11 responders and deportations to El Salvador.</p>

A CBS News poll reveals divided opinions on Trump's plan, with most believing the tariffs are temporary negotiation tactics. While Republicans show patience, a majority anticipates price increases and a negative economic impact. Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have declined, though his policies are now widely considered responsible for the current economic state.</p>
