          <p>Taiwan is preparing to receive a significant influx of long-delayed U.S. military hardware, totaling nearly $4.5 billion in systems currently being delivered. This marks the largest annual volume of arms arrivals in years, aimed at bolstering the island's defense capabilities against increasing threats from Beijing. However, reports submitted to the legislature highlight ongoing delays for key items, such as the F-16V fighter jets and AGM-154C glide bombs, raising questions about whether Taiwan's forces are fully prepared to integrate the new equipment effectively. The total backlog of arms orders from the U.S. currently stands at over $21.5 billion.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that smoke or fume events on commercial airliners are occurring at a rate of more than three per day, raising significant health concerns. Experts warn that these fumes, often caused by engine oil leaks seeping into the cabin's air supply, can be toxic and lead to neurological problems. Data indicates that Airbus A320 family jets account for a majority of these incidents. While the FAA maintains that cabin air standards are strict, flight attendant unions and medical specialists are advocating for better filtration systems to protect both crew and passengers from potential long-term health effects.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has prevented President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, upholding a lower court's decision just before a crucial meeting on interest rates. The divided court ruled that removing Cook would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act, which is designed to protect the central bank from political influence. The decision allows Cook to participate in the upcoming rate-setting vote, thwarting a move that would have allowed Trump to appoint a fourth member and gain a majority on the seven-member board. The case stems from allegations made by a political ally of Trump, which Cook denies.</p>

In interviews, Democratic contenders like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised Newsom's economic management and pushback against the Trump administration, while also identifying areas for improvement, such as housing and healthcare. Republican candidates, including Sheriff Chad Bianco, offered sharp critiques, with Bianco stating Newsom has only done well when "acting like a Republican." The responses highlight key state issues, including the housing crisis, healthcare costs, and public education.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commented on the killing of a Dallas motel manager, Chandra Nagamallaiah, blaming the Biden administration's immigration policies for the incident. The suspect, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, is a Cuban national who was in the U.S. illegally and had a prior arrest history. In a social media post, Trump stated the suspect should have been deported but was released under the previous administration because Cuba refused to take him back.

          <p>A final report from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health confirms that the Eaton fire left significant and persistent lead contamination in Altadena's soil. The contamination, believed to be from incinerated lead paint, remains even after U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cleanup efforts, with 45% of uncleaned properties and some cleaned properties still exceeding state safety levels. The report also found high lead levels in yards and at homes outside the direct burn scar, posing a health risk, particularly to children. This has left many homeowners facing difficult and costly remediation decisions on their own.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran, a White House economic adviser, to the Federal Reserve's board of governors. His confirmation, occurring just before a key meeting on interest rates, makes him the first sitting White House official to join the Fed's board in its modern form. The move has amplified concerns among critics about the erosion of the central bank's political independence, particularly as President Trump continues his campaign for significant rate cuts. Miran's appointment is seen as a key part of Trump's effort to reshape the Fed and influence its monetary policy decisions more directly.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, many people feel a renewed motivation to organize their living spaces, a process that psychologists say can reduce stress. Experts suggest several strategies for a successful decluttering process, starting with small, manageable tasks like a single drawer to avoid feeling overwhelmed. It is also crucial to plan ahead for where discarded items will go, whether to charity, recycling, or online marketplaces. The advice emphasizes prioritizing quality over quantity by keeping items that are genuinely loved and meaningful, and learning to distinguish between nostalgia for the past and true sentimental value in the present.</p>

Many doctors now believe these risks, highlighted by a flawed 2002 study, were overstated and that the study's focus on older women skewed the results. More recent research suggests that when started closer to menopause, HRT is a safe and the most effective treatment for symptoms like hot flashes for many women.

This abundance provides China with energy security and cost advantages that it may be reluctant to surrender. While the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources is meeting new electricity demand, the country's reliance on cheap coal as a backstop and for its chemicals industry could lead to a prolonged plateau in consumption rather than a swift decline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semi-annual schedule, an idea the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now actively reviewing. Trump argued the change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The proposal has reignited a debate on corporate governance, with supporters claiming it would reduce short-term market pressure, while critics argue it would decrease transparency for investors. The change would not require congressional approval and could be implemented by a majority vote at the SEC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beachgoers in Santa Monica may notice the ocean has a pink hue as researchers from UCLA and the Bay Foundation release a nontoxic dye into the water. The study aims to understand how a 1930s-era manmade breakwater may be hindering ocean circulation and contributing to the bay's notoriously poor water quality. By tracking the fluorescent dye's movement, scientists hope to gain insights that could help address the high levels of fecal bacteria often found near the Santa Monica Pier. City officials are hopeful the research will lead to solutions that finally get the popular beach off the state's list of "dirtiest" beaches.</p>

          <h2>Expert Analyzes Trump's Use of 'Sissy' in NFL Critique as Part of a 'Disturbing' Trend</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent social media post criticizing the NFL's new kickoff rule as "'Sissy' football" is being analyzed as part of a broader trend of promoting toxic masculinity. A public humanities professor explained that the term has a long history of being used in a derogatory way to belittle men who don't conform to hyper-masculine ideals, thereby insulting both men and women. The expert suggests that Trump's use of such language is intended to project an image of strength but also normalizes abuse and discrimination. This reflects what the professor calls a "disturbing" and "dangerous" trend in public discourse.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration reports it has agreed on a deal framework that would allow TikTok to avoid a U.S. ban, with a new deadline approaching this week. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the framework, while Chinese officials confirmed a "basic consensus" has been reached, though specific commercial terms are not yet public. This development addresses long-standing U.S. concerns about the Chinese-owned app's potential for data collection and propaganda dissemination to its 170 million American users. President Trump is scheduled to discuss the terms with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, potentially resolving a major geopolitical and tech issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" for a deal with Chinese-owned ByteDance that would allow the social media app TikTok to continue operating in the United States. This agreement comes ahead of a September 17 deadline that would have otherwise triggered a nationwide ban on the app. While details are still scarce, any deal would require the sale of TikTok to a U.S.-based owner to address national security concerns over data privacy and potential Chinese influence. The move navigates a politically sensitive issue, given TikTok's massive user base of 170 million Americans, particularly among younger voters.</p>

          <p>A jury has awarded a combined $13.6 million to five women who were sexually assaulted in the 1980s by their former English teacher and coach at Rolling Hills High School. The verdict found the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District negligent for failing to prevent the abuse by teacher Garry Poe. The women testified that Poe groomed them at school before sexually assaulting them during an annual, unsanctioned European tour he chaperoned for recent graduates. The case holds the school district accountable for failing to address the teacher's predatory behavior, which the plaintiffs' lawyers argued caused lifelong harm.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is proposing a massive new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, potentially worth around $900 billion, to incentivize him to remain focused on the company. The plan would require Musk to grow Tesla's valuation to an unprecedented $8.5 trillion. This move comes as Musk's attention is divided among his many other companies and his increasing political activism. The article suggests the board believes Musk's personal brand and vision are inextricably linked to Tesla's high valuation, making his continued dedication essential, even if it means offering a historically large pay package to secure it.</p>

          <p>Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has sharply criticized the club's performance under manager Ruben Amorim, stating the team lacks the quality to execute his preferred 3-4-3 formation. Following the team's worst start to a league season in decades, Scholes argued that the club's summer transfer strategy was flawed. He believes they wrongly prioritized signing three forwards instead of acquiring a dominant central midfielder, which he saw as the most critical need. Despite growing external pressure on Amorim, senior club officials reportedly remain supportive of the manager and his long-term vision for the team.</p>
