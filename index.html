          <p>Four people were killed in a shooting at a Manhattan skyscraper, including an off-duty NYPD officer, a Blackstone executive, a security guard, and a Rudin Management employee. The gunman, identified as a Las Vegas resident with a history of mental health issues, died from a self-inflicted wound after the attack. Authorities believe the rampage, which also left one person critically injured, was motivated by a grievance against the National Football League, although the shooter went to the wrong elevator bank.</p>

          <p>This satirical article critiques the "Clear Skies Act," a bill introduced by congressional Republicans to prohibit weather modification technologies like geoengineering and cloud seeding. The author humorously suggests expanding the ban to include other "nonexistent" weather-altering phenomena, such as witches in eggshells, the demigod Maui, and Punxsutawney Phil. The piece uses absurdity to comment on what it portrays as legislative distraction from more pressing environmental issues like climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has responded to a congressional subpoena with conditions for her testimony. Her lawyer stated she would only cooperate if granted formal immunity or a presidential pardon, citing risks to her ongoing legal appeals. The House Oversight Committee has rejected the possibility of granting immunity, indicating Maxwell will likely invoke her Fifth Amendment rights if forced to appear before the panel.</p>

          <p>Former NBA player Marcus Morris Sr. was denied bond in a Florida court following his arrest on felony fraud charges originating from Nevada.

While his attorney indicated a large payment has been made to resolve the debt, the judge ruled she lacked jurisdiction to set bond for an out-of-state case, and Morris remains in custody.</p>

The dispute arose over a bipartisan policing package, which Booker argued failed to prevent the politicization of federal grants to law enforcement agencies. He called for Democrats to show more "backbone" and fight against what he described as unconstitutional actions by the president, leading to a tense exchange.</p>

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious summer fruit, health experts caution against overconsumption due to several potential side effects. Its high sugar content can be a concern for people with diabetes, and as a high-FODMAP food, it can cause digestive issues for some individuals. Additionally, its high level of tyramine may trigger migraines in those who are susceptible, and in rare cases, it can cause allergic reactions for people with certain grass allergies.</p>
