          <p>Shares of U.S. and Canadian companies involved in the rare earth supply chain saw significant gains on Monday, driven by new U.S. industrial policy aimed at reducing dependence on China. The rally follows an agreement between the U.S. and Australia to develop a joint supply chain and the Trump administration's plan to set price floors for critical minerals to combat Chinese market manipulation. Investors are anticipating further government support for domestic miners like MP Materials and USA Rare Earth as the nation seeks to secure its own supply of these minerals, which are vital for technology and defense industries.

          <p>A jury has found former New York State corrections officer David Kingsley guilty of murder and manslaughter in the 2024 beating death of inmate Robert Brooks at Marcy Correctional Facility. Two other officers, Matthew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer, were acquitted of all charges related to the incident. Brooks died within an hour of arriving at the facility, and the event, captured on body-worn cameras, sparked widespread outrage. Kingsley faces a sentence of 25 years to life in prison, while the verdict has drawn mixed reactions from community organizers and Governor Kathy Hochul, who called the killing "unconscionable."</p>

          <p>The leak of a Young Republican group chat containing antisemitic and pro-Hitler comments has intensified a debate within conservative circles about rising bigotry among the young right. The incident has exposed a deep divide: some figures, like commentator Matt Walsh and VP JD Vance, have downplayed the remarks to maintain unity against the left, while others, like Ben Shapiro, argue that the movement must police its own ranks and reject extremism. This article explores how conspiracy theories and extremist rhetoric, once confined to the fringes, are being normalized by some influencers, forcing a difficult conversation about the ideological boundaries of modern conservatism.</p>

          <p>Comfort Colors, a half-century-old T-shirt brand owned by Gildan, has experienced a surge in popularity, particularly among Gen Z consumers who value its vintage look and comfortable, 100% cotton material. The brand has become a staple for college groups, fraternities, and even tour merchandise for musicians like Maggie Rogers. This growth, with sales up approximately 40% year-over-year, has significantly boosted parent company Gildan's stock performance. Its success is attributed to a focus on bulk sales to printers, allowing for unique designs, and an appeal that resonates with younger shoppers' preferences for authenticity and sustainability.</p>

          <p>An upstate New York man, David Cox, was arrested in Brooklyn after allegedly threatening to use firebombs to "fight ICE agents" at a "No Kings" protest in Manhattan. The 54-year-old reportedly made the threats to a bystander at a gas station, who then alerted authorities. While police did not find any weapons or explosive devices in his vehicle upon his arrest, Cox has been charged with making a terroristic threat. The arrest occurred on a day when thousands gathered for nationwide demonstrations against the Trump administration, though the NYPD reported no other protest-related arrests in New York City.</p>

          <p>As European football leagues La Liga and Serie A plan their first regular-season games abroad in Miami and Perth, respectively, they can draw lessons from the NFL's highly successful international strategy. Over two decades, the NFL has grown its overseas presence by focusing on a premium fan and team experience, using iconic stadiums, and building grassroots support years before hosting games. This approach has significantly increased the league's shared income, dwarfing that of other American sports. The NFL's model demonstrates that long-term investment in local fan engagement, rather than just one-off matches, is crucial for sustainable global growth.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve beginning to cut its benchmark rate, retirees are questioning the best time to purchase annuities, as their payouts are closely tied to prevailing interest rates. Generally, it is more advantageous to buy fixed annuities when interest rates are high, because insurance companies can generate higher returns on the premiums invested, leading to larger guaranteed income streams for the buyer. While rates are currently still relatively high, trying to perfectly time the market peak is nearly impossible.

          <h2>Analyzing the Prospect of Investing in Gold Ahead of Federal Reserve Meeting</h2>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut widely expected at its upcoming October meeting, this article explores the potential benefits of investing in gold beforehand. Historically, lower interest rates tend to increase gold's appeal compared to interest-earning assets, often driving up its price. Gold has already seen a remarkable price surge over the past two years, recently surpassing $4,300 per ounce, and offers a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Given the current economic climate, including rising inflation and the ongoing government shutdown, adding gold to a portfolio now could provide timely protection and growth potential.

          <p>Steelmaking giant Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the commercial viability of rare earths mining at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota, causing its stock to surge by 17%. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated that the move aligns with the national strategy for critical mineral independence and aims to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign nations like China for these essential materials. The exploration into rare earths, which are crucial for magnets used in EVs and defense technology, represents a strategic pivot for the experienced iron ore mining company, capitalizing on recent government initiatives to build a domestic supply chain.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for King Charles has stated that the monarch wishes to focus on "duty and service" and hopes public attention will not be diverted by "other matters," a reference to his brother, Prince Andrew. This comes as fresh allegations against the prince are set to be published in a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre. Prince Andrew recently announced he would give up his royal titles amid continued scrutiny over his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Royal sources indicate the palace is treating the claims with "very great concern" as calls continue for his titles to be formally removed.</p>

          <p>Despite nearly 90% of U.S. adults having at least one risk factor, a new survey from the American Heart Association (AHA) found that about nine in ten have never heard of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. Defined by the AHA in 2023, CKM syndrome describes the interconnectedness of heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and obesity, where each condition can worsen the others. Risk factors include high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, excess weight, and reduced kidney function. Health experts emphasize that recognizing these conditions as a linked syndrome is crucial for holistic treatment and prevention through lifestyle changes.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals a significant generational divide in economic confidence among small business owners, with Generation X entrepreneurs expressing the most anxiety. While younger Gen Z and millennial owners are more concerned about a future recession, they remain more optimistic about current business conditions. In contrast, Gen X owners, many of whom are in their peak career years, are least confident about the present economy, citing jobs and inflation as their top concerns. This pessimism reflects the immediate pressures they face in sustaining their businesses amid rising costs and an uncertain economic landscape.</p>

          <p>French police are investigating a meticulously planned heist at the Louvre Museum, where thieves stole eight pieces of the French crown jewels in broad daylight on Sunday. The gang used a vehicle-mounted lift to access a first-floor window of the Galerie d'Apollon, cut through the glass, and escaped on scooters in a raid that lasted only minutes. The museum remained closed as about 60 investigators work the case, with prosecutors believing the robbery was ordered by a larger criminal organization. The incident has raised serious questions about security, as it was revealed that a local alarm was broken and some rooms lacked CCTV coverage.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with the Australian Prime Minister, President Trump announced his intention to visit China "fairly early next year." This planned trip follows a period of escalating trade tensions between the two global powers.

Despite recently threatening to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports by November if a deal isn't reached, Trump expressed optimism about a potential agreement, noting that Beijing has been "respectful" throughout the trade dispute.</p>

          <p>The recent theft of French crown jewels is the latest in a series of significant heists at the Louvre Museum, which has a long history of security breaches despite its status as a former fortress. The most famous incident was the 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa by an employee, a crime that paradoxically catapulted the painting to global fame. Other historical thefts include the diamond-studded sword of King Charles X in 1976 and a Camille Corot painting in 1998, neither of which were ever recovered. This pattern of security failures underscores the persistent vulnerabilities of the institution, even as it prepares for extensive renovations aimed at improving security.</p>

However, Nandy called the decision "wrong," stating that the risk assessment was partly based on the fans being Israeli and Jewish.

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has announced a policy change to no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, aiming to allow officers to concentrate on matters that meet the criminal threshold. This decision was revealed as the Met dropped its investigation into "Father Ted" creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence through social media posts. The police commissioner stated that officers should not be policing "toxic culture war debates." Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as motivated by prejudice but do not constitute a criminal offense, and their recording by police has been a contentious issue.</p>
