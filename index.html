While the trial successfully showed Mounjaro was not inferior, it did not meet analyst benchmarks for outright superiority in reducing major cardiovascular events. However, the drug did show a significantly lower rate of death from any cause and offered greater kidney protection, strengthening its case to become the first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients with established cardiovascular disease.

The move created a notable rift with other Republicans on the panel, who argued against the measure. The bill, now named the Honest Act, also prompted a critical social media post from President Trump, which Hawley later suggested was based on a misunderstanding of the legislation's scope and impact on the president's own assets.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has vowed to fight a new Republican-led congressional redistricting plan in Texas, calling it a power grab and stating that "all options should be on the table." The GOP's proposed map aims to make several Democrat-held seats more competitive by redrawing district lines, part of a national strategy to maintain their House majority. The move has prompted Democrats in blue states like California to consider their own mid-decade redistricting efforts in response.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 90-day delay on imposing new tariffs on Mexico, allowing more time for trade negotiations with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. The move provides temporary relief, but the administration's shifting timelines and lack of clarity on new global trade rules are creating significant uncertainty. This unpredictability makes it difficult for U.S. businesses that rely on international trade to plan for potential changes in costs and supply chains ahead of the looming deadlines.

In response to the family's plea, a senior White House official stated that no leniency for Maxwell is being given or discussed by the administration.</p>

          <p>The College Sports Commission, the new agency overseeing name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, has relaxed its standards for agreements between athletes and third-party collectives. The updated guidance broadens the definition of a "valid business purpose," allowing deals that promote goods or services sold to the public for profit, thus avoiding a potential return to court. This change provides a more liberal interpretation of what collectives can do, though it still prohibits payments made solely to induce an athlete to attend a specific institution.</p>
