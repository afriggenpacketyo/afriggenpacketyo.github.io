          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its popular Monopoly-themed sweepstakes for the first time in almost ten years, running from October 6 to November 2. The updated game now integrates a digital component, requiring players to use the McDonald's app to scan and redeem both physical and digital game pieces. Prizes range from instant-win food items to larger rewards like a $1 million cash prize and a 2026 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The promotion was previously halted following a major fraud scheme that was uncovered in the early 2000s, which later became the subject of an HBO documentary series.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the student financial aid platform Frank, has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. The bank acquired her startup in 2021 for $175 million based on her claims that Frank had over five million student customers. It was later discovered that the company had fewer than 300,000 real users, with the rest being fabricated data. The case has been an embarrassment for JPMorgan, which failed to conduct adequate due diligence before finalizing the high-profile acquisition.</p>

          <p>Following Europe's victory over the United States at the Ryder Cup in New York, Captain Luke Donald has not ruled out leading the team for a third time in 2027. Donald became the first European captain since 1987 to win consecutive Ryder Cups, masterminding wins both at home in Rome and away at Bethpage. In an interview, he also addressed the unruly behavior of some American fans during the event but praised the U.S. players for their attempts to calm the crowd. The decision on his future captaincy will be made after he takes time to enjoy the recent win.</p>

While the storm's center is projected to pass west of Bermuda, its significant strength will cause large swells affecting the coastline from Florida to the Carolinas. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for Bermuda and advises coastal residents to exercise extreme caution. Humberto is one of two storm systems currently active in the Atlantic, with Tropical Storm Imelda also being monitored.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old decorated Marine veteran and Purple Heart recipient, Nigel Edge, has been charged with killing three people and wounding five others at a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina. Authorities allege that Edge opened fire on patrons from a boat in what they describe as a "highly premeditated" attack. The suspect, who suffers from PTSD, was arrested shortly after the incident and has reportedly confessed. This event highlights ongoing concerns about mental health among veterans and the accessibility of firearms, prompting the governor to call for improvements to the state's mental healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Famo, a traditional genre of accordion music from the African kingdom of Lesotho, has become dangerously intertwined with gang violence, leading to numerous deaths. Originating as folk music among shepherds and migrant mineworkers, the genre has evolved into a medium for lyrical battles between rival musicians, which often escalate into real-world violence and revenge killings. The situation has become so severe that the Lesotho government has banned some Famo groups, labeling them as terrorists. The conflict, likened to 1990s U.S. hip-hop rivalries, has also infiltrated the country's political landscape and security forces.</p>

          <p>Scientists are increasingly using a suite of advanced technologies, including AI, drones, and environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing, to track life on Earth at an unprecedented scale. These tools allow researchers to rapidly catalog millions of species, many of which are unknown to science, by analyzing genetic material from the environment or using algorithms to identify organisms from images and sounds. This technological revolution is crucial for understanding ecosystems and the impacts of climate change, as many species face extinction before they can even be formally described.

          <p>The White House is warning that several key Veterans' Affairs (VA) programs are at risk of expiring if Congress fails to pass a short-term funding bill and a government shutdown occurs. Programs in jeopardy include those providing nursing home care, suicide prevention grants, mental health services, and support for homeless veterans. While core VA services like healthcare would continue, the lapse in funding threatens these specific initiatives.

Alonzo, who created and starred in the ABC sitcom "Cristela," says that recent ICE raids have brought back the childhood trauma of protecting her mother. Her personal experiences with poverty, class, and the immigrant experience are central themes in her three Netflix comedy specials.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded a Biden-era policy that restricted the export of civilian firearms to 36 countries considered at high risk for weapon diversion to criminal organizations. The Commerce Department stated the reversal will restore rules from Trump's first term and create significant export opportunities for U.S. gun manufacturers. The previous administration had implemented the restrictions in 2024 to prevent American guns from reaching drug cartels and gangs. This policy shift aligns with President Trump's stance against stricter gun control measures and is expected to benefit major U.S. firearms companies.</p>

          <p>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which provides essential coverage for millions of American homeowners, is facing a severe financial crisis with over $22.5 billion in debt. The program is struggling as climate change increases the frequency and cost of devastating floods, while congressional mandates require it to keep rates affordable. This creates a moral hazard, encouraging development in high-risk areas because the federal government subsidizes the cost of rebuilding. Experts argue the system is fundamentally broken and requires a major political reckoning over who should bear the costs of building in flood-prone zones.</p>

          <p>With a government funding deadline just a day away, President Trump is scheduled to meet with bipartisan congressional leaders in a final attempt to prevent a shutdown. However, a stalemate persists, with Democrats insisting that any funding bill must include an extension of Obamacare subsidies and a reversal of recent Medicaid cuts. The White House has stated there is "nothing to negotiate" and is pushing for a "clean" short-term funding extension. With both sides deeply entrenched in their positions, a shutdown appears increasingly likely unless an unexpected breakthrough is achieved during the high-stakes meeting.</p>

          <p>For the first time in almost 20 years, enrollment in Medicare Advantage is expected to fall, dropping from nearly 35 million this year to a projected 34 million in 2026. Health insurers are cutting back on unprofitable plans and exiting some markets after facing shrinking profits due to higher-than-expected medical costs and new government regulations. As a result, seniors may face higher premiums and reduced benefits when the open enrollment period begins. Analysts note that insurers are taking action to improve margins, particularly by cutting benefits in HMO plans, signaling a significant shift in the competitive landscape.

When he was fired from that job at 26, he experienced a pivotal moment that led him to pick up a camera and move to New York.

The primary point of contention is the Democrats' demand to include an extension of healthcare subsidies in the funding legislation, which Republicans oppose. If no agreement is reached by the deadline, non-essential government services will halt, potentially affecting national parks, food assistance programs, and student loan processing, while essential services like air traffic control will continue.
