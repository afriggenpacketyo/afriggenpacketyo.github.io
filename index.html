            <p>Former UK Defence Minister Grant Shapps expressed his disgust at Donald Trump's favorable attitude towards Russia and Vladimir Putin, particularly Trump's description of a Russian missile strike in Ukraine as a 'mistake.' Shapps criticized Trump's 'lack of moral clarity' as demoralizing to the democratic world, suggesting it emboldens other autocrats with territorial ambitions. He alluded to potential compromising material Russia might possess on Trump, referencing Trump's first impeachment for withholding military aid to Ukraine. Shapps emphasized the need for the 'leader of the free world' to condemn Putin's actions unequivocally, asserting that appeasing dictators sets a dangerous precedent for international relations.</p>

            <p>Dr. Kevin Hall, a top NIH researcher on ultra-processed foods, resigned after accusing aides to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of censoring his research. Hall claims he was blocked from speaking to a reporter about his study on ultra-processed foods and that his written answers were edited without his consent. He also alleges he was prevented from presenting his research at a conference and pressured to alter a manuscript. Hall's research showed that ultra-processed foods may not be addictive in the same way as drugs. This incident highlights growing tensions between Kennedy and federal scientists.</p>

            <p>China is moving away from tariff-based retaliation against the U.S., opting instead for measures targeting the American services sector. This shift comes after China deemed further U.S. tariff increases a 'meaningless numbers game'. Beijing's tactics include widening export controls on rare-earth minerals, initiating antitrust probes into American companies, and restricting Chinese airlines from taking deliveries of Boeing jets. These actions signal a broader decoupling of the two economies and create various levels of pain for U.S. companies, according to analysts.</p>

            <p>Gold prices have surged to a new record high as investors seek safe-haven assets amidst escalating trade war tensions between the U.S. and China. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that President Trump's tariff policies are likely to slow economic growth and increase consumer prices. Investors are flocking to gold as a hedge against inflation and government recklessness, with some analysts comparing the current rally to the Iranian Revolution era. The introduction of tariffs has fueled fears of inflation, driving investors towards safer assets like gold (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced another island-wide power outage, impacting 1.4 million customers.

This blackout highlights the fragility of the island's electrical system, which has struggled with chronic outages since Hurricane Maria in 2017.

            <p>California will sue the Trump administration over sweeping tariffs, arguing they are unlawful and require Congressional approval. Governor Gavin Newsom stated that California will be the most impacted state and that the tariffs have resulted in inflated costs and billions of dollars in damage. The lawsuit challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs. This move follows Newsom's request for countries to exempt California exports from retaliatory tariffs, making California the first U.S. state to challenge the tariffs in court.</p>

            <p>A White House briefing featured Patty Morin, whose daughter was brutally murdered, emphasizing the need for justice and supporting President Trump's deportation policies. The briefing drew a direct connection between the crime and immigration policy, framing deportations as necessary to protect American lives. However, critics argue that leveraging Morin's tragic story to justify the deportation of Kimar Albrega Garcia, who lacks a criminal conviction, disregards the context and due process. The Supreme Court has ordered Garcia's return, but the White House resists.</p>

            <p>Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw made his first rehab start in triple-A Oklahoma City, throwing three scoreless innings as he recovers from offseason knee and foot surgeries.

Manager Dave Roberts emphasized that the focus is on Kershaw's overall health and recovery from toe surgery. The Dodgers anticipate Kershaw's return to the starting rotation in mid-to-late May, further complicating their pitching options.</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could create a 'challenging scenario' of rising inflation and slower economic growth. Powell noted that the tariffs are 'significantly larger than anticipated' and will likely result in higher prices for consumers. While the Fed is prepared to remain patient, Powell acknowledged that the impact of tariffs could be more persistent than initially expected. These concerns have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation.</p>

The weapons arrived in Haiti stashed in two cardboard boxes, nestled among packages of food and clothes, on a cargo ship stacked with rust-red shipping containers. The investigation reveals a chain of lax laws, absent checks and suspected corruption used by traffickers to bypass a UN embargo. The US is described as a "supermarket" feeding an arms race among gangs that have brought chaos to the Caribbean island nation.</p>
