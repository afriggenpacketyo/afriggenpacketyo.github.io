        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has accused Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement, opening a new front in the administration's criticism of the central bank. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought alleged that Powell misled Congress about a costly renovation of the Fed's headquarters, claiming the project is significantly over budget. The letter questions the project's legal compliance and raises speculation about whether the administration will seek to remove Powell for cause. This follows President Trump's repeated, unsuccessful calls for the Fed to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The imminent end of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500, is expected to trigger a summer buying rush. The credits, eliminated by President Trump's new bill, will expire on September 30, creating a sense of urgency among potential buyers. Automakers like Tesla are actively encouraging consumers to purchase before the deadline, and analysts predict strong incentives will be offered to capitalize on the final weeks of the subsidy. The end of this financial support is seen as a significant challenge for the EV market, which has relied on such credits to approach price parity with gasoline-powered cars.

          <h2>Trump's Deportation Push Reportedly Causing Reverse Migration Trend from US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 14:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant shift in migration patterns is occurring, with some migrants who once traveled north to the United States now making the journey in reverse. This "reverse migration" is attributed to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, which have created a climate of fear and hopelessness. The administration has intensified raids and revoked temporary legal statuses like humanitarian parole, leaving many long-term residents vulnerable. Consequently, unauthorized crossings have plummeted, not due to safer conditions, but because many see no viable future in the U.S. and are returning to unstable home countries.</p>

          <p>Walmart is recalling approximately 850,000 Ozark Trail stainless steel water bottles following multiple reports of serious injuries, including two cases of permanent vision loss. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the bottle's lid can eject forcefully upon opening, creating significant impact and laceration hazards. The 64-ounce bottles, sold exclusively at Walmart and on its website for about $15, should be returned immediately for a full refund. The recall notice urges consumers to stop using the product to prevent further injuries.</p>

          <p>Spanish filmmaker Nacho Vigalondo returns with his new English-language film, "Daniela Forever," a story about a man who uses an experimental dream treatment to cope with his girlfriend's death. In an interview, Vigalondo explains that the film, starring Henry Golding and Beatrice Grannò, explores themes of addiction to an idealized reality, comparing it to modern phenomena like AI relationships. He discusses the creative process, including shooting in Madrid and using obsolete Betamax cameras to visually distinguish the real world from the more vivid dream world. The director also reflects on the influence of the late David Lynch on his work.</p>

          <p>Annuities can serve as a powerful tool to supplement and enhance Social Security benefits, providing retirees with a more stable financial future. This article outlines how the guaranteed income from an annuity can allow individuals to delay claiming Social Security, thereby increasing their monthly payments. Furthermore, annuities can fill income gaps left by Social Security, cover essential expenses, and potentially help manage the tax liability on retirement benefits. By creating a predictable "paycheck," the combination of these two income streams can offer retirees greater financial security and peace of mind. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The newly announced "one-in-one-out" migrant returns deal between the UK and France is being positioned as a deterrent but faces significant practical, legal, and political challenges. The plan proposes that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept another with a strong asylum case, though details on numbers remain vague. While the legal principle of returning asylum seekers to a safe country like France is sound, the scheme is likely to face legal challenges over its implementation and fairness. The pilot's small scale may not be a sufficient deterrent, and scaling it up would involve complex negotiations and considerable costs.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will use its All-Star Game as a testing ground for the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System, marking another step toward its potential regular-season use. Under the system, each team will receive two challenges that can be initiated by the pitcher, catcher, or batter to review a ball or strike call. The technology, which has been tested in the minor leagues since 2021, aims to improve accuracy, though human umpires have already increased their correctness significantly. If the trial is successful with players and fans, the challenge system could be considered for implementation in the 2026 season.</p>

After a multi-agency meeting, police concluded that the risk of letting the bonfire proceed was lower than the risk associated with intervening to remove it.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has declared his country will respond with "reciprocity" after President Trump announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, effective August 1. Trump's letter cited an "unfair trade relationship" and explicitly linked the tariff to the ongoing prosecution of his ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. Da Silva pushed back, stating Brazil is a sovereign nation that will not be lectured, and noted that the U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Brazil. This move is part of a broader U.S. strategy of imposing steep new tariffs on numerous countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article revisits Virginia Woolf's unpublished 1932 letter, where she fiercely defended "highbrow" art while delivering a withering attack on the "middlebrow." Woolf defined the middlebrow as a dishonest consumer of art who lacks genuine taste and instead follows fashion, preferring inoffensive depictions of life. She argued that both highbrows, who pursue ideas, and lowbrows, who pursue life, were honest in their tastes, but she would "stab dead" anyone who called her middlebrow. The essay reflects the cultural anxieties of early 20th-century England and explores how the term's definition has since softened.</p>

          <p>If your migraines seem more frequent or severe in the summer, you are not alone, as weather-related factors can be significant triggers. A neurologist explains that changes in weather, bright sun, and even shifting from outdoor heat to indoor air conditioning can provoke migraine attacks. Dehydration is another major contributor, making it critical for sufferers to stay hydrated. To help prevent summer migraines, experts recommend wearing sunglasses, ensuring proper rest, reducing stress, and choosing fragrance-free summer products, as strong odors can also be a trigger.</p>
