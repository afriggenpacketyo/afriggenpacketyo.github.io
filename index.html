          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant wrongly deported during the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal charges related to human smuggling. The indictment alleges that Garcia conspired to transport undocumented migrants, including MS-13 members, from Latin America through Mexico into the U.S. between 2016 and 2025. Garcia's attorney argues that his client's due process rights were violated when he was initially deported and that the charges are an abuse of power. The case has sparked legal battles involving multiple courts, including the Supreme Court, regarding the government's handling of Garcia's deportation and subsequent return to the U.S.</p>

This development could simplify the calculations of countries that rely on trade with both powers, but the relationship between the two superpowers remains fragile.

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against Sonoma County, alleging that the county is using drones for code enforcement without warrants, violating residents' privacy. The ACLU argues that the county's use of drones to gather aerial images of private properties constitutes a "runaway spying operation." Residents claim that the drones have led to ongoing privacy concerns and a loss of enjoyment of their property. The lawsuit raises questions about the appropriate use of drone technology by government agencies and the protection of individual privacy rights.</p>

Alaska Airlines is cutting routes served by multiple flights to minimize disruption for passengers, impacting routes served by Horizon Air in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, California, Colorado, Utah, and western Canada.</p>
