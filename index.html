          <p>Chinese robot manufacturers are experiencing robust demand despite US tariffs, particularly in areas where their technology holds a competitive edge. Dolphin Robot Technology, for example, has secured substantial orders for its automated cafe at a trade expo, demonstrating strong buyer interest from various regions. The company attributes its success to advanced patents and the absence of comparable products in the US, Germany, or Japan. This situation allows them to maintain prices without bearing the tariff burden, indicating the resilience of specialized Chinese industries in the face of trade tensions.</p>

          <p>SK Hynix reported a significant increase in quarterly profit, driven by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets, surpassing revenue and operating profit estimates. Revenue rose 42% year-on-year, and operating profit surged 158%. However, the company cautioned about potential demand volatility in the second half of the year due to macroeconomic uncertainties and U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>President Trump criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, suggesting it was hindering peace negotiations. Trump hinted that the U.S. might be willing to formally recognize Russia's seizure of Crimea as part of a peace deal. This statement came as U.S. Vice-President JD Vance outlined a vision for a deal that would freeze territorial lines close to their current positions, requiring both Ukraine and Russia to make concessions. Zelenskyy has consistently rejected any suggestion of ceding Crimea, citing its unconstitutionality.</p>

          <p>A bill in California, AB 942, is generating controversy as it seeks to reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels, particularly those who installed systems before April 2023. The bill's sponsor, Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, previously worked for Southern California Edison, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Proponents argue that the credits unfairly burden non-solar customers, while opponents contend that the changes violate long-standing agreements and undermine the state's commitment to renewable energy. The debate highlights the complex interplay between utility interests, environmental goals, and consumer incentives in the solar energy market.</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has burned through 13,250 acres and is approximately 50% contained, prompting evacuations and road closures. While no homes were damaged, a business was destroyed, and smoke from the fire is impacting air quality, leading to advisories in New York City. The wildfire, exacerbated by dry conditions, is expected to continue burning until significant precipitation occurs. Fire officials are working to fully contain the fire and restore power to affected areas.</p>

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, has warned that extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients. The report cites medication errors, impaired decision-making, and rude behavior as common problems associated with fatigued staff. The watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs. The watchdog said the government and NHS England needed to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it.</p>

This proposal comes amid criticism of water companies for misreporting pollution levels and concerns about the Environment Agency's capacity to conduct adequate oversight.

Projecting the city’s vast ambitions and ideals in the 19th century, it morphed into a Hooverville during the Depression, becoming a beehive of ball fields and “Be-Ins” during the 1960s. A decade later it was a lawless dust bowl, the poster child for urban decline. Restoring Central Park’s glory has been a labor of decades, its maintenance an endless task. But the $160 million Davis Center, opening to the public Saturday, is a culmination of sorts.</p>
