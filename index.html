          <p>An analysis of Nvidia's recent earnings report suggests that Wall Street may be overlooking certain issues, particularly the decline of its China business due to export controls. While the company's CEO, Jensen Huang, emphasized strong demand for AI chips, analysts have been quick to downplay the impact of the China business's decline. The article questions whether Nvidia deserves a pass for a confusing quarter and notes that despite positive hype, the company's adjusted earnings per share fell short of estimates. The article suggests that investors should carefully consider the numbers rather than relying solely on positive narratives. (not investment advice)</p>
