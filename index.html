Goldman Sachs increased its GDP growth forecast to 4.6% from 4%, citing tariff reductions. UBS also raised its forecast to between 3.7% and 4%, depending on the scale of US tariffs and Beijing's policy stimulus. The analysts believe that a stronger yuan could offset tariff reductions, pointing to the strength of China's export sector. (not investment advice)</p>

A spokesperson for Biden defended his effectiveness as president and said that evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.

          <h2>State Farm Rate Hike Sparks Outrage Among California Fire Victims</h2>

          <p>State Farm's approval for a 17% emergency rate hike in California has drawn criticism from fire victims and consumer advocates, who claim the insurer is mishandling claims and providing inadequate service. The rate increase comes after State Farm requested it following the destructive Los Angeles-area wildfires. Consumer Watchdog argues that the rate hike is an insult to injury while State Farm is mishandling existing claims. The insurance commissioner defended the decision as a difficult compromise and said that State Farm must justify its financial condition at a future hearing.</p>
