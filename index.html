        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has committed to reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrapping the two-child benefit cap if they gain power, highlighting policy divisions within the Labour party. The party plans to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and asylum seeker hotels. This move follows pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to ease cuts to winter fuel payments and address the two-child benefit cap, a policy affecting an estimated 1.5 million families. The article suggests Reform UK is attempting to position itself as a viable alternative by addressing issues where Labour faces internal disagreements.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, Japan, with visitors cringing as the insects land on food and surfaces. While the midges do not bite, inhaling dead ones can trigger asthma and allergic reactions, prompting health advisories. Experts believe the insects originate from the Water Plaza, where seawater is stored, and could persist through autumn. The expo organizer is actively spraying insecticide, treating rainwater accumulation areas, and installing insect repellent lights, with Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura seeking assistance from an insecticide manufacturer.</p>

          <p>New York City beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, a number short of the city's needs but an improvement from last year. City officials are optimistic that staffing will increase as summer progresses and students finish their classes, with 374 new lifeguards in training. Incentives such as increased hourly wages and signing bonuses are being offered to attract more lifeguards, and efforts have been made to improve lifeguard stations. Beachgoers expressed relief at the presence of lifeguards, which provides a sense of security, especially given past incidents of drownings when lifeguards were not on duty.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners, each side bringing home 307 soldiers, following a large-scale missile and drone attack on Kyiv. This swap is viewed as a rare instance of cooperation amidst stalled ceasefire efforts in the ongoing war. The prisoner exchange occurred hours after Kyiv endured an attack that injured at least 15 people, with Russia launching ballistic missiles and Shahed drones, though Ukrainian forces claim to have neutralized most of them. Despite the prisoner exchange, fighting continues along the front lines, with both sides continuing deep strikes.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author and activist known for her influential book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," has died at the age of 90. Her groundbreaking work redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, significantly impacting societal attitudes and legal reforms. The book sparked both praise and controversy, with some critics accusing her of anti-male bias and misinterpreting cases involving Black men and white women. Despite facing backlash, Brownmiller remained a vocal advocate against pornography and sexual violence throughout her career.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has cancelled his summer tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition causing issues with hearing, vision, and balance. The musician is undergoing physical therapy and hopes to return to the stage in the future. NPH occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, and while treatable, it is often underdiagnosed. The condition's symptoms include walking difficulties, cognitive issues, and urinary incontinence, which can be mistaken for normal signs of aging.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers are facing increasing financial strain due to rising driving lesson costs, with instructors citing higher expenses for cars, fuel, and insurance. The cost of lessons is impacting learners' ability to afford frequent sessions, delaying their progress and test readiness. A practical test backlog exacerbates the issue, requiring learners to take more lessons to maintain skills while awaiting test slots. While instructors argue that current prices are fair, many learners, especially those with essential needs for driving, struggle to balance lesson costs with other living expenses.</p>

President Trump signed an executive order opening refugee pathways to Afrikaners, claiming they face "racial discrimination," while thousands of other refugees with approved applications remain in uncertain situations. This has led to accusations of unfairness and unequal treatment, particularly as the US also cut aid to South Africa and restricted other immigration routes.

They criticize the apparent indifference and the absence of a parliamentary commission, accusing France of a systemic silence regarding child sexual assault.

The investigation gained momentum when the family's former nanny, Paola Yarberry, provided crucial information after investigators traveled to Costa Rica. Worrell and Yarberry had been in an inappropriate relationship, moved to Costa Rica together, and raised the victim's children together for years.</p>
