          <p>Netflix has secured a deal to stream Sesame Street, providing its 300 million subscribers access to the 56th season and a substantial back catalog. This move comes after Warner Bros Discovery did not renew its deal with the show, creating uncertainty about its future. PBS will retain access to episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix, ensuring continued availability on free-to-air television. Sesame Street has been a cornerstone of children's media since 1969, addressing issues like child obesity and music education, with appearances from figures like Michelle Obama and Elmo in public policy discussions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, has dropped the federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka stemming from a protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. However, U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver now faces charges of "assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement" during the same visit. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and a mischaracterization of her actions during oversight of the facility's treatment of ICE detainees. The Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem supports the decision to charge McIver, following a review of video footage from the incident.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump over 11% in their Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing trade tensions and a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year over year, driven by strong demand for electric vehicles in China.</p>

SPACs are inherently speculative, allowing companies to raise money without a business plan, and their resurgence depends on investors' appetite for risky bets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed that Russia and Ukraine would "immediately" start negotiating towards a ceasefire and an end to the war after a phone call with Vladimir Putin. Trump said conditions for peace would need to be negotiated between the two parties. Zelensky reaffirmed Ukraine's desire for a "full and unconditional ceasefire" and warned if Moscow is not ready, "there must be stronger sanctions". Putin spoke of the potential for a ceasefire and said Russia is ready to work with Ukraine on a memorandum on a possible future peace agreement.</p>

          <p>Latino legislators criticized Gov. Gavin Newsom's proposed budget cuts to Medi-Cal, including freezing enrollment and charging premiums for adult immigrants without documentation. State Senator María Elena Durazo called the plan a form of redlining, while Assemblymember Mia Bonta questioned its constitutionality. The Latino Legislative Caucus has staunchly opposed cuts to Medi-Cal, despite California expecting decreased revenue and increased spending. State Senator Caroline Menjivar accused Newsom of scapegoating immigrants for California's economic woes.</p>

Trump claimed that Biden had been less than forthcoming about his health and insinuated that Biden officials had been running the office using the autopen. Trump also noted that he had been screened for prostate cancer and given a cognitive test during his recent physical, while Biden's physical did not include a cognitive exam.

Chickpeas, chia seeds, edamame, raspberries, and avocados are highlighted as top high-fiber foods that can help manage blood sugar. These foods slow the digestion and absorption of glucose, preventing sharp spikes and crashes in blood sugar. Increasing fiber intake should be a slow and steady endeavor to minimize digestive symptoms, and these additions can be easily incorporated into a balanced diet.</p>

The pitch included an illustration of a pyramid topped by “progressive ‘elites’ leading the way,” including Jewish billionaires such as George Soros and Governor JB Pritzker. The campaign, called Project Esther, aims to destroy the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, which Heritage defines broadly.

Chinese exporters understate the value of goods or mislabel them in shipping documents, routing shipments through shell companies acting as "importers of record." This tactic has gained momentum as businesses scramble to sidestep new levies imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
