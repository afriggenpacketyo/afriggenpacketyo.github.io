          <p>Archaeologists excavating the Basilica of St. Stephen on Caelian Hill in Rome discovered a stone head believed to depict an ancient deity, likely from the Roman era. The head, found in the church's foundation, is deteriorated and covered in mortar, obscuring some features. It will undergo documentation, study, and restoration at the Central Institute for Restoration (ICR) in Matera, with students from the School of Advanced Training for Restoration involved in the process. The collaboration between the Appian Way Regional Park and the ICR aims to enhance archaeological and restoration practices, enriching understanding of the Appia Antica territory during the late antique period. This Fox News article adds to a growing list of ancient artifacts unearthed during archaeological digs.</p>

          <p>China rejected Japan's assertion that a Chinese coast guard helicopter entered its airspace near the Senkaku Islands, blaming the incident on a Japanese civilian aircraft. Liu Jinsong of the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a protest with Akira Yokochi of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, citing the "intrusion of a civilian aircraft operated by Japan's right-winger." Yokochi reiterated Tokyo's protest, demanding preventive measures. The Japanese Defense Ministry reported the helicopter flew above the territorial waters for about 15 minutes, prompting the Air Self-Defense Force to scramble two jet fighters. Senior Col. Zhang Xiaogang of China's Defense Ministry stated the coast guard's action was "completely legitimate and legal."</p>

          <p>China is expediting the construction of its Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (Best) nuclear fusion reactor in Hefei, aiming for completion in 2027. This project seeks to achieve net energy generation, a crucial step toward commercializing nuclear fusion as a clean energy source. The assembly involves thousands of components weighing approximately 6,000 tonnes. Chief engineer Song Yuntao stated that they have mastered core technologies, both scientifically and technically. The project began two months ahead of schedule, with Yan Jianwen noting the rapid progress as "China speed" in civil construction and component readiness.</p>

          <p>Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in an interview with CBS News, characterized President Trump's pressure campaign on higher education as "extortion," highlighting the potential consequences for research funding, foreign student safety, tax-exempt status, and academic freedom. Summers believes Trump's actions, particularly against universities like Harvard, are a direct attack on academic independence.

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a new adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray" on Broadway, playing all 26 roles in a technologically innovative performance. The production uses smartphones and elaborate camerawork to explore themes of narcissism and the superficiality of modern society. Snook, portraying Dorian Gray, uses a smartphone to manipulate her image on a giant screen, highlighting the gap between false perfection and reality. This adaptation contrasts with another London import, "Vanya," starring Andrew Scott, which offers a different perspective on self-expression and performance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ health, impacting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. Officials justified the cuts by stating the research no longer aligns with agency priorities, citing concerns over gender identity and equity objectives. This decision has led to job losses and jeopardizes ongoing clinical trials, particularly in HIV prevention and mental health support for transgender youth. Critics argue that these cuts create a hierarchy of patients and undermine efforts to address health disparities in the LGBTQ community, reversing a decade of increased federal funding for such research.</p>

Despite President Trump's past skepticism, the decision reflects a shift towards supporting Ukraine, highlighted by a recent cordial meeting between Trump and Zelensky and a signed minerals deal. Ukraine currently operates eight Patriot systems, with only six functioning, and the addition of these systems would enhance its air defense capabilities, primarily around Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Fourteen children, aged between 11 and 14, have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following a fire at an industrial unit in Gateshead, UK, where the body of a 14-year-old boy, Layton Carr, was found. The fire broke out at Fairfield industrial park in the Bill Quay area, a site known for disrepair and trespassing. Police have asked the public to refrain from speculation and have specialist officers supporting the family.

          <p>A Houthi missile struck near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, forcing a brief shutdown and highlighting the group's ability to strike distant targets despite a sustained US military campaign. The missile evaded Israeli air defenses, prompting warnings of a severe response. The Houthis claimed responsibility, citing Israel's actions in Gaza. This incident marks a major security breach and raises questions about Israel's missile defense capabilities. The US military has conducted extensive strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, but has largely failed to disrupt their ability to launch ballistic missiles against Israel.</p>

          <p>Heather Stewart of The Guardian argues that President Trump's chaotic policies are destabilizing the US economy, creating uncertainty for businesses and consumers. Despite strong payroll data, forward-looking surveys reveal anxiety, with the Michigan consumer sentiment index showing a steep decline. The article highlights concerns over tariff policies, budget cuts, and immigration policies, all contributing to an unstable economic environment. The author suggests that a more settled policy position could alleviate some of the uncertainty, but Trump's love for political drama makes it difficult to predict future actions.</p>

This shift means that Trump is no longer constrained by dissenting voices or a Republican Party that he doesn't fully control.
