          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, stock markets experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping nearly 750 points. Oil prices surged due to concerns about potential disruptions to oil flow from Iran, a major crude producer, and fears of the Strait of Hormuz closing. Airline stocks suffered losses due to rising fuel costs and decreased travel sentiment, while defense stocks rallied.

The piece considers how the conflict will influence Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon and whether Israel's actions will deter or accelerate Iran's nuclear ambitions.

          <p>President Trump is set to host a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, marking Washington, D.C.'s first major military parade in over three decades. Military parades in the U.S. are relatively rare, typically held to celebrate the end of wars or the return of military personnel. Past parades include those marking the end of the Gulf War, presidential inaugurations, and celebrations of World Wars I and II. The article examines the historical context and cultural significance of military parades in the United States. </p>

The bill includes significant cuts to SNAP, which could impact millions of children's food assistance.

It argues that Israel's specific plan to counter Iran led to both the disaster of October 7 and the subsequent triumphs. The focus on Iran and its proxies left Israel unprepared for Hamas's attack, while the resources and strategies not applied to Hamas proved effective against Hezbollah and Iran. The article concludes that while Israel was prepared for a conflict with Iran, the war is likely to be protracted and destructive. </p>
