          <h2>Tariff Exemption's End Impacts Tech Giants' Ad Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 00:01:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption on inexpensive goods from China, a policy enacted by President Trump, is already impacting advertising revenue for major tech platforms like Meta and Alphabet. This exemption had fueled the rise of low-cost online retailers such as Temu and Shein, who heavily advertised on these platforms. As these companies now face tariffs as high as 145%, they are reducing their ad spending, leading to a revenue decline for the tech giants. The article notes that Meta CFO Susan Li confirmed some Asian retailers had already reduced U.S. advertising spending in anticipation of the end of the exemption.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, envisioned by former President Nana Akufo-Addo and designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy. Plagued by financial difficulties and corruption accusations, the $400 million project has stalled, leaving behind only a large hole in Accra. The new government has ceased funding and dissolved the managing agency, marking a likely end to the project. The article highlights that many Ghanaians view the cathedral as an unnecessary expense amid the country's economic struggles, especially with an estimated cost of $400 million.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Daily, the Chinese military's mouthpiece, has drawn a parallel between the current anti-corruption drive within the PLA and preparations for war.

The article suggests that unifying political loyalty and eliminating corruption are crucial for the military to fulfill its missions, drawing historical parallels to previous campaigns before key wars.

          <p>New tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported auto parts are expected to drive up prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repair and insurance costs. These tariffs, intended to incentivize domestic production, impact even cars made in the United States due to the widespread use of foreign components.

Sperbeck fell from a moving golf cart in La Quinta and sustained a fatal head injury. While there were five people on the cart, which was designed for two or four, the driver does not appear to be at fault, and alcohol was not a factor.

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The suit claims these policies interfere with the enforcement of federal immigration law and violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit mentions a controversial apartment complex in Aurora which President Trump claimed last year had been taken over by a Venezuelan gang, arguing Colorado's policies allowed Tren de Aragua to seize control of the building. Local officials have defended their policies, asserting that they comply with all applicable laws.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that approximately 58% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media during elections should be regulated by law. This sentiment arises amidst growing concerns over partisan online posts influencing election outcomes, despite constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression. The survey also indicates split opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, and a general feeling that momentum for constitutional amendment is not building. The survey was conducted ahead of the Constitution Memorial Day national holiday.</p>
