          <p>Former President Donald Trump has denied a Wall Street Journal story claiming that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent persuaded him not to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The report suggested Bessent warned that such an unprecedented move could destabilize financial markets and noted the Fed was already likely to cut interest rates. Trump dismissed the story as "typically untruthful" on Truth Social, asserting his own superior understanding of the market and the economy. This denial occurs amidst ongoing criticism of Powell by Trump and his allies over the central bank's policies and management.</p>

          <p>A protest in Epping, Essex, at a hotel housing asylum seekers turned violent, with demonstrators throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The unrest, involving over 1,000 people, was reportedly triggered by the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of sexual assault. Chanting slogans like "send them home," the crowd's actions led to one arrest, adding to previous arrests from a similar protest where eight officers were injured. Essex Police have implemented a temporary order requiring the removal of face coverings to manage the disorder and ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has threatened to impede the Washington Commanders' plans for a new stadium in D.C. if the team does not change its name back to the Redskins. In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump argued that reverting to the original name would make the team more valuable and the stadium deal more appealing. He also called for the Cleveland Guardians to return to their former name, the Indians, suggesting it would be politically beneficial for the team's ownership. The Commanders' owner, Josh Harris, has previously stated the team is moving forward with the new name and is not looking back.</p>

          <p>A recent broadcast of "Face the Nation" delved into key issues of the Trump administration's second term, revealing declining public approval. Polling data showed a majority of Americans now feel the administration's deportation efforts are broader than expected and oppose the focus on tariffs over lowering consumer prices. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the administration's trade strategy, promising historic deals, while Rep. Jim Himes criticized the approach as economically unsound. The program also featured ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons discussing enforcement tactics and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass on the local impact of immigration raids. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler has won his first British Open, claiming the Claret Jug at Royal Portrush with a dominant four-stroke lead over runner-up Harris English.

          <p>Intense rainfall caused severe flash flooding in Montgomery County, Maryland, leading to over 100 rescue calls within a two-hour period on Saturday, a volume typically seen over 24 hours.

Although no injuries were immediately reported, dozens of people were rescued from trapped vehicles and buildings. Residents were stunned by the rapid rise of the floodwaters, which local officials attributed to the extreme intensity of the downpour over a very short time.</p>

The conflict, which also involved government forces and Israeli air strikes in support of the Druze, has displaced at least 128,000 people. Amid the devastation and a severe shortage of medical supplies, deep-seated mistrust between the communities complicates hopes for lasting peace.</p>

          <p>An update on the tragic school coach crash in Somerset confirms that four people are still in the hospital, including two children and two adults. The incident, which occurred when a coach carrying Minehead Middle School pupils on a trip from the zoo left the road, resulted in the death of a 10-year-old boy. The school was closed as the community paid respects and left tributes, with several fundraisers collecting over £40,000 for those affected. The police investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Todd Lyons, has stated that his agents will continue the controversial practice of wearing masks during arrest operations. He defended the policy as a safety measure for officers and their families against threats and doxxing. Lyons also confirmed that ICE has a broad mandate to arrest any individual encountered who is in the country illegally, including those without criminal records, who are often detained as "collateral" arrests during targeted operations. This approach marks a significant shift from the more prioritized enforcement seen under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has strongly criticized the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, stating that the enforcement raids have spread fear throughout the city's large immigrant and Latino communities. In an interview, she described how masked federal agents in unmarked cars have created a climate where residents, including legal citizens, are afraid to leave their homes, disrupting daily life and the local economy. Bass condemned the tactics as a "reign of terror" and argued that the deployment of military troops to the city was an unnecessary political stunt that misused taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>At a concert in Wisconsin, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously acknowledged the recent viral incident involving his "Jumbotron Song." Before performing the song, Martin jokingly advised the audience, "if you haven’t done your makeup, do your makeup now," giving them a friendly warning they might appear on the big screens. This comes after a man and woman at a previous show were identified as a tech CEO and his HR chief in an intimate moment, leading to the CEO's resignation. The band has not directly addressed the fallout, but Martin's on-stage comment served as a lighthearted nod to the controversy.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even as exit polls project his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election results reflect growing public frustration with the Liberal Democratic Party over rising prices and the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. This potential loss of control in the upper house, following a similar loss in the more powerful lower house last year, is expected to significantly undermine the coalition's influence and could lead to further political instability at a crucial time for the nation.</p>
