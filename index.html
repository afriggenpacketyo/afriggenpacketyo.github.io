          <p>A driver reportedly lost consciousness before their car plowed into a crowd in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, injuring at least 20 people. The incident occurred near a taco cart and a club on Santa Monica Boulevard. According to the Los Angeles Fire Department, multiple individuals are in critical and serious condition, prompting a large-scale emergency response involving over 100 fire personnel. A preliminary investigation suggests the driver's loss of consciousness was the primary cause of the tragic event.</p>

          <p>New York Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu won the WNBA 3-point contest for the second time, scoring 30 points in the final round to defeat the defending champion. The event took place during the WNBA All-Star weekend, notably in the absence of Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with an injury. Ionescu's performance, while not matching her record-breaking 2023 score, was a highlight of the night's festivities. Her teammate Natasha Cloud also won the skills competition, making it a successful event for the Liberty players.</p>

          <p>Syria's interim government has declared an immediate ceasefire in the southern city of Suweida, following a week of intense sectarian violence between local Bedouin tribes and the Druze community that has resulted in hundreds of deaths. Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for unity as internal security forces were deployed to the region to enforce the truce. The situation remains tense, with international actors like Israel and the United States involved in monitoring and mediating the fragile peace, though doubts about its durability persist.</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Rwanda-backed M23 militia have signed a provisional ceasefire agreement, committing to a permanent truce by mid-August. This deal, brokered in Qatar, represents a significant step toward ending the long-running conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, which has displaced millions.

Recent actions, including the ousting of a vaccine advisory committee and cancellation of a preventive services task force meeting, have intensified fears that science-based policymaking is being systematically dismantled in favor of political ideology.</p>

          <p>A social media trend has brought attention to the "Gen Z stare," a term describing a blank, unresponsive look that older generations report receiving from younger people in conversation. While some Zoomers deny its existence, psychologists speculate it could be an unconscious behavior influenced by a life lived through screens and altered by the pandemic. The article suggests the frustration it causes in older generations stems from a perceived lack of social cues, which can feel like rejection. It ultimately frames the phenomenon as a classic point of generational misunderstanding.</p>

          <p>More than 100 days into President Trump's sweeping tariff policies, economists are evaluating their initial effects.

However, analysts caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and could be reversed, while the tariffs have already begun to push up prices on some consumer goods.

          <p>In the wake of deadly disasters like the recent Texas floods and Los Angeles firestorms, meteorologists are grappling with "forecaster regret" and the challenge of ensuring their warnings are heeded. Despite issuing alerts days in advance, officials and the public are often caught unprepared, leading to questions about how to overcome complacency and communicate risk more effectively. The article explores the disconnect between available forecasts and public action, citing past disasters where apathy or a bias toward optimism led to tragedy, and highlights the need for better decision-making frameworks.</p>

          <p>Three highly experienced Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives were killed in an explosion while moving ordinance at a training facility in East L.A. The fallen lawmen—Dets. Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn—were all members of the specialized arson and explosives detail. The incident, which is the department's deadliest in over 160 years, occurred after the detectives had assisted in removing explosives from a Santa Monica apartment complex. The men are being remembered as courageous heroes who collectively served the department for 74 years.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes how President Trump is now struggling with the political fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories that have been amplified by his allies and the MAGA movement. After years of stoking such theories, the administration's recent declaration that no incriminating "client list" exists has caused a backlash among his base. The author argues that Trump's own long and documented relationship with Epstein makes him vulnerable, and his inability to quash the controversy reveals a loss of control over the very narrative machine he created.</p>

          <p>Six months into his term, President Trump is facing rising consumer prices, a trend many economists link to his chaotic rollout of high tariffs on imported goods. Despite his administration's claims that inflation is under control, data shows an upward trend. In response, Trump has intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, blaming the central bank for not cutting interest rates and threatening his position. This conflict creates economic uncertainty, as experts warn that political interference with the Fed could destabilize the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas has passed a new law, the "Life of the Mother Act," intended to clarify when doctors can legally perform abortions in medical emergencies under the state's restrictive ban. The law specifies that a patient's death does not need to be "imminent" to justify an abortion and confirms that the burden of proof is on the state in any prosecution. While supported by some medical groups as a step in the right direction, reproductive rights advocates and legal experts question if it will be enough to reassure doctors, who still face severe penalties.</p>
