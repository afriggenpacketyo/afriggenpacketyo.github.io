          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing integration into mainstream finance. Major institutions like Robinhood, Deutsche Bank, and BlackRock are now building on Ethereum, launching tokenized stocks and funds. This shift emphasizes utility over speculative hype, with firms valuing Ethereum's stability, security, and decade-long operational record. Despite market volatility, the trend towards using Ethereum as the foundational "plumbing" for global finance signals a significant maturation of the crypto ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian frames President Trump's plan to host a UFC event at the White House as more than mere entertainment, labeling it "authoritarian theatre." The author draws on personal experience with Russian MMA to highlight the political undertones of such spectacles, arguing the event is the culmination of a long-standing partnership between Trump and the UFC. The article suggests this alliance promotes a brand of nationalistic masculinity and spectacle reminiscent of historical fascist regimes, serving to bolster Trump's strongman image.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has accused the Smithsonian Institution of using taxpayer funds to promote "one-sided, divisive political narratives" that undermine American history. A White House official cited examples from the National Museum of American History's "Entertainment Nation" exhibit, which frames cultural icons like Mickey Mouse and The Lone Ranger through a critical, politically-charged lens. This move is part of a broader push by the administration to reshape cultural institutions, with an audit of Smithsonian content already underway to ensure it aligns with what the White House deems patriotic values.</p>

          <p>A software engineer from Mumbai has sparked a debate on work ethics after being publicly exposed for simultaneously holding jobs at multiple Silicon Valley startups. While some founders accused him of scamming companies, the engineer, Soham Parekh, claimed he did it out of "dire financial circumstances" and not greed. The incident highlights the "overemployed" trend, where tech workers secretly take on multiple remote jobs, a practice enabled by remote work and fueled by job market uncertainty. Experts warn this behavior could erode trust and jeopardize flexible work arrangements for everyone.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a new milestone in solar energy by launching a large-scale floating photovoltaic power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. The project, developed by state-owned Sinopec, is part of the largest initiative of its kind and is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Spanning approximately 60,000 square meters, the solar panels are designed to rise and fall with the tides. Their proximity to the ocean surface also enhances their efficiency by up to 8%, marking a significant breakthrough for the industry.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece reflects on the return of champion eater Joey Chestnut to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, framing the event as a bizarre yet honest reflection of modern culture. The author describes Chestnut's intense athletic preparation, from neck exercises to breathing techniques, highlighting the serious dedication behind the seemingly absurd spectacle. The article posits that the contest, while grotesque, is a raw expression of American themes of abundance, consumption, and excess. Ultimately, it suggests the event acts as a satirical mirror to a society obsessed with consumption, making it a strangely compelling and relevant sport.</p>

One study found that people from rural Namibia saw circles in an illusion where Westerners saw rectangles, suggesting environment shapes vision. However, another study dismantled this explanation for the famous Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it affects animals and even the formerly blind. The author argues that perception is an active brain construction, not a direct window to reality, leading to significant perceptual diversity both between and within cultures, urging humility about our own way of seeing.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant advance in regenerative medicine by discovering a "genetic switch" that restored damaged ear tissue in mice. The research, published in the journal *Science*, found that a mouse's inability to regenerate is linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in development. By reactivating this pathway, they achieved complete restoration of cartilage and other tissues in the mice's ears. The researchers believe this mechanism may be present in other organs, offering hope that this research could one day lead to organ regeneration in humans.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that the public discourse surrounding the war in Gaza is being diverted by manufactured outrage, using the controversy over the band Bob Vylan as a key example. The author contends that the band's chant of "Death to the IDF" was deliberately misreported as "Death to Israelis" to frame legitimate criticism of military action as antisemitism. This strategy, the article suggests, distracts from the devastating reality in Gaza, where the death toll is in the tens of thousands. The piece concludes that this diversionary tactic is losing its power as more people see the disconnect between media narratives and observable reality.</p>

Many participants stated they were forgoing traditional holiday celebrations to join the march. The protest moved through Olvera Street and past the Federal Building, which houses the immigration court, with demonstrators chanting and waving signs. The event was monitored by police and military personnel, who guarded federal property as the rally highlighted the deep community opposition to the ongoing enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced their most lopsided loss in Dodger Stadium history, falling 18-1 to the Houston Astros on Independence Day.

The game spiraled out of control for the Dodgers in the sixth inning, when reliever Noah Davis surrendered ten runs. The devastating defeat came in front of a sold-out crowd, many of whom stayed in somber silence to await the postgame fireworks show.</p>

          <p>The Hamas organization has announced it issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the war with Israel. In a statement, the group said it was prepared to enter negotiations immediately to implement the framework. This development follows President Trump's announcement that Israel had agreed to a two-month ceasefire plan, though Israeli officials have not yet publicly committed. President Trump expressed optimism about the response, suggesting a deal could be reached within the next week, but the situation remains fluid and complex.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's new administration under President Lai Ching-te is navigating a complex historical issue regarding the island's World War II legacy. Critics accuse the government of attempting to honor the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory while simultaneously downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's emphasis on a distinct Taiwanese identity clashes with the legacy of the Kuomintang (KMT), which retreated to Taiwan after the civil war but continued to govern as the ROC. This creates a revisionist dilemma over how to frame the nation's history.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece draws parallels between Donald Trump's presidency and the rule of cold war-era dictators in Africa, arguing the comparison is more apt than Eurocentric analogies. The author points to tactics like deploying troops against domestic protestors, theatrical economic policies, self-aggrandizing projects, and attacks on academia and the press as echoes of leaders like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. The article suggests that since the U.S. supported many of these autocrats as anti-communist allies, it is a startling reversal to now see the U.S. imitating their authoritarian models.</p>

During the visit, new investments in health and energy were announced, and Modi declared that more citizens of Indian origin in the nation would be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards.</p>
