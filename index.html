        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell 1.7% year-over-year in May, marking the steepest decline since September 2024, attributed to ongoing trade uncertainties and a drop in U.S. shipments. The decline, though less severe than economists' forecasts, contrasts with April's 2% gain, with exports to the U.S. decreasing by 11.1% and to China by 8.8%. Automobile exports, particularly to the U.S., experienced a significant drop of 24.7% amid concerns over potential tariffs and trade tensions with the U.S. The Bank of Japan acknowledged the likelihood of moderating growth due to trade factors, impacting overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. Optimism surrounding Japan's economic outlook is tempered by the reliance on exports and the potential impact of trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

This stance could reflect Japan's confidence in its economic position or a strategic decision to delay concessions until more favorable terms are offered.

Uthmeier defended his actions, stating he was standing behind President Trump's agenda on illegal immigration. The court ordered Uthmeier to file bi-weekly reports detailing arrests made under the immigration law, with the first report due by July 1.</p>

          <p>As President Trump convened with top advisors, U.S. officials indicated that the next 24-48 hours are critical in determining whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible, or if military action will be pursued. Trump has escalated his rhetoric against the Iranian regime, asserting knowledge of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's location and warning against attacks on civilians or American soldiers. Despite the saber-rattling, U.S. negotiators believe Iran is in a weak position and could be compelled to return to negotiations, potentially leading to a high-level meeting led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Vice President JD Vance. The U.S. military is deploying assets to the region, maintaining a defensive posture while keeping options open for assisting Israel.</p>

          <p>California farmers and workers are experiencing uncertainty due to contradictory signals regarding the Trump administration's stance on immigration enforcement during the crucial summer harvest season. While California's agricultural industry heavily relies on undocumented labor, recent ICE raids have caused fear among workers and concerns among farmers about potential workforce shortages. President Trump initially suggested changes were coming after complaints from farmers and hospitality leaders, but the administration later reversed course, stating there would be no safe spaces for industries harboring violent criminals. Employers are now seeking guidance on protecting their workers, with some forming alliances with worker advocates to resist immigration sweeps.</p>

Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson criticized Republican "warmongers," prompting a rebuke from Trump, while Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene defended Carlson and warned against U.S. involvement. Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, supported Massie's effort, arguing that a war with Iran would undermine Trump's coalition and hinder efforts to address immigration.</p>

          <p>Meta expressed concern after Iranian state television urged citizens to delete WhatsApp, accusing it of being used by Israel to identify and target individuals. WhatsApp refuted these claims, emphasizing its end-to-end encryption and commitment to user privacy. The Iranian government's warning comes amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with reports of reduced internet usage in the country. Meta's platforms have previously been targeted by Iran's government during times of unrest, raising concerns about censorship and access to information.</p>

The film highlights the challenges faced by undocumented trans women, as well as the importance of community support.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose their gender identity when renewing or applying for passports, including selecting "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. The executive order, issued by Mr. Trump, reversed a policy under the Biden administration that allowed for self-selection of gender on passport applications. The ACLU sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming it was discriminatory against transgender and nonbinary individuals.</p>

          <p>Retailer Co-op is offering its members Â£10 off a minimum shop of Â£40 following disruption caused by a recent cyber attack. The grocery chain said it had not yet completely recovered from being targeted by hackers last month, which resulted in a significant amount of customer data being stolen. The one-off deal, which runs from Wednesday for a week, is open to existing Co-op members, and shoppers wanting to sign up, but not to staff. One analyst said the majority of customers do not spend Â£40 or more per shop, so it would not appeal to many people. (not investment advice)</p>
