          <p>U.S. immigration authorities have detained 475 people, a majority of whom are South Korean nationals, in a major raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia. The operation was part of a multi-month criminal investigation into alleged unlawful employment and other federal crimes. South Korea's government has expressed regret over the raid and urged the U.S. to respect the rights of its citizens, highlighting a potential conflict between the administration's goals of boosting domestic manufacturing and its stringent immigration enforcement policies. The raid is described as the largest single-site enforcement action in the history of Homeland Security Investigations.</p>

          <p>The sudden resignation of former Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler has deepened in mystery following a review of her real estate records, which show conflicting information about her primary residence. This scrutiny comes as her former colleague, Lisa Cook, faces a campaign by the Trump administration to remove her from the board over similar accusations of mortgage irregularities. Kugler's departure provides President Trump an opportunity to appoint a successor, furthering his efforts to influence the central bank's interest rate policies. Kugler has stated the discrepancy in her records was a county error that is being corrected.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to initiate a Section 301 trade investigation to counteract what he terms "discriminatory" fines imposed by the European Union on major U.S. technology firms. His statement followed the EU's issuance of a nearly $3.5 billion penalty against Google's advertising technology business. Trump argued that these fines are unfair and effectively divert money that would otherwise be invested in the American economy and create jobs. He vowed that he would be forced to act to nullify the penalties being charged to these companies.</p>

Kennedy Jr. is expected to release a report linking autism to acetaminophen use during pregnancy. Kenvue stated it has continuously evaluated the science and maintains there is no causal link, a position supported by the FDA and leading medical groups. This development is the latest instance of Kennedy using his position at HHS to challenge established medical consensus, following his actions on vaccine policy.

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Experience Largest Single-Day Decline in Over a Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 15:25:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% after a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This decline offers potential relief for homebuyers facing high housing prices, as it could lower monthly payments by a noticeable amount. For example, the monthly payment on a $450,000 home would decrease by approximately $169. However, it remains uncertain whether this drop is substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as mortgage demand has remained low and some analysts believe rates need to fall into the 5% range to make a significant impact.</p>

          <p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who built a national profile by opposing abortion rights, suing companies over diversity initiatives, and defending Donald Trump, has been appointed as a co-deputy director of the FBI. An Iraq war veteran, Bailey's rapid political ascent saw him use his office to engage in high-profile culture-war lawsuits. His appointment comes as the FBI faces accusations of politicization and heavy turnover under the Trump administration. Critics express concern that his track record of performative and partisan legal action will now be applied at a national level with the full power of federal law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, though the outlet has been given an opportunity to file an amended complaint. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that the initial suit was an impermissible "shotgun complaint" because its counts improperly incorporated all previous allegations. Newsmax accused Fox News of monopolistic behavior to suppress conservative media competitors through intimidation and other tactics. Fox News dismissed the lawsuit as an attempt by Newsmax to compensate for its own competitive failures. Newsmax stated it views the dismissal as a technical matter and intends to refile.</p>

Former president Dmitry Medvedev often refers to her as an "evil aunt gynecologist," reducing her extensive political career to her brief time as a doctor. Experts suggest these smear campaigns are intended to ridicule and delegitimize her, weaken the EU, and are fueled by her strong support for Ukraine and her gender.

          <p>In response to the resignation of his deputy, Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has executed a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle in an effort to assert authority and refocus his government. Instead of a simple replacement, Starmer has recast his top team, appointing new home and foreign secretaries. This decisive action is seen as an attempt to seize momentum after a difficult first year in office marked by declining approval ratings. The move is a high-stakes gamble to re-energize the government and demonstrate a commitment to delivery ahead of looming political battles.</p>

          <p>Tesla's latest strategic document, "Master Plan IV," indicates a significant pivot away from its core business of selling electric cars to focus primarily on artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, and autonomous robotaxis. The plan makes no mention of new vehicle models, instead envisioning a future of "sustainable abundance" enabled by Tesla-made robots. This shift comes as Tesla's auto sales have collapsed globally and competition from Chinese EV makers has intensified. Critics suggest the move is an overly ambitious gamble on unproven technology at the expense of the successful car business that generates nearly all of the company's revenue.</p>

The ruling noted that the company had no clear policy prohibiting such use and that the business owner herself used her work computer for personal reasons.

          <p>A significant portion of the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles will be partially closed this weekend, marking the start of a multi-year repaving project through the heavily trafficked Sepulveda Pass. The freeway will be reduced to three lanes in each direction between Van Nuys and Westwood, and transportation officials are urging motorists to find alternate routes. The $143.7-million project is scheduled for completion in late 2028 or early 2029 and will ultimately restore 92 miles of lanes. This is the first of up to 25 weekend closures required to complete the extensive infrastructure upgrades.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved legislation raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This marks a significant change from the $10,000 cap imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The SALT deduction, which primarily benefits taxpayers in states with high income and property taxes like New York and California, was previously unlimited for over a century. While the higher cap provides tax relief for some households, it is projected by the Joint Committee on Taxation to increase the national debt by more than $142 billion over the next decade.</p>

This unprecedented secession from federal guidance signals a deep crisis in public health, with experts warning that the nation's defenses against infectious diseases are being dangerously eroded.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense back to its historical name, the "Department of War." Trump argued the name has a "stronger sound" and is associated with a time when the U.S. consistently won wars. The department was renamed in 1947 as part of a post-World War II restructuring aimed at integrating the armed services and shifting focus toward deterring major conflicts in the nuclear age. Critics worry that reverting to the old name implies a more aggressive and bellicose foreign policy, moving away from the strategic goal of deterrence.</p>

The attacks occurred in California, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. The breakthrough came after DNA from two 1980s Ventura County cases were matched and then linked to other unsolved crimes through a national database. Investigative genealogy identified McNulty as a potential suspect, and his DNA was confirmed using a biological sample retained from a 1997 Indiana case. Authorities are now working to notify the surviving victims, providing long-awaited closure.</p>
