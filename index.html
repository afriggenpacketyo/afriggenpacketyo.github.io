        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has adjusted his promise to halt migrant arrivals on small boats within two weeks of gaining power. He clarified on a BBC program that this two-week timeline would begin only after new, stringent deportation laws are passed, a process that could take months. This shift comes after the pledge was a key announcement at his party's conference, where he outlined plans to detain and deport illegal migrants, potentially disregarding international treaties like the Refugee Convention. The clarification raises questions about the feasibility of his initial bold promise.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system for mobile phones on Sunday, September 7th, around 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks. The upcoming test aims to address technical issues from the first trial in April 2023, where some users received multiple alerts or none at all. The alert will cause compatible phones to vibrate and emit a siren sound, and while opting out is possible, the government advises against it for safety reasons.</p>

          <p>Actor Steve Buscemi has revealed that most people, including himself for a long time, have been mispronouncing his last name. During an interview, he explained that while the traditional Italian way is "Boo-shemi," his family pronounced it "Bue-semi" growing up, and he now uses a hybrid "Boo-Semi." The topic arose from a running joke in his cameo on the series "The Studio," highlighting the common confusion. This follows a similar revelation from actor Denzel Washington, who also recently shared that his name has been pronounced incorrectly throughout his career.</p>

The discussion also covered a contentious Senate hearing with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., exploring how his anti-vaccine stance has gained traction with the MAGA base and its potential implications for public health.</p>

          <p>In one of the largest single-site immigration enforcement operations in U.S. history, federal authorities detained 475 workers at a Hyundai facility in Georgia.

However, columnist Arwa Mahdawi argues this stance is hypocritical given the Trump administration's efforts to defund public education programs like Head Start and promote censorship. The article suggests that while the first lady advocates for "watchful guidance" of AI, her family's embrace of technology seems more focused on financial gain. The author expresses skepticism that the administration's AI initiatives will genuinely benefit children, suspecting they may instead enrich tech allies.</p>

Elliott recommends refranchising the bottling business, divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, and refocusing investment on its dominant Frito-Lay North America and core beverage products. The firm believes these changes could unlock significant shareholder value, potentially increasing it by at least 50%. (not investment advice)</p>

She argues that renting has made her wealthier by allowing her to invest the proceeds from her home sales and focus on her business without the stress and hidden costs of property management. Joy points to underestimated expenses like renovations, repairs, property taxes, and the emotional labor of being a landlord as significant drawbacks to owning. For her, the flexibility and reduced mental load of renting currently outweigh the traditional benefits of building equity through homeownership.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conducted a major cabinet reshuffle following the resignation of his deputy, Angela Rayner, over a tax issue. The departure is a significant blow to Labour's claim of holding higher ethical standards and provides ammunition for Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. Key changes include moving Shabana Mahmood to Home Secretary to tackle immigration and Yvette Cooper to Foreign Secretary. The shakeup is seen as an attempt to regain control and accelerate the government's agenda, but critics within the party question if changing personnel will solve a perceived lack of clear political direction.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has expanded its operations in Gaza City and is calling on all remaining residents to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the south. The army specified a makeshift camp in Muwasi as a safe zone, promising field hospitals and aid, though aid groups warn such a large-scale displacement will worsen the severe humanitarian crisis. This order comes as parts of the city, home to nearly one million people, are already under evacuation orders ahead of expected heavy fighting. Throughout the nearly two-year war, Israeli strikes have previously hit areas that were declared safe zones.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old surfer was killed in a shark attack on Saturday while surfing with friends off a popular beach in northern Sydney, Australia. Authorities reported that the man was mauled by what is suspected to be a large shark, losing several limbs before his body was recovered from the water. Despite efforts by fellow surfers to bring him to shore and resuscitate him, his injuries were too severe. This is the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since 2022, and nearby beaches have been closed as a precaution while patrols search for the shark.</p>

          <p>China is designing a planetary defense mission to test its ability to deflect a potentially hazardous asteroid, a top space researcher has announced. The mission, which could launch as early as this year, will target a small asteroid tens of millions of kilometers from Earth. It will involve two spacecraft: an impactor designed to collide with the asteroid and an observer to measure the resulting orbital change, which is expected to be between 3 to 5 centimeters. If successful, China would become the second nation, after the United States, to demonstrate this crucial planetary defense capability.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic landslide in Sudan's remote Darfur region has left villagers digging with their bare hands to find hundreds of victims, according to the aid group Save the Children. The disaster, triggered by heavy rainfall, has devastated several villages, with death toll estimates ranging from a few hundred to over a thousand, including many children. Rescue and aid efforts are severely hampered by the area's remoteness and the ongoing civil war in Sudan, which has already created a massive humanitarian crisis. Aid workers described scenes of "destruction and devastation" and are struggling to deliver supplies to the few known survivors.</p>

An Israeli military inquiry quickly concluded the shooting was unintentional, but her family and a Washington Post investigation dispute this.

The event included speakers like Senator Eric Schmitt and Deputy Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon alongside individuals associated with white nationalism and secretive, men-only ultranationalist groups. Analysts note this demonstrates the increasing difficulty in distinguishing the mainstream Republican party under Trump from the anti-democratic, nationalist hard right. The conference showcased the influence of movements like Project 2025, which provides a blueprint for the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have reached new record highs, gaining about 35% this year to trade near $3,600 an ounce, driven by economic uncertainty and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Investors often turn to gold as a safe-haven asset during periods of political and financial instability. For those looking to gain exposure, most financial experts recommend using gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than buying physical bullion, as ETFs are more liquid, cost-effective, and tax-efficient. Despite the rally, advisors typically suggest limiting gold to a small portion, under 3%, of a diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

His story represents the Church's effort to connect with a digital generation, balancing modern life with faith.

Initially hailed as a progressive, Obama-era phenomenon that celebrated an immigrant's story, the show's optimistic tone now feels different in the current political climate. Academic Daniel Pollack-Pelzner notes that while the show's first act reflected a hopeful vision of America, the nation now seems to be living in its more polarized and tragic second act. The musical's legacy is now viewed through the lens of subsequent political divisions and a more critical perspective on the founding fathers.</p>

Investigators were aided by a trail of evidence left at the scene, including a blood-stained rope, a shell casing, and broken acrylic nails that were matched to Jimenez.
