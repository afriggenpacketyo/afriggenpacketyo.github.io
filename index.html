          <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is reportedly evaluating a potential acquisition of some of BP's assets, particularly its liquefied natural gas (LNG) holdings, fueling speculation about a possible takeover of the energy major. ADNOC's interest comes amid a period of underperformance by BP, making it an attractive target for larger industry players like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. While a full takeover by ADNOC is considered unlikely due to its primary focus on gas assets, the two companies have a history of collaboration across various geographies and energy sectors. BP is currently undertaking a strategic reset to restore investor confidence, including increasing oil and gas spending while reducing investments in renewables, aiming for $20 billion in divestments through 2027.

          <p>A severe heatwave has gripped northern India and Pakistan, with temperatures exceeding 45Â°C, prompting weather agencies to issue alerts and hospitals to brace for an influx of heatstroke patients.

          <p>Los Angeles has imposed a second night of curfew following nearly a week of unrest sparked by U.S. immigration raids, resulting in hundreds of arrests and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines. Mayor Karen Bass attributed the demonstrations to President Trump's immigration policies, which she claims have caused fear and panic among residents. The protests began after border patrol agents massed outside a Home Depot in a predominantly Latino area, leading to widespread demonstrations and clashes with law enforcement. Trump has vowed to "liberate" the city, while California Governor Gavin Newsom has accused the president of an "assault" on democracy, escalating tensions between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>China's military has called for the large-scale and centralized deployment of unmanned combat forces at key locations to maximize their potential in future conflicts, amidst rising tensions with the U.S. in the Indo-Pacific. The PLA Daily emphasized the need for innovative organization and applications of unmanned systems, highlighting their decisive role in conducting close-range precision strikes. Citing efforts by Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. to build unmanned systems forces, the PLA Daily argued that mass deployment of unmanned systems has become a consensus in military modernization. The competition between the U.S. and China in UAVs and unmanned systems is a key front in their intensifying strategic and technological rivalry.</p>

The protests began after border patrol agents massed outside a Home Depot in a predominantly Latino area, leading to the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines. While some argue that such protests can be used by authoritarian rulers to justify displays of force, others contend that failing to resist injustice leads to moral corruption. The protests' demands are clear: to prevent the arrest and deportation of neighbors and colleagues, highlighting the tension between symbolic resistance and concrete action in defending communities.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States are scheduled to hold a sixth round of negotiations in Oman this Sunday regarding Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, as confirmed by Oman's foreign minister. This announcement comes amid heightened regional tensions, prompting the U.S. to reduce its non-essential embassy staff in the Middle East due to potential unrest. The talks aim to reach an accord that could see the U.S. lift economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limitations on uranium enrichment. Failure to reach a deal could escalate tensions in the Middle East, potentially leading to economic instability in Iran or military action against Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>

MOAH can cause DNA damage and potentially increase the risk of cancer if consumed regularly over time, although the immediate food safety risk is considered low. The affected products include Jolly Rancher Hard Candy, Jolly Rancher 'Misfits' Gummies, Jolly Rancher Hard Candy Fruity 2 in 1, and Jolly Ranchers Berry Gummies. The FSA advises consumers to dispose of these products and urges businesses to remove them from the market, as The Hershey Company has been working to remove the affected Jolly Rancher products from the UK market since 2024.</p>

          <p>A juror in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes is facing scrutiny over potential lack of candor, raising concerns about the integrity of the jury. The defense is responding to the government's attempt to dismiss a Black juror from the case, with the U.S. Attorney's Office citing a lack of candor. Legal experts suggest that complications with the jury could lead to severe problems, including a possible mistrial, if the juror is biased or untruthful. The trial continues with testimony from Diddy's ex-girlfriend, who alleges instances of drug use and manipulation during their relationship.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called on officials to enhance their ability to anticipate challenges and accurately implement policies amidst a turbulent geopolitical environment. He emphasized the difficulty of promoting China's modernization with high-quality development, given the complex external situation. Li's comments come as China faces rising tensions with the West over trade and technology, with ongoing negotiations with the U.S. over tariffs and export controls, and a major trade summit with the European Union planned for July. Despite these challenges, American and Chinese officials have agreed in principle to a framework designed to de-escalate a feud over rare earths and sales of strategic technologies.</p>

          <p>China is making strides in the mass production of high-performance photonic chips, positioning the country for significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) has begun producing 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, which use light instead of electrical signals for data transmission. While Europe and the US are already established in the field, China's pilot production line is showing gains in technical performance by overcoming a global limit for high-speed optical links. TFLN is known for its ultra-fast electro-optic effect, high bandwidth, and low power consumption, making it a promising material for future technological advancements.</p>

Hunter and Chenery-Woods were convicted of using fraudulent practices to circumvent restrictions on ticket purchases, such as using multiple identities and credit cards. Ticketmaster denies any involvement in the uncapped resale market and claims to be committed to fair and secure ticketing.</p>

Frankie O'Reilly, who lost his partner Georgie to an Aids-related illness, participated in the project as a way to cope with his grief and honor his friend.

          <p>Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former Home Secretary Lord Leon Brittan, has criticized the decision to drop misconduct proceedings against Met Police officer Steve Rodhouse, who led an inquiry into false claims against her late husband. Lord Brittan was falsely accused of being part of a paedophile ring in Westminster, and Lady Brittan believes the dropped proceedings show a lack of professionalism and undermine her trust in the Met Police and the police watchdog. The Met Police investigation, Operation Midland, cost Â£2.5m and ran from November 2014 to March 2016, but the claims were later found to be false and made up by Carl Beech, who was jailed for perverting the course of justice and child sexual offences.

The Daily Mail criticizes the review as a "reckless splurge" that voters will be paying off for years, and the Metro calls it the "spend of austerity." The Times reports that the Chancellor will have "no choice" but to raise taxes to balance the books, while the Daily Telegraph claims the police and defense are being "sacrificed."

Despite Lee's pre-election promise to end the cycle of political revenge, he has launched special counsel investigations into Yoon's declaration of martial law and his wife's alleged corruption.
