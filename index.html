        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov was forced to retire from his fourth-round Wimbledon match against world number one Jannik Sinner after suffering a pectoral injury. Dimitrov was leading by two sets when he collapsed in pain after serving an ace in the third set. Visibly emotional, he received a standing ovation as he left Centre Court, unable to continue. This incident marks the latest in a series of injury-related withdrawals for Dimitrov from major tournaments, a recurring issue that has unfortunately plagued the latter part of his career.</p>

          <p>Dozens of lives were lost in the catastrophic flash floods that struck central Texas, including young campers, counselors, and families. This article shares the stories of some of the victims, such as Chloe Childress, a camp counselor remembered for her grace and compassion, and Julian Ryan, a father who died a hero while trying to save his family from their flooded trailer. Other victims include camp director Dick Eastland, who died trying to save campers, and several young children attending Camp Mystic. The accounts paint a heartbreaking picture of the individuals and the profound loss felt by their communities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially announced plans to impose steep tariffs on imports from at least 14 countries, with new rates taking effect on August 1. In letters posted to social media, President Trump detailed varying tariff levels, including 25% for Japan and South Korea, 30% for South Africa, and up to 40% for Laos and Myanmar. This move formalizes the 'reciprocal tariffs' first proposed in April, which were temporarily paused. The White House stated the tariffs are necessary to correct trade deficits, while warning targeted nations against retaliatory measures.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price dropped by nearly 7% following CEO Elon Musk's announcement that he has formed a new political entity called the 'America Party.' The move came after a public falling out with President Trump over a major policy and spending bill. Musk stated the party will focus on a small number of key Senate and House races to influence the legislative balance. Analysts suggest this deeper dive into politics is viewed negatively by investors, who worry about the potential impact on the Tesla brand and prefer Musk focus on the company during a period of declining sales.</p>

These urban areas can be up to 20 degrees hotter than greener neighborhoods, posing significant health risks as climate change intensifies heat waves.

          <p>Wage garnishment, a legal process where creditors take money directly from a debtor's paycheck, can be a prolonged and stressful experience. For most consumer debts, garnishment continues until the entire balance, including interest and fees, is paid off, which can take years. Federal law typically limits the amount to 25% of disposable income, but rules differ for student loans and tax debts, which often don't require a court order. Individuals facing garnishment can challenge it in court, negotiate with creditors, or consider bankruptcy to stop the process, highlighting the importance of addressing debt collection notices promptly.

          <h2>Analysis Shows Trump's New Tax Bill Does Not Eliminate Taxes on Social Security for Most Seniors</h2>

          <p>Tax experts are refuting claims from the Social Security Administration that President Trump's new tax and spending package will eliminate federal income taxes for nearly 90% of beneficiaries. While the bill includes a new $6,000 deduction for seniors, experts from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center state this will not eliminate taxes for most, but rather reduce the liability for some middle-income seniors. The deduction is an 'above-the-line' adjustment, which can indirectly lower the amount of benefits subject to tax. Critics also note the changes will reduce tax revenue, potentially worsening the Social Security program's long-term funding shortfall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Waymo, the autonomous driving technology company owned by Alphabet, has announced it will begin testing its vehicles in Philadelphia. The initial phase of testing will run through the fall and will involve a limited fleet of vehicles operating with human safety drivers behind the wheel. The company's vehicles will be manually driven through more complex areas like downtown while collecting mapping data to evaluate how its autonomous system handles the city's unique traffic and infrastructure. This expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to roll out its ride-sharing service in more major U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly called on Brazilian authorities to stop the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, labeling it a 'witch hunt.' In a social media post, Trump defended Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt, comparing the situation to his own legal battles. The comments prompted a sharp response from Brazil's current President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who stated that Brazil is a sovereign nation and will not accept interference from anyone. Lula emphasized that 'no one is above the law,' underscoring the diplomatic tension created by Trump's intervention.</p>

          <p>This editorial urges the UK's Labour government to handle its upcoming reforms for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) with more care than its recent, calamitous changes to welfare payments. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson faces a skeptical party and concerned parents as she prepares proposals that may alter the system of Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs). The article advises a transparent, consultative, and unhurried process, emphasizing the need to build cross-party consensus and avoid reforms driven solely by budget cuts. It suggests that ensuring a fair and effective system for vulnerable children must be the primary goal.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic humorously critiques the media's tendency to frame ordinary workplace behaviors as new, alarming 'trends' attributed to Gen Z. The author recounts a fictional worker's day using this sensationalized language, describing sleep as a 'Microdeath,' taking the subway as a 'Tiny Detox,' and using the restroom as a 'Microspa.' The piece mocks terms like 'quiet quitting' and 'micro-retirement' by applying the same logic to mundane activities like breathing ('Lung Bathing') and leaving the office at the end of the day ('Silent Retreats'). It serves as a commentary on workplace discourse and generational stereotypes.</p>

          <p>The devastating and deadly floods in central Texas were the result of a complex convergence of factors beyond just heavy rainfall. This analytical article from Vox explores why the event was so catastrophic, citing the region's 'flash flood alley' topography and the increasing moisture content in storms due to climate change. It also examines gaps in the disaster warning system, noting that alerts were sent late at night and some areas lacked sirens. The piece highlights how changing baselines for flood risk, population growth, and a tendency to underestimate danger contribute to such tragedies, making them difficult to prevent.</p>

The dollar's weakness has benefited U.S. stocks by making exports cheaper but has also fueled discussion about the end of its global dominance.
