            <p>A dozen masked individuals have been charged with felony vandalism and conspiracy to trespass after allegedly breaking into a Stanford University building during an anti-Israel protest in June 2024. Prosecutors allege the group caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage, including breaking windows, disabling security cameras, and defacing property with fake blood and anti-Semitic graffiti. The protesters, some of whom are current or former Stanford students, barricaded themselves inside the building and listed a series of demands related to the university's investments in companies doing business with Israel. The incident reflects a broader trend of anti-Israel protests on university campuses across the U.S.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has instructed the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a lower court order requiring the government to assist in Garcia's release from custody and ensure his case is handled as if he had not been improperly deported. While the court acknowledged the administration's concerns about foreign affairs, it emphasized the need to address the error in Garcia's deportation. The case highlights the complexities of immigration enforcement and the potential for administrative errors.</p>

            <p>Financial markets experienced renewed turmoil following a short-lived rally sparked by President Trump's partial pause on global tariffs. Investor optimism quickly faded amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding trade policies, particularly the escalating trade war with China. Despite positive news regarding EU tariff suspensions and cooling inflation, stocks declined, reflecting investor concerns about the economic impact of the tariffs. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen criticized Trump's policies as a "self-inflicted wound" on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has instructed the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The court's order requires the government to assist in Garcia's release and ensure his case is handled properly, but it also raises questions about the extent to which the courts can compel the administration's actions. The Supreme Court acknowledged the illegality of the Trump administration's removal of Garcia to El Salvador. The court's decision is a partial rebuke to the administration's immigration policies.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court's decision to uphold part of a lower-court order requiring the Trump administration to seek the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has created a dangerous moment. The administration had acknowledged it mistakenly dispatched Abrego Garcia, who was allowed to stay in the US because he was likely to be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador. Trump's policies are now colliding with the justices' expectation that he will abide by their decisions, creating the possibility that the administration may defy the court order.</p>

China announced more countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%, not 125% as initially announced by Mr. Trump on social media.

Several papers also feature royal stories, including Prince Harry's visit to Ukraine and Queen Camilla's visit to Italy.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's effort to bring inflation down to 2%. On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years. Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis. However, tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect, such as auto tariffs, so inflation could pick up later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>According to a contributor, President Trump's decision to impose tariffs on China is a necessary step to reset the U.S.-China economic relationship. The contributor argues that past policies of welcoming China into the global economy have not worked out as planned, citing intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and the decimation of America's manufacturing base. The contributor believes that Trump is the right person to confront China and protect American interests.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court just ruled that the immigrant at the heart of the case get some relief — but that relief is only partial. The Trump administration claims that Abrego Garcia was deported as the result of an “administrative error.” The judge ordered the federal government to “facilitate and effectuate the return of [Abrego Garcia] to the United States. The Supreme Court concludes that the lower court’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.</p>
