          <h2>Federal Judge Halts Rule to Remove Medical Debt from Credit Reports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 13:56:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Texas has blocked a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that aimed to remove approximately $49 billion in medical debt from consumers' credit reports. The court ruled that the CFPB overstepped its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This decision impacts around 15 million Americans, as the now-vacated rule was intended to prevent medical debt, which is often considered a poor indicator of creditworthiness, from negatively affecting loan eligibility. The future of the rule is uncertain, given recent leadership changes and directives within the CFPB.</p>

          <p>John Torode has been fired as a presenter on the BBC's "MasterChef" after an independent investigation upheld an allegation that he used "an extremely offensive racist term." Torode stated he has no memory of the incident but acknowledges that such language is unacceptable. This follows the recent dismissal of his co-host, Gregg Wallace, over separate allegations, placing the popular cooking show's future in question. The BBC's director general confirmed the decision, emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy for racist language within the organization.</p>

          <p>Dan Serafini, a former Major League Baseball pitcher, has been found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2021 killing of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr. A California jury also convicted the 51-year-old of the attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood, who survived the attack but later died by suicide. Prosecutors argued the motive was related to a financial dispute over a home renovation project. Serafini, who played for several MLB teams including the Minnesota Twins and Chicago Cubs, is scheduled for sentencing in August.</p>

          <p>The family of Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Florida, is calling on the Trump administration to prosecute the Israeli settlers who beat him to death in the occupied West Bank. Musallet was reportedly protecting his family's farm from attackers when he was killed. At a press conference, his family criticized the U.S. government for a perceived lack of action and demanded accountability for the murder. This incident is part of a rising wave of settler violence in the West Bank, where hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since October 2023.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education has announced that interest will begin accruing again on August 1 for the roughly 8 million federal student loan borrowers enrolled in the SAVE repayment plan. These borrowers had been in an interest-free administrative forbearance for about a year due to legal challenges against the plan. While monthly payments are not yet required, balances will now start to grow. The department is urging borrowers to switch to other legally compliant income-driven repayment plans, as the SAVE plan itself is slated for elimination by 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) indicated that the annual inflation rate rose to 2.7% in June, a slight increase from 2.4% in May. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this rise was driven by higher grocery prices, which were partially offset by a decrease in gasoline prices. Economists suggest that the full inflationary impact of the Trump administration's tariffs has not yet been felt by consumers but is expected to become more apparent in the coming months. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was up 2.9% over the last 12 months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an unexplained emergency ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to dismantle the Department of Education while legal challenges continue in lower courts. The administration aims to close the agency, which it has called a "big con job," by significantly cutting its workforce. A lower court had previously blocked these actions, but the Supreme Court's majority lifted that injunction without providing any reasoning. The dissenting justices warned that the decision poses a grave threat to the separation of powers and allows the president to nullify laws passed by Congress.</p>

          <p>Significant cuts to U.S. foreign aid under the Trump administration are creating uncertainty for humanitarian and development projects across the Middle East. Countries like Yemen, Jordan, and Egypt have historically relied on this funding for everything from emergency food to economic stability. With the U.S. reducing its contributions, a funding gap is emerging that is unlikely to be filled in the short term. Experts suggest that wealthy Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE may increase their roles as donors, but this could lead to aid being used more transactionally for political objectives.</p>
