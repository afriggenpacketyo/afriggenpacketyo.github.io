          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily reinstated President Trump's tariffs, suspending a lower court's ruling that deemed them illegal. The move comes after the White House argued that the lower court's decision overstepped its authority and threatened ongoing trade negotiations. Small businesses and states had challenged the tariffs, which are central to Trump's economic agenda, arguing that the president exceeded his powers. The legal battle raises questions about the limits of presidential authority in trade policy and foreign relations (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>David Brooks, an opinion columnist, expresses his anger at statements made by Patrick Deneen and JD Vance, who suggest soldiers are primarily motivated by loyalty to their unit rather than ideals. Brooks argues that these statements reflect a moral decay at the core of Trumpism, which he sees as an attempt to reduce people to their most primitive instincts. He contends that Trumpism disregards the higher aspirations of the human spirit and the commitment to larger causes that have historically motivated individuals. The article serves as a broader critique of the values and principles underlying the Trump administration's policies.</p>
