          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, killing 241 passengers and crew and causing casualties on the ground, specifically at a medical college. The flight, AI171, was en route to London Gatwick Airport when it went down minutes after departure. Indian authorities, along with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the crash. One passenger survived and is being treated at a local hospital, while the live tracking site Flight Radar reported receiving a final signal from the aircraft seconds after takeoff. The cause of the crash remains unclear, but investigators have recovered at least one of the "black boxes" from the wreckage.</p>

          <p>Israel initiated "Operation Rising Lion," launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear sites, military commanders, and research scientists, prompting Iran to retaliate by launching over 100 drones at Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation aimed to roll back the Iranian threat, while IDF spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said Israeli intelligence uncovered an Iranian plan to destroy Israel. The Israeli military claimed to have destroyed Iran's air defenses and eliminated senior Iranian security leaders, including the Iranian Chief of Staff, Commander of the Revolutionary Guards, and Head of the Emergency Command. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte urged de-escalation, but Iranian officials threatened retaliation, and the U.S. Embassy in Israel ordered American personnel to shelter in place.</p>

          <p>Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear facilities triggered a surge in oil prices and a shift by investors towards safer assets like government bonds and gold. The Brent global benchmark for oil prices rose significantly, reaching a multi-month high, while Asian and European stock markets experienced declines. The conflict prompted several airlines to cancel flights to the region, and Israeli airlines relocated some of their planes overseas. Analysts warn that an all-out war between Israel and Iran could disrupt energy markets and trade routes, potentially leading to a global recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Facing rising grocery costs, consumers are increasingly turning to generic or store brands, often perceived as inferior, but food experts say that generic brands can be just as good as name brands. Experts note that in many cases, generic products are made by the same manufacturers as name-brand counterparts, with minimal nutritional differences. The shift toward generic brands was also influenced by product shortages during the pandemic, prompting consumers to try alternative options. While some suggest splurging on ingredients that significantly impact flavor, many generic pantry staples are praised for their comparable quality.</p>

This breakthrough by the Qinghai Institute of Salt Lakes (ISL) could significantly reduce China's reliance on rubidium imports, primarily from Canada. The new method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, providing a domestic source for this strategically important material. Rubidium is used in various high-tech applications, including perovskite solar cells and atomic clocks.</p>

The strikes, which targeted Iran's nuclear program and resulted in the death of a top Iranian military commander, prompted Trump to emphasize the potential for further bloodshed if a deal is not reached.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, arguing it was discriminatory and in breach of human rights law. The government defended the policy, stating it would raise Â£1.8bn a year to improve standards in the state sector. Claims were brought by families with children with special educational needs, those attending same-sex schools, and low-paying faith schools, but the court found that the government was entitled to prioritize revenue for public services. Head teachers have indicated plans to appeal the judgment.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the House reconciliation legislation, known as the 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill,' reveals that proposed changes aimed at boosting family finances depend largely on income, with potential reductions in aid for low-income families. While proposed tax cuts may provide increased take-home pay for the average family, households in the lowest income bracket could lose approximately $1,600 per year due to reductions in in-kind transfers, particularly Medicaid and SNAP. The enhanced child tax credit and new work requirements may exclude millions of low-income children from receiving the full benefit.</p>

The allegations starkly contrast Tait's public image of piety, given his songs often promoted abstinence and sobriety, and he served as a bridge between the evangelical community and Donald Trump.
