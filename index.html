          <p>An ICE official testified that the agency has no plan for where to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he is released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and is now back in the U.S. facing human trafficking charges. His attorneys are fighting to ensure he receives due process and is not removed to a third country without a proper hearing. A federal judge expressed frustration with the government's lack of clarity, likening the situation to "trying to nail Jello to a wall."</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has released stunning new images celebrating its third anniversary, revealing a vibrant star-forming region within the Cat's Paw Nebula. The images show young, massive stars carving through gas and dust, creating a colorful cosmic landscape about 4,000 light-years from Earth. These observations provide new insights into the lifecycle of stars and the dynamic processes that shape galaxies. The telescope continues to exceed expectations, uncovering previously hidden aspects of the universe.</p>

          <p>The White House has escalated its criticism of the Federal Reserve, with Budget Director Russell Vought accusing Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement. Vought's letter alleges the Fed's headquarters renovation is vastly over budget, costing up to $2.5 billion, and questions whether Powell misled Congress about project details like VIP dining rooms and water features. This new line of attack raises questions about whether the administration will seek to remove Powell for cause, a move that would face significant legal hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in the Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 120 deaths, with Kerr County being the most severely affected region. Search and rescue operations are still underway for 161 missing people, including campers and a counselor. The disaster has prompted a federal disaster declaration and raised serious questions about the effectiveness and timing of local emergency alert systems. Officials waited nearly 90 minutes to issue an alert after it was first requested by a firefighter as floodwaters rose rapidly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the catastrophic flooding in Texas, disaster preparedness experts are outlining crucial safety measures for flash floods. Key advice includes understanding your area's flood risk, creating a household emergency plan, and packing a "go bag" with essentials well before a storm hits. During a flood, the priority is to get to higher ground immediately and never attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters, as just six inches can sweep a person away. After the event, residents should wait for the all-clear from authorities before returning home.</p>

          <p>As the economic landscape shifts with anticipated interest rate cuts, savers are advised to be more strategic with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. The article highlights three key mistakes to avoid this summer: assuming CD rates will only drop after official Fed action, getting distracted by higher short-term rates, and failing to calculate potential earnings before depositing. Proactively locking in a high-rate, long-term CD now could protect savings against future rate decreases and maximize overall returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will take a significant step toward robotic umpires by using the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System during its upcoming All-Star Game. Each team will receive two challenges that can be initiated by the batter, pitcher, or catcher to review a ball or strike call, with successful challenges being retained. The system uses Hawk-Eye technology to track the pitch, and its use in the showcase event will serve as a major test for potential implementation in the 2026 regular season. Human umpire accuracy has already improved dramatically due to pitch-tracking analysis.</p>

          <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has announced it will not assist contractors in dismantling a controversial loyalist bonfire in south Belfast. The decision came after a multi-agency risk assessment concluded that intervening to remove the structure would pose a greater risk of public disorder than letting it proceed. The bonfire, built near an electricity substation and on a site containing asbestos, had raised significant safety concerns for critical hospital infrastructure and public health. Bonfire builders had voluntarily removed some tiers before the police decision was announced.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own proprietary hardware to provide liquid cooling for Nvidia's next-generation AI chips, like the Blackwell series. This in-house solution allows Amazon to upgrade its existing data centers for the new, hotter chips without the time and expense of building new facilities. The development is a positive for both Amazon and Nvidia, as it will enable faster deployment of the powerful new AI hardware. This move is not expected to materially impact industrial suppliers like Eaton or Dover. (not investment advice)</p>

The Biden-era program had allowed individuals from Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to live and work in the U.S. for two years. Workers were asked by Amazon to provide updated permits and were dismissed when they could not, leaving them unemployed and in a precarious immigration status.

          <p>A Department of Justice whistleblower has provided the Senate Judiciary Committee with messages and emails that appear to support his claim that a top official, Emil Bove, defied court orders. The initial complaint alleged Bove told lawyers to ignore court orders blocking deportations to El Salvador. The new evidence reportedly shows Bove approving the deplaning of migrants on foreign soil even after a U.S. judge had ordered the flights to return. Bove, who is being considered for a federal judgeship, has denied ever advising a DOJ attorney to violate a court order.</p>

          <p>Sweden's Migration Minister, Johan Forssell, has confirmed that his 16-year-old son was the individual recently reported by an anti-racism watchdog to have links to far-right extremist groups. Forssell stated he was unaware of his son's online activities until being notified by security services and will not resign. He explained that his son is deeply remorseful and has since cut off all contact with the groups. The revelation has prompted accusations of double standards against the center-right government, which collaborates with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats party.</p>

          <p>Joe Root demonstrated exceptional grit, finishing the day one run short of a century with an unbeaten 99, to guide England to 251-4 against India at Lord's.

The hosts were in precarious positions at 44-2 and later 172-4, but Root's steadying presence, including a key partnership with Ollie Pope, held the innings together. Captain Ben Stokes provided support with 39 not out, though he appeared to be struggling with an injury.</p>

The nation's capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and its flag closely resembles the American flag. Liberia's foreign minister stated they were not offended, seeing it as a reflection of a lack of global understanding about Africa.</p>

The center reportedly consists of FEMA tents and trailers with a capacity for up to 3,000 detainees. The announcement has drawn criticism, while also highlighting the ecological challenges of the region, where the python population is estimated to be in the tens of thousands.</p>
