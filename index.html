            <p>Nvidia announced it expects to record a $5.5 billion charge related to H20 graphics processing units due to new U.S. export license requirements for China and other destinations, causing the stock to slide in extended trading. The U.S. government imposed the license requirement after determining the chips could be used for military supercomputers. CEO Jensen Huang previously noted that revenue from China had already decreased significantly due to export controls, with competition from companies like Huawei increasing. This development underscores the challenges Nvidia faces amidst escalating geopolitical tensions and export restrictions, potentially impacting its historic growth trajectory.

            <p>March retail sales increased by 1.4%, surpassing estimates and indicating strong consumer spending despite declining sentiment and looming tariffs, according to the Commerce Department. Motor vehicle sales saw a significant surge of 5.3% as consumers anticipated potential price hikes due to President Trump's tariffs. This report contrasts with recent sentiment surveys reflecting fears of economic recession and rising prices due to the tariffs. Economists suggest consumers are rushing to purchase goods before prices increase, treating the current market as a clearance sale. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Court of Appeal has been asked to review the life sentence with a minimum term of 49 years given to Nicholas Prosper, who murdered his mother, brother, and sister in Luton and planned a school shooting. The solicitor general referred the case after requests to reconsider Prosper's sentence under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, arguing for a whole life order. Prosper had planned to murder his family and then continue the killing at his former primary school, but was stopped by neighbors who called the police. The judge did not issue a whole life order after considering guidance relating to Prosper's age and lack of previous convictions.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Maine, challenging its policy regarding transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sports, alleging a violation of Title IX. Attorney General Pam Bondi asserted that Maine's policy prioritizes gender identity over biological reality, depriving girl athletes of fair competition and exposing them to risks. The lawsuit is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to highlight the issue, which they view as politically damaging for Democrats. Maine's Governor Janet Mills criticized the administration's actions as executive overreach.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that doctors in two end-of-life cases can be named, overturning previous court orders that barred their identification, after the parents of two children involved in life support treatment disputes sought to "tell their story." The ruling emphasizes the importance of freedom of speech and public interest in the treatment of patients in public hospitals. The court acknowledged the need to protect medical staff against unfounded accusations but sided with the families' right to share their experiences. The trusts involved expressed condolences and affirmed their commitment to acting in the best interests of patients while safeguarding their staff.</p>

            <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) warned that the outlook for global trade has "deteriorated sharply" due to the surge in tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, anticipating a 0.2% decline in world merchandise trade volume in 2025. This decline is particularly steep in North America, where exports are forecasted to drop by 12.6%. The WTO cautioned that reciprocal tariffs and broader policy uncertainty could further reduce global goods trade by 1.5%, posing risks for least-developed countries. This forecast marks a significant reversal from earlier expectations of continued trade expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

He also noted robust trading in the UK and highlighted the company's US business's reliance on local food and snack suppliers.

            <p>Federal authorities have indicted the top two leaders of the Mexican drug cartel La Nueva Familia Michoacana, Johnny Hurtado Olascoaga and Jose Alfredo Hurtado Olascoaga, and are offering up to $8 million for information leading to their capture and conviction. The brothers are accused of participating in a conspiracy to manufacture and distribute drugs in the United States. The State Department is offering the rewards, and the Treasury announced new sanctions against the men, who are believed to be in Mexico. The cartel is known for drug trafficking, extortions, kidnappings, and murders.</p>

            <p>Proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could significantly impact low-income shoppers and retailers. House Republicans are seeking to cut $230 billion from the USDA budget over the next decade, with most savings coming from SNAP funding. SNAP shoppers tend to come from larger households and spend 20% more on groceries. Retailers like Walmart, Kroger, and General Mills could see sales declines, while dollar stores like Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which cater to lower-income shoppers, are most exposed to any changes in SNAP benefits.

            <p>New US export restrictions on Nvidia's H20 AI chips are expected to disrupt China's Big Tech firms and force them to shift to domestic semiconductor alternatives, such as those from Huawei. Nvidia's China business is likely to decline significantly. The H20 chip, designed for the Chinese market, has become a key hardware component for LLM training.

            <p>Chinese researchers have developed new underwater acoustic technology that could enhance the country's submarine detection capabilities near Alaskan waters. The innovation allows for pinpointing the depth of low-frequency sound sources with near-perfect accuracy in the Arctic's Beaufort Sea. This development marks a significant step in China's undersea warfare capabilities in the northern backyard of the United States. The technology leverages the Beaufort Sea's "double duct" acoustic environment to improve sonar systems.</p>

            <p>The Associated Press (AP) reported that its reporters were prevented from attending an Oval Office event despite a federal judge's order to restore the news outlet's access. The White House is changing the makeup of the press pool, removing a spot designated for news wire services like the AP, prompting criticism from the White House Correspondents' Association. A federal judge ruled last week that the White House cannot deny AP journalists access due to its refusal to use the name Gulf of America in its Stylebook.</p>

            <p>The Roman Republic was transformed into a dictatorship in about 80 years, with Augustus dismantling the republic and founding a monarchy. Augustus consolidated power with the support of wealthy aristocrats and the complacence of a population exhausted by conflict. He gradually took control of the government, with the institutional blessing of the Senate, who let him bend rules and accumulate domestic powers. The lesson of the Roman Republic's fate is that once you've allowed one man to rule as a monarch, you are past the point of no return.</p>

            <p>Harvard University is refusing to comply with the Trump administration's demands, resulting in a freeze of $2.2 billion in federal funds. The university's president, Alan Garber, stated that no government should dictate what private universities can teach. The Trump administration accused Harvard of a "troubling entitlement mindset." Harvard is able to weather the storm due to its $53.2 billion endowment, but experts say it will still be impacted by the funding loss and the potential removal of its tax-exempt status.</p>
