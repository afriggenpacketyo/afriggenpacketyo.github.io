        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A petroleum analyst predicts that US gasoline prices will be their cheapest since 2021, potentially dropping below $3 a gallon by September. The recent price spike, driven by the Israel-Iran conflict, is expected to be temporary, with prices resuming a slow decline. Factors contributing to the expected drop include the switch to summer-blend gasoline leveling off, increased refinery production, and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Despite recent volatility, the article notes that, adjusted for inflation, gas prices are near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new film 'F1', directed by Joseph Kosinski, is reviewed as a compelling and straightforward underdog sports drama set in the world of Formula One racing. Starring Brad Pitt as an aging driver and Damson Idris as his rookie teammate, the movie focuses on the internal team rivalry, which the director describes as "chess at 200 miles an hour." The article praises the film for its fidelity to the sport's technical details while grounding the story in a familiar but effective character study. It successfully avoids the pitfalls of previous racing movies by focusing on human drama amidst the high-octane action.</p>

          <p>Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claiming a significant military victory over Iran, recent polling indicates his popularity among Israelis has not seen a major boost. A majority of Israelis, 59%, still want the war in Gaza to end in exchange for hostages, and many believe he is prolonging the conflict for personal political survival. The article highlights that "trust" is a major issue for Netanyahu, who also faces ongoing corruption charges. Experts suggest that calling early elections would be a significant risk for the long-serving leader.</p>

          <p>Activists in Budapest are proceeding with the annual Pride march despite threats of "legal consequences" from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event defies a new "child protection" law that restricts gatherings seen as promoting homosexuality, with attendees facing potential fines and organizers facing prison time. Organizers and participants, including EU officials, are marching to defend LGBTQ rights and promote diversity in the face of increasing pressure from the nationalist conservative government. The city's liberal mayor has co-organized the event, asserting it does not require police approval.</p>

          <p>A series of recent military actions against Iran and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, has reasserted Israel's military dominance and significantly altered the regional power balance. The conflicts, which began with the October 7th attack, have decimated Iran's network of proxies and removed other regional rivals, creating a new strategic landscape. However, the article notes that these military successes have not resolved underlying political disputes, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel's international reputation has also suffered due to the humanitarian crisis and high civilian death toll in Gaza.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses the case of a Norwegian man who claimed he was denied entry to the U.S. partly because of a meme of Vice President JD Vance saved on his phone. While the Department of Homeland Security stated the denial was due to "admitted drug use," the author argues the incident's believability highlights America's damaged international image and slide towards authoritarianism. The article suggests that the proliferation of such memes reflects a "cringe" political era where embarrassing figures wield significant power, eroding free speech and democratic norms.</p>

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Republican leaders are using his win as a new line of attack. They are depicting the Democratic Party as embracing "radical socialists" and being out of touch with mainstream America. National Republican groups and figures like RNC Chair Michael Whatley are linking Mamdani's progressive platform to the national Democratic party to energize their base. In response, some moderate Democrats have distanced themselves, while others have defended Mamdani against what they call Islamophobic attacks from the right.</p>

          <p>With record heatwaves sweeping parts of the U.S., child safety advocates are issuing urgent warnings about the danger of children dying from heatstroke in hot vehicles. So far this year, nine children have died after being left in cars, with an average of 38 such deaths annually. Experts stress that a vehicle's interior can heat up by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes, and a child's body temperature rises three to five times faster than an adult's. They urge caregivers to create reminders, such as leaving a personal item in the backseat, to prevent tragic accidents.</p>

Schaefer, a highly-regarded prospect from the OHL's Erie Otters, is known for his strong defensive skills and puck-moving ability.

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled against the use of nationwide injunctions, a significant shift in the remedial power of federal courts. The case, *Trump v. Casa*, concerned a challenge to an executive order on birthright citizenship, but the ruling focused solely on the remedy, not the order's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion argued that such broad injunctions, which halt a policy for everyone, lack historical precedent. While this ends the practice, the Court left open other avenues for broad relief, such as class-action lawsuits and providing "complete relief" to plaintiffs.</p>

His campaign's success is presented as evidence that Palestine has become a central issue in domestic politics, mobilizing a base that rejects the Democratic establishment's pro-Israel stance.
