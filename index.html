            <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren cautioned that U.S. markets would experience a significant downturn if President Trump were to dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Warren emphasized the importance of the Fed's independence from political influence for market stability.

            <p>An Atlantic article argues that Trump's power grab to arrest and deport individuals to El Salvador, bypassing the American legal system, threatens the Constitution. The author suggests Trump's actions could allow him to imprison any dissident with the cooperation of foreign strongmen. The article highlights the influence of post-liberal thought on the right, which advocates for using state power to entrench right-wing control. It warns of a potential expansion of denaturalization and deportation efforts.</p>
