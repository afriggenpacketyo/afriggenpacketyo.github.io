            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary Easter truce in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening until Sunday midnight, though previous attempts at ceasefires have failed. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy responded that Ukraine would mirror the approach if Russia genuinely observed a full ceasefire, suggesting an extension beyond Easter. Simultaneously, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner exchange mediated by the UAE, marking the largest exchange since the war began. This announcement came after frustrations from the Trump administration, with Secretary of State Rubio indicating a potential withdrawal from peace talks if progress isn't made soon.</p>

            <p>Free breakfast clubs are set to launch in 750 schools across England, offering half an hour of free morning childcare to thousands of parents as part of a trial. The scheme, running until July, aims to provide up to 95 additional hours of childcare and save parents Â£450 annually. While welcomed by headteachers, concerns have been raised by teaching unions about insufficient government funding to meet the costs, potentially impacting other school provisions. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the move would help with "breaking down barriers to opportunity".</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily blocked deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The ACLU argued that the deportations were proceeding without due process and in violation of a previous Supreme Court order. The Trump administration invoked the AEA, claiming the migrants were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU also expressed concern about the migrants being deported to El Salvador.</p>
