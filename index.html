        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the significant reliance of the Pentagon and NASA on Elon Musk's companies, such as SpaceX, President Trump has potential avenues to exert pressure on Musk. Even if terminating federal contracts proves unfeasible due to this dependence, the administration could intensify federal oversight of Musk's various business ventures. This could involve closer scrutiny of operations, compliance, and potentially, the imposition of stricter regulations. This strategy would allow the government to wield influence without disrupting essential services provided by Musk's companies. The government may be trying to find a way to gain leverage. The optimism score reflects the potential for ongoing tension and possible market instability.</p>
