          <p>The United States and China have reportedly reached a framework agreement regarding the popular social media platform TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The deal, which is between two private parties, has commercial terms that have been agreed upon and will be discussed by President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday. This framework could potentially shift the platform towards U.S.-controlled ownership, addressing national security concerns previously raised. The agreement comes ahead of a looming deadline for ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its U.S. operations or face a potential ban in the country. Optimism here reflects the avoidance of a potential ban and a resolution to a complex geopolitical issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the Charlie Kirk shooting, seemingly confessed to the crime on Discord hours before his arrest, according to a company spokesperson. In messages to friends, Robinson appeared to take responsibility for the shooting at Utah Valley University. The messages surfaced after a nearly two-day manhunt following the fatal shooting during an outdoor event. Discord's internal investigation found no evidence Robinson planned or promoted violence on the platform. Robinson faces charges of aggravated murder, obstruction, and firearm offenses, with the state seeking the death penalty, which reflects the severity of the crime.</p>

          <p>The United States has designated Colombia as failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly 30 years, a rebuke reflecting rising cocaine production and strained relations with President Gustavo Petro. Despite the designation, the Trump administration issued a waiver to avoid major aid cuts, citing U.S. national interests. President Petro expressed regret, highlighting Colombia's sacrifices in the U.S.-led drug war. This decision underscores a shift in U.S.-Colombia relations and concerns over Colombia's counternarcotics efforts, with manual eradication of coca crops slowing under Petro's leadership, which reflects a disagreement on policy.</p>

Utah prosecutors are expected to indict Robinson for first-degree murder, with the possibility of the death penalty.

          <p>Baker Mayfield orchestrated a game-winning drive, leading the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a 20-19 victory over the Houston Texans on Monday Night Football. The drive culminated in a two-yard touchdown run by Rachaad White with just six seconds remaining. Mayfield threw for 215 yards and two touchdowns, with a crucial fourth-down scramble extending the final drive. The Texans, led by CJ Stroud, initially took the lead, but failed to maintain momentum in the second half, with a blocked punt and defensive fumble keeping the game close, and the final score reflects the Buccaneers' resilience and clutch performance.</p>

          <p>California's legislature has passed a bill to designate Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official state holiday, potentially allowing community colleges and public schools to close. The bill, awaiting Governor Newsom's signature, aims to recognize the religious and historical importance of Diwali and enable greater participation in the festivities. Diwali, celebrated over five days, marks the beginning of the new year in the Hindu calendar and honors Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. This move signifies increasing recognition and representation for the South Asian community in California, where it is the largest such population in the US.</p>

Delta and Aeromexico expressed disappointment, stating the move will harm U.S. jobs and consumers, though they will continue to offer flights on each other's airlines and maintain frequent flyer reciprocity.
