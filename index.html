          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose new tariffs on 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, by August 1. The levies vary significantly, with rates as high as 40% for nations like Myanmar and Laos, while Japan and South Korea face 25% duties. This move comes as the White House extends a freeze on a separate set of previously announced tariffs, pushing their implementation date to August 1 to allow for further negotiations. The administration stated the new tariffs are intended to address trade imbalances, but economists have expressed concerns about their potential to fuel inflation and hinder global economic growth.

          <h2>Meteorological Data Reveals Scale of Rainfall in Catastrophic Texas Floods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 19:35:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the catastrophic Texas floods reveals that some areas received upwards of 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend, contributing to the disaster. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed—26 feet in just 45 minutes—due to the intense downpour in the Texas Hill Country, a region naturally susceptible to flash flooding. This is because its dry, packed soil struggles to absorb water, causing rapid runoff. Forecasters warn that the already devastated region could see an additional three to five inches of rain, maintaining a high risk of further flash flooding in cities like Kerrville and San Antonio.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 104 deaths, with dozens of people, including children from a summer camp, still missing. Kerr County was the most affected area, accounting for 84 of the fatalities, with Camp Mystic confirming the deaths of at least 27 campers and counselors. President Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for the region, mobilizing federal resources for the ongoing search and rescue operations. Officials are struggling to account for all individuals due to the number of tourists and campers in the area for the holiday weekend, suggesting the number of missing persons may be higher than current estimates.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targeted organizations providing abortion services, even though federal funds are already barred from being used for most abortions. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the law was an unconstitutional attempt to penalize the organization and would severely impact its ability to provide other essential health services like cancer screenings. The White House responded that the administration is ending the use of taxpayer dollars to fund elective abortions.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Education has formally refused to comply with a Trump administration directive to bar transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports. The administration's Office for Civil Rights had determined California's inclusive policy violates the rights of female students under Title IX and gave the state a 10-day deadline to conform. By rejecting the demand, California risks an unspecified "imminent enforcement action," which could include the withholding of federal funding. This confrontation highlights the deep ideological and legal disagreements between state and federal officials over the interpretation of civil rights protections for transgender individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly Texas floods have triggered intense scrutiny over the adequacy of emergency warnings and whether federal staffing cuts impacted forecasting. Local officials have faced questions about why campers and residents were not evacuated sooner, with some pointing to a lack of a robust local warning system due to cost concerns. While the National Weather Service issued 22 warnings for the area, some residents said they received no alerts or have become desensitized to them. The debate also involves concerns that budget cuts and vacancies at the NWS, including a key warning coordinator position, may have hindered communication between forecasters and local emergency managers.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas serves as a stark warning for California, which faces similar dangers from extreme weather events in its low-lying river and creek areas. California has a history of deadly floods and debris flows, and scientific projections indicate these risks are increasing due to climate change, which allows storms to carry more moisture. While the state has stronger local planning regulations that often restrict construction in high-risk floodways, many communities, campgrounds, and homeless populations remain vulnerable. Experts note that past disasters highlight the risks motorists face when attempting to cross fast-moving water, a common cause of flood-related fatalities.</p>

          <p>Financial analyst Jim Cramer has advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's latest announcement of new tariffs on 14 countries. Speaking on CNBC, Cramer suggested that the announced tariff rates are likely just a starting point for negotiations rather than final figures, pointing to the administration's history of postponing or reducing previously threatened levies. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction, he argued that the tariffs' ultimate impact on inflation and Federal Reserve policy might be less than feared if they are part of a broader strategy to boost U.S. exports. He also noted that pro-growth measures in Trump's recently passed domestic spending bill could offset some of the negative sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

The article points to recent events, such as a halt in weapons shipments to Ukraine and a surprise review of the AUKUS security pact, as evidence of a dysfunctional policy process. It suggests that with President Trump's attention being episodic, key decisions are being driven by lower-level, and sometimes unknown, appointees like Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby. This creates a vacuum where policy can be shaped by individual preferences rather than a unified national strategy, leaving the nation's approach to global affairs fragmented and unpredictable.</p>

          <p>China is strategically positioning Guizhou, historically one of its poorest provinces, as a central component of its national economic development plan for 2026-2030. Provincial leaders are focusing on leveraging Guizhou's "comparative advantages" to serve as a "strategic hinterland" in the face of ongoing trade tensions and global economic shifts. This strategy, introduced during a major policymaking conference, aims to reshape the country's industrial landscape by developing inland regions. The plan reflects a broader national effort to enhance economic resilience and rebalance development away from traditional coastal hubs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match ended in heartbreak as Grigor Dimitrov was forced to retire with an injury while leading world number one Jannik Sinner by two sets. Dimitrov collapsed in pain, clenching his right pectoral muscle, after serving in the third set and could not continue, leaving the court in tears. Sinner, who advanced to the quarterfinals, expressed his sympathy for his opponent, stating he did not consider the outcome a win and highlighting Dimitrov's unfortunate history with injuries at major tournaments. The emotional conclusion underscored the physical toll of the sport, overshadowing Sinner's continued progress in the tournament.</p>

          <p>President Trump is escalating his trade war by announcing new tariff rates on numerous countries, including Japan and South Korea, scheduled to take effect on August 1. This action follows a 90-day pause on a previous set of tariffs, a period intended for striking new trade deals that has yielded few results. The administration's trade policy has been characterized by its mercurial nature, with drastic measures often being announced and then walked back after negative market reactions. The legality of imposing these tariffs through emergency authority is also being challenged in court, adding another layer of uncertainty to whether the threatened economic penalties will ultimately be implemented.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will ban the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void confidentiality clauses that seek to prevent workers from speaking out about such allegations. The move follows years of campaigning by activists, including Harvey Weinstein's former assistant Zelda Perkins, who argued NDAs have been abused to cover up criminality and protect powerful individuals. The change aims to give workers confidence that inappropriate behavior will be addressed rather than concealed, aligning UK law with similar measures in Ireland, the US, and Canada.</p>

          <p>Rising anger over gentrification and the influx of American remote workers has culminated in street protests in Mexico City, with some demonstrators targeting U.S. influence. Hundreds marched on July 4 with signs like "gringo go home," demanding curbs on short-term rentals and taxes on foreigners, who they blame for soaring rents and the displacement of locals. The protests, which saw some vandalism, challenge the city's welcoming reputation and add to binational tensions fueled by U.S. immigration policies. While Mexican leaders condemned the xenophobic tone, they acknowledged the legitimacy of grievances over the city's housing affordability crisis.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano erupted twice on Monday, spewing ash and volcanic materials up to 11 miles into the sky and forcing dozens of flight cancellations. The eruptions from the volcano, which is on the highest alert level, sent searing gas clouds and lava down its slopes and covered nearby villages in heavy ash, blocking out the sun. No casualties were immediately reported, but authorities have expanded the exclusion zone around the mountain. Airlines, including Jetstar and Virgin Australia, canceled flights to and from Bali due to the volcanic ash cloud, disrupting travel in the region.</p>

Authorities identified the shooter as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda, who reportedly had psychological issues. Hours before the attack, his father had informed police that his son was missing and carrying weapons. Mosqueda drove to the facility and began shooting at agents before they returned fire. The motive for the attack is under investigation by the FBI, which found additional ammunition and weaponry in the shooter's vehicle.</p>

The system, designed to warn the public of imminent dangers like extreme weather or terror attacks, will cause compatible phones to vibrate and sound a siren for 10 seconds. A previous national test in 2023 experienced technical issues, with some users on the Three network and others not receiving the alert at all. The upcoming test aims to ensure these problems have been resolved and to familiarize the public with the system, which has been used successfully in several regional emergencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top economic advisor to the White House, has defended the administration's projection that major cuts to Medicaid will not result in anyone losing health insurance. This claim directly contradicts the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimated that the cuts in the "Big, Beautiful Bill" would cause 8 million people to lose coverage. Hassett argued the CBO cannot be trusted, alleging it made incorrect predictions in the past regarding Obamacare. Critics, however, point out that Hassett's example refers to a bill that never became law and highlight his own track record of inaccurate economic and public health forecasts.
