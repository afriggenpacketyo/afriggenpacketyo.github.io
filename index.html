          <p>Geely Auto, a major car manufacturer in China, is ceasing the construction of new car plants due to significant global overcapacity, as stated by Chairman Li Shufu at the Chongqing Auto Show. This decision reflects the challenges many Chinese companies face in achieving profitability amidst a brutal price war within the mainland's automotive sector. Companies like BYD, Geely, and Leapmotor have been slashing prices by as much as 20% to maintain market share. The move signals a shift towards focusing on technological advancements rather than expanding production capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In May, China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline of 34.5%, marking the most significant drop since February 2020, which was influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. This decrease contributed to an overall export increase of only 4.8%, falling short of expectations, while imports also decreased by 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. Despite the decline in trade with the U.S., exports to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa saw substantial increases, and China's total trade surplus increased to $103.2 billion. These shifts reflect the ongoing impact of trade tensions and the need for China to bolster domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

At a press conference, Hakuho expressed his desire to develop sumo from an external perspective and focus on spreading the sport globally.

He outlines five steps in the creation of such an infrastructure, including declaring an emergency, using federal agents against civilians, making warrantless arrests, creating detention camps, and eventually declaring martial law. Reich emphasizes the importance of peaceful protests and the role of the federal courts in resisting what he describes as an emerging tyranny. He suggests that broad-based peaceful protests can combat this authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing a strong backlash following the Trump administration's decision to deploy National Guard soldiers in response to protests against immigration raids. The deployment, bypassing the governor, is seen as an escalation in the administration's promise of mass deportations. Federal agents have been conducting raids without judicial warrants, leading to the detention of families and denial of access to attorneys. Union leaders and community advocates are condemning the brutality of the raids, and protests are growing in response to what is perceived as an attack on the community.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, affecting citizens from a dozen countries primarily in Africa and the Middle East, has gone into effect, sparking less outrage than his initial 2017 ban. The ban fully restricts nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and others, while partially restricting entry from countries like Venezuela. Critics argue the ban disproportionately affects non-white countries and is rooted in bigotry. The new measures do not revoke previously issued visas but will reject new applications unless they meet specific exemption criteria.</p>
