This regulatory action precedes an anticipated meeting between the leaders of both nations, highlighting the strategic use of economic policy in their ongoing geopolitical rivalry.

          <p>Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley has issued a warning to WNBA players regarding their ongoing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations with the league. Citing his own experience with NBA labor disputes, Barkley advised players to be careful not to "overplay their hand" when negotiating with billionaire owners, suggesting they should aim for the best possible deal in the moment while continuing to grow the league. His comments come as tensions rise between players and WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert over accountability and alleged remarks about star players.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is formally requesting information from four major U.S. tech platforms—Apple, Google's YouTube, Snap, and Google Play—regarding their child protection practices. The inquiry, under the Digital Services Act (DSA), will examine concerns such as easily circumvented age restrictions, addictive algorithms, and access to inappropriate content like gambling apps. If the EU executive finds infringements of its rules, it could open formal proceedings and impose fines of up to 6% of a company's global turnover, signaling a continued regulatory focus on online safety for minors.</p>

          <p>Genevieve Shore, executive chair of Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR), has voiced concerns over the proposed big-money R360 breakaway series, arguing it is not a genuine league. Shore described the four-team event as a "short-term showpiece" that would not provide players with adequate game time to prepare for international competition. Her comments follow a joint statement from eight major rugby nations, which declared that any players signing with R360 would be ineligible for their national teams, escalating the conflict between established leagues and the new private venture.</p>

          <p>Actress Alex Kingston, known for her roles in 'ER' and 'Doctor Who,' has publicly revealed that she was diagnosed with womb cancer last year. The 62-year-old star underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, completing her treatment in late 2024. Kingston stated that she initially mistook her symptoms for signs of aging and is now urging others not to ignore potential health issues. She credits the experience with inspiring her to participate in the television show 'Strictly Come Dancing,' embracing the philosophy that life is too short to pass up desired opportunities.</p>

          <p>German state police and prosecutors have conducted raids on the homes and offices of 17 Frankfurt police officers amid an investigation into allegations of assault, obstruction of justice, and wrongful prosecution.

The investigation, which has so far found no evidence of extremist motives, involved approximately 150 state officers and resulted in the seizure of mobile phones and data storage devices for analysis.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in San Francisco has heard arguments concerning President Trump's authority to federalize and deploy Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. The administration sought to deploy the troops to protect a federal immigration facility from protesters, a move previously blocked by a lower court judge who found the president's description of violence was "untethered from reality." The case tests the limits of presidential power over state National Guard units for domestic law enforcement, a contentious issue that has drawn support for Oregon from two dozen other states.</p>

          <p>This essay contemplates the perspective of America's Founders on the state of the republic in 2025, suggesting they would be both amazed and appalled. While they would likely recognize the fulfillment of their ideal of equality in principle, they would be horrified by extreme economic inequality, political polarization, and the erosion of a shared public sphere for rational debate. The Founders would also be dismayed by the rise of Christian nationalism, the sycophancy of legislators toward a monarchical presidency, and the weaponization of insult in political discourse, viewing these as grave threats to the republic.</p>

By framing the Civil War as a second founding meant to fulfill the first, Lincoln offered a dynamic way to confront national contradictions without discarding foundational principles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's highly successful diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of being a pedophile, constituted "nonactionable opinion" and hyperbolic vituperation within the context of a rap battle, rather than verifiable facts a reasonable listener would believe. Drake had sued UMG, which releases music for both artists, for publishing and promoting the track, alleging it tarnished his reputation and led to security threats.</p>

          <p>North Korea celebrated the 80th anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party with a massive military parade in Pyongyang, attended by high-level delegations from China and Russia. The event showcased the nation's extensive arsenal and highlighted Kim Jong Un's strengthening geopolitical position, bolstered by support from Beijing and Moscow amid their own rivalries with the U.S. Analysts note that Russia's war in Ukraine has made Pyongyang a more valuable partner, allowing Kim to mitigate sanctions and advance his goal of gaining recognition as a de facto nuclear power.</p>

This move marks another escalation in the ongoing trade dispute between the two economic superpowers, with both nations now using targeted maritime fees as a tool of economic pressure.

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a mortgage for a property in Virginia. Prosecutors allege she misrepresented the property as a secondary residence to secure a more favorable loan, while actually using it as a rental investment. James denies the charges, calling them a politically motivated "weaponisation of our justice system" orchestrated by President Trump, against whom she previously led a major civil fraud case that resulted in a finding of liability.</p>

          <p>President Trump has increasingly deployed or threatened to deploy the National Guard to nearly a dozen cities run by Democratic mayors, citing the need to combat crime or quell protests. Federal interventions have occurred in Chicago, Portland, and Memphis, sparking legal challenges from state and local officials who accuse the administration of a dangerous abuse of power and misrepresenting local conditions. These actions have intensified the debate over the president's authority to use military forces for domestic law enforcement, particularly in politically opposed jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>The Tenement Museum in New York City provides an alternative approach to history education by focusing on the lives of ordinary immigrant, migrant, and African American families. By recreating the actual apartments of these families from the 1860s through the 1980s, the museum makes history tangible and relatable for students. This method emphasizes that everyone, not just prominent leaders, is a part of the American story. It aims to balance the harsh realities of poverty and discrimination with the hope and progress these families experienced.</p>
