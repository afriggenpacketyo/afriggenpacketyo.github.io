          <p>Beijing recently concluded the first "World Humanoid Robot Games," a three-day event featuring competitions in sports, martial arts, and job-skill simulations like housekeeping and factory work. The competition highlighted China's growing robotics industry, with domestic companies like Unitree, a rival to Tesla's Optimus, securing multiple medals. This event underscores the Chinese government's strategic push to establish a world-class humanoid robot industry by 2027. The games serve as a platform to test and refine robotic capabilities, motivating innovation among the 280 participating international teams.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have started their closing arguments in the high-profile national security trial of Jimmy Lai, a 77-year-old pro-democracy media tycoon in Hong Kong. Lai is accused of colluding with foreign forces and sedition, primarily through his now-shuttered newspaper, Apple Daily, which authorities claim he used to advocate for international sanctions. The trial, which began in December 2023, is seen by critics as a key indicator of diminishing press freedom under the national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020. Lai faces a potential life sentence if convicted by the three government-appointed judges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is now emphasizing the enforcement of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, citing the threat wind turbines pose to these birds. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure eagles are not “sacrificed” for wind power. Critics, however, view this as a pretext for the administration's broader opposition to wind energy, pointing out that far greater threats to birds include climate change, cats, and buildings. This newfound concern for eagles contrasts with the administration's other actions, which have weakened protections for other species and habitats to benefit the oil and gas industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, President Donald Trump stated that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for a peace deal to end the war with Russia. This marks a significant reversal from his position just last week, when he threatened Russia with severe consequences if a ceasefire was not agreed upon. Trump cited his experience with other peace deals, arguing that negotiations can proceed while fighting continues. The meeting, which included European leaders, also focused on potential security guarantees for Ukraine and the possibility of a future trilateral summit with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, most Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, allowing the legislature to regain a quorum and resume business. The lawmakers had fled the state to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in a way that could add up to five GOP seats in the 2026 midterms. Democrats stated their return allows them to build a legal case against what they call a discriminatory map. This move comes as the partisan battle over mid-decade redistricting escalates nationally, with states like California proposing their own countermeasures to offset potential Republican gains.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms' stock experienced a downturn following a report that the company is planning another restructuring of its AI team, its fourth in six months, raising concerns about its strategy despite heavy investment in AI talent. In other market news, Eli Lilly's shares remained stable even after its main competitor, Novo Nordisk, announced a price cut for its diabetes drug Ozempic to $499 per month for cash-paying patients. Analysts suggest this move by Novo Nordisk is unlikely to trigger a major price war, as the cash-pay market for diabetes treatments is less significant than for weight-loss drugs due to broader insurance coverage.

Yang, now an Emmy nominee, also discussed co-hosting the popular podcast "Las Culturistas" and shared a humorous anecdote about hiding his copy of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" as a teenager, treating it like "cultural contraband" due to social pressures.</p>

While the U.S. remains the largest single-country donor, President Trump's previous claim of the U.S. spending over $300 billion is not supported by available data. The aid from both sides consists of a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided more direct grants while the EU has offered more loans.</p>

If a cardholder only makes minimum payments, it could take decades to clear the balance and cost tens of thousands in total interest.

          <p>Gateway Church, one of the largest megachurches in the U.S., has installed Pastor Daniel Floyd as its new lead pastor, aiming to begin a new chapter following a major scandal. The church's founder, Robert Morris, stepped down 14 months ago after being accused of child sexual assault, and he now faces criminal charges in Oklahoma. In his first sermon, Floyd acknowledged the weight of the moment and promised to lead with integrity, stating it was time to "turn the page." The leadership transition occurs as the church and Morris are also involved in civil lawsuits related to defamation and retirement payments.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a powerful Category 4 storm, is not forecast to make landfall in the U.S. but is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast for several days. The storm's large size is predicted to cause significant coastal flooding, particularly in North Carolina's Outer Banks, where waves could exceed 15-20 feet. In response to the flood risk, mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for visitors and residents on Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands. The storm is expected to move northward between Bermuda and the U.S. coast through the middle of the week.</p>

          <p>The US Open has revamped its mixed doubles tournament, attracting a star-studded field of top singles players with a new schedule and a $1 million prize. The event, held the week before the main draw, features high-profile pairings like Carlos Alcaraz with Emma Raducanu and Novak Djokovic with Olga Danilovic. This change aims to boost interest in the format, which is typically dominated by doubles specialists. However, the move has drawn criticism from those specialists, who feel they have been pushed out of the event because the entry list now prioritizes singles rankings.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has sold academy graduate Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle for £40 million, a move driven by the need to comply with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Because Ramsey is a homegrown player, the entire transfer fee counts as pure profit on the club's books, helping them balance their finances under the league's loss limits. The sale has frustrated fans and players, highlighting a growing trend where clubs are incentivized to sell their own academy talent to meet financial regulations. This situation underscores the pressure ambitious clubs face when trying to compete with the established top teams.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that nearly a third of people who started using the over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill, had previously been using no form of contraception. Published in JAMA Network Open, the research surveyed users in 44 states and found that the OTC option is successfully reaching those who face significant barriers to healthcare, including the uninsured, younger individuals, and those in rural areas. The most common reason for choosing the OTC pill was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment. The findings suggest that increased accessibility is a powerful tool for improving reproductive autonomy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The era of the "Great Resignation" appears to be over, as consultants now describe a trend of "job hugging," where workers are clinging to their current roles amid economic uncertainty. The rate at which employees voluntarily quit their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level since 2016, reflecting decreased confidence in the labor market. This stagnation is linked to a cooling job market, slower hiring rates, and CEO plans that favor shrinking rather than expanding workforces. While providing stability, experts caution that staying in one role for too long can risk wage and career stagnation.</p>
