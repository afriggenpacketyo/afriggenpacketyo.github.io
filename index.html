          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially joined the contest for the Labour Party's deputy leadership position, becoming the most senior candidate so far. She joins Dame Emily Thornberry and Bell Ribeiro-Addy in the race to succeed Angela Rayner. Candidates face a tight deadline to secure nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs. The contest highlights different ideological wings of the party, with Phillipson representing a more centrist, government-aligned position while others signal a desire to be a more critical voice for the party's membership.</p>

          <p>A 500-pound bomb from World War II was discovered during construction in Bratislava, Slovakia's capital, leading to widespread evacuations. The emergency measures affected several downtown blocks and halted traffic, including on a major bridge over the Danube River. This area, which housed an oil refinery targeted by Allied bombing in 1944, has a history of such discoveries, with unexploded ordnance from the war being a recurring issue across Europe. Experts were called in to defuse the device and restore normalcy to the city.</p>

          <p>A U.S. House committee has publicly released a collection of documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including a "birthday book" from 2003, his will, and personal address books. The release follows pressure on the Trump administration for more transparency regarding the late convicted sex offender's network. The book contains messages from prominent figures, including a note with a signature resembling Donald Trump's, which the White House denies he wrote. This development revives scrutiny of Epstein's connections to powerful individuals and the ongoing questions surrounding his activities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release a significant downward revision of U.S. jobs data, potentially showing that hiring was weaker by as many as 800,000 jobs through March 2025 than initially reported. This revision, based on more comprehensive data, could indicate a more pronounced labor market slowdown. The news comes amid slowing job growth and political scrutiny from the Trump administration, which recently fired the BLS commissioner. Economists suggest this weakening trend could increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to implement an interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese state-owned Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) has unveiled an aggressive expansion plan for Europe, aiming to increase its electric car sales 17-fold by 2027. The company intends to sell at least 50,000 units annually within two years, intensifying competition for established European automakers like BMW and Mercedes. GAC's move is part of a broader trend of Chinese EV manufacturers making significant inroads into the European market. Despite potential EU tariffs, the company is also exploring local manufacturing to solidify its presence in the region.</p>

          <p>Recent polling data indicates historically low favorability ratings for the Democratic Party, with over 60% of American adults holding a negative view. This widespread dissatisfaction stems from multiple sources, including frustration among Democrats who perceive their party as "weak" and "ineffective" in opposing President Trump. Furthermore, the party is ideologically divided on its future direction, with factions pulling it towards both moderation and more liberal stances. The unpopularity of key Democratic leaders also contributes significantly to the party's negative public perception.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage approaching a one-year low, prospective homebuyers still have methods to secure even better loan terms. Financial experts advise that improving one's credit score is the most critical step, as higher FICO scores qualify for lower interest rates. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can also lead to more favorable terms and avoid private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.

          <p>The practice of institutional investors, like private equity firms, buying single-family homes to rent them out has drawn bipartisan criticism for making homeownership less attainable for middle-class families. However, research reveals a nuanced impact: while this trend does drive up home prices, it also increases the availability of rental properties in suburban areas. This has been shown to make neighborhoods more affordable for lower-income families and increase racial and economic diversity. The core issue, many economists argue, is not corporate ownership but the overall shortage of housing construction in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Applications to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are surging as the political climate under the Trump administration becomes more contentious, according to former Spelman College president Beverly Daniel Tatum. She suggests that as society expresses more anti-Black sentiment, Black students are increasingly seeking affirming communities like HBCUs "where their history isn’t being erased." While this trend is a positive sign for the institutions, it also presents a challenge, as many applicants require financial aid that under-resourced HBCUs struggle to provide.</p>

          <p>A Fort Myers, Florida, country music station, WHEL 93.7 FM, has rebranded itself as "Trump Country," extensively using President Trump's name, image, and a voice impersonator in its marketing and on-air promotions. The station, whose slogan is "Make Country Great Again," claims its ratings have tripled since the change, demonstrating the commercial power of the Trump brand in a politically aligned region. The station's general manager, who is also running for Congress as a Republican, stated they did not ask for permission from the Trump campaign for the branding.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary, is altering federal vaccine guidance, creating confusion and disagreement with the established medical community. Kennedy has declared that healthy children and pregnant women should not receive Covid-19 vaccines, a stance opposed by major physician groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics. This divergence means parents can no longer rely on a single, unified recommendation. The article advises consulting multiple sources, including the CDC, professional medical societies, and personal physicians, to make informed decisions.</p>

          <p>This column argues that recent political language, particularly from the Trump administration, echoes the discredited and dangerous pseudoscience of eugenics. The author points to President Trump's comments about people being "born to be criminals" as a modern parallel to the eugenicist belief in hereditary inferiority, famously cited in the 1927 Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell. The article suggests that ideas of "fit" and "unfit" people are resurfacing in policies related to public health and social welfare, representing a troubling return of ideologies that historically justified discrimination.</p>

          <p>Residents in urban core and South Los Angeles face a dual public health threat from excessive heat and noise pollution, environmental stressors that disproportionately affect low-income communities of color. Researchers at UCLA are collaborating with community groups to study how this combination impacts brain health, metabolism, and sleep, and aggravates chronic conditions. The project highlights the stark environmental inequalities in the city, contrasting the tree-canopied, quieter neighborhoods of affluent areas with the loud, sun-exposed streets in others, where residents have few places to find relief.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that the Trump administration's friendly overtures toward Vladimir Putin are counterproductive and will not lead to a resolution in the Ukraine war. The author contends that Russia interprets conciliatory gestures as weakness to be exploited, and that meaningful negotiations will only occur when the Kremlin realizes its military objectives are unattainable. The piece asserts that the root cause of the conflict is Russia's imperial inability to accept its former colonies' independence. Therefore, a strong, unwavering stance is necessary to persuade Russia to end the war.</p>

          <p>Dan Brown, author of the global bestseller "The Da Vinci Code," is releasing a new novel, "The Secret of Secrets," which he describes as his most ambitious yet. The thriller delves into the science of noetics and the concept of nonlocal consciousness, suggesting the human brain may act as a receptor for a universal consciousness rather than its source. Brown spent eight years researching cutting-edge brain science for the book, which explores the potential for this knowledge to be weaponized. The story follows hero Robert Langdon to Prague, a city with a deep history of mystical exploration.</p>

          <p>In his book "Raising A Nation," researcher Elliot Haspel argues that advocates for affordable child care should shift their focus from purely economic arguments to a moral one. He contends that framing child care primarily as a tool to help parents work is less effective than positioning it as a fundamental right, similar to public education. Haspel suggests that a more compelling case can be built around child care's benefits to family well-being, community strength, and even national security, which could broaden its appeal across the political spectrum.</p>

The historian argues that the fear and disruption caused by today's raids echo the "cruel forced deportations" of the past, where racial animus led to the displacement of entire communities, a forgotten chapter of American history.</p>
