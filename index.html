          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 achieved a record high, mirroring Wall Street's gains driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and positive inflation data. SoftBank Group experienced a surge following a report of OpenAI's cloud-computing deal with Oracle, which saw its shares jump significantly. The connection between SoftBank and Oracle stems from their involvement in the Stargate program, a $500 billion U.S. initiative announced in January. Energy and utilities stocks led gains on the Nikkei 225, while other Asian markets showed mixed performance, and investors are closely watching upcoming U.S. consumer price index data.

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot at an event at Utah Valley University, prompting a manhunt for the shooter. Utah's governor has called the shooting a "political assassination," and the FBI is assisting in the investigation. Authorities initially detained two individuals, but they were later released after being cleared of involvement. Kirk, a prominent figure in the conservative movement and a confidant of former President Trump, was 31 years old. The university campus is closed, and classes have been canceled as the investigation continues, sparking condemnation from political leaders across the spectrum.</p>

          <p>Following a large immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, South Korean companies are reportedly hesitant about investing in the US, according to President Lee Jae-myung. Over 300 South Koreans arrested in the raid are returning home after delays caused by instructions from the White House, and Lee expressed bewilderment over the situation, highlighting the common practice of Korean firms sending workers to set up overseas factories. The South Korean government is negotiating with Washington for visa options for its workers, while US President Trump has called for foreign companies to hire Americans. The incident has raised concerns in Seoul, especially amid ongoing trade talks.</p>

          <p>According to Nathalie Tocci, the transatlantic relationship is unlikely to return to its previous state, even without Trump, due to deeper structural issues. The relationship may devolve into transactional interactions based on converging interests, or a world of empires could emerge, posing challenges for Europe. Tocci argues that European leaders' reactions to Trump's actions are making the latter outcome more likely, and Europe must accept the changing reality to avoid being marginalized. The author warns against self-humiliation and urges Europe to develop strategic autonomy and strengthen trade relationships with other nations.</p>

          <p>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life. Scientists stress that in-depth analysis is needed before reaching any conclusions, and the rover cannot directly detect life. The sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, and the findings include organic carbon and chemical compounds that, on Earth, are byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. The return of the samples to Earth is on hold as NASA seeks cheaper options.</p>

          <p>A home in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles has drawn attention due to the accumulation of garbage bags in the front yard, sparking debate among neighbors. Some neighbors defend the homeowner, Raymond Gaon, as a Vietnam veteran who is simply collecting material for recycling. Others express concern about the potential health and fire hazards, and Gaon has declined to speak to reporters about his home. The situation has drawn media attention and prompted calls for compassion and understanding.</p>

          <p>China has opened the world’s longest cable-stayed bridge, connecting Changzhou and Taizhou in Jiangsu province. The Changtai Yangtze River Bridge is 10.3km long and features a main span of 1,208 meters. The bridge is the first river crossing to carry an expressway, regular road, and intercity railway on the same structure, and its asymmetrical lower deck is a distinctive feature. The bridge is expected to reduce travel time between the two cities from over an hour to just 20 minutes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's order blocking him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook while a lawsuit challenging his removal of her continues. The appeal follows a judge's ruling that Cook's reinstatement is in the public interest and that Trump's purported removal of her violated the Federal Reserve Act. Trump claimed he was firing Cook due to mortgage fraud allegations, which she denies, and the Senate Banking Committee has recommended approval of Trump's nominee for a vacant Fed governor's seat.

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk marks a watershed moment in a surge of U.S. political violence, with experts fearing it will inflame an already-fractured country and inspire more unrest. The U.S. has experienced about 150 politically-motivated attacks in the first six months of the year, nearly twice as many as last year. Experts cite economic insecurity, demographic shifts, and inflammatory political discourse as factors contributing to the increased violence. The article also notes past assassination attempts on Trump and other recent acts of political violence.</p>

          <p>Approximately 75 cargo containers tumbled off a vessel at the Port of Long Beach, resulting in a light oil sheen, a sprained ankle, and waterlogged cargo. The U.S. Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident, which occurred while the vessel was offloading at Pier G. One worker aboard the barge sprained an ankle fleeing the falling containers, and the damaged barge was the source of a light oil sheen.

          <p>Thousands of people in rural West Virginia lack reliable drinking water, relying on untreated sources like natural springs or aquifers from coal mines. About 250,000 West Virginia residents rely on untreated water sources, and the decline of the coal industry has impacted water infrastructure. The nonprofit DigDeep is working to bring clean tap water to communities like Rhodell, where residents have lacked access to clean water for years. Access to clean water is described as a human right.</p>

          <p>Senior cancer doctors are warning that excessive red tape is causing some patients in England to struggle to access the latest cancer treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists says bureaucracy is stifling innovation, leading to a "postcode lottery" where some cutting-edge treatments are only available in larger, better-funded units. The RCR and the Society of Radiographers have written to the government asking for easier access to treatments like Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR). The government says a new cancer strategy is due later this year.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris writes that Joe Biden's decision to run again was a choice that shouldn't have been left to an individual's ego. Harris criticizes the recklessness of leaving the decision to the former president and first lady alone, and she admits that she knew it would appear incredibly self-serving if she advised him not to run. Harris' book is also critical of the president's team, saying his inner circle often wouldn't defend her against unfair attacks.</p>
