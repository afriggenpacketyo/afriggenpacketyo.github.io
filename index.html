          <p>During a private golfing trip to Scotland, Donald Trump was met with widespread protests across the country, including outside his resorts and in major cities like Edinburgh. Demonstrators voiced their opposition to his visit, citing his recent felony conviction and questioning the use of taxpayer money for his security. A recent poll indicated that 71% of people in Scotland hold an unfavorable opinion of him. The protests also highlighted his past association with Jeffrey Epstein, with signs appearing near his properties referencing the connection. Trump is in Scotland for several days, with plans to meet with UK and EU leaders.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, a 73-year-old Illinois landlord, has died in prison custody just three months after being sentenced for a fatal hate-crime attack. In October 2023, motivated by the Israel-Hamas war, Czuba stabbed 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi 26 times and seriously wounded his mother, Hanan Shaheen. The attack, which occurred in their shared home, drew global condemnation and highlighted rising anti-Muslim hostility in the U.S. Czuba was serving a 53-year sentence for murder, attempted murder, and hate-crime charges at the time of his death.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced it will begin airdropping aid into Gaza and establish humanitarian corridors for UN convoys to address the escalating humanitarian crisis. This move comes after increased international pressure and reports of starvation-related deaths in the territory. Despite these measures, the IDF clarified that combat operations against Hamas have not ceased and reiterated its position that there is no deliberate starvation. Aid organizations, including the UN, have warned that airdrops are insufficient and that only lifting restrictions on land-based aid can prevent a man-made famine.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Las Vegas was forced to make a sudden, rapid descent of nearly 500 feet shortly after departing from Hollywood Burbank Airport. The pilots took evasive action in response to an onboard traffic alert warning of a nearby decommissioned Hawker Hunter fighter jet in the same airspace. While no passengers reported injuries, one flight attendant was hospitalized for minor injuries after the incident. The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed it is investigating the near-collision, which highlights ongoing concerns about air traffic control safety.</p>

          <p>Katey Sagal and Christina Applegate, stars of the iconic 1990s sitcom "Married… With Children," recently revealed the difficult behind-the-scenes atmosphere of the show. On a podcast, they described the cast as a "sarcastic, cynical bunch" where negative gossip was common, with Applegate recalling hearing castmates talk badly about her from her dressing room. Applegate also spoke about how the pressure of being portrayed as a sex symbol at a young age contributed to a long-lasting eating disorder. Sagal acknowledged the show was "very misogynistic" and that Applegate was heavily scrutinized.</p>

          <p>A government initiative from the Trump administration, known as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is reportedly using an AI tool to identify federal regulations for elimination. According to internal documents, the goal is to cut approximately half of 200,000 targeted federal rules by January 2026, aiming to save trillions in government spending. The "DOGE AI Deregulation Tool" has already been utilized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This effort is part of a broader, aggressive push for deregulation within the administration, though the White House has described the plans as preliminary.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican efforts to redraw congressional maps in states like Texas and Ohio, Democrats are considering aggressive redistricting strategies of their own in California, New York, and Maryland. This move sparks an internal party debate over whether to match the GOP's hardball tactics to gain a crucial edge in the House of Representatives. While governors like California's Gavin Newsom have vowed to counter Republican gerrymandering, they face significant legal and political hurdles, including state constitutional constraints and potential infighting.

          <p>The Trump administration's extensive use of tariffs is facing a critical legal test in a federal appeals court, which could invalidate numerous trade policies. The lawsuit challenges the president's authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the basis for duties on China, Mexico, Canada, and others. A lower court previously ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, a decision currently paused pending the appeal.

Stokes, who has a history of injuries and recently had hamstring surgery, appeared weary in the field. His potential absence from the bowling attack on the final day is a significant concern for England as they push for a series-leveling win.</p>

Trump stated, "It’s something I haven’t thought about," a reply that a CNN legal analyst called a botched answer to "the easiest question in human history." The question arose after a top Justice Department official met with Maxwell in prison. As Trump faces mounting pressure to release files related to Epstein, his non-committal stance on a potential pardon for one of the case's central figures has intensified public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>While on a diplomatic trip in Scotland, President Donald Trump engaged in telephone diplomacy, attempting to broker a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand amid deadly border clashes. Trump spoke with the leaders of both nations, urging an immediate end to the conflict and threatening that he would not pursue trade deals with either country if they failed to reach a peace agreement. He compared his approach to a previous U.S.-mediated ceasefire between India and Pakistan, where he claimed trade incentives were used as leverage. The clashes have resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 168,000 people.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to oust 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative balance of power. Supporters of the recall had criticized the KMT for being too close to China and for obstructing key legislation, including defense spending. The KMT, which holds a majority with its allies, framed the outcome as a public desire for stability over political infighting, ensuring President Lai Ching-te's government will continue to face a strong legislative opposition.</p>

          <p>While studies show daily coffee consumption can offer health benefits, experts emphasize that the right amount is highly individual and moderation is key. The FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, but tolerance varies greatly from person to person. For some, even one or two cups can cause anxiety or jitteriness, while others can consume more without issue. Dietitians advise listening to your body, noting any negative effects like poor sleep or a racing heart. They also suggest not replacing meals with caffeine and being mindful of sugar intake.</p>
