            <p>Economist Erica York suggests President Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese imports, now at 145%, will effectively halt most trade between the two nations. She noted that while some essential items without substitutes might still be imported, the tariffs represent a major economic hit. This follows Trump's temporary reduction of tariffs for most countries to 10% for 90 days, excluding China. The Tax Foundation estimates Trump's tariffs will increase federal tax revenues by $171.6 billion this year, marking the largest tax increase since 1993. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a temporary slowdown in deportations to support the agricultural and hospitality sectors, addressing labor concerns in these industries. The decision was revealed during a Cabinet meeting that included discussions with top officials and Elon Musk. This adjustment follows Trump's recent tariff policy changes, which included a pause in higher taxes for most countries, except China, where rates increased to 145%. Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are also advancing a budget plan to support Trump's domestic agenda, despite some internal opposition.</p>

            <p>China is restricting the import of American films in response to President Trump's escalated tariffs on Chinese goods. The National Film Administration in Beijing stated that Trump’s tariffs would reduce domestic demand for American movies. Trump responded to China’s move by saying, "I think I've heard of worse things," eliciting laughter during a cabinet meeting. China's domestic movies are increasingly outperforming American movies, with Hollywood films now accounting for only 5% of China's box office receipts.</p>

            <p>A Senate committee held a hearing to discuss the possibility of establishing a year-round time standard instead of switching between daylight saving time and standard time. The committee is considering whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time, with some suggesting states should have the option to opt out. The twice-yearly time changes are generally unpopular among Americans, with many favoring the elimination of the practice. Experts testified on the potential health and safety impacts of different time standards.</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to pause some tariffs was offset by increasing duties on Chinese goods to 145%, raising concerns about inflation and recession. The high tariffs on China are expected to increase prices for consumer goods, such as smartphones and clothing. Experts warn that these extra costs and policy uncertainty could lead to an economic downturn. Despite positive economic indicators like low unemployment, economists remain cautious, citing the potential for reduced business activity and consumer spending.</p>
