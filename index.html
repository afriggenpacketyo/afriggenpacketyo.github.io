          <p>Tesla's decision to sell 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-2022 has proven to be a significant financial misstep, costing the company billions in potential profits. The sale occurred when the cryptocurrency's value was a fraction of its current price, which has since surged to near-record highs. Had Tesla retained its entire stake, it would be worth approximately $5 billion today, compared to its current digital asset value of $1.24 billion. This missed opportunity comes as the electric vehicle maker faces declining auto revenue and could have used the substantial cash boost from the investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell engaged in a public dispute over the costs of renovating the central bank's headquarters. During a site visit, Trump claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately contested, stating it included a separate building completed years ago. Despite previously suggesting the cost overruns could be a fireable offense, Trump indicated he does not think firing Powell is necessary. The president reiterated his desire for lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, a long-standing point of contention between the two.</p>

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is rapidly increasing, with AI-related job postings growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years. A recent Brookings Institution report highlights that as more companies integrate AI into their operations, they are actively seeking employees for both advanced and general AI-related roles. These positions often command higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar jobs that do not require AI expertise. While currently concentrated in tech hubs, AI-related jobs are beginning to spread across the country and into various non-tech sectors.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is recalling more than 121,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L vehicles from the 2023-2024 model years due to a safety issue with the second-row headrests. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the headrests may fail to lock in the upright position, increasing the risk of injury during a crash. The company has stated that a head restraint folded forward could pose a significant danger to occupants. Dealers will inspect and, if necessary, replace the faulty head restraints for free, with owner notification letters scheduled to be mailed in September.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at overhauling the nation's approach to homelessness, making it easier for cities and states to clear outdoor encampments. The order prioritizes federal funding for programs that mandate sobriety and treatment, shifting away from the "housing first" model. It also encourages the use of civil commitment for individuals who refuse treatment and are deemed a risk to themselves or the public. This action aligns with a recent Supreme Court ruling that permits punishing people for sleeping outdoors even without available shelter options.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order aimed at curbing the influence of money in college sports by prohibiting "third-party, pay-for-play" payments to athletes. The directive targets booster-funded name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals used as recruiting inducements, which the White House describes as creating a "chaotic environment." The order seeks to restore competitive balance and protect non-revenue and women's sports by redirecting funds and preserving scholarships. It represents the most significant federal intervention to date in response to the rapid commercialization of collegiate athletics, particularly in football and basketball.</p>

          <p>The legendary Ozzfest touring festival was born from a rejection by Lollapalooza in 1996, which deemed Ozzy Osbourne irrelevant for their lineup. In response, his wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, created Ozzfest, which quickly became a premier destination for heavy metal, launching the careers of numerous bands like Disturbed and Kittie. The festival, which ran until 2018, was celebrated for giving a platform to both established acts and newcomers on its iconic two-stage setup. Despite its success, the tour eventually ended due to rising costs and greedy demands from band managers.</p>

          <p>Following a six-hour meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyer stated that she "answered every single question" truthfully and never declined to answer. The unusual meeting took place in a Tallahassee federal courthouse as the Justice Department seeks information about Jeffrey Epstein's network of potential abusers. The sit-down occurred amid intense pressure on the Trump administration to be more transparent about the Epstein investigation. Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker, is also facing a subpoena to testify before the House Oversight Committee in August.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is systematically weakening a legal framework designed to protect unaccompanied minors who cross the border, creating what this article describes as a new, less visible form of family separation. Instead of separating families at the border, the administration is using bureaucratic and legal means to undermine a system that diverts children to the Department of Health and Human Services. Changes include making it harder for relatives to sponsor children, leading to longer detention times in facilities not intended for long-term stays, and cutting funding for legal aid.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional, finding it violates the 2nd Amendment. The court determined that the law, passed by voters in 2016, imposes a meaningful constraint on the right to operate firearms. The ruling heavily cited a 2022 Supreme Court decision that requires gun control laws to be consistent with the nation's historical traditions. The decision was praised by gun rights activists and condemned by gun violence prevention groups, who noted the law had stopped prohibited individuals from buying ammunition.</p>

          <p>The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached desperate levels, with international organizations warning of mass starvation as a direct result of man-made conditions. Displaced Palestinians describe an overwhelming daily struggle to find food, with flour and bread being nearly unaffordable or unavailable. According to the World Food Program, a third of the population, including children, goes multiple days without eating. Aid deliveries fall far short of what is needed, and the concentration of the population into small areas has complicated distribution and led to deadly incidents at aid points.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines shares dropped over 11% after the carrier reduced its 2025 profit forecast and posted second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations. The airline now anticipates pre-tax earnings between $600 million and $800 million, down significantly from an earlier forecast of $1.7 billion. CEO Bob Jordan stated that while travel demand has recently stabilized, economic uncertainty and increased summer discounting have impacted performance. The news comes as Southwest overhauls its business model, moving away from policies like open seating to better compete in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has made a direct plea to resident doctors in England not to proceed with a five-day strike over pay, warning it would cause "huge loss for the NHS and the country."

The BMA argues that even with recent pay rises, wages are still around 20% lower in real terms than in 2008. NHS England is concerned about the strike's impact on both emergency and non-urgent care, which has already been strained by previous industrial actions.</p>

His comments come as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to release more information from the federal investigation. The Justice Department's recent conclusion that no "client list" exists has failed to satisfy many, fueling calls for Congress to compel the release of the files.</p>
