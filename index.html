          <p>Brandon Blackstock, a talent manager and the former husband of singer Kelly Clarkson, has died at the age of 48 following a more than three-year battle with cancer. A family representative confirmed he passed away peacefully, surrounded by family. Clarkson had recently postponed her Las Vegas residency dates, citing that Blackstock had been ill and she needed to be fully present for their children. Blackstock, who was also the stepson of country star Reba McEntire, had two children with Clarkson before their divorce was finalized in 2022.</p>

          <p>Rushanara Ali has resigned from her position as the UK's Homelessness Minister following accusations of hypocrisy regarding her handling of a rental property she owns. Critics, including opposition politicians and housing charities, called for her to step down after it was reported she increased the rent on her property by £700 per month shortly after the previous tenants moved out. In her resignation letter, Ali stated that remaining in the role would be a "distraction," while insisting she had complied with all legal requirements. Prime Minister Keir Starmer thanked her for her work.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing further construction on the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades for 14 days. The ruling follows testimony from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening a sensitive ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the order prevents new construction to avoid potential irreparable harm. Florida officials have vowed to fight the ruling, which highlights ongoing jurisdictional disputes over the facility's operation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zach Cregger's new film, "Weapons," is reviewed as a compelling and intentionally messy horror story that splices together the perspectives of six different characters. The plot centers on the mysterious disappearance of a third-grade class, leaving the town and the protagonists to grapple with the unexplained tragedy. The review praises the film's bold structure, which avoids forced coincidences and instead layers narratives to build a fuller, though still ambiguous, picture of the events. While some symbolic elements are noted as underdeveloped, the film is lauded for its atmospheric tension and strong performances.</p>

          <p>Two individuals are confirmed dead after a helicopter struck a power line and crashed onto a barge on the Mississippi River near the Illinois-Missouri border. The St. Charles County Police Department reported that the aircraft, which belonged to a company that services power lines, caught fire upon impact. The helicopter was reportedly involved in maintenance work, specifically installing large orange marker balls on power lines to make them more visible to aircraft. The identities of the victims have not yet been released, and no other injuries were reported.</p>

          <p>This article explains the legal process through which a debt collector can freeze a consumer's bank account. It clarifies that this action cannot be taken arbitrarily; the collector must first file a lawsuit and obtain a court judgment against the debtor. The article emphasizes that ignoring a court summons often leads to a default judgment, enabling the freeze. However, certain funds, such as Social Security and disability benefits, are legally protected from garnishment. Even after a freeze, consumers have options, including filing exemption claims or negotiating a settlement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Labor Federation Backs Ballot Measure to Redraw Congressional Maps</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 14:32:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of California's most powerful labor groups, the California Federation of Labor Unions, has endorsed a proposal to redraw the state's congressional districts. This move supports an effort by Governor Gavin Newsom and other Democrats to counter potential Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas. The proposed ballot measure would ask voters to temporarily allow state lawmakers to help determine district boundaries for the next three election cycles, a power currently held by an independent commission. The labor federation has committed to spending millions to support the measure, framing it as a necessary fight against President Trump's political agenda.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's policy of restricting humanitarian aid to Gaza is not only a moral atrocity causing a hunger crisis but also a major strategic blunder. The author contends that the policy has failed to weaken Hamas and has instead strengthened the group's leverage, while severely damaging Israel's international standing, particularly with key allies like the United States. The piece suggests that Prime Minister Netanyahu's actions are driven by the need to appease extreme right-wing coalition partners who support the war. This dynamic, the article concludes, is leading Israel into a disastrous and counterproductive long-term occupation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that a 90-day extension of the current tariff truce between the United States and China is likely. This statement is the most concrete signal from the U.S. that the deadline, set to expire next week, will be pushed back to allow for further negotiations. The comments were made as new, sweeping U.S. tariffs on imports from approximately 90 other countries came into effect. Since April, the U.S. has progressively increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures and export controls on raw materials from Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

The investigation began after a cat named Sultan, adopted that same morning, was found in his vehicle with its paws bound and suffering from severe trauma. Another deceased cat was found in his trunk, and authorities linked him to several other missing or deceased animals with similar signs of abuse.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel intends to take control of the entire Gaza Strip to ensure its security but does not wish to govern the territory permanently. In an interview, he stated the goal is to remove Hamas and then hand over civilian governance to "Arab forces" that do not threaten Israel. This potential expansion of military operations would likely face strong international opposition amid growing concerns of famine in the region.

          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. This article explains that such a change would be a massive and legally contentious undertaking, as the Constitution mandates an "actual enumeration" of all persons every ten years to determine congressional seats. In his first term, the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court. Experts note the 2020 census already undercounted minority populations, and this new effort would face significant legal and logistical hurdles.</p>
