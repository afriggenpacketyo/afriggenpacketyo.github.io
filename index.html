          <p>A shooting occurred on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis following a Wayzata High School graduation ceremony, injuring two men. The victims, aged 49 and 19, were later discharged from the hospital. The incident took place outside the 3M Arena at Mariucci, prompting a police investigation involving the University of Minnesota Police Department, the Minneapolis Police Department, and the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz expressed his concern and offered state support to the university in response to this tragic event that disrupted a celebratory occasion. The authorities are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Optimism in this situation is very low due to the violence that marred a joyous event.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has claimed responsibility for a large-scale drone attack deep within Russian territory, alleging the destruction of 40 military bombers in what they dubbed "Operation Spider's Web." Ukrainian security sources stated that the operation, which took over a year and a half to plan, was personally overseen by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This attack coincided with Kyiv's announcement of a Russian military strike that reportedly killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site. Amid these events, Zelenskyy announced that a Ukrainian delegation would meet with Russian representatives in Istanbul to discuss a potential ceasefire and the return of prisoners and abducted children. This complex situation reflects the ongoing conflict and diplomatic efforts.</p>

The attack occurred on the eve of the Jewish holiday Shavuot, leading to cancellations of upcoming Run for Their Lives events.

          <p>Japan's capital spending increased by 6.4% in the January-March period, according to recent reports. This rise indicates a potential strengthening of the Japanese economy, as capital spending is a key indicator of business investment and future growth. The data suggests that companies are becoming more confident in the economic outlook and are willing to invest in new equipment and facilities. This development could lead to increased productivity and job creation in the coming months. The increase in capital spending may also reflect the impact of government policies aimed at stimulating economic activity.</p>

In the book, he refers to his attacker as "the A" and emphasizes his determination to answer violence with art.

          <p>Australia's significant contribution to Hollywood's acting scene is examined, highlighting numerous A-list stars from the country. The article explores the reasons behind this phenomenon, including the training provided by institutions like the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA). NIDA's emphasis on devising original work and a "can do, will tell, don't wait for permission" attitude are cited as key factors. The Australian soap opera industry and a culture of not taking oneself too seriously also contribute to the success of Australian actors in the global entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity experts are increasingly worried about the rise of ransomware attacks, particularly those involving young, Western hackers working with Russian cybercriminals. The FBI has been monitoring a group called Scattered Spider, known for social engineering, which was responsible for the MGM Resorts hack. These Western hackers team up with established Russian gangs like BlackCat, who provide malware and experience in negotiating ransoms. The Russian government provides a safe haven for these gangs, allowing them to operate with impunity as long as they don't target Russian entities. The NSA has joined the fight, but investigators say they are under-resourced compared to the adversaries.</p>

Contemporary artist Barry X Ball incorporates robots into his process to create pieces that would be impossible otherwise. Despite the controversy, some artists believe robots are reviving the artistic fortunes of Carrara by handling the laborious rough cutting.</p>
