          <p>The UK is holding four days of commemorative events to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, including a two-minute silence, a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey attended by the Royal Family, and a concert at Horse Guards Parade. Celebrations are also taking place across the nation, with local councils hosting events and street parties echoing the festivities from 80 years ago. The Tower of London opened an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies, reminiscent of the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red artwork from the WW1 centenary, serving as a visual tribute. The article also notes the significance of these commemorations as the first without the royals who appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony in 1945.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a "comprehensive" trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on numerous trading partners. The agreement, hinted at in a social media post, was confirmed by a British official and is anticipated to be revealed from the Oval Office. Details remain unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. The deal could be a significant win for both countries, potentially offsetting weaker relations with Europe post-Brexit for Britain.</p>

          <p>For Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the imminent trade agreement with the United States represents a significant political victory and validates his strategy of nurturing a relationship with President Trump. While the specifics of the deal are still emerging and could face opposition from certain sectors, Britain's position as the first country to finalize an agreement with the U.S. after the imposition of tariffs underscores the enduring "special relationship." Starmer's efforts to maintain a positive rapport with Trump, including delivering an invitation from King Charles for a state visit, appear to have been instrumental in securing the deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated potential trade deals could be announced soon, as his administration faces pressure to finalize agreements before a 90-day tariff pause concludes. The administration is reportedly engaged in negotiations with multiple countries, including the UK, Canada, Italy, India, and Japan, aiming to alleviate economic uncertainty. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested many deals could be wrapped up by year-end, though some experts anticipate longer negotiation timelines. The US is also set to meet with a Chinese delegation to discuss trade issues. The article suggests that any agreements reached may be nonbinding and subject to future changes.</p>

          <p>A potential trade deal between the US and the UK is expected to provide a boost to the British economy, offering relief from recent US tariff increases. The agreement could strengthen specific sectors, such as the auto industry, and improve consumer and business confidence. However, its overall impact may be limited due to the UK's strong focus on service exports to the US, which are not affected by the tariffs. While this deal may help, the UK still seeks closer ties with the EU and faces domestic challenges like sluggish economic growth and rising cost pressures, which could force the government to consider tax increases or spending cuts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege to withhold information in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly removed to El Salvador. This action prevents the disclosure of details regarding the administration's efforts to return him to the U.S. and any arrangements concerning the use of El Salvador's prison to house deportees. A judge has ordered both sides to submit legal papers justifying the invocation of these privileges. Abrego Garcia, who had been granted a withholding of removal, was among migrants sent to CECOT, prompting accusations of an administrative error.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for maintaining steady interest rates, which Trump believes hinders economic growth amid his trade policies. The Fed's decision to hold rates is based on economic uncertainty caused by tariffs and the risk of rising unemployment and inflation. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are independent of political pressure and solely based on economic data. Trump had previously sparked market concerns by suggesting he might fire Powell, but later clarified he had no intention of doing so.</p>

          <h2>GOP Establishment Figures Regain Influence in Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the perception of a fully MAGA White House, certain establishment figures are regaining influence in the Trump administration, particularly in economic and foreign policy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has taken the lead in trade negotiations, sidelining hardliners, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio has secured key foreign policy roles. These figures have learned from Trump's first term, focusing on convincing him to make better choices rather than directly defying his decisions. This dynamic suggests a tug of war between dueling factions seeking Trump's favor, indicating that he is not yet ready for a fully MAGA administration on all fronts.</p>
