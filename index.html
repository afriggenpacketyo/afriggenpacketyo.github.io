          <p>The Chinese e-commerce platform Temu has ceased direct shipments from China to U.S. customers, instead utilizing American warehouses.

The article notes that Temu adjusted prices last month, anticipating this change, and that some shoppers noticed products from China being removed from the site. The company maintains that consumer pricing remains unchanged.</p>
