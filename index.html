          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson and its affiliate Brickworks saw their stocks surge after announcing a A$14 billion merger. The deal aims to unwind a 56-year mutual ownership structure designed to prevent hostile takeovers but criticized for suppressing shareholder value and transparency. Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow stated that the merger simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company, with Brickworks shareholders receiving an implied value of A$30.28 per share, a 10.1% premium over the previous closing price. The merger follows previous unsuccessful attempts to unwind the cross-shareholding, including efforts between 2012 and 2017. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national, is accused of a terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, targeting a pro-Israel group advocating for the release of Israeli hostages. According to Homeland Security sources, Soliman was in the U.S. illegally after overstaying his visa, which expired in February 2023, and had previously been granted work authorization. During the attack, Soliman allegedly yelled "Free Palestine" and injured six people, ages 67 to 88, with one in critical condition, leading the FBI to investigate the incident as an act of ideologically motivated violence. The White House has responded, with Stephen Miller calling for a reversal of suicidal migration policies.</p>

          <p>Mexico held its first judicial elections, becoming the only nation to select judges and magistrates by popular vote, a move championed by President Claudia Sheinbaum to overhaul the judicial system due to corruption and inefficiency. Critics argue the vote will politicize the judiciary in a country plagued by crime and gang violence, leading to protests in Mexico City. Voters were tasked with electing around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, and hundreds of local judges, with turnout appearing low due to the large number of unknown candidates. Rights group Defensorxs identified around 20 candidates as "high risk," including a former lawyer for Sinaloa Cartel co-founder Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.</p>

          <p>China refuted U.S. claims of violating the Geneva trade agreement, accusing Washington of breaching deal terms and worsening relations between the two countries. The Trump administration has increased export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China and announced visa revocations for Chinese students, drawing criticism from Beijing. China, in turn, has maintained control over rare earth exports, contrary to U.S. expectations, while U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating the preliminary trade agreement. Tensions have also risen beyond trade, with the Pentagon chief warning of China's military pressure in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

Russia confirmed Ukrainian attacks in five regions, labeling them a "terrorist act", while Zelenskyy said 117 drones were used in the "Spider's Web" operation, which took a year-and-a-half to organize. SBU sources stated that strategic nuclear capable bombers and A-50 early warning warplanes were hit, with the damage estimated at $7 billion, although the Ukrainian claims have not been independently verified.

          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a resurgence after the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by pent-up demand and new investments, with Japanese ports seeing record domestic passenger numbers. The Japanese cruise market grew significantly in 2024, increasing by 14.2 percent year-on-year to 224,100 passengers, and the number of international visitors entering Japan by cruise ship quadrupled to 1.4 million. Shipping giants like NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K Lines Ltd. are expanding their cruise ship fleets, with NYK Cruises launching the Asuka III and Mitsui Ocean Cruises adding a third ship, indicating a shift towards thriving businesses that can produce stable income streams. Oriental Land, which operates Tokyo Disney Resort, will also take over the operation and management of cruise ships scheduled to enter service in fiscal 2028, featuring Disney characters on board.</p>

          <p>With the Trump administration implementing a program aimed at deporting migrants with irregular status, fear is growing among residents and U.S. citizens about traveling outside the country. Immigration attorney √Ålex G√°lvez advises that citizens, whether born in the U.S. or naturalized, should not fear being questioned upon their return, but residents may face scrutiny at the discretion of an officer. Residents who stay outside the U.S. for more than six months risk being considered as having abandoned their residency, and those with criminal records may be denied entry and face deportation proceedings. To avoid issues, residents planning to stay abroad longer than six months should apply for a permit, and those with criminal records should consult an immigration lawyer to assess their deportation risk.</p>

          <p>More than 50 people were killed and many wounded near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses, while the Israeli military denies its soldiers were involved. Witnesses claimed they were fired at from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the Israeli military stated its forces did not fire at civilians near or within the site. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) dismissed reports of casualties around its sites, claiming they delivered aid without incident, but the U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to work with the new system, citing violations of humanitarian principles.</p>

Despite Maduro's claims of success in recent elections, Machado asserts that the regime is increasingly isolated internationally and faces an unsustainable economic situation, with minimal support from traditional allies. The limited operation of Chevron could be crucial for the democratic transition when it arrives.</p>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, remains optimistic about technological advancements despite geopolitical tensions and the potential for technological decoupling between the U.S. and China. He emphasized that fundamental sciences like biology, math, physics, and chemistry are universal, allowing breakthroughs in one country to benefit scientists globally. Diamandis expressed concern over cuts to scientific funding in the U.S., particularly at the National Institutes of Health, which he believes could slow the pace of scientific discoveries. Diamandis aims to encourage a positive view of the world, countering the brain's natural inclination towards fear and scarcity.</p>

          <p>Students are being warned about potential subject "cold spots" as universities cut courses, prompting a government review of higher education funding in England. Universities UK found institutions reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it aims to support collaboration where possible in a financially challenging environment. Greater collaboration between universities could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient, preventing isolated decisions about course closures, while the CMA enforces existing laws to protect students. University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and fees failing to keep up with inflation, leading to course cutbacks and closure announcements at various institutions.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs due to widespread family displacement across the country. The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation, while Shelter's analysis indicates nearly 94,000 children in London are living in temporary accommodation. A mother-of-three, Shanice Aird, is facing homelessness after rejecting unsuitable accommodation offered by Ealing Council, highlighting the challenges faced by families displaced due to a lack of affordable housing, and the government says it is investing ¬£1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing controversy over a land law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, drawing criticism from US President Donald Trump. The law aims to increase black ownership of land, addressing historical imbalances from the apartheid era, but opponents argue it threatens property rights. While the government says compensation will be paid in most cases, it plans to use the law in rare circumstances for land needed in the "public interest," especially for land reform, with less money being paid in compensation than previously. The law has sparked debate within South Africa and strained relations with the U.S., as Trump has opposed the law, claiming it discriminates against white farmers.</p>

Cramer highlights how even positive earnings reports or potential mergers are overshadowed by the unpredictable nature of the administration, and he expresses concern over the overall derision of business and the uncertainty it creates.
