          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 10:47:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While some data center projects face reconsideration, the AI data center market remains robust, driven by accelerated AI deployments and long-term growth signals. Companies like Amazon and Nvidia have reaffirmed strong demand, although strategic thinking around spending is evolving due to factors like the emergence of new players and concerns over tariffs. The industry is experiencing a temporary pause as it reshuffles priorities amid scarce resources like power, fiber, water, and land. Long-term enterprise adoption will continue to drive AI and data center demand for the next decade, with the market expected to grow significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Wind Energy Industry Enters 'Repowering' Phase Despite Political Obstacles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 10:45:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite efforts by the Trump administration to hinder wind energy development, the industry is experiencing a resurgence through the 'repowering' of aging wind farms. This involves upgrading or replacing old turbines with newer, more efficient models, increasing electricity output and extending the lifespan of existing sites. Repowering offers economic benefits by avoiding the need for new property acquisition and potentially reducing the number of turbines needed. This trend is providing a boost to major players like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa, as they secure contracts for repowering projects and contribute to meeting the growing demand for electricity.</p>

          <p>The opinion piece argues that the international community, particularly the United States, needs to take a stronger stance against President Erdogan's autocratic actions in Turkey. The recent detentions of political opponents and their associates mark a significant escalation in the erosion of democracy. While acknowledging Turkey's strategic importance, the author calls for greater support for the Turkish people and increased pressure on Erdogan to reverse his authoritarian course.</p>
