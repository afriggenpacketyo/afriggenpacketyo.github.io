          <p>Owen Lawrence, the 38-year-old suspect in a crossbow attack in Leeds that injured two women, has died in the hospital. Lawrence was arrested and hospitalized after sustaining a self-inflicted injury following the incident on the popular Otley run pub crawl in Headingley on Saturday. Counter Terrorism Policing North East believes Lawrence acted alone and is not seeking any other suspects in connection with the attack. The police investigation is ongoing to determine the motive behind the attack and ensure there are no further threats to the public.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued over 130 executive orders and memorandums in his first 100 days, sparking debate over constitutional overreach. Experts argue that Trump is trying to govern by executive order, purging independent agencies and targeting political opponents, which some critics see as verging on authoritarianism. While Trump claims he is using presidential power as intended, legal scholars express concern about the breakdown of checks and balances. The courts are pushing back, but Congress remains largely silent, raising concerns about the future of democracy in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney of the Liberal Party is urging Canadians to unite in the face of trade tariffs and annexation threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this year, emphasized the need to prepare for the worst and asserted that Trump is trying to undermine Canada. While the Liberals secured enough seats to form the government, it remains unclear whether they will have a majority, which could pose challenges in navigating a potential trade war with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada's Conservative Party, has lost his seat in parliament as Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured a victory in the federal election. This defeat is a significant blow for Poilievre, who was once predicted to win the election before Trump's renewed threats and tariffs influenced voters. The Conservatives are expected to remain in opposition, and Poilievre's loss raises questions about his future leadership. He faced challenges from local advocates wanting to change the electoral system and struggled to distance himself from Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>Pfizer is expanding its cost-cutting initiatives and announced first-quarter profits that surpassed estimates, despite a decline in sales largely due to reduced revenue from its COVID-19 antiviral pill, Paxlovid. The company now expects additional savings of approximately $1.2 billion by the end of 2027, primarily through enhanced digital enablement and streamlined business processes. These cuts include an expected $500 million in savings from research and organizational restructuring by the end of 2026, which will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline. The cuts aim to help Pfizer recover from the decline of its COVID business.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) exceeded Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations but is reassessing its full-year financial guidance and suspending additional stock buybacks due to anticipated cost increases and uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's auto tariffs. The company's previous 2025 guidance, which did not account for tariffs, is now considered unreliable. GM CFO Paul Jacobson stated that the future impacts of tariffs could be significant, and the company is awaiting greater clarity on the economic and regulatory environments before providing updated guidance. Despite strong first-quarter results, GM is taking a cautious approach amid growing instability in the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Economists are questioning President Trump's ability to deliver on his campaign promises of economic revival after his first 100 days in office.

Businesses express concerns about the impact of tariffs, and consumers are skeptical about Trump's ability to tackle inflation.

          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply due to the Trump administration's steep tariffs, prompting warnings from major U.S. retailers about potential supply shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%, leading to a significant decline in cargo shipments. Retailers, who had previously stockpiled inventory, may soon face out-of-stock situations, and consumers could experience price hikes. Experts warn of potential "empty shelves" and COVID-like shortages if the tariffs remain in effect, causing disruptions for both businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration has been marked by sweeping changes, including efforts to shutter agencies and cut the federal workforce.

Musk's influence has been broad, impacting various agencies, but his aggressive approach has also sparked controversy and divided public opinion.

The author contends that Trump has prioritized loyalty over competence, leading to mismanagement and an unsustainable course for the country.
