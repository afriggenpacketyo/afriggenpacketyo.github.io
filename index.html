          <p>President Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on imported Japanese goods, a rate lower than the previously threatened 25%. The agreement reportedly includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States and opens Japanese markets to American products like cars and agricultural goods. This deal is part of a broader administration strategy to renegotiate trade relationships and impose tariffs, aiming to boost U.S. manufacturing ahead of an August 1 deadline for several countries.

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate remained at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, slightly below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also held steady at 0.6%. This persistent low inflation gives the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy to support economic growth amid global trade uncertainties. The MAS has maintained a subdued growth forecast for the second half of the year, citing concerns over softening global demand and the lagging impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top German administrative court has finalized the classification of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a "suspected right-wing extremist" group. This ruling allows the domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, to continue monitoring the party, which could include using undercover informants. The court upheld a previous decision that found sufficient evidence of anti-democratic tendencies within the AfD, particularly regarding the legal status of German citizens with migration backgrounds. The AfD remains the largest opposition party in the German parliament.</p>

          <p>The UK government has outlined its plan to cut foreign aid spending by 40%, a move intended to free up funds for increased defense spending. A Foreign Office report reveals that the most significant reductions will impact programs in Africa, particularly those focused on children's education, women's health, and water sanitation. Aid organizations have warned that these cuts will disproportionately harm the world's most marginalized communities. While bilateral aid is being reduced, the government stated that funding for multilateral bodies like the World Bank will be protected.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen struggles continued in a 10-7 defeat against the Minnesota Twins, marking another loss in a difficult July. The relief pitchers were responsible for six runs in the sixth and seventh innings, issued through a combination of walks and errors rather than strong hitting from the Twins. A particularly rough seventh inning included three consecutive walks and a throwing error that allowed three runners to score. The performance highlights the team's current pitching vulnerabilities, which are exacerbated by multiple key players being on the injured list.</p>

While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, locals argue that the dominance of these shops is displacing essential services like grocers and butchers, making the area less livable. The influx of tourists and short-term lets has led to a decline in the local school's population and a feeling among residents that their community is being hollowed out to serve visitors.</p>

Terror birds were apex predators, standing taller than humans with powerful beaks, but this fossil provides rare evidence of their vulnerability. By analyzing 3D scans of the bite marks, researchers matched them to an extinct, five-meter-long caiman species. The lack of healing on the bone suggests the bird died during the attack, offering a fascinating glimpse into ancient predator-prey dynamics.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, federal judges in New Jersey voted to remove Trump-appointee Alina Habba from her role as the state's interim U.S. Attorney, citing the expiration of her temporary appointment. They installed her deputy, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, in her place. However, within hours, the Trump administration's Justice Department fired Grace, accusing the judges of a partisan move to undermine the president's authority. The rapid sequence of events highlights the intense political battle over the leadership of one of the nation's key prosecutor's offices.</p>

          <p>The case of the four murdered University of Idaho students has reached a conclusion with Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, but it leaves the community and victims' families with mixed emotions. The plea deal spares him the death penalty and avoids a painful trial, which some family members see as a form of closure. However, it also means that the motive for the brutal November 2022 slayings remains a mystery, frustrating others who sought answers. The article reflects on the case that captivated and terrified the nation, from the investigation to the role of internet sleuths.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are advising Chinese companies to establish deeper, more authentic roots within ASEAN countries to avoid being targeted by U.S. tariffs aimed at cracking down on transshipments. The advice comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs on goods suspected of being diverted through third countries like Vietnam to circumvent duties on Chinese products. By becoming more integrated with local economies in Southeast Asia, Chinese firms can better demonstrate their products' true country of origin. This strategy is seen as a long-term solution to navigate unpredictable tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Jacksonville, Florida sheriff's deputy has been suspended after a viral video showed him punching a driver during a traffic stop. The driver, William McNeil Jr., posted footage of the officer smashing his car window and striking him. Police later released bodycam footage showing McNeil had refused commands to exit his vehicle after being pulled over. While a state prosecutor found no criminal misconduct by the officers, the sheriff's office has initiated an internal review and stripped the deputy involved of his law enforcement duties pending its outcome.</p>

          <p>The family of Brian Holmes, who died at Castle Hill Hospital in the UK following a heart procedure, claims the hospital covered up medical errors and altered his death certificate. The family was initially told the TAVI heart valve implant "got stuck," but an unpublished review seen by the BBC reveals it was incorrectly placed, leading to emergency surgery and his eventual death. The hospital then issued a second death certificate that removed any mention of the failed procedure. This case is part of a wider police investigation into a cluster of deaths at the hospital's TAVI service.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed relief pitcher Tanner Scott on the injured list with elbow inflammation, but the team is optimistic that the injury is not season-ending. Scott exited a recent game after feeling a "stinging sensation" in his forearm, raising concerns for the team's already depleted bullpen. While awaiting a full medical review, team officials reported that Scott was feeling better. The injury underscores the team's need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the upcoming trade deadline to bolster their pitching staff for the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>A Worcestershire musician, Anna Downes, has spoken out about feeling ignored by police after she reported being a victim of cyberflashing. She received unsolicited pornographic images from a man she had met once professionally. Despite providing evidence, she says it took nearly six months and her own persistent follow-ups before the perpetrator was arrested and convicted. The case highlights the challenges victims face in getting cyberflashing, which became a specific crime in the UK in 2023, taken seriously by law enforcement, forcing her to investigate the crime herself.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has directed all national sports governing bodies to comply with President Trump's executive order that effectively bars transgender women from competing in women's sports. In a policy change, the federally chartered USOPC stated its "obligation to comply with federal expectations," which threaten to rescind funding from non-compliant organizations. This significant move aligns with recent changes by the NCAA and other sports federations. The policy has been condemned by civil rights groups who argue the USOPC is sacrificing athletes' safety and needs for political reasons.</p>
