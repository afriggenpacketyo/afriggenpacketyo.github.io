          <p>Federal prosecutors in the U.S. have announced they will not seek the death penalty against Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero, two of Mexico's most infamous drug lords. Both men, who have pleaded not guilty to extensive drug trafficking charges, are being prosecuted in the same Brooklyn courthouse where "El Chapo" Guzmán was convicted. This decision removes capital punishment as a possibility for Quintero, who is charged in the 1985 killing of a DEA agent, and Zambada, a long-time leader of the Sinaloa cartel. While lawyers for the defendants welcomed the move, it remains unclear if it opens a path toward potential plea agreements in these high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham has publicly criticized former teammate DeWanna Bonner for her handling of her departure from the team. Bonner left the Fever nine games into the season for "personal reasons" and subsequently returned to the Phoenix Mercury, where she was met with boos from Indianapolis fans upon her return. Cunningham, speaking on her podcast, suggested Bonner lacked professionalism by not communicating with her teammates directly about her exit. While expressing a desire for Bonner to be happy, Cunningham stated that Bonner should have anticipated the negative reception from fans given the circumstances of her controversial mid-season departure.</p>

          <p>Michigan's Democratic Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, met with President Trump to discuss critical issues affecting her state, leveraging their cordial working relationship. During the meeting, Whitmer advocated for a three-year delay in federal changes to Michigan's Medicaid program to avoid disrupting care for vulnerable residents. She also highlighted the detrimental impact of the administration's tariff policies on Michigan's vital automobile industry. This meeting underscores Whitmer's strategy of maintaining bipartisan communication with the White House to secure federal support and investment for her state, even while disagreeing on certain policies and rhetoric.</p>

These models are designed to be lower-cost alternatives that developers and researchers can run and customize, competing with similar offerings from Meta, Mistral AI, and DeepSeek. The release follows delays for extensive safety testing, where OpenAI worked to mitigate potential malicious use. The models, available on platforms like Hugging Face and GitHub, are optimized to run on a wide range of hardware, from consumer laptops to cloud servers, aiming to broaden access to powerful AI technology.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have arrested two Los Angeles County residents, Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, for their alleged role in an illegal scheme to export high-powered AI microchips to China. The duo, who operated a tech company called ALX Solutions Inc., are accused of violating the Export Control Reform Act by shipping tens of millions of dollars' worth of sensitive technology without the required licenses. Prosecutors claim they concealed the shipments by routing them through third-party countries like Singapore and Malaysia and falsifying labels. If convicted, Geng and Yang face a maximum of 20 years in prison for undercutting U.S. national security controls on emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court seeking the removal of Democratic State Representative Gene Wu from office. Abbott accuses Wu of being the "ringleader" of the Democratic walkout, where dozens of lawmakers fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan. The governor's petition argues that Wu and his colleagues have abandoned their official duties, thereby forfeiting their elected positions. This legal action represents a significant escalation in the political standoff that has paralyzed the Texas House by denying it the quorum needed to conduct business.</p>

          <p>Austin Robert Drummond, the man suspected of killing four members of his girlfriend's family, has been arrested in rural Tennessee, ending an intensive weeklong manhunt. Drummond is accused of fatally shooting the parents, grandmother, and teenage uncle of a baby he then abandoned in a car seat outside a stranger's home. The arrest occurred after authorities issued a shelter-in-place warning near Jackson and received multiple tips from the public. The killings were described as a targeted attack, and Drummond now faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder. The infant is reported to be safe and in care.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements, public perception of weather forecasting accuracy remains mixed, a phenomenon this article explores in detail. Lead weather forecaster Carol Kirkwood explains that while a one-day forecast is now over 90% accurate, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere means tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, an idea known as the Butterfly Effect. The article discusses the difficulty of predicting weather for very small geographic areas and the challenge of communicating complex meteorological data and uncertainty to the public. It also looks to the future, where AI could provide more granular, long-range predictions but also presents new challenges for clear communication.</p>

          <p>A recent tsunami that struck Crescent City, California, caused an estimated $1 million in damage to its harbor, significantly more than initially assessed. While one dock, H Dock, functioned as a "sacrificial lamb" to protect other infrastructure, officials discovered severe underwater damage and a previously underrecognized design vulnerability. The powerful currents created a downward force that submerged the floating dock, a reverse-lift effect that caused structural failure. This event has highlighted new challenges for the tsunami-resistant harbor, which was rebuilt after a devastating tsunami in 2011, and will require extensive dredging and costly repairs.</p>

In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience price growth due to more limited housing supply and stricter zoning laws.

Struggling business owners argue the higher fees could be disastrous, as they already face high taxes, lack of traditional financing, and intense competition from the illicit market. While the city will use a state grant to offset some of the increased costs for social equity participants, the new fees add another financial burden to a constricting industry.

          <p>Shares of Snap Inc. fell over 15% after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, specifically missing expectations for global average revenue per user (ARPU). This key metric, which indicates advertising revenue generated from each user, came in at $2.87 against an expected $2.90. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weak topline growth to a since-reverted update to its ad platform, the timing of Ramadan, and trade policy changes. While the company's daily active users and Snapchat+ subscriptions grew, the weak ARPU figure and an overall net loss of $262.6 million concerned investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. is making a concerted effort to reduce its heavy reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for everything from consumer electronics to advanced military technology. A key part of this strategy is the revival of California's Mountain Pass mine, which was once the world's dominant supplier but closed in 2002. With significant funding from the Department of Defense, the U.S. government is aiming to re-establish a domestic supply chain after previous private sector attempts to restart the mine ended in bankruptcy. This strategic push reflects growing urgency in Washington to secure American access to these critical materials.</p>

          <p>California officials are warning hunters and the public about wild pigs in Monterey County whose flesh and fat have turned a startling "neon blue." The California Department of Fish and Wildlife determined the discoloration is caused by the pigs consuming diphacinone, an anticoagulant rodenticide used by agricultural operations to control squirrels and other pests. The poison, which is dyed blue, remains in the animals' tissue, posing a risk of secondary exposure to predators and humans who might consume the meat. Authorities are urging the public not to eat any animal with signs of blue pigmentation and to report such findings immediately.</p>

The BRIC program was created to help communities protect critical infrastructure before natural disasters occur.

However, his legacy is marred by controversy, particularly his role in the violent suppression of anti-government protests in 1990, known as the Mineriads.

Despite this, Trump has persistently labeled any investigation into the matter a hoax or witch hunt.
