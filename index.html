            <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is investigating a pediatric teaching hospital, suspected to be Texas Children’s Hospital, after a nurse alleged she was fired for raising concerns about gender-affirming treatments for minors. The nurse, Vanessa Sivadge, testified about witnessing disturbing practices, including doctors allegedly emotionally blackmailing parents to affirm their child's false identity. The investigation follows claims that the hospital paused and later banned gender-affirming services due to legal challenges in Texas. This comes after President Trump signed an order preventing minors from undergoing transgender treatments, prompting HHS to issue guidelines for whistleblowers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Some tourists are expressing anxiety and reconsidering travel plans to the U.S. following Donald Trump's re-election, citing concerns about detainments and deportations at border points.

These efforts, fueled by claims of election insecurity, include stricter voter ID provisions and restrictions on mail voting. Critics argue these bills could disenfranchise eligible voters and undermine confidence in elections.
