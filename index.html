          <p>Former professional boxer Duke Tanner, who received clemency from President Trump and a subsequent pardon, shares his experiences with the criminal justice system. Tanner, who served 16 years for drug trafficking, reflects on his time in prison, his dedication to Christianity, and his efforts to rehabilitate himself. He recounts the dream that led him to write letters to the White House, ultimately resulting in his release. Tanner also touches on the possibility of a pardon for Sean "Diddy" Combs, emphasizing the importance of due process and accountability within the criminal justice system. He highlights the need for clemency for others who deserve a second chance, while contrasting his situation with Hunter Biden's pardon. The discussion is centered on the topic of clemency, not the direct promotion of financial instruments. </p>

Activists from the 1980s student movement stressed the need for remembrance and accountability from the Chinese government. The exhibit's director, Wang Dan, a participant in the Tiananmen protests, aims to expand its impact and make the El Monte location a hub for cultural and educational events.

He aims to strengthen ties with the United States and Japan to counter North Korea, while also seeking improved relations with China and Russia. Lee also faces challenges in talks with the U.S. regarding higher import tariffs, and will be watched closely for changes in South Korea's stance toward Japan regarding wartime issues.

Barcelona's women's team, for example, has built a strong fan base and generates significant revenue through sponsorships and ticket sales. The WE League is working to acquire sponsors and collaborate with the J-League to stabilize its financial base and increase attendance.

An attorney for the L.A. Alliance for Human Rights withdrew subpoenas issued to Bass and two City Councilmembers, citing potential delays from legal challenges. The alliance, which sued the city in 2020, argues that the city has failed to comply with a settlement agreement requiring it to provide 12,915 beds for the unhoused population by 2027. City officials maintain they intend to comply, highlighting efforts such as Inside Safe, which moves unhoused individuals into interim housing.

Scott allegedly wrote the letters to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying against him in a robbery case. Morales-Reyes doesn't speak fluent English, and his handwriting differs from the letters. Scott admitted to writing the letters, stating his intention was not to threaten Trump but to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying.

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that required hospitals to perform emergency abortions under a federal law.

The Trump administration stated that the rescinded guidance does not reflect its policy and that CMS will continue to enforce EMTALA, protecting individuals seeking treatment in emergency departments. Abortion rights groups have criticized the administration's decision, while the Biden administration's guidance has faced legal challenges in the past.

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing increasing criticism from right-wing figures for her votes on the Supreme Court. Criticism stems from her votes with liberal justices on issues such as foreign aid and election-related cases. Some MAGA voices accuse Trump of elevating Barrett as a "DEI Hire." Despite the criticism, Trump has publicly defended Barrett, and she has voted in line with conservative principles on key issues. The situation highlights the complex dynamics within the conservative legal movement. </p>
