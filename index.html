          <p>In 1993, Jeanie Childs was brutally murdered in her Minneapolis apartment, leaving behind bloody, bare footprints that became a crucial clue. Decades later, forensic scientist Andrea Feia discovered an unknown DNA profile that repeated itself throughout the crime scene. Investigators turned to investigative genetic genealogy, which led them to two brothers, one of whom was Jerry Westrom. Investigators followed Westrom to his daughter's hockey game and obtained a napkin he used, confirming the DNA match. Westrom was arrested and charged with the murder of Childs, eventually being convicted, though the journey to justice was filled with twists and turns, as well as challenges to the presented evidence.</p>

          <p>President Trump scolded Walmart after the retail giant warned that his tariffs would force it to raise prices, asserting that the company should absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Walmart, in response, stated it would strive to keep prices low despite the tariff pressures. Trump's stance comes as he aims to prevent inflation amid his trade policies, with Walmart noting that a third of its products are sourced from abroad, particularly China and Mexico.

          <p>Taiwan has shut down its last operating nuclear power reactor, marking the end of four decades of nuclear energy production on the island. The closure aligns with the government's policy to phase out nuclear power, a decision influenced by the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. However, questions remain about whether Taiwan can successfully achieve its goal of transitioning to alternative energy sources. The No. 2 reactor at the Maanshan power plant in southern Pingtung County ended operations as the self-ruled island moves to phase out nuclear power following Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster.</p>
