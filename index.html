        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold futures retreated from a record high after the White House stated it would issue an executive order to clarify misinformation regarding tariffs on the precious metal. The announcement came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association expressed concern that new U.S. tariffs, reportedly as high as 39% on Swiss exports, would negatively impact the international gold market. The clarification is intended to address uncertainty surrounding whether 1-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars are subject to these duties, a move that affects global refiners, not just Switzerland. This development introduced volatility into the market, pulling prices down from their peak.</p>

          <p>Tesla has obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing service in Texas, positioning it to compete with Uber and Lyft across the state. The permit allows the company to run its Robotaxi service, which has been in a limited trial in Austin with human safety supervisors, without a mandatory human driver. While CEO Elon Musk is optimistic about expanding autonomous ride-hailing, the company faces scrutiny over safety incidents and legal challenges concerning its driver-assistance technology claims. This permit marks a significant step for Tesla's ambitions, despite ongoing federal investigations and controversy surrounding its autonomous driving systems.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies like Meta and Alphabet are experiencing significant revenue growth in digital advertising, largely driven by advancements in artificial intelligence tools. These AI systems have enhanced ad efficiency, attracting increased spending from both large and small advertisers. In contrast, smaller platforms such as Snap and Pinterest reported lukewarm results, struggling with issues like botched platform updates and advertiser pullback amid economic uncertainty. The trend highlights a growing divergence in the market, where the massive AI investments by tech giants are solidifying their dominance and leaving less room for error for their smaller competitors.</p>

          <p>A new bill, the Apeel Reveal Act, has been introduced in the U.S. House to mandate the labeling of shelf-life-extending coatings applied to fruits and vegetables. The legislation specifically targets products from companies like Apeel Sciences, aiming to provide consumers with greater transparency about the substances on their food. Apeel states its plant-based coatings are made from FDA-approved, safe ingredients and already uses its own logo for identification. The debate centers on consumer rights to detailed information versus the food industry's innovations aimed at reducing waste and lowering grocery costs for families.</p>

The Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to prevent the passage of maps that would likely increase the GOP's congressional seats. Despite threats of arrest and suspension of pay from Republican leaders, the Democrats are holding firm, creating a significant political standoff with national implications. The conflict has escalated with legal actions and involvement from politicians in other states, highlighting deep partisan divisions.</p>

Sturgeon also opens up about personal hardships, including a miscarriage, and addresses public rumors about her sexuality. The excerpts provide a raw look into the personal and political turmoil she faced during and after her time in office.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly gave a Soviet-era award to President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, intended for a senior CIA official whose son was killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The gesture, which involved the Order of Lenin, is seen as a provocative move by Putin to highlight a sensitive and unusual situation. The CIA official's son, Michael Gloss, had struggled with mental health and enlisted with Russian forces without his family's knowledge. This action by Putin occurs during tense negotiations over the Ukraine war and is likely intended to create diplomatic and political awkwardness for the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to develop military options for potential use against drug cartels, which his administration has designated as foreign terrorist organizations. While officials state that military action is not imminent, the directive authorizes the preparation of plans that could involve U.S. forces operating against these groups. This move follows the official terrorist designation of several cartels, including the Sinaloa Cartel and MS-13. The policy signals a significant escalation in the U.S. approach to combating drug trafficking, shifting from a law enforcement focus to a potential military one.</p>

Despite the company's assurances of comprehensive safety enhancements, including hiring a new food safety officer, the findings raise questions about systemic problems and federal oversight.

          <p>The daughter of Bhim Kohli, an 80-year-old man killed in an attack by teenagers, claims his death could have been prevented if police had acted on earlier information. A report revealed that police knew the identities of youths who had racially assaulted another man two weeks prior—an incident her father witnessed—but failed to make arrests until after his death. The victim's daughter argues that timely police action could have deterred further violence in the area. Leicestershire Police acknowledged "organisational learning" but concluded that its actions did not contribute to Mr. Kohli's death.</p>

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude is not expected to jeopardize a potential free trade agreement between the EU and India. Experts suggest the move is largely symbolic and has less impact than the threat of U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. In fact, pressure from the U.S. may paradoxically push India to seek a more stable and predictable economic partnership with the EU. The sanctions target Nayara Energy, partly owned by Russia's Rosneft, as part of the EU's effort to cut off funding for Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, launched a sharp, undiplomatic attack on UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, comparing Israel's assault on Gaza to the controversial Allied bombing of Dresden during World War II. The comments came after Starmer criticized Israel's decision to expand the war and called for a ceasefire. Huckabee provocatively asked on social media if the UK surrendered to the Nazis and dropped food on them, suggesting Britain would be speaking German if Starmer had been prime minister then. The remarks represent a significant diplomatic rebuke and reflect the ambassador's history of making inflammatory pro-Israel statements.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record high of over $1.21 trillion, this article outlines several strategies for consumers to combat compounding interest charges. Key methods include transferring balances to a credit card with a 0% introductory APR, which can provide an interest-free period of up to 21 months to pay down the principal. Other options discussed are enrolling in a credit card issuer's hardship program for temporary relief, using a personal loan to consolidate high-interest debt, and paying off balances before the statement closing date to avoid interest accrual entirely.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates are expected to decline, this article advocates for using a CD laddering strategy to maximize savings while maintaining financial flexibility. The approach involves opening multiple certificates of deposit (CDs) with staggered maturity dates, allowing savers to lock in currently high rates on some funds while keeping other portions of their money accessible in the short term. This method helps navigate an unpredictable economy where savers want to capitalize on favorable rates before they drop, without committing all their funds to long-term, inflexible accounts.

          <p>Archaeologists from East Carolina University may have discovered the remains of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer ship that exploded during an attack on a colonial port in 1748. The shipwreck was one of four found near the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site. Wood sample analysis suggests the vessel was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was recovered in 1985. The discovery, along with three other wrecks, offers a significant opportunity to understand the maritime history and colonial life of one of North Carolina's earliest port towns.</p>

The decision has been met with dismay from grant recipients, including state energy offices and tribal organizations, who had already begun work on projects.

          <p>A federal appeals court has thrown out a judicial contempt finding against the Trump administration concerning its deportation of over 250 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. A lower court judge had found officials willfully disregarded his order to halt the removals, which were conducted without due process under the Alien Enemies Act. However, the appellate panel ruled that the lower court's order raised "troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions," particularly in foreign policy. The decision is a victory for the administration in one of its most controversial immigration actions.</p>
