        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a general slowdown in deal-making among single-family offices, artificial intelligence startups continue to attract significant investment. In April, AI-related ventures accounted for half of all direct deals made by these firms. Quantitative AI firm SandboxAQ, led by CEO Jack Hidary, recently closed a $450 million Series E round, backed by billionaires and their family offices, including Eric Schmidt's Hillspire, Ray Dalio's family office, Google, and Nvidia. Hidary notes that professionally managed family offices and large institutions have developed a greater appetite for deep-tech startups, recognizing their lower risk compared to consumer-oriented tech companies.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman reportedly had an outburst during a meeting with a teachers union, repeating himself, shouting, questioning why everyone was mad at him, and slamming his hands on a desk. This incident occurred the day before a New York Magazine story detailed concerns from former staff about Fetterman's mental health, including a letter from his former chief of staff describing alarming behavior. Fetterman's office stated that the meeting involved a "spirited conversation" about frustration with the Trump administration's cuts to education, but the union president declined to comment on the private conversation. The article adds to existing scrutiny following Fetterman's stroke in 2022 and subsequent battle with depression, raising questions about his recovery and fitness for office.</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her final appeal to have her 2022 fraud conviction reheard. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals denied Holmes' request for a rehearing, leaving the Supreme Court as her last option to overturn the conviction. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison for deceiving investors about the capabilities of Theranos' blood-testing technology. The company, once valued at billions, collapsed after a Wall Street Journal story revealed its struggles and ultimately shut down in 2018.</p>

Experts anticipate a rise in inflation, with manufacturers expecting price increases over the next year.

          <p>Two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham, are advocating for congressional approval of any Iran nuclear deal, preferably through a two-thirds majority treaty vote. They argue that a lasting agreement requires Iran to eliminate enriched uranium and centrifuges, dismantle its ballistic missile program, and cease support for terrorist groups. The senators draw parallels with legal frameworks governing U.S. civil nuclear cooperation with foreign nations, suggesting that any comprehensive deal with Iran should undergo similar legislative scrutiny. They emphasize that the regime has limited time to agree to a deal, with potential for direct military action if talks fail.</p>

          <p>Political scientists argue that America has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition to the government comes with a price. The Trump administration's weaponization of government agencies and punitive actions against critics have raised the cost of opposition for many Americans. This includes targeting major law firms, donors to the Democratic Party, and media outlets. The authors contend that these attacks have occurred with greater speed and force than equivalent actions taken by elected autocrats in other countries, leading to self-censorship and a weakening of democratic defenses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to end a program that provided temporary protection to over 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela. The request arises from a legal challenge to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke the parole granted under the CHNV program. The administration argues that federal immigration law grants the Homeland Security secretary discretion over parole-termination decisions and that the district court overstepped its authority by interfering with executive branch control of foreign policy and immigration.</p>

          <p>An autopsy revealed that a firing squad execution in South Carolina may have been botched, as the bullets largely missed the prisoner's heart, causing prolonged suffering. Mikal Mahdi's lawyers are arguing that the execution was cruel and unusual punishment, citing the state's autopsy and a forensic report indicating that Mahdi experienced excruciating conscious pain for 30 to 60 seconds after being shot. The autopsy showed two wounds on his chest, not three, and none of the bullets hit his heart directly, which pathologists say likely caused the prisoner pain and suffering while he was still conscious.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers from swing districts face difficult decisions as key House panels prepare to consider legislation that would cut popular programs to fund President Trump’s agenda. Representative Gabe Evans of Colorado, whose district includes many Medicaid recipients, is involved in drafting legislation that could significantly reduce Medicaid spending. The Republican budget resolution requires the Energy and Commerce Committee to slash spending by $880 billion over the next decade, forcing tough choices for lawmakers in competitive districts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates, claiming it would boost the markets like "jet fuel." Trump accused Powell of being a "fool" and suggested personal dislike might be influencing his decisions. The Fed voted to maintain its benchmark interest rate, citing economic uncertainty created by tariffs, frustrating Trump's desire for lower rates to stimulate the economy. Powell maintained that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the goal of maximum employment and price stability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement framework with the United Kingdom, the first such deal since pausing "reciprocal" tariffs.

The deal also includes commitments on intellectual property, labor, and the environment, as well as a secure supply chain for pharmaceutical products. Some experts downplayed the impact, noting that the U.S. has a trade surplus with the U.K., and this model may not be replicable with countries where the U.S. has a trade deficit.</p>

The Biden administration abandoned the proposal in 2022, citing court orders and concerns that it could cut off some Medicare beneficiaries from drugs and strain providers.

President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world remains in place and still applies to most UK goods entering the US. The deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. Trump had placed import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US on top of the existing 2.5%. This has been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year. The US has previously demanded the import tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated she is open to such a cut.</p>
