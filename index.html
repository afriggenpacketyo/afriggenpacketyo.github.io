          <p>Japan has unveiled a major land and maritime infrastructure initiative spanning East Asia, Africa, India, and the Middle East, raising concerns about potential competition and conflict with China's Belt and Road. This initiative, announced by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the Tokyo International Conference on African Development, risks duplicating efforts and wasting resources, particularly as the US and Europe are less engaged in this arena. The article advocates for Japan and China to collaborate through multilateral development banks, which are specifically designed to provide finance and expertise for international projects. This cooperation would help avoid geopolitical friction, ensure compatible technical and quality standards, and maximize the positive impact of infrastructure development in these crucial regions.</p>

Despite her strong form, Aryna Sabalenka remains world No. 1 and seeks to convert her consistent deep runs into a major win. Coco Gauff faces challenges with her serve, while other contenders like Mirra Andreeva and Elena Rybakina look to make an impact. In the men's draw, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continue their dominance, with Novak Djokovic, now 38, facing physical challenges and a break from competition.

          <p>The US Department of Justice has released the transcript of an interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, conducted under limited immunity. In her testimony, Maxwell stated she never witnessed Donald Trump in any inappropriate setting or engaging in untoward behavior, and repeatedly offered praise for the former president. She described the social relationship between Trump and Jeffrey Epstein but denied knowing details of its origin or the extent of their friendship. The release, which includes documentation from a two-day interview, follows Maxwell's transfer to a minimum-security prison, raising questions about a potential deal for her cooperation. This development is seen by some as beneficial to Trump amidst ongoing political scrutiny over his links to Epstein.</p>

          <p>A suspicious fire broke out late Friday at railway tracks in Wuppertal-Oberbarmen, Germany, causing damage to three track switches and severing crucial cables. German rail operator Deutsche Bahn indicated that an accelerant was likely involved, prompting state security investigators to treat the incident as suspected arson targeting critical infrastructure. This event marks the latest in a series of attacks on railway equipment in North Rhine-Westphalia, intensifying concerns over national transport security. Despite the damage, train traffic experienced minimal disruption. Authorities have initiated a comprehensive investigation, including an overnight helicopter search for suspects, though no immediate arrests have been reported.</p>

          <p>Republican senators are urging Vice President Kamala Harris to testify before the House Oversight Committee, which is actively investigating alleged cover-ups concerning former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline and use of an autopen. Committee Chair James Comer has suggested a subpoena for Harris is highly probable. Senator Roger Marshall, a medical doctor, asserted that Biden's neurodegenerative disease was evident and contributed to national security issues during his term. While Republicans emphasize the need for transparency and accountability from all administration officials, Democrats, like Senator Richard Blumenthal, argue that current economic and inflation challenges should be the primary focus, dismissing the probe as a distraction.</p>

          <p>China's Puer tea market, once seen as a stable wealth preservation investment akin to stocks and real estate, has experienced a significant downturn. Prices for premium Puer products have plummeted to their lowest levels since 2019, with some brands seeing values crash by over 60% from their 2021 peak. This collapse of the speculative bubble mirrors broader economic strains in China, including a weak economy, thinning corporate profit margins, and a sharp reduction in business gift-giving. Stricter anti-corruption campaigns have also made officials wary of conspicuous consumption, further impacting the luxury tea market. (not investment advice)</p>

While acknowledging it wouldn't immediately alter conditions, he noted growing international momentum, with France, Canada, and Australia planning similar recognition.

          <p>Germany's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, a steeper decline than initially estimated, indicating Europe's largest economy is losing momentum.

This marks a potential third consecutive year of contraction for Germany, a first in its postwar history, making it the only G7 economy to stagnate for two years.

Proposals include allowing guests to customize breakfast packages instead of being served numerous small plates, and offering more à la carte dining options in all-inclusive resorts.

In response, California lawmakers approved their own redistricting plan, aiming to gain five Democratic seats to counteract Texas's move. This partisan "arms race" highlights the legal gerrymandering practices and the unusual mid-decade timing, with Democrats threatening lawsuits over alleged dilution of minority voting power.

          <p>The Mirror highlights an open letter from 12 Holocaust survivors who are urgently appealing to Israel to end the suffering of starving Palestinian children in Gaza, following confirmation of famine by a UN-backed body. The article features three-year-old Karim Muammer, hospitalized with malnutrition. Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissing the famine report as an "outright lie," signatories like Joan Salter express heartbreak over the human tragedy and Israel's involvement. This powerful appeal underscores the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the moral imperative felt by those who endured historical atrocities.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Attempt to Cut Funding to Sanctuary Cities</h2>

          <p>A US District Judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties. The ruling extends a previous order, deeming the administration's executive orders and actions as an unconstitutional "coercive threat" against jurisdictions limiting cooperation with federal immigration efforts. The Justice Department had previously sued some of these cities and the Department of Homeland Security had listed non-compliant jurisdictions. The decision represents a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to enforce its tough immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The United States is monitoring with unease the presence of China's five-strong icebreaker and research vessel fleet in the Arctic Ocean, which recently passed through the Bering Strait. China's intensifying interest in the Arctic, demonstrated by numerous scientific expeditions, has prompted a response from the US Coast Guard. The US noted the vessels came within 290 nautical miles of the Alaskan coast, near a disputed "extended continental shelf" area. This development highlights growing geopolitical competition and strategic concerns over China's expanding presence and potential influence in the resource-rich and strategically important Arctic region.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is pledging mass deportations for asylum seekers arriving in the UK via small boats, with Farage asserting this is the "only way forward" to address a national security threat and prevent public disorder. The plan includes taking Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights, banning asylum claims for small boat arrivals, and detaining individuals on disused RAF bases for return to their home countries. While Labour and Conservatives criticize the proposals as unrealistic or recycled, Farage insists radical action is necessary to curb record-high crossings and reduce the £4.76 billion annual asylum spending.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran man, has been released from federal custody after being wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration and subsequently detained upon his return to the US. Despite a 2019 immigration judge's order granting him protection from deportation, he was sent to El Salvador and imprisoned in a maximum-security facility. The Trump administration admitted an "administrative error" but later detained him on criminal charges of conspiring to transport illegal immigrants, which his lawyers deny. A Maryland ruling allowed his release to home detention, enabling him to challenge further deportation efforts.</p>
