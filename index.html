          <p>Major European financial institutions, including Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank, are set to release their quarterly earnings, with market optimism high for the banking sector. This positive outlook contrasts with downgrades in other industries like luxury and energy. However, the European Central Bank is expected to hold interest rates steady, while carefully monitoring potential economic fallout from threatened US tariffs on EU imports, which could prompt future rate cuts.

          <p>The 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Green Bay, Wisconsin, saw her boyfriend initially become the prime suspect before being exonerated by data from his Fitbit. This technological alibi shifted the investigation's focus, ultimately leading authorities to George Steven Burch. Location data from Burch's Google Dashboard placed him at the key locations related to the crime, providing critical evidence that secured his conviction and brought justice for the victim's family.</p>

          <p>Five consecutive days of severe rainfall across South Korea have led to a significant loss of life, with government officials confirming at least 14 fatalities and 12 individuals still missing. The torrential downpours caused landslides, flash floods, and building collapses, particularly in the southern town of Sancheong. Although the rain has subsided and alerts have been lifted, nearly 4,000 people remain evacuated from their homes as the country assesses the extensive damage.</p>
