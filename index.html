          <p>Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) featured a significant software update, introducing a new design language called Liquid Glass across its devices, marking the first major iPhone operating system redesign since 2013. The update includes a revamped lock screen and new animations. However, the unveiling failed to impress Wall Street, with Apple's stock dropping 1.2% as investors anticipated more substantial AI advancements to compete with rivals like Google and OpenAI. Apple delayed its Apple Intelligence feature, including a "more personal" Siri, citing the need for more development time to meet quality standards, with a restated timeline of "the coming year." The unveiling of the software update was underwhelming to some. Optimism for the future of Apple's AI is still up in the air.</p>

          <p>The Insurrection Act of 1807 is a law that allows the president to deploy federal troops on U.S. soil under specific circumstances, such as an insurrection. President Trump has considered invoking the act to address protests in Los Angeles, but has not done so, instead citing Title 10 of the U.S. Code to mobilize the National Guard. Legal experts note the law's broad scope and the potential for abuse of presidential power. California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the administration over the deployment of the National Guard, arguing it is an illegal federalization.</p>

Winfrey was surprised by the story's focus on a male character, given Lamb's extensive work with women in prison. Lamb hopes readers will recognize that addiction is a black hole you can get out of, and that 12-step programs really work.</p>

          <p>As immigration sweeps intensify in Southern California, federal agents are targeting various businesses, both randomly and specifically. Agents have been spotted at courthouses, libraries, Home Depots, and other establishments. The aggressive tactics were reportedly suggested by White House official Stephen Miller, who urged immigration officials to conduct random sweeps and not just focus on people with arrest records. Local officials have expressed concern over the sweeps, which they say have rattled communities and targeted Latino populations.</p>

          <p>The article compares debt forgiveness and debt consolidation, two strategies for managing high credit card debt. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into one new loan or payment plan, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than what is owed. Debt forgiveness can save more money upfront but damages credit, while debt consolidation protects credit but doesn't reduce the principal balance. The article provides a cost comparison and timeline for each strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
