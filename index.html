          <p>Following a deadly attack at a synagogue, Greater Manchester Police has significantly increased its visible presence to reassure local communities. Hundreds of extra officers have been deployed, with many working 12-hour shifts and having rest days canceled to provide security. The heightened police operations also account for the Conservative Party Conference and a planned pro-Palestine march, creating a complex security situation. Authorities have arrested six individuals on suspicion of terrorism offenses in connection with the attack, which was carried out by a man who was out on bail for alleged sexual assault.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly fired Jon Harrison, the Navy's chief of staff, in a significant personnel change at the Pentagon. Harrison, appointed in January, was instrumental in implementing broad changes to the Navy's policy and budgeting offices under the Trump administration. His dismissal follows reports that he and Navy Secretary John Phelan sought to limit the influence of the Navy under secretary. This event is part of a larger pattern of upheaval under Hegseth, who has overseen the firing of numerous top generals and admirals since January.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on how to defend against web injection scams, a type of cyberattack where criminals overlay fake pop-ups on legitimate financial websites to steal credentials. These attacks are particularly deceptive because they appear while a user is already logged into a trusted session. To protect against such threats, the article recommends several key steps, including immediately changing passwords for any exposed accounts, enabling stronger app-based multi-factor authentication, and running comprehensive antivirus software to detect and remove any underlying malware. Regularly monitoring financial accounts for suspicious activity is also crucial.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate the FBI is contemplating a "showy" arrest and perp walk for its former director, James Comey, following his recent indictment for allegedly lying to Congress. The plan reportedly involves using large agents in full tactical gear, a move that is highly unusual for a white-collar defendant. An FBI supervisory special agent was allegedly suspended for insubordination after refusing to participate in the plan, citing its inappropriateness. This development marks a significant escalation in the long-standing feud between President Trump and Comey, whom he fired early in his first term.</p>

          <p>China has revealed details of an incident from last year in which one of its J-16 fighter jets intercepted and expelled two unidentified foreign stealth fighters near its coastline. According to the Chinese pilot, the foreign aircraft were heading directly toward them with provocative intent. The pilot described performing a barrel roll and flying inverted just meters above one of the foreign jets before successfully locking his systems onto both, prompting them to leave the area. The type and nationality of the foreign stealth jets were not disclosed, but the report claims such aircraft have not appeared in the area since.</p>

          <p>Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, has not been sworn into Congress by Speaker Mike Johnson, leaving her unable to officially begin her duties. Grijalva speculates the delay is politically motivated, as her signature would be the final one needed on a discharge petition to force a House vote on releasing files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Speaker Johnson's office has indicated she will be sworn in when the House returns to full session, but the ongoing government funding dispute has kept the chamber largely inactive. This has left Grijalva and her constituents in a state of political limbo.</p>

          <p>According to new research from the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice, prosecutors in 16 states have charged 412 people with pregnancy-related crimes in the two years since Roe v Wade was overturned. The report highlights a trend where laws meant to protect children are being used to criminalize pregnant individuals, often low-income women, for issues like substance use. This practice reflects a growing legal acceptance of "fetal personhood," which grants fetuses full legal rights and could lead to increased surveillance and prosecution of pregnant people for a wide range of behaviors. The article also notes that less than 4% of reported sexual assaults lead to a conviction.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's recent Supreme Court opinions suggests her powerful dissents are intended as a public warning about threats to American democracy. In a notable dissent against a ruling that expanded presidential power, she included a footnote citing a book on the legal structure of Nazi Germany, drawing a parallel to the current administration's actions. Legal scholars interpret this and other sharp critiques as a direct message to the American people and lower courts about the erosion of the rule of law. Her outspokenness has positioned her as the court's 'great dissenter' against the conservative supermajority.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist recommends a simple yet profound practice for parents: creating a dedicated email address for each child at birth. The idea is to periodically send messages, stories, photos, and memories to this inbox, effectively creating a digital time capsule. This practice serves as a private journal and a way to preserve the small, meaningful moments of childhood that are often forgotten. The expert suggests that this collection of notes can be shared with the child at a future milestone, serving as a powerful testament to a parent's love and a cherished record of their life.</p>

Despite Bill Gates calling it the "stupidest decision," Risher was convinced by founder Jeff Bezos's vision and customer-centric approach. Bezos's confidence was key, as he predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000 if they did everything right. Risher was drawn to the opportunity to be part of such rapid growth, and Amazon ultimately surpassed that goal a year early, hitting $1.6 billion in revenue in 1999.</p>

The lyrics refer to another singer who calls Swift a "boring Barbie" and writes songs about hating her, which has fueled the online debate.

This shift is reflected in data showing that fewer high-income families are willing to pay full sticker price, and more are willing to trade prestige for significant merit aid.

          <p>Primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, is being remembered for fundamentally changing humanity's understanding of its place in the world. Her groundbreaking work began in the 1960s when, with no formal college experience, she began living among chimpanzees in Tanzania. A pivotal moment in her research was observing a chimp she named David Greybeard modifying a twig to use as a tool, challenging the long-held belief that tool-making was exclusive to humans. This discovery, and her broader work, dissolved the perceived barrier between humans and other animals, leaving a lasting legacy of empathy and conservation.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike targeted a railway station in the northern Ukrainian city of Shostka, injuring at least 30 people, including train staff and passengers. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as an act of terrorism, stating the target was clearly civilian. This incident is part of a broader escalation of Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine's infrastructure, which also included recent overnight attacks on energy facilities near Chernihiv. In response, Ukrainian forces have reportedly struck one of Russia's largest oil refineries for the second time in recent weeks, continuing the pattern of retaliatory attacks.</p>

          <p>Following the recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called on pro-Palestinian protesters to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews." He argued that planned demonstrations in London and Manchester this weekend are ill-timed and will cause further distress. Police leaders have expressed concern that policing the protests will strain resources needed to protect synagogues and other Jewish community buildings. While protest organizers have asserted their right to demonstrate, a leader from the Community Security Trust called the timing "phenomenally tone deaf."</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend using the final quarter of the year as an ideal time to conduct a thorough financial review. With actual income and spending data available, individuals can engage in more effective year-end tax planning, which is particularly important given recent changes to tax laws. Additionally, this period is crucial for preparing a holiday season budget to prevent starting the new year with financial stress and debt. Proactive planning now can help align spending with future goals and ensure a stronger financial start to 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is making rapid technological advancements with its aircraft carriers, exemplified by its newest carrier, the Fujian, which features advanced electromagnetic catapults for launching jets. While this closes a key technology gap with the U.S. Navy's Ford-class carriers, experts argue China still significantly lags in a critical area: operational experience. The U.S. Navy has decades of institutional knowledge, a deeply experienced workforce, and a proven doctrine for carrier operations built over a century. China is still in the early stages of building this human capital, which is a much slower process than building the hardware itself.</p>

          <p>Following Hamas's positive response to a U.S.-backed peace proposal, Israel has reportedly halted its offensive military operations in the Gaza Strip. A senior Israeli official stated the pause is intended to allow Hamas to organize the release of hostages as stipulated in the first phase of the plan. This move does not constitute an official ceasefire, and the IDF may make tactical adjustments to protect its troops while monitoring Hamas's actions. Indirect talks between the two sides are scheduled to begin in Egypt, which will test the seriousness of Hamas's commitment to the deal.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party will commit to taking the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they win the next election. This major policy shift follows a party-led legal review which concluded that remaining in the ECHR obstructs key government objectives, such as migration reform and protecting military veterans from legal action. The move is seen as a response to growing pressure from Reform UK and aims to settle a long-running internal debate, though it is likely to face strong opposition from moderate conservatives and legal experts.</p>
