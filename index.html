          <p>President Trump's tariff threats have led to a market trend known as "Taco trades," where investors sell at-risk assets when tariffs are threatened and rebuy them when Trump backs down. This strategy reflects an awareness of Trump's negotiation tactics and their impact on the market. Despite this, many investors still believe "there is no alternative" (TINA) to investing in U.S. assets. The S&P 500's performance in April, declining after tariff impositions and rebounding after a pause, exemplifies this pattern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly attempting a "reverse Nixon" strategy by drawing Russia closer to the United States to gain an advantage in geopolitical competition with China. This plan aims to isolate China, guarantee European security, and solidify American global primacy. However, analysts warn that this strategy could backfire, potentially fracturing the American alliance with Europe without splitting Russia from China. The close ties between Russia and China, driven by mutual antipathy toward the United States, present a significant challenge to this strategy.</p>
