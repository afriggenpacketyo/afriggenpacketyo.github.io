          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, following intense pressure over his connection to Jeffrey Epstein. The decision, made in consultation with King Charles, comes as excerpts from a posthumous memoir by accuser Virginia Giuffre are being released. Giuffre's brother has publicly called for the King to also strip Andrew of his "prince" title, a move that would require a formal Letters Patent. Andrew continues to deny all allegations against him but stated the controversy was becoming a distraction for the Royal Family.</p>

          <p>A 17-mile stretch of Interstate 5 in Southern California was closed for four hours as the U.S. Marine Corps conducted a live artillery demonstration over the freeway. The event, part of the Marines' 250th-anniversary celebration, drew sharp criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who called it a dangerous and "absurd show of force." Despite assurances of safety protocols from the military, state officials closed the major artery between San Diego and Orange County due to the risk posed by live ammunition. The demonstration highlights growing political tensions between state and federal leadership.</p>

          <p>Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, attended a "No Kings" protest, vowing to oppose President Trump's agenda "tooth and nail." At the rally in Montclair, Sherrill and other prominent Democrats, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, criticized the president and his administration's policies. Sherrill accused the president of running an "extortion racket" and suggested the economy was struggling compared to the previous administration. The event occurs as polls show a tightening race just weeks before the gubernatorial election.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators gathered in cities across the United States for "No Kings" protests against what they describe as authoritarian actions by the Trump administration. Organizers cited concerns over immigration policies, the deployment of troops to U.S. cities, and attacks on the media as key motivations for the widespread rallies. The events, which also saw solidarity protests at U.S. embassies in Europe, were framed by some Republican leaders as "Hate America" rallies. President Trump responded to the "king" moniker by stating, "I'm not a king," in a television interview.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that a vast majority of American workers feel they have been victims of "career catfishing," where a job's reality differs significantly from what was described during the hiring process. This phenomenon involves employers misrepresenting company culture, workload, or career growth opportunities to attract candidates. To avoid this, experts advise job seekers to ask specific, example-based questions during interviews about daily operations, management style, and team dynamics. Paying attention to red-flag phrases like "we're like a family" can also help applicants vet potential employers.</p>

Huerta was arrested during a protest of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Los Angeles, where he was accused of obstructing federal officers. His arrest drew condemnation from labor advocates and Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who framed the charges as a politically motivated act of retaliation by the Trump administration.

Officials advise motorists to use Interstate 15 as the main alternative, a detour that could turn a 20-minute drive into a journey of over two hours.

          <p>The reconstruction of the Gaza Strip following a two-year war will be a monumental task, potentially costing $70 billion and taking decades to complete, according to new assessments. Experts from the United Nations and the World Bank highlight the immense scale of devastation, with over 80% of buildings in Gaza City alone damaged or destroyed. Before rebuilding can even begin, significant challenges must be addressed, including clearing massive amounts of rubble and unexploded ordnance. While European and Arab nations have shown willingness to contribute financially, funding is contingent on meaningful progress toward Palestinian statehood.</p>

His albums, including the acclaimed "Voodoo" and the politically charged "Black Messiah," showcased his musical genius but also led to intense public scrutiny.

          <p>A new study from Macromedia University in Hamburg reveals a significant bias in German media, where foreign suspects in criminal cases are mentioned about three times more often than their actual share in police statistics. The research, which analyzed reporting since 2007, found a "drastic distortion" that has intensified since the 2015 migrant crisis, influencing public perception of crime and migration. Professor Thomas Hestermann, who led the study, states this pattern follows a right-wing populist agenda, even if unintentional. Criminologists argue this "migrantization" of crime wrongly links criminal behavior to origin rather than socioeconomic factors.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to settle down, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more likely to want to speed up relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. Researchers suggest this trend is driven by both financial incentives and the fact that heterosexual men often rely on romantic relationships as their primary source of social and emotional support. Experts note that traditional masculinity often restricts men's ability to form close, intimate platonic friendships, making a romantic partner uniquely important for their psychological well-being.</p>

This approach is gaining traction as it provides a form of downside protection against equity drawdowns.

          <p>Lady Annabel Goldsmith, a prominent socialite and the namesake of the iconic London nightclub "Annabel's," has passed away at the age of 91. Born into an aristocratic family, she was a notable figure in London's high society and the matriarch of a well-known family, including politician Zac Goldsmith and producer Jemima Khan. Her first husband, Mark Birley, named the famous club in her honor in 1963. In addition to her social life, Lady Annabel was a dedicated campaigner for various causes, including animal charities and HIV/AIDS relief for children in South Africa.</p>

          <p>A Gen X mother's social media post has gone viral after she apologized to her children's generation for pushing them toward four-year degrees, calling it a "HUGE disservice." She argued that while her generation was taught that college was the only path to success, there is now a significant shortage and high demand for skilled trade workers like electricians and welders. With many college graduates facing substantial debt and underwhelming salaries, she urged parents to consider the high earning potential in trades. The sentiment reflects a growing national conversation about the value of vocational training.</p>

          <p>For just the second time in its 1,500-year history, the Grand Sumo Tournament is being held outside of Japan, taking place at London's Royal Albert Hall. The event required significant logistical efforts to maintain authenticity, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. The tournament features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, competing in 100 bouts over five days, bringing the highly traditional and ritualistic Japanese national sport to a Western audience. Organizers are providing English commentary to help explain the sport's complex rules.</p>

          <p>In a Los Angeles neighborhood, a bi-monthly support group called Mental Health Is Real Wealth offers a vital space for Black men to address their mental health. The group was founded by Desmond Carter after his best friend died by suicide, aiming to combat the stigma that prevents many Black men from seeking help. This initiative comes as suicide rates among Black men have risen significantly, and they often face systemic barriers to receiving culturally competent care. The space allows men to be vulnerable, share their struggles, and build a community of trust and support.</p>

          <p>A graduate student from the University of North Texas found her planned educational trip to China complicated by escalating political tensions between the U.S. and Beijing. Krislyn Massey, who developed a deep interest in Asian culture, had to organize her trip through a non-profit after her university canceled its own programs to the country. Her experience reflects a broader chilling of academic and cultural exchanges, influenced by state-level policies that discourage travel to China. What was once a routine part of international studies has now become a carefully navigated political act for students in some U.S. states.</p>

She identifies three major mistakes: applying for overly broad national scholarships, not applying to enough scholarships, and writing generic essays. Greene recommends focusing on local and state-level awards, as well as scholarships with specific criteria that narrow the competition. She also emphasizes that applying is a numbers game and advises students to treat their application essays as a marketing pitch to convince committees to invest in their education.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) and is engaging with its management. The move comes after KDP's stock fell 25% following the announcement of a complex, debt-financed merger with JDE Peet's, a deal seen as highly favorable to majority owner JAB Holdings. Shareholders were surprised by the structure, which bypasses a shareholder vote and saddles the new company with significant leverage. Starboard's involvement is seen as a potentially constructive effort to restore investor confidence and guide the company through this transition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible to promote better mental health and future success. She recommends two critical steps: starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, and establishing firm, clear rules once devices are introduced. These rules should include no phones in bedrooms overnight or during the school day, and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone first. By teaching moderation and setting boundaries early, parents can help children develop a healthier relationship with technology.</p>
