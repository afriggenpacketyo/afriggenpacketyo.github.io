          <p>Novo Nordisk announced a decrease in its 2025 sales growth forecast due to increased competition from copycat drug compounders impacting Wegovy sales, despite exceeding first-quarter profit expectations.

The article states that for 2025, Novo Nordisk anticipates sales growth between 13% and 21%, a reduction from the previous forecast of 16% to 24%, and operating profit growth is projected at 16% to 24%, compared to the earlier 19% to 27%.</p>

The agreement, which will take up to a year to come into force, is projected to increase trade between the UK and India by an additional £25.5 billion a year by 2040 and boost the UK economy by £4.8 billion.</p>

          <p>AMD has cautioned that new US export restrictions on sales to China, particularly affecting its MI308 chips, will lead to a US$1.5 billion reduction in revenue this year, despite an otherwise optimistic outlook for the company.

CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in the overall demand for AI infrastructure and expects new chips to boost sales in the second half of the year, while acknowledging investor concerns about trade restrictions and competition with Nvidia.</p>
