          <p>Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons publicly supported his agent, David Mulugheta, after Cowboys owner Jerry Jones downplayed the agent's role in contract negotiations. Jones' comments, suggesting he was unaware of Mulugheta's name and that the agent was irrelevant to on-field performance, sparked Parsons' defense of his representative. Parsons emphasized his trust in Mulugheta's expertise and insisted on his involvement in any contract negotiations, highlighting the importance of professional representation in high-stakes deals.  This situation underscores the complexities and dynamics involved in professional sports contract negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court will review President Trump's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants without due process. Trump's interpretation of the act, which has only been invoked during wartime, is unprecedented and lacks historical precedent.  Legal experts question the administration's claim that the act applies to non-state actors and during peacetime, and the attempt to limit legal challenges to individual habeas corpus proceedings in a specific jurisdiction. The case raises significant constitutional concerns regarding due process and executive overreach.</p>
