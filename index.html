          <p>Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb, who was not playing in the preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, was inadvertently knocked over by a sprinting official on the sideline. Lamb was standing too close to the field of play while watching a deep pass during the second quarter. Despite being in street clothes and laughing off the incident, the Cowboys were assessed a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for making contact with an official. The collision and subsequent penalty provided an unusual moment in a game where most of the team's key starters did not participate.</p>

          <p>The death of 32-year-old nurse Alex Pennig in St. Paul, Minnesota, initially appeared to be a suicide, as claimed by her companion, Matthew Ecker. However, investigators uncovered numerous inconsistencies in Ecker's story, including the positioning of Pennig's body and a dry sink despite his claim of washing blood off his hands. A critical piece of evidence, a small metal part from a broken door lock found under the victim's head, suggested the door was forced open before the fatal shot was fired. Ecker was ultimately convicted of second-degree murder, bringing a sense of justice to Pennig's grieving family.</p>

          <p>Legendary New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the team's Old-Timers' Day game and will require surgery. The 55-year-old Hall of Famer was injured while moving to field a fly ball in shallow center field. The incident cast a pall over the celebratory event, which was being held for the first time since 2019. Rivera had previously recovered from a major knee injury in 2012 to return for a final season, finishing his career as baseball's all-time saves leader and a five-time World Series champion with the Yankees.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Rams' preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys, rookie running back Blake Corum demonstrated his readiness for a more significant role in the offense. Corum rushed for 32 yards and two touchdowns, showing he could help ease the workload of star running back Kyren Williams. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also had a solid performance, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, though he did throw one interception. The game showcased the Rams' depth at the running back position, with other rookies also contributing effectively to the team's ground attack.</p>

          <p>After a period dominated by understated "quiet luxury," the high-end fashion industry is shifting back towards more visible and statement-making "loud luxury." Analysts suggest this change is driven by a need to create novelty and excitement to counter slowing sales and weary consumer sentiment. Brands like Burberry and Gucci are embracing more distinct branding and heritage designs to boost desirability, while new creative directors at other major houses are expected to phase out subtlety. This sartorial shake-up aims to navigate economic headwinds and reconnect with a broader base of consumers who felt alienated by recent price hikes.</p>

These moves highlight the intense competition for AI expertise within China's tech sector, as companies race to advance their own large language models.

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, once a booming market following the 2008 recession, is now experiencing a significant slowdown due to a combination of economic pressures. Factors contributing to the decline include shifting consumer habits, with Gen-Z drinking less, and post-pandemic inflation pushing drinkers toward cheaper alternatives. The situation is exacerbated by global trade disputes, particularly retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada, which have severely impacted exports. This downturn has led to falling sales for major brands and bankruptcies for smaller distilleries and related businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

This move intensifies pressure on the university, which is already suing the administration over the freezing of federal research funds.

An investigation by BBC News found that while these drinks contain popular supplements like L-theanine and Lion's Mane, the quantities are often too small to produce the advertised effects based on current scientific research. One psychologist suggests that any calming effect may be a placebo, created by the ritual of taking time for oneself with a perceived treat. Despite an advertising ban against one major brand for making unproven health claims, these drinks remain popular alternatives to alcohol.</p>

This article explores how Irish identity is no longer a simple binary but a complex and evolving concept, influenced by diaspora, history, and the peace process in Northern Ireland. The discussion encompasses a wide spectrum of figures, from the children of immigrants like the members of Oasis to artists from Ulster's Protestant tradition. It suggests that identity is deeply personal and can embrace multiple heritages, reflecting a more fluid and inclusive understanding of cultural belonging in a globalized world.</p>

          <p>Six months after Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 shocked the tech world, its impact continues to be felt, having challenged the prevailing "bigger is better" philosophy in AI development. The app demonstrated that a highly capable model could be built for a fraction of the cost and resources used by American giants like OpenAI, signaling a shift in the U.S.-China AI rivalry. While security concerns about its Chinese origins persist, DeepSeek's success has spurred a move toward more efficient, cost-effective models. This has prompted major players like OpenAI to release their own smaller, open-source models, altering the industry's trajectory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The gunman who attacked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention campus in Atlanta, killing a police officer, was reportedly motivated by a belief that the COVID-19 vaccine had made him depressed and suicidal. According to a law enforcement official, the suspect, 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, had become fixated on this idea. The attack has drawn sharp criticism from former CDC employees, who argue that anti-vaccine rhetoric from public figures has fueled a climate of hostility against public health workers. This tragic event highlights the dangerous real-world consequences of health-related misinformation and the escalating threats faced by scientific institutions.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas are facing accusations of cultural appropriation from authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico, over a new sandal design. The Mexican government claims the "Oaxaca Slip-On" reinterprets a traditional huarache sandal unique to the region without proper collaboration or compensation. Chavarria has expressed deep regret, acknowledging the design should have been developed in partnership with the Oaxacan community. Adidas has also recognized the criticism and requested a meeting with local officials to repair the damage, as Mexico continues to challenge fashion powerhouses over the use of Indigenous cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White as the gunman in the fatal shooting near the CDC headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta. The attack resulted in the death of DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose, a 33-year-old former Marine, before White was also found dead. The incident prompted a massive law enforcement response and a shelter-in-place order for the campus area. While the motive is still under investigation, sources indicate that the shooter may have believed he was sickened by the COVID-19 vaccine, and neighbors confirmed he was outspokenly against vaccines.</p>

The move was well-received by the Trump administration, which indicated Apple would be exempt from future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about profitability.

Martin acknowledged a lack of energy and questioned the team's mentality, admitting there is "no quick fix" for the cultural issues at the club.

          <p>London police arrested 365 people during a protest in support of Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian organization recently banned by the British government. Supporters intentionally violated the new law, which criminalizes public support for the group, as a form of civil disobedience to challenge the ban. The government outlawed Palestine Action after its activists vandalized military aircraft to protest Britain's support for Israel's actions in Gaza. Protesters argue the law illegally restricts freedom of expression, while the mass arrests were intended to strain the criminal justice system and highlight the law's perceived unworkability.</p>
