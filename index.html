          <h2>Tesla Shares Decline Amid Reports of Board Seeking Musk's Replacement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 02:55:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a dip following reports that the company's board is considering candidates to succeed Elon Musk as CEO. The move comes after a decline in Tesla's sales and profits, exacerbated by Musk's involvement in government affairs with President Donald Trump, leading to negative impacts on the company's reputation. Musk has stated he intends to dedicate only a couple of days per week to Tesla, focusing the rest of his time on his role in the Department of Government Efficiency, raising concerns about his commitment to the electric vehicle manufacturer. The board's search reflects concerns about Tesla's performance and brand image under Musk's leadership.</p>

          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a Stoke-on-Trent firm known for its colorful pottery, ceased operations after over 100 years, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs. The company cited rising costs and falling sales as reasons for the closure, which follows similar shutdowns in the ceramics sector. Moorcroft was founded in 1897 and gained recognition with support from Liberty, later receiving royal patronage. Industry leaders are urging government support to address the high cost of energy, which has significantly impacted the ceramics sector, and local authorities are working to support the affected employees in finding new employment opportunities.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is launching his Worldcoin project in the U.S., introducing an identity verification system that scans irises to create unique "IrisCodes." The project aims to combat fraud and bots by verifying users as unique humans, offering free cryptocurrency (WLD) as an incentive for signing up. Worldcoin is opening six flagship U.S. retail locations for iris scans and has partnered with Visa for a "World Visa card" and Match Group for Tinder age verification. Concerns about data storage are addressed by decentralizing data across multiple parties and using cryptography to ensure data security.</p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what observers view as a charm offensive to improve relations with the EU amidst uncertainty created by U.S. tariffs. The sanctions, imposed in 2021 after the EU sanctioned Chinese officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, had stalled a trade and investment deal. While the EU welcomes the move, it maintains concerns about human rights in China and intends to monitor trade flows to prevent market flooding. Despite this easing of tensions, experts doubt the investment deal will be revived due to Beijing's ties with Moscow and persistent human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk argue that the U.S. military lacks sufficient personnel and resources to effectively engage in a major war. They highlight that the current military is equipped for short, high-intensity conflicts but is ill-prepared for prolonged engagements, citing the situations in Ukraine, Israel, and Yemen as examples. The authors urge Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to prioritize resources that directly strengthen combat power, such as active service members, ammunition, new ships, and aircraft, to address the challenges posed by various global threats.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris returned to the political scene with a sharp critique of the Trump administration's first 100 days, accusing it of "wholesale abandonment" of American ideals. She claimed Trump was advancing an agenda that undermined American democracy and brought "chaos" to the U.S. through his tariff policy. Harris praised Democrats resisting the Trump administration and highlighted the importance of judges upholding the rule of law. She also suggested that a constitutional crisis could arise if Congress and the courts fail to check the president's power.</p>

The hospital also offers a "confidential birth" system, allowing women to give birth without revealing their identities.

The author contrasts the past, when America aimed to shape the world in its image, with the present, where China's economic and military presence is increasingly felt. The article highlights instances where China has stepped in to provide assistance, while the U.S. has reduced its involvement, leading some in Asia to question America's commitment. Despite this, American ideals and culture continue to resonate in the region.</p>

Reports suggest that reserve attendance has decreased, signaling a potential crisis for the military, which heavily relies on reservists. Critics argue that the government's determination to continue fighting Hamas is misplaced, and that releasing the hostages should be the priority.</p>
