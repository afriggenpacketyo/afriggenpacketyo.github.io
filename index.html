          <p>China's unemployment rate for urban youth aged 16-24, excluding students, climbed to 17.8% in July, its highest point in nearly a year. This increase follows four months of decline and coincides with a record number of college graduates entering a challenging job market. The Chinese government has responded by launching initiatives to support jobless youth, including career guidance and training opportunities, as recent graduates report significant difficulties in securing suitable employment. The data highlights ongoing economic pressures affecting the nation's younger generation.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after a prison sentence for sexual assault marked a pivotal moment for the sport's pay-per-view model. The highly promoted fight against Peter McNeeley, which lasted only 89 seconds, shattered viewership records despite being a blatant mismatch, attracting a massive celebrity audience. This article reflects on how the event, promoted as "He's Back," demonstrated that spectacle and celebrity could triumph over competitive substance. It set a precedent for future high-profile exhibition matches and influencer boxing, proving that Tyson's controversial mystique and drawing power remained potent.</p>

          <p>A writer shares her personal experience of being diagnosed with very high cholesterol and advised to change her diet, years after recovering from anorexia. The essay explores the complex emotional and psychological challenges of adopting "healthy" eating habits when one's identity has been shaped by both the disorder and a performative recovery that rejected all food restrictions. The author criticizes societal health messaging that conflates weight with health and the design of health apps that can trigger disordered eating patterns. She reflects on the difficult journey of balancing physical health needs with mental well-being.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has agreed to participate in a trilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, even without a pre-existing cease-fire. This development comes after Trump shifted his own stance on the necessity of a cease-fire following a meeting with Putin, a move that has drawn criticism. While the author expresses hope that Trump's diplomatic efforts could lead to peace, they also raise concerns about Putin's lack of concessions and the potential risks for Ukraine in negotiating while under continued Russian attack. The article questions whether Putin will even agree to attend such a summit.</p>

This digital evolution of language is rewiring how individuals, particularly younger generations, interact and express themselves both online and offline, creating new linguistic norms.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reported that a record 383 aid workers were killed in global conflict zones during 2024, a significant increase from the 293 deaths in 2023. Nearly half of these fatalities occurred in Gaza amid the ongoing war, with Sudan following as the second deadliest location. U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher described the figures as a "shameful indictment of international inaction," calling for accountability and better protection for humanitarian staff. Most of the victims were national staff serving their own communities, highlighting the extreme dangers faced by those providing essential aid in crisis areas.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, U.S. President Donald Trump announced he had called Russian President Vladimir Putin to arrange direct talks. Zelenskyy stated he is ready for such a meeting without preconditions, a significant diplomatic development aimed at ending the war. While Trump pledged U.S. and European support for Ukraine's security in a potential peace deal, some European leaders expressed skepticism about Putin's willingness to negotiate in good faith. The talks occurred even as Russia continued its drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, underscoring the conflict's ongoing intensity.</p>

The complex, two-day operation involves hoisting the 672-tonne structure onto giant rolling platforms to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. This event is a key part of a broader project to relocate parts of the city threatened by ground fissures from the mine, which is the area's largest employer. The church's treasures, including a large altar painting and a 1,000-pipe organ, are being moved while still inside the structure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing acquiring a 10% equity stake in Intel, a move that would make the U.S. government the chipmaker's largest shareholder. The proposal involves potentially converting some or all of the $10.9 billion in grants awarded to Intel under the 2022 CHIPS Act into company equity. This consideration is part of a broader effort to revitalize the struggling American semiconductor giant and bolster national security amid intense global competition.

          <p>The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery has successfully raised £3.8 million to purchase "Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red," a significant piece by Dame Barbara Hepworth. The acquisition prevents the sculpture from being sold to a private international buyer and ensures it will remain on permanent public display in the artist's hometown. The fundraising campaign was a major success, receiving over 2,800 public donations alongside large grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund. The piece is a rare example of Hepworth's wooden carvings from the 1940s.</p>

          <p>After entering the workforce during the pandemic and experiencing fatigue with virtual interactions, many Gen Z professionals are seeking out in-person networking events to make friends. This article highlights initiatives like "Wharf Connect" in London, which organizes free events such as dumpling-making classes and pub quizzes for young workers. These structured, activity-focused gatherings provide a low-pressure environment for a generation that reports high levels of loneliness and may have underdeveloped social skills due to remote work. The trend reflects a broader rejection of purely digital connections in favor of building tangible, real-life communities.</p>

          <p>After nine months of largely peaceful demonstrations, protests in Serbia have turned violent, with nightly clashes between demonstrators and police erupting across the country. Protesters, who are furious with the current regime, have been met with batons, tear gas, and smoke bombs. Reports and videos suggest the presence of masked, pro-government paramilitary groups attacking demonstrators, adding to the chaos. President Aleksandar Vucic has promised a "harsh response" to restore order, accusing protesters of trying to destroy the state, while activists fear for their safety amid the escalating violence and police brutality.</p>

          <p>Sean Gardner, a former coach at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute in Iowa, has been arrested by the FBI on a federal child pornography charge. The arrest comes more than three years after he was suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport following allegations of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at the academy. Court records also show he was accused of secretly recording other gymnasts undressing at a previous job in Mississippi. The case highlights the slow and often opaque process of SafeSport investigations, as Gardner was able to secure a job in a hospital even after the abuse allegations were reported.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the United States is experiencing massive collapses in its commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has grown by 25% to a record 15 million colonies. According to researchers at China's Institute of Apicultural Research, the key difference lies in management practices. The U.S. model relies on large, clustered apiaries and minimal intervention, making colonies more vulnerable to disease and stress. In contrast, Chinese beekeeping often involves smaller-scale, more mobile operations where beekeepers actively manage their hives, moving them frequently to follow blooming seasons and providing more direct care, which contributes to their resilience.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union's inaction regarding Israel's actions in Gaza is a reflection of deep-seated structural racism and a lingering colonial mentality. The author contends that the EU has failed to use its significant economic leverage, such as suspending its trade agreement with Israel, despite clear human rights breaches. This paralysis is contrasted sharply with the EU's swift and severe response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, suggesting that Palestinian lives are treated as expendable. The piece calls for a moral reckoning within the EU, urging it to confront these double standards to maintain its credibility.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a preliminary injunction sought by USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and UCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson, effectively blocking them from playing in the 2025 college football season. The players had sued the NCAA, arguing that its five-year eligibility rule violated antitrust laws by unfairly limiting their ability to earn Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) compensation. However, the judge ruled that the NCAA's rule was related to eligibility, not commercial activity, and therefore was not subject to antitrust scrutiny. The decision is a significant blow to both players and their respective teams.</p>

          <p>Following a 4-3 walk-off loss to the Colorado Rockies, Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts held a private meeting with manager Dave Roberts and president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman. The loss was punctuated by two crucial defensive misplays in right field by Teoscar Hernández, fueling speculation about potential defensive adjustments. One possibility discussed is moving Betts, a six-time Gold Glove winner in the outfield, back to right field to shore up the defense. The meeting underscores the team's growing frustration with its defensive performance, even as Hernández remains a key offensive contributor in the lineup.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed part of a lawsuit filed by civil rights attorneys concerning the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades. The dismissed claim alleged a Fifth Amendment violation because the government had not clarified which court had jurisdiction over the detainees. The judge ruled this point moot after the government designated a specific court, but allowed other claims regarding the violation of detainees' First Amendment rights to confidential legal access to proceed. The case, which highlights the controversial conditions at the temporary facility, has been transferred to a different federal court.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he intends to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, claiming that his administration is currently drafting an executive order to do so. During a meeting, he asserted without evidence that mail-in ballots are "corrupt" and the only way Democrats can win elections. However, the U.S. Constitution grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections, with changes requiring an act of Congress. Legal experts and election officials note that such an executive order would be unconstitutional and that widespread mail-in voting has been used securely in the U.S. for decades.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war, according to a new S&P report. In the last five years, these exports grew by 65%, far outpacing the 28% growth in exports to the United States. China now sends over 50% more goods to the developing world than to the U.S. and Western Europe combined. Analysts suggest that ongoing trade uncertainties with the West will continue to push Chinese firms to deepen their commercial ties with the Global South, potentially creating a new center of gravity in global trade.
