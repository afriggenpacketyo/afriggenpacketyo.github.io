          <p>Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez was hospitalized in Indianapolis early Saturday morning after being involved in a physical disturbance. His agent, Andrew Kessler, confirmed Sanchez is in stable condition and recovering. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police reported that two adult men were involved, with one suffering apparent stab wounds, and emphasized it was not a random act of violence as the individuals appeared to know each other. FOX Sports expressed gratitude to the medical team and requested privacy for Sanchez and his family. The case will be presented to the Marion County Prosecutor's office for a charging decision.</p>

          <h2>Certain Fruits May Aid Sleep, According to Health Experts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certain fruits, rich in natural hormones and antioxidants, may help Americans fall asleep faster and improve sleep quality, according to board-certified dietitian nutritionist Kendall Mackintosh. She notes that as fall brings shorter days and less natural light, supporting melatonin naturally becomes increasingly important for sleep, mood, and metabolism. Tart cherries are highlighted for their ability to increase melatonin and provide tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin and melatonin. Kiwi consumption has also been associated with significantly improved sleep quality and duration, as evidenced by a 2024 study on elite athletes. Grapes, containing a degree of melatonin and being low in calories, are recommended as a beneficial evening snack, with experts advising consumption in their natural, unprocessed form for optimal nutrition.</p>

          <p>Over 400 people were arrested in central London during protests organized by Defend Our Juries, expressing support for the proscribed group Palestine Action. These demonstrations proceeded despite calls from ministers and police to postpone them following a deadly synagogue attack in Manchester, with organizers stating that canceling would mean "letting terror win" while acknowledging grief for all victims. The Metropolitan Police deployed 1,500 officers, making numerous arrests as demonstrators defied the ban, including for unfurling banners on Westminster Bridge. The force highlighted the significant resources diverted from community reassurance efforts, while human rights groups like Amnesty International UK criticized the arrests as breaches of international human rights obligations.</p>

          <p>Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard has set an unwanted Premier League record, becoming the first player to be substituted before half-time in three consecutive starts. The 26-year-old Norwegian midfielder was forced off after just 30 minutes against West Ham due to a knee-to-knee collision, following earlier withdrawals from matches against Leeds and Nottingham Forest due to a recurring shoulder issue. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed significant concern, stating Odegaard is "not positive about it" and has been unlucky with injuries since the season began. His consistent fitness struggles are a challenge for Arsenal, as he is their captain and provides a crucial attacking dimension, requiring the team to find solutions in his absence.</p>

          <p>Rite Aid, the long-standing U.S. pharmacy chain, has announced the closure of all its locations, with a message on its website thanking loyal customers. This development follows the company's second bankruptcy filing in nearly two years, initially in October 2023, which led to plans for closing 154 stores. Since then, over 520 pharmacies, about a quarter of its total, have ceased operations. The company has been grappling with declining sales and significant opioid-related lawsuits, including a Justice Department complaint accusing it of filling unlawful prescriptions.

          <p>Formula 1 drivers are divided over the use of cooling vests at the Singapore Grand Prix, the first race declared a 'heat hazard' by the FIA due to high temperatures and humidity. Red Bull's Max Verstappen criticized the system and proposed mandatory use, citing discomfort, lack of cockpit space, and potential for the system to become ineffective if dry ice melts. In contrast, Mercedes' George Russell plans to use the vest, noting team improvements in car cooling. McLaren's Oscar Piastri remains undecided, highlighting the benefits if it works versus the risks if it fails. The debate underscores challenges in driver safety and comfort in extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>Populist billionaire Andrej Babiš has won the Czech parliamentary election, marking a political comeback that signals a shift away from Ukraine support and towards policies aligning with Hungary and Slovakia. His ANO movement secured 35% of the vote, significantly ahead of Prime Minister Petr Fiala's pro-Western coalition, which garnered 23%. This victory could lead to a government less aligned with the European Union's mainstream foreign policy. Babiš's potential partners include the anti-migrant Freedom and Direct Democracy party and the right-wing Motorists, suggesting a possible majority government with a more nationalistic and pro-Russian leaning.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering minting a commemorative $1 coin for the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026, potentially featuring President Donald Trump. A draft design, shared by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, depicts Trump with a clenched fist and the words "Fight, Fight, Fight," referencing his reaction after a 2024 assassination attempt. While a Treasury spokesperson confirmed the draft reflects the country's spirit, legal precedents generally prohibit living individuals on U.S. currency, though Congress could grant an exception. The article notes Trump's plummeting approval ratings and public perception of his economic policies, which have reportedly led to increased consumer prices and cuts to healthcare protections.</p>

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries clarified that federal law prohibits undocumented immigrants from accessing Medicare, Medicaid, or ACA subsidies, and Democrats are not seeking to change this. Instead, Democrats aim to reverse cuts to Medicaid and allow lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, to enroll in federal health programs. Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson, have framed the debate around illegal immigration, a strategy Democrats argue is misinformation to avoid discussing healthcare provisions.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza are experiencing a mix of hope and profound fear following Hamas's conditional agreement to President Trump's peace plan. Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod is among the remaining hostages, described waking with both hope and the fear that something could still go wrong in the delicate situation. The plan, which includes the release of all living and deceased hostages, has been met with calls for immediate action from families, who emphasize the need for a lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. Despite previous failed opportunities, this moment is viewed as a crucial stage, potentially bringing their loved ones home and concluding the devastating conflict.</p>

          <p>Veteran left-handed pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' National League Division Series (NLDS) roster, marking his return to postseason play after being left off the wild-card round roster. Kershaw, who went 11-2 with a 3.36 ERA this season, is expected to pitch out of the bullpen, providing much-needed left-handed depth and veteran presence against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Dodgers made only two roster changes, also adding Anthony Banda, while maintaining their 15-man position player group, including Will Smith who is recovering from a fractured hand. This inclusion could be Kershaw's final career postseason series if the Dodgers don't advance.</p>

          <p>Great Western Railway (GWR) has been fined £1 million for health and safety breaches after a 28-year-old passenger, Bethan Roper, died in 2018 when her head struck a tree branch after leaning out of a droplight window. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) prosecuted GWR, stating the company was aware of the risks associated with these windows and failed to implement recommended safety measures from a risk assessment conducted two months prior. The incident echoed a similar death in 2016. Since Roper's death, the rail industry has introduced measures, including withdrawing trains with such windows or fitting controls to prevent them from opening while moving.</p>

Images obtained by the Minnesota Star Tribune showed Salisbury discussing the deployment via Signal with other high-ranking federal officials, including a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The messages indicated Hegseth sought direct authorization from Trump due to concerns about public backlash from using the Army's top-tier quick reaction force domestically.

          <p>Israel has deported over 130 activists to Turkey who were detained after their aid flotilla, the Global Sumud Flotilla, was intercepted en route to Gaza. The flotilla, which included politicians and activists like Greta Thunberg, aimed to break Israel's 18-year maritime blockade and deliver food to Palestinians. World leaders condemned Israel's interception in international waters, with Turkey calling it a breach of international law. Israel's foreign ministry labeled the activists "provocateurs" and accused some of obstructing deportation, while flotilla members denied Israeli claims of Hamas links.

          <p>The global rise of digital money, including cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, poses significant regulatory challenges, with concerns about user tracking, financial stability, and the potential for increased unemployment-inducing crashes. Major financial centers, like London, are developing laws to govern this shift away from cash. While the Bank of England seeks to facilitate competing stablecoins with robust regulation, it appears to be moving away from a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The U.S., under President Trump, is pursuing an extreme private digital money model, banning Federal Reserve participation, which critics warn could lead to a "wild west" scenario with systemic risks, given the interconnectedness of global finance.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is being considered for a leading role on a "Board of Peace" to govern Gaza post-ceasefire, as outlined in President Trump's peace plan. This potential appointment has drawn significant criticism, particularly from Palestinians and human rights advocates, who cite Blair's controversial involvement in the 2003 Iraq War and his perceived pro-Israel stance during his previous eight-year tenure as Middle East envoy. Critics argue his past actions make him an unsuitable figure for fostering peace and self-governance in the region. Blair, however, has described Trump's plan as "bold and intelligent," offering the best chance to end the war.</p>

This evidence includes statements from Trump administration officials, notably Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the timing of the charges.

Published in *Explosion and Shock Waves*, the research found that multiple rapid detonations create significantly larger craters and cause more destruction than a single strike. Scientists believe the data can help design more resilient bunkers against advanced weaponry like U.S. and Russian earth-penetrating warheads. The experiment involved using pressurized gas to pierce glass spheres in quartz sand within a vacuum chamber, validating results against the 1965 U.S. Palanquin test.
