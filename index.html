            <p>During Holy Week, a group of LGBTQ+ Christian leaders gathered near the U.S. Capitol to protest President Trump's "anti-LGBTQ+ legislation," claiming the administration is hostile to both the LGBTQ+ community and faith leaders. They cited Trump's executive order establishing only two sexes and a lawsuit against Maine for allowing transgender women in women's sports as examples of attacks on transgender people. Attendees emphasized the importance of faith leaders uniting to counter the administration's policies, while Trump's White House Faith Office announced a Holy Week schedule to celebrate Easter. This event highlights the ongoing tensions between LGBTQ+ advocacy groups and the Trump administration regarding LGBTQ+ rights and religious freedom.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that the escalating trade war between the US and China may present China with an opportunity to enhance its relationships with European nations and Asian neighbors. Beijing has already begun initiatives to foster alternative trade agreements and partnerships, aiming to improve its international image. As tensions rise between China and the US, other countries may find common ground, potentially leading to closer ties between Europe and China, as well as within Asia. This shift could reshape global trade dynamics and alliances.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador, despite court rulings against the deportation. Van Hollen conveyed a message of love from Abrego Garcia to his wife. El Salvador's President Bukele mocked speculation about Abrego Garcia's death in custody, stating he would remain in El Salvador's custody. The White House criticized the visit, accusing Democrats of siding with an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist. Abrego Garcia's lawyers deny any gang affiliation and are suing the US government for the erroneous deportation.</p>

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 10:47:12 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>New tariffs, particularly those on vehicles and imported parts, are causing Americans to reassess car purchasing plans and impacting repair costs, potentially leading to higher auto insurance rates. While President Trump considered a temporary pause on tariffs for imported cars, tariffs on steel, aluminum, and goods from Canada and Mexico are already affecting parts prices. This increase in repair costs will likely push insurance premiums higher as insurers spread these costs across policyholders. Experts advise consumers to shop around for the best insurance rates and practice safe driving to mitigate potential increases. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Researchers have identified a "diploma divide" in politics, separating those with and without a four-year college degree, but focusing solely on education risks overlooking class grievances. The Democratic party's emphasis on college education as a path to social mobility has alienated working-class voters. This has led to a neglect of economic interests and a failure to challenge the hyper-global economy. To regain power, progressives must address class grievances directly.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly using claims of uncertainty to evade court orders, particularly in immigration cases, without appearing to defy them outright. This strategy involves twisting the interpretation of court orders and misrepresenting them publicly. Judges have opened investigations into whether officials deliberately flouted their decrees, signaling a growing effort to hold the White House accountable. The administration's actions have drawn criticism for undermining the legal system and due process.</p>

            <p>Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is facing scrutiny over her Hope Florida Foundation's failure to file required tax documents and a questionable $10 million donation. The scandal has angered Republican legislators and may impact her potential candidacy for governor in 2026. The controversy stems from a $67 million overbilling settlement, with funds allegedly directed to the charity and then to political committees supporting her husband's agenda. The situation highlights the increasing tensions between the governor and state politicians.</p>

            <p>China has established the world's first satellite constellation in Earth-moon space, forming a communication and navigation network stretching from low Earth orbit to distant retrograde orbit. The constellation, comprised of three satellites, achieved a record-setting 1.17 million km space-to-space communication link. This network can track each other instead of relying on ground stations, which shows a network could stay connected reliably across the vast distance between Earth and the moon. The technology could serve as a staging point for future missions to the moon and beyond.</p>

            <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old man at the center of a Maryland deportation case, was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador mega-prison by the Trump administration. Despite a judge demanding his return and the Supreme Court partially backing the order, Trump officials have pushed back. Ábrego García had been granted protection from deportation in 2019 due to the risk of persecution in El Salvador. The case raises questions about due process and the government's handling of immigration matters.</p>

            <p>Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' is a horror film about vampires that starts as a period drama set in the Jim Crow-era South and slowly transforms into a fright-fest. Michael B. Jordan plays identical twin brothers who buy a mill and turn it into a saloon. The movie's biggest, strangest scene is dedicated to selling the idea that Delta-blues music is so raw and generationally powerful that even vampires want to listen to it. By the time the movie flips the switch to unveil itself as a Southern Gothic, the audience has become invested in the journeys of its characters.</p>
