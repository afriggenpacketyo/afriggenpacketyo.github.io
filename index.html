The protests were sparked by ICE raids in Huntington Park and other locations, leading to over 300 detentions. Flores criticized the militarization of immigration enforcement and the deployment of Marines on U.S. soil, calling it an alarming escalation that undermines democracy.</p>

Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson described the events as "racist thuggery targeted at ethnic minorities and police officers". There have been additional incidents in Carrickfergus, north Belfast, and Newtownabbey, with police treating these as racially-motivated hate crimes, leading to increased security measures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's deployment of the military against protesters in Los Angeles and disregard for federal court orders have prompted concerns about democratic institutions. Trump invoked the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces without the governor's consent, a move criticized by Governor Newsom. Trump has also bypassed Congress, issuing numerous executive orders, and has authorized deportations despite court orders blocking them. Critics argue that Trump is eroding the balance of power among the three branches of government.</p>
