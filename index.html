          <p>A 47-year-old Chinese businesswoman, Qian Zhimin, has pleaded guilty in a London court to charges related to a massive bitcoin fraud scheme. She admitted to possessing and transferring criminal property from a large-scale fraud orchestrated in China between 2014 and 2017, which victimized over 128,000 people. After defrauding her victims, Qian fled China with false documents and attempted to launder the illicit funds, now valued at approximately $7.4 billion, by purchasing property in the UK. The case involves what is believed to be the world's single largest seizure of cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a detailed plan aimed at resolving the war in Gaza, which President Trump described as an "extremely fair" proposal. The plan requires a gradual disarmament of Hamas and a phased withdrawal of the IDF, which would retain control over key corridors and buffer zones. It also outlines a role for a reformed Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza and keeps the possibility of future negotiations for Palestinian statehood open. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his support for the plan, calling it a critical step toward ending the conflict and securing the release of hostages.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan's Taliban authorities have mandated a complete, indefinite shutdown of the nation's fiber optic internet, a move expected to cause a total communications blackout. The government cited the need to combat "immorality" and "vice" as the reason for severing connectivity, which began weeks ago in several provinces. According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the shutdown will also cripple mobile and fixed-line telephone services, as they largely rely on the fiber optic network. This drastic measure is anticipated to have severe consequences for the country's economy, banking sector, and government administration.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 15:15:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist argues that the most effective method for managing stress is not inward-focused self-care but channeling stress energy outward to help others. Research indicates that stress is a social experience, releasing oxytocin which motivates connection, making solitary coping methods often ineffective. The article suggests a technique called "stress springboarding," where individuals use their stress as fuel for meaningful actions that benefit colleagues, friends, or the community. Brain imaging studies support this, showing that helping others activates reward centers and reduces activity in stress-related brain regions, offering both personal and professional benefits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Charlie Javice, the 33-year-old founder of the fintech startup Frank, has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. The bank acquired her company for $175 million in 2021 based on claims that Frank had over 5 million student customers. However, it was later discovered that the firm had fewer than 300,000 real users, with the rest being fabricated data. Prosecutors argued that Javice's crime was fueled by greed, stating that JPMorgan acquired a "crime scene" rather than a functioning business in an embarrassing episode for the financial giant.</p>

Originally the music of shepherds and mineworkers, Famo has evolved to include lyrical battles between musicians that escalate into real-world violence and turf wars, similar to historic hip-hop rivalries. The situation has become so severe that the government has labeled some Famo gangs as terrorist groups and launched a crackdown.

          <p>The German NGO Sea-Watch reported that one migrant drowned and three others were rescued after their dinghy capsized while being pursued by the Libyan coast guard. The incident occurred when a Libyan patrol boat intercepted the dinghy, which was carrying about 30 people, and attempted to force it back to Libya. As the dinghy tried to flee in high waves, four people fell overboard. Sea-Watch, which filmed the event from an aircraft, stated that such incidents are common but rarely documented. The organization criticized Italy's policy of requiring cooperation with the Libyan coast guard, arguing it violates international law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a $625 million investment aimed at revitalizing the U.S. coal industry, alongside opening 13.1 million acres of public land to coal mining. The funding includes $350 million to modernize existing coal plants and $175 million for coal projects in rural communities. This initiative comes despite the rapid decline of coal as an energy source, which has been largely displaced by cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. Critics argue the move is a colossal waste of taxpayer money and props up the oldest and most polluting energy source amid growing demand for cleaner alternatives.</p>

          <p>In a three-way phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret to Qatar's leader for a recent Israeli attack in Doha. According to a White House statement, Netanyahu also apologized for violating Qatari sovereignty and gave assurances that such an attack would not happen again. The call was part of broader discussions about a proposal to end the war in Gaza and improve regional stability. The conversation took place just before a press conference where Trump and Netanyahu were set to discuss the Gaza peace plan in more detail.</p>

          <p>While often associated with those already in retirement, purchasing an annuity at age 55 is both possible and potentially advantageous for long-term financial planning. At this age, individuals can opt for a deferred annuity, allowing the investment to grow tax-deferred for years before they need the income stream. This longer time horizon can lead to more favorable terms from insurers. However, the article cautions that annuities are illiquid investments with surrender periods, so buyers must be confident they won't need the funds for unexpected expenses before the penalty-free withdrawal period begins.

          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low, with the average 30-year rate now at 6.30%, significantly down from over 7% at the start of the year. This creates a more affordable climate for potential homebuyers who have been waiting for better conditions. However, the market remains volatile, and these low rates are not guaranteed to last, as factors like inflation and Treasury yields could cause them to rise again. With the Federal Reserve likely to cut rates again at the end of October, prospective buyers should weigh the benefits of acting now against the challenges of a less active fall housing market.

          <p>President Trump has once again proposed a 100% tariff on all movies made outside the United States, arguing the measure would combat "runaway production" and bring the film industry back to America. The threat, posted on his Truth Social platform, was met with skepticism from Hollywood and criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom. Many industry experts and lawmakers advocate for a federal film tax incentive as a more effective solution to compete with generous credits offered by countries like Canada and the U.K. A tariff could raise costs for consumers and have unintended negative consequences for the industry.</p>

          <p>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is sinking deeper into debt, now exceeding $22.5 billion, as climate change increases the frequency and cost of devastating floods across the U.S. The federally-backed program is caught between its mandates to provide affordable coverage and the fiscal reality of rising risks, creating a moral hazard that encourages development in flood-prone areas. With outdated flood maps and subsidized rates that mask true risk, the system is considered unsustainable. Experts argue that a difficult political reckoning is needed to reform the program and address the growing threat of flooding.</p>

As a result, seniors may see higher premiums and deductibles for 2026 plans.
