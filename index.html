          <p>The AI industrial trade is rebounding after market volatility, with GE Vernova leading the pack. While other data center-linked stocks like Eaton and Vertiv have also rallied, they haven't reached pre-DeepSeek levels like GE Vernova. GE Vernova's strong performance is attributed to its earlier stage in the revenue upcycle and a larger backlog of customer orders. Recent deals and support for the nuclear power industry have further boosted GE Vernova's stock, leading to a rating downgrade to hold due to its rapid rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to £1,000, and may have debts written off due to the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are allocating over £70 million in compensation and support following a review by Ofgem, which found suppliers did not meet required standards when switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. Customers will receive payments based on how they were treated, and a new code of practice is now in place to prevent future inappropriate installations. Enforcement investigations are ongoing for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo, representing tens of thousands more customers.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns regarding the government's proposals to release some prisoners early to ease prison overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued the plans could negatively impact public safety, citing concerns about electronic tagging costs and repeat offenders avoiding jail time. Metropolitan Police head Sir Mark Rowley acknowledged the government's problem but noted the proposed solutions would create extra work for the police. The government maintains that the announced proposals address many of the concerns, with repeat offenders still facing short sentences and terrorists not eligible for early release.</p>

He emphasized the need to manufacture attack drones, interceptors, cruise missiles, and ballistic systems domestically, as Russia and Ukraine engage in an arms race.

          <p>Vanguard's research indicates that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is a top predictor of financial well-being. The survey found that people with this level of savings reported greater financial improvement than those with higher incomes or assets. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa emphasized the importance of being prepared for unexpected expenses, as the median emergency cost is around $2,000. Having readily available cash provides confidence and reduces financial anxiety. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted, shooting lava fountains over 1,000 feet into the air during a six-hour event, marking the 23rd episode in a series of eruptions since December 2024. The eruption occurred within a closed area of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, posing no immediate threat to nearby communities. However, officials warn of potential hazards like sulfur dioxide emissions, volcanic smog, and dangerous strands of volcanic glass called "Pele's hair." Scientists anticipate another eruption soon, following the volcano's pattern of erupting about once per week.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The idea that everyone needs extreme amounts of protein to build muscle is a myth, according to experts. It's not necessary to consume one gram of protein per pound of body weight, and focusing too much on protein can lead to overconsumption of animal products. For gaining muscle, the benefits of eating more protein top out at around 0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day, with weightlifters recommended to aim for between 0.54 and 0.73 grams. Plant-based protein is just as effective as animal protein for muscle gain, and a focus on whole plant foods is beneficial for overall health.</p>

In the US and many other countries, young people between 18 and 29 do not appear to be flourishing, with flourishing increasing with age. Factors contributing to this trend may include a lack of engagement in group activities, societal emphasis on individualism, and the negative impacts of social media.

          <p>Target's sales have cratered, at least in part because consumers were angry about its reversals. The company's management has been a little vague about the impact of all this. At a May 21 conference call with Wall Street analysts following its release of earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, Cornell alluded to the backlash without going into detail. Cornell attributed the company’s ugly performance — comparable-store sales down by 5.7% from a year earlier — to several factors, including “the reaction to the updates we shared ... in January.” That was an obvious allusion to the dropping of DEI initiatives.</p>

          <p>Bath flanker Sam Underhill has been banned for four weeks due to a dangerous tackle during the club's European Challenge Cup final victory against Lyon. Underhill received a yellow card for the head-on-head collision, and an independent panel upheld the complaint that it warranted a red card. He will miss Bath's upcoming matches, including their Premiership semi-final, and potentially England's summer matches if selected.</p>
