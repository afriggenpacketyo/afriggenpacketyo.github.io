          <p>Paul Doyle, a former Royal Marine, appeared in Liverpool Magistrates' Court facing multiple charges, including wounding with intent and dangerous driving, after allegedly driving his car into a crowd following Liverpool FC's trophy parade. The incident injured 79 people, with footage showing a pram being struck but the child unharmed. A fundraising campaign for the injured has raised over £30,000, including a donation from Jamie Carragher's charity. Doyle, who was emotional during the hearing, did not enter a plea and will appear at Liverpool Crown Court for a further hearing.</p>

          <p>OpenAI, initially founded as a nonprofit research lab committed to safe AI development, is navigating a complex transition to a for-profit structure to attract investors and fund its ambitious AI projects. This shift has sparked concerns from co-founder Elon Musk, state attorneys general, and AI experts, who fear it could compromise the company's commitment to responsible AI development. Despite resistance, OpenAI is proceeding with its plans, emphasizing that a nonprofit arm will remain in charge, although Microsoft has yet to agree to the new structure. Critics worry about the lack of effective oversight and the potential for prioritizing profits over safety in the development of powerful AI technologies.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating in Angola's Cabinda exclave due to intensifying clashes between the government and separatist groups, with both sides accusing each other of human rights abuses. The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC) alleges that the Angolan army is retaliating against civilians after separatist attacks, a claim the government denies. Cabinda, rich in oil resources, has sought independence from Angola for about 50 years, citing its distinct cultural and historical identity, and its integration into Angola without local consent. Despite producing 60% of Angola's oil, Cabinda suffers from poor living conditions and environmental damage.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has emerged as the frontrunner to sign striker Liam Delap from Ipswich, after their relegation triggered a £30 million release clause, due to Champions League football, Cole Palmer, and the Premier League's youngest squad. Manchester United, Everton, Nottingham Forest, and Newcastle also expressed interest, but Chelsea's Champions League qualification proved decisive. Delap was granted permission to speak with interested clubs and was spotted at Stansted Airport before undergoing a medical examination. Chelsea's co-owner Behdad Eghbali met with Delap's agent, and head coach Enzo Maresca directly pitched to the player.</p>

          <p>India's economy exhibited robust growth, expanding at an annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts amidst global economic uncertainties. This growth marks the strongest quarterly performance in the fiscal year 2025, with the overall economy expanding by 6.5% for the full fiscal year. Strong domestic consumption and lower dependence on exports have helped to cushion the impact of trade policies. The White House has been resorting to protectionist trade policies to address trade imbalances, and India ran a nearly $46 billion surplus with the U.S. in 2024.</p>

West Java Governor Dedi Mulyadi stated that the mine was operating illegally and ordered the permanent closure of the pit, as similar incidents are common in Indonesia due to ignored safety protocols. Mining accidents are frequent in Indonesia, with a similar incident occurring at the same mine in February, although no casualties were reported at that time.</p>

This initiative hopes to spark greater interest in automotive careers by providing easier access to motor sports for children, with the goal of inspiring future drivers, engineers, and mechanics.

Her campaign's fundraising email has also drawn criticism for controversial comments connecting slavery to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Polling indicates that Earle-Sears is trailing her Democratic opponent, Abigail Spanberger, by nearly seven points, and the race often swings in the opposite direction of the presidency.</p>

          <p>New research has detected Pfas, known as "forever chemicals," in nearly all of 23 sampled beers, raising safety questions about the popular beverage. The study, which examined craft beer, major domestic brands, and international labels, found Pfas levels as high as 40 parts per trillion, often exceeding drinking water limits. The researchers found a strong correlation between Pfas levels in beer and the local water supply, suggesting contaminated water is a primary source of the problem. The authors suggest that brewers interested in reducing Pfas levels should install granular activated carbon or reverse osmosis filtration systems, and beer drinkers can protect themselves by checking for Pfas levels in the areas in which beer is bottled.</p>

Negotiations are ongoing, and the details of how tariff costs will be divided are not yet finalized as both sides navigate a challenging time for the industry.

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe, now believes that the standard model of cosmology may be incorrect. Riess's measurements of the universe's expansion rate differ from those produced by looking at the afterglow of the Big Bang, creating what cosmologists call the Hubble tension. Riess suggests that this discrepancy could indicate a flaw in the standard model, leading to a potential upheaval in the field of cosmology. The debate over the Hubble tension has caused tension among cosmologists, with some expecting the problem to disappear with more data and others considering a revision of the standard model.</p>

          <p>Three massive wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearing containment after burning for weeks, leading to the lifting of all evacuations on Memorial Day. Firefighters have made significant progress since the fires broke out around May 12, although air quality alerts remain in effect in the Arrowhead region due to smoke. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was human-caused, while the Camp House Road Fire has destroyed over 150 structures, and the Munger Shaw Fire is nearly 100% contained. The Horse River Fire, located in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, is being fueled by thick duff and dead balsam fir trees, complicating containment efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Pittsburgh to celebrate a partnership between United States Steel and the Japanese company Nippon Steel, despite previously blocking the sale on national security grounds. After ordering a national security review of the proposed plan, Trump announced his support, stating it would add $14 billion to the U.S. economy and create at least 70,000 jobs. Details of the deal have not been announced, but experts believe it is an acquisition rather than a partnership.

Trump has expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has considered imposing new sanctions on Russia. While the administration has not dramatically changed its approach, key elements of support, such as weapons shipments and intelligence sharing, have continued. The US and Ukraine have also reached a minerals deal, and direct negotiations with Russia are ongoing, which have proven less disastrous for Ukraine than initially feared.</p>
