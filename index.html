          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, is forecast to move up the U.S. East Coast without making landfall, though it will generate life-threatening surf and rip currents. As a Category 3 storm with 120 mph winds, its effects will be felt from Florida to New England throughout the week. While the storm's center will remain offshore, between Bermuda and the U.S., coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are under warnings for potential flooding, prompting some mandatory evacuations. Officials are urging the public to avoid entering the ocean due to the hazardous conditions expected to persist for several days.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled images of a new crewed tilt-rotor aircraft, marking a significant step in its aviation technology and drawing comparisons to the U.S. V-22 Osprey. The prototype was photographed hovering in helicopter mode, showcasing its vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, which are combined with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane. This development represents China's first manned aircraft of this type, though details about its specific capabilities and operational status remain limited. The design's complexity, a known challenge for tilt-rotor technology, raises questions about its maintenance costs and safety profile as it progresses.</p>

          <p>An academic in Gaza provides a harrowing first-person account of the severe famine gripping the region, detailing the physical and mental toll of starvation. The author describes the constant struggle to think, work, and maintain a sense of identity while facing extreme hunger and dehydration due to Israel's blockade, which has emptied markets and shuttered bakeries. The piece highlights the collapse of the local economy, where accessing cash is nearly impossible and basic survival depends on overpriced nutrient pastes. Despite the dire conditions, the author emphasizes that continuing academic work is an act of resistance against erasure, calling for genuine international solidarity that addresses the systemic causes of the crisis.</p>

          <p>Exam results day presents unique challenges for neurodivergent students, who may experience heightened anxiety and stress due to conditions like autism, ADHD, or OCD. This article shares personal stories and expert advice on how to manage the emotional difficulties of this period. Key recommendations for parents and carers include planning for various outcomes, using clear language for reassurance, and considering alternative ways to receive results to avoid overwhelming environments. Students who have been through the experience emphasize the importance of self-compassion, focusing on personal progress rather than comparing with others, and remembering that exam grades do not define their worth or future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Open has reimagined its mixed doubles tournament, creating a polarizing new format designed to attract top singles stars with significant prize money and a primetime schedule. The event now features superstars like Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, and Novak Djokovic, a move praised by some for increasing fan interest and promoting the sport. However, the changes have drawn sharp criticism from doubles specialists, such as Jamie Murray, who argue it devalues the Grand Slam title and redirects lucrative earnings away from career doubles players. The debate centers on whether the new format is a valuable innovation for tennis or a glorified exhibition that undermines the event's competitive integrity.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group has announced a strategic $2 billion investment in Intel, acquiring a stake of approximately 2% in the U.S. chipmaker. This news comes as the Trump administration is reportedly considering converting some of Intel's CHIPS Act grants into a government equity stake of up to 10%, which would make the U.S. government its largest shareholder. These developments aim to bolster Intel's position in the global semiconductor market and support its domestic manufacturing expansion, particularly its new hub in Ohio. The dual investments reflect a concerted effort to revitalize a key American technology company for both economic and national security reasons. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized artificial intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were transported to Australia during the 19th century. By combining detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and in some cases photos of modern descendants, a team of volunteers has brought the potential appearances of these individuals to life. The project sheds light on the harsh justice system of the era, where people were deported for crimes as minor as stealing a handkerchief. This initiative also highlights a cultural shift in Australia, where having convict ancestry has transformed from a source of shame into a point of historical interest and pride for many.</p>

          <p>A woman who was sexually assaulted by a fellow passenger on a Qatar Airways flight to the UK is fighting for compensation after her claim was rejected due to a legal technicality. Although her attacker was successfully prosecuted and jailed in the UK, her application to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was denied because the crime occurred on a foreign-registered aircraft. Current laws allow for prosecution of such crimes but do not extend eligibility for victim compensation. Her lawyers are now calling on the Justice Secretary to close this gap in the law, arguing it is an irrational inconsistency that denies justice to victims of violent crimes on international flights bound for the UK.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered that tiny freshwater flatworms, known as planaria, could serve as a viable alternative to rodents in the development of treatments for mental health disorders like schizophrenia. A study at the University of Reading found that the worms react to the antipsychotic drug haloperidol in a manner similar to mice and rats, showing significantly reduced activity. Given the worms' unique regenerative abilities, including regrowing their brains, they offer a powerful and more ethical model for neurological research. This finding could help reduce the number of mice and rats used in scientific testing annually while still advancing the development of critical psychiatric medications.</p>

          <p>While the United States is experiencing a record collapse of its commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has grown to a historic high, solidifying its status as the world's top honey producer. Researchers attribute this stark difference to management practices. The U.S. model relies on large-scale, clustered apiaries that are transported to single-crop locations, which can increase stress and disease transmission among bees. In contrast, Chinese beekeeping often involves smaller, more diversified operations with greater intervention and care from beekeepers, leading to healthier and more resilient colonies. This highlights how different agricultural approaches can profoundly impact pollinator health.</p>

The article asserts that this double standard reveals how Palestinian lives are devalued and their suffering is depoliticized.

While the location is yet to be decided, this development marks a significant potential step in diplomatic efforts to end the war. Merz also stressed that any peace deal should not force Ukraine to cede territory, a key concern for European leaders involved in the negotiations.</p>

          <h2>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey Appointed as FBI Co-Deputy Director</h2>

          <p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has been appointed to serve as the FBI's co-deputy director, sharing the role with current second-in-command Dan Bongino. Bailey, who will resign from his state position in September, accepted the role offered by President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi, vowing to uphold the Constitution. The appointment continues a trend in the Trump administration of placing political loyalists without prior FBI experience in the bureau's senior leadership. Bailey is known for his conservative legal battles, including defending Missouri's restrictions on abortion and gender-affirming care, and for an unsuccessful attempt to have the Supreme Court intervene in Trump's New York criminal case.</p>

          <h2>India Has the Highest Number of Abandoned Seafarers Globally</h2>

          <p>Despite being a major supplier of maritime labor, India leads the world in the number of its sailors abandoned on vessels by shipowners. In 2024, nearly 900 of the 3,133 known abandoned seafarers were Indian nationals, often left stranded without pay, provisions, or a way home. The issue is largely attributed to the practice of registering ships under "flags of convenience" in countries with lax regulations, which obscures true ownership and allows unscrupulous owners to evade responsibility. For many crew members, leaving the ship is not an option as it means forfeiting months of unpaid wages, trapping them in a difficult and often dangerous situation.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Suggest Trump's Diplomatic Moves May Grant Putin More Time</h2>

          <p>Following a contentious meeting in Alaska, President Trump's diplomatic efforts with European leaders regarding Ukraine are being analyzed as a potential strategic benefit for Vladimir Putin. The push for a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, without a preceding ceasefire, is seen by some experts as a way to delay substantive action while fighting continues. This approach allows Russia to maintain its military pressure and potentially solidify its gains on the ground while engaging in prolonged, low-stakes negotiations. The analysis suggests that while Trump may have been steered away from an immediate land-for-peace deal by European allies, the current path of continued talks still serves Putin's interest in buying more time.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump and several European leaders at the White House to discuss a path toward ending the war in Ukraine. A key development was Trump's suggestion that he is arranging a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, to be followed by a trilateral summit. Trump also hinted at U.S. involvement in security guarantees for Ukraine, a critical component of any potential peace deal. The meeting was noted for its improved tone compared to a previous encounter, with Zelenskyy employing a more diplomatic approach to secure continued support from his Western allies.</p>
