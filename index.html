          <p>A helicopter crash on the Mississippi River near East Alton, Illinois, resulted in the deaths of two individuals. The aircraft reportedly struck a powerline before crashing into a barge, which was unoccupied at the time of the incident. In response to the crash, authorities closed a nearby bridge and shut down the river to commercial navigation. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the fatal accident.</p>

Huckabee also commented on the complete breakdown of ceasefire negotiations, attributing the failure to Hamas's lack of seriousness.

          <p>Restaurant Brands International announced mixed second-quarter financial results, with adjusted earnings per share falling short of analyst expectations while revenue surpassed them. The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and growth at Tim Hortons, which saw a 3.4% increase in same-store sales. However, Popeyes experienced a 1.4% decline in same-store sales, lagging behind its sister brands Burger King and Tim Hortons, amid increased competition in the chicken market. The company reiterated its full-year forecast, maintaining its long-term growth targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California Federation of Labor Unions has endorsed a proposed ballot measure that would allow for the temporary redrawing of the state's congressional district maps. This strategic move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, is intended to counteract potential Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas ahead of the next midterm elections. If passed, the measure would allow state lawmakers to help shape districts for the next three election cycles, with the process returning to an independent commission after the 2030 census. Proponents of the independent commission have pledged to vigorously defend the current system.</p>

          <p>Peloton reported an unexpected profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, driven by cost-cutting measures and better-than-expected sales. Despite the positive earnings, the connected fitness company announced a new restructuring plan that includes laying off 6% of its staff to reduce expenses by an additional $100 million. New CEO Peter Stern outlined a strategy focused on returning to growth through micro-stores, expanding the preowned market, and diversifying beyond its core bike and treadmill products.

The current truce is set to expire soon, and an extension would provide more time for negotiators to work towards a longer-term agreement.

          <p>A recent survey by the American Association of Individual Investors shows a significant spike in bearish sentiment, with 43.2% of investors now holding a negative outlook on the stock market for the next six months. This 10.2 percentage point increase in pessimism is the largest since the market's peak in February. Some market strategists view this widespread uneasiness as a contrarian indicator, suggesting that with so many investors already having sold stocks, there is more cash on the sidelines available to fuel a potential market rally.

          <p>A new wave of U.S. tariffs implemented by the Trump administration has sent more than 60 countries scrambling to respond to the economic consequences. The "reciprocal" tariffs, with rates ranging from 10% to over 40%, have upended global trade dynamics, prompting warnings of job losses and economic strain from industry groups worldwide. Governments in affected nations like Brazil and Switzerland are planning state aid and seeking further negotiations, while others are bracing for significant impacts on their export-oriented industries.

          <p>The president of the United Arab Emirates met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a deepening of the strategic partnership between the two nations. The leaders pledged to double their bilateral trade, which has already surged since the start of the war in Ukraine, reaching $11.5 billion. The UAE, a key U.S. ally, has maintained a neutral stance on the war and has not participated in Western sanctions, becoming an important economic partner for Russia. This growing relationship tests the limits of U.S. influence and highlights the UAE's diversified foreign policy.</p>

The banned works include those by acclaimed author Arundhati Roy and various academics.

The ban was enacted on the sixth anniversary of New Delhi stripping the region of its semi-autonomous status and imposing direct rule.</p>

          <p>Shares of Eli Lilly dropped significantly after the company released late-stage trial data for its daily obesity pill, orforglipron. While the drug helped patients lose nearly 12% of their body weight and met its primary goals, the results fell short of the higher expectations of some Wall Street analysts, who had hoped for a figure closer to 15%. Despite the market's disappointment, the pill is still seen as a promising needle-free alternative in the booming weight-loss drug market. Eli Lilly plans to submit the data to regulators by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has surged to become the front-runner to be the next Fed chair, according to prediction market Kalshi, with his probability crossing 50%. This spike followed reports that President Trump's advisors favor Waller's openness to adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts rather than just current data. Waller, a Trump nominee to the Fed board, recently dissented on the decision to hold rates steady, arguing the approach was overly cautious. He has overtaken previous favorites Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett in the speculative market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical analysis comparing President Trump's recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner to President Richard Nixon's actions in 1971. While Nixon was infuriated by BLS jobs numbers and targeted officials he believed were disloyal, he never directly fired the commissioner, instead working through indirect pressure and reassignments. The author argues that Trump's direct dismissal of the commissioner for producing numbers he disliked represents a more brazen and unprecedented abuse of presidential authority, demonstrating fewer constraints than even the Nixon administration faced.</p>
