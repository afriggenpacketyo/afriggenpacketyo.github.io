          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is ending its session early for the August recess, a move that prevents votes on motions concerning the Jeffrey Epstein case. House Speaker Mike Johnson characterized the Democratic-led efforts to force votes on releasing Justice Department files as "political games," asserting the administration is already addressing the matter. This decision effectively shelves the controversial issue until Congress reconvenes, sidestepping a potentially divisive vote for Republican members.</p>

          <p>The UK High Court has ruled that the estate of deceased tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his former business partner owe Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. The ruling stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's firm, Autonomy, with the court finding that the company's finances were misrepresented during the sale. The judgment was delayed following the tragic death of Lynch and his daughter in a yachting accident last year, an event for which the judge expressed his deepest condolences.</p>

          <p>The head of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City has reported that 21 children have died from malnutrition and starvation across the territory in just 72 hours. This comes amid warnings from the UN that lifelines are collapsing and reports that Israeli forces have killed over 1,000 Palestinians seeking food aid since late May. Aid organizations state that the amount of food allowed into Gaza is vastly insufficient, leading to severe shortages and a growing death toll from hunger.</p>

Maxwell's lawyer confirmed discussions are underway, stating she will testify truthfully, as the DOJ also seeks to unseal grand jury transcripts from both the Epstein and Maxwell cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the common misunderstanding of credit card grace periods, explaining they primarily apply to new purchases, not late payments. A grace period allows cardholders to avoid interest on new purchases if they pay their balance in full each month, but this benefit is often lost if a balance is carried over. While most issuers do not officially offer a grace period for late payments, some may provide an informal window before applying fees, but relying on this is risky and can damage credit scores.

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England, organized by the British Medical Association (BMA), is set to go ahead after negotiations with the government broke down. While talks focused on working conditions, the BMA stated that the core issue remains pay restoration, and the government's offers were insufficient to avert the strike. The action is expected to cause significant disruption, with NHS England directing hospitals to minimize cancellations of routine care, a move the BMA warns could stretch senior doctors thin and risk patient safety.</p>

          <p>Despite appearing to function normally, U.S. national parks are facing a severe crisis due to staffing cuts and hiring freezes under the Trump administration, according to a former Glacier National Park superintendent. While visitor-facing services like clean toilets are prioritized, the critical work of resource preservation, environmental monitoring, and trail maintenance is being abandoned. This "hollowing out" process threatens the long-term health of these natural treasures, as the expertise needed to manage invasive species and monitor wildlife is rapidly disappearing.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing for June reached £20.7 billion, significantly higher than expected and £6.6 billion more than the same month last year. The Office for National Statistics attributed the rise to increased public service spending and soaring debt interest payments, which have nearly doubled due to inflation. This figure, the second-highest for June on record, intensifies pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with analysts suggesting that tax hikes or spending cuts may now be necessary to meet fiscal targets.

          <p>Crystal Palace FC has formally appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against its demotion from the Europa League to the less prestigious Conference League. The punishment was issued by UEFA due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules, as owner John Textor also has a majority stake in Lyon, another Europa League qualifier. Palace argues that Textor does not have "decisive influence" over the club and is seeking annulment of the decision, which would see rival Nottingham Forest take their spot.</p>
