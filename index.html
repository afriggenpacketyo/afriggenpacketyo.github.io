          <p>The New York Knicks avoided elimination by defeating the Indiana Pacers 111-94 in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals. Jalen Brunson scored 32 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns added 24 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks. The Knicks are now attempting to become only the 14th team in NBA history to overturn a 3-1 series deficit. Indiana struggled offensively, recording their lowest-scoring game of the postseason, while Tyrese Haliburton was limited to eight points and six assists. Game 6 is scheduled for Saturday night in Indiana, with a potential Game 7 back at Madison Square Garden on Monday. The Knicks' victory marked their first home win in the conference finals. The team's ability to bounce back and secure a crucial win has injected a sense of hope and determination into their playoff journey.</p>

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined this year due to tariffs, tightened border policies, and other U.S. government policies. A report by the Global Business Travel Association indicates that positive sentiment fell from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025. Nearly 30% of business travel buyers anticipate their companies will reduce employee trips this year, while a third are considering changing policies regarding travel to or from the United States. Despite these concerns, global airfares have slightly decreased. The trade war's uncertainty could lead to delays in investment decisions and hiring (not investment advice).</p>

The competition came down to Sarv Dharavane, Sarvadnya Kadam, and Faizan, with all three finalists initially misspelling their words, adding late-round drama. The first National Spelling Bee began in 1925, and this year's event featured nine finalists out of 243 young spellers who qualified through local and regional bees.

His wife, Jo Roop, kept his head above water while waiting for rescuers, and a sled dog tourism company provided a helicopter to transport rescuers to the remote location. Seven men used inflatable airbags to lift the boulder off Morris, who drifted in and out of consciousness. He spent two nights in the hospital for observation but was otherwise unharmed, acknowledging his luck and his wife's quick thinking.

Kerik's career was marked by both significant achievements and later controversies, including pleading guilty to federal tax fraud and false statement charges in 2010.

          <p>A US Court of International Trade ruling challenged President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, leading to a legal battle over his economic policies. The court gave the White House 10 days to remove almost all tariffs, which it says have been imposed illegally. The White House appealed, and a federal appeals court has stayed the trade court's ruling, which means that those tariffs will stay in place - for now. The administration argued in its appeal that a ruling against Trump "would kneecap the president on the world stage, cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals, imperil the government's ability to respond to these and future national emergencies". The situation has created uncertainty for businesses and global leaders, who are trying to anticipate Trump's next moves.</p>

Badenoch argues that the country cannot "afford their fantasy economics" and that Britain deserves leaders who do not "treat economics like a branch of showbiz".

          <p>President Trump announced that Elon Musk's official role in the administration is concluding, but hinted at continued collaboration. Musk's government service as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) ends on May 30, due to legal limits for his "special government employee" designation. DOGE has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts. Democrats in Congress have criticized Musk's influence, while markets have reacted positively to his return to the private sector. Musk reassured shareholders that he would allocate more time to Tesla and SpaceX, as the groundwork at DOGE is in place.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's time in the Trump administration is ending after 129 days, during which he led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's mission was to cut government spending, initially targeting $2 trillion, then $1 trillion, and ultimately $175 billion. This involved asset sales, lease cancellations, and workforce reductions. However, these efforts have caused controversy, with some federal judges halting mass firings. Musk's presence in the White House has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, considering his companies' business dealings with the government.

Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The restart of seafood exports from 37 prefectures to China is considered a significant milestone. The process may take a few months due to registration and radiation checks.</p>

          <p>A 43-year-old cancer patient, Natalie Phelps, reports that her life-saving treatment is being delayed due to cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Phelps, who has stage 4 colorectal cancer, is part of a cell-based immunotherapy trial at the NIH. Her treatment was delayed by a month due to staff reductions. Despite statements from the Department of Health and Human Services that no clinical trials have been cut, the doctor leading the trial confirmed that patients were experiencing delays due to staff cuts and purchasing slowdowns. Phelps' story has sparked debate in Congress and raised concerns about the impact of government cuts on healthcare.</p>

Students fear potential repercussions, such as exclusion orders, for saying the 'wrong' thing.

Harvard president Alan Garber received a standing ovation when he noted that graduates hail from "around the world, just as it should be."

          <p>China has unveiled the world’s first AI nuke inspector, a technology developed by researchers at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The project, built on a protocol proposed by Chinese and American scientists, aims to bolster Beijing’s stance in international disarmament talks. The development involved training and testing the AI using sensitive nuclear data, convincing Chinese military leaders that the system would not leak tech secrets, and persuading sceptical nations to abandon Cold War-era verification methods. So far, only the first step has been cleared, with specific data remaining undisclosed due to the classified nature of nuclear warheads.</p>

A city spokesperson said a code enforcement officer would inspect the device for noise ordinance compliance. The property management company said it is testing the device and that results seem positive. The inventor of the device says he wishes he didn’t have to resort to this tactic, but feels there has been little done to address the homeless crisis in Los Angeles County.</p>

          <p>Major USDA cuts are severely impacting food banks and school food programs in North Carolina. The Trump administration cut over $1 billion in annual funding to school districts and food banks nationwide, including $660 million to the Local Food for Schools program and $420 million to the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement. These cuts have forced local farms to lay off employees and reduced the amount of produce available to schools and food banks. Food bank presidents express concern over the increasing hunger crisis and the difficult choices families will have to make.

The judges ruled there would be a new trial after one of the judges stepped down due to criticism surrounding her participation in a documentary series about the case. The prosecutor alleged that the judge violated judicial ethics by allowing a camera crew to film her overseeing closed-door hearings. The decision threw into doubt the timeline of the trial, which was initially expected to last until July.
