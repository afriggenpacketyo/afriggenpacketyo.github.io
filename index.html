          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third significant heatwave of the year, with temperatures forecasted to peak above 30°C across large parts of the country. In response, health officials have issued amber heat alerts for southern England and the Midlands, while wildfire warnings are active in Scotland and Northern Ireland due to the prolonged dry conditions. The extreme weather has already impacted major events like the Wimbledon tennis tournament, leading to medical emergencies in the crowd, and has prompted National Rail to caution travelers about potential disruptions. The article notes that scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events to man-made climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor secured a victory over Amanda Serrano for the third time, concluding their historic trilogy with a majority decision win at Madison Square Garden. The bout, held during the first-ever all-female card at the iconic venue, was a tactical and gripping contest, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor and one scoring it a 95-95 draw. Unlike their more contentious previous encounters, this verdict was largely undisputed, as Taylor employed a smarter, more economical boxing style. Serrano acknowledged that her strategic shift to fight from a distance did not pay off against the 39-year-old undisputed light-welterweight champion.</p>

          <p>The owner of a luxury penthouse in Mayfair, London, has been engaged in an eight-year legal dispute with companies controlled by the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family. The conflict, centered at the 55 Park Lane apartment building, reportedly began over a lift installation agreement and has since escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the malicious use of a noisy lift at night. This protracted battle highlights the combative business practices associated with Al Fayed's empire, which appear to persist after his death. The article also references a prior BBC report on allegations against Fayed, where 13 women accused him of sexual assault, with four of those accusations involving sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' losing streak extended to seven games following an 8-7 loss to the San Francisco Giants, marking the team's longest skid since 2017. Despite a late-game offensive surge where they nearly erased a six-run deficit, the Dodgers' efforts were not enough. Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, allowing seven runs in under five innings, which put the team in a deep hole early on. Although Shohei Ohtani hit his 32nd home run and the offense showed signs of life in the later innings, they ultimately left runners stranded in crucial moments, sealing their defeat and shrinking their division lead to four games.</p>

          <p>A fugitive named Sedrick T. Stevenson, who escaped from custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office reported a multi-agency effort involving U.S. Marshals and Seattle-area police ensured his secure return after more than a month on the run. Photos released by the sheriff's office showed a smiling Stevenson on the plane, heavily secured and monitored by law enforcement. Stevenson was originally wanted on multiple charges, including being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and assault, before his initial escape from a contracted agent at the airport's ticket counter.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Raja Shehadeh argues that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, a reality made starkly evident during the ongoing war in Gaza. The article criticizes Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah, which an Israeli human rights lawyer described as a potential "crime against humanity," and contends that such actions demonstrate the demise of the rule-based order. Shehadeh asserts that despite the failure of legal institutions, hope lies in Palestinian resilience and their enduring connection to their land. The author concludes that global accountability for Israel and its allies will ultimately come from shared humanity recognizing the suffering, not from legal frameworks that have proven ineffective.</p>

          <p>Indirect negotiations in Qatar between Israel and Hamas for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal are reportedly on the brink of collapse. According to Palestinian officials familiar with the talks, Israel's delegation lacked the authority to make decisions on key issues, effectively stalling the process. Major points of contention include the mechanism for humanitarian aid distribution and the extent of the Israeli military's withdrawal from Gaza. A significant disagreement arose over a map presented by Israel, which showed its forces maintaining a much larger buffer zone inside Gaza than previously discussed, eroding trust and leading Hamas officials to believe the talks were a delaying tactic for diplomatic purposes.</p>

          <p>Chinese analysts are observing a growing, albeit uneasy, alliance between parts of the U.S. tech sector and the Make America Great Again (MAGA) political movement, which could intensify the tech rivalry with China. The article highlights that some American tech leaders are deepening ties with the defense industry and advocating for continued pressure to contain China's technological development and promote further decoupling in high-tech sectors. However, some Chinese scholars suggest this trend could backfire, as tensions between the traditionally more globalist tech elite and the nationalist MAGA camp might ultimately undermine the effectiveness of their combined efforts to reshape U.S. politics and foreign policy regarding China.</p>

The controversy erupted after Prada presented the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its cultural origins, prompting a social media outcry and a formal request for recognition from a Maharashtra trade chamber representing artisans. In response, Prada held a meeting to discuss future collaborations, with Lorenzo Bertelli, head of corporate social responsibility, participating. This move is seen as a step towards respectful engagement between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities, which are now seeking to patent the design.</p>

U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's ruling came in response to a lawsuit from the ACLU and other rights groups, which alleged that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting people based on race and denying legal counsel. The order specifically bars agents from making detentive stops based solely on factors like a person's apparent ethnicity, accent, or presence at specific locations like day labor sites without reasonable suspicion. The judge also criticized the administration, stating there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims of constitutional violations.</p>

While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their work as training data will proceed.

The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so.

          <p>A major terminal operator at the Port of Long Beach has broken ground on a $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in port activity linked to global trade uncertainties and rising tariffs. The project by International Transportation Service (ITS) aims to extend the quay and fill in a 19-acre water area, boosting cargo-handling capacity by 50% and allowing larger ships to dock. While officials acknowledge the current uncertainty in the industry, which has seen a drop in container movement, they express confidence in the port's long-term growth. The expansion is seen as a crucial investment in strengthening America's supply chain infrastructure for the future.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of the infamous former Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a U.S. federal court. Prosecutors accused Guzman Lopez, known as "El Raton," of taking over a leadership role in the Sinaloa Cartel following his father's arrest and extradition. As part of his plea deal, he admitted to coordinating the transport of vast quantities of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl into the U.S. and agreed to forfeit $80 million. In exchange for his full cooperation, he will receive a reduced sentence, marking a significant development in U.S. efforts to dismantle the powerful cartel.</p>

          <p>A decade after its initial release, the song "The Night We Met" by indie folk band Lord Huron has become a massive and unlikely global hit, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify alone. Originally the final track on their 2015 album "Strange Trails," the song gained a second life after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 and subsequently exploding in popularity on TikTok. Its slow-burning success is unusual for a track that was not a hit upon release, with its streaming numbers continuing to grow each year. Frontman Ben Schneider attributes its enduring appeal to its relatable, wistful lyrics about a soured relationship, which allows listeners to insert their own stories.</p>

          <p>Numerous independent gift and toy shops across the UK have been left confused and devastated after the popular British soft toy company, Jellycat, abruptly terminated their supply accounts. Shop owners who had stocked the brand for decades reported receiving a generic email stating the decision was final and part of a "brand elevation strategy." The move comes after Jellycat's popularity surged on social media platforms like TikTok, which also led to stock availability issues for smaller retailers. Many independent owners feel they are being cast aside in favor of larger department stores, and the decision has sparked a backlash from loyal customers who supported the brand through these small businesses.</p>

          <p>A contentious debate is unfolding in Prague over the future of the historic Vysehrad railway bridge, a 123-year-old steel landmark that the national Railway Authority plans to dismantle and replace. Officials argue a new, wider bridge with a third track is necessary to accommodate projected growth in rail traffic, as the current structure is corroded and operating at reduced capacity. However, a coalition of architects, engineers, and preservationists, backed by a public petition and UNESCO, insists the bridge can be repaired in place for less money while preserving a crucial part of the city's skyline. The dispute highlights the classic conflict between modern infrastructure needs and the protection of historical heritage.</p>

This optimism is primarily fueled by the sustained and accelerating dominance of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which continues to gain market share from competitors like Amazon Web Services. The upgrade is supported by survey data indicating a record number of chief information officers intend to increase their spending on Azure, alongside strong growth in the company's overall cloud revenue and commercial bookings.

This criticism comes after months of pressure from Trump for the Fed to slash interest rates to boost the economy, a move Powell and the Fed have resisted due to inflation risks.
