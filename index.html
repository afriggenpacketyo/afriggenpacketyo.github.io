          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris re-emerged into the political spotlight with a speech in San Francisco, criticizing President Trump's policies during his first 100 days in office. Harris accused the Trump administration of abandoning America's highest ideals and fostering fear, while also condemning his trade war as the "greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history." She argued that Trump's tariffs hurt workers and families by raising costs and paralyzing businesses, predicting they would invite a recession. Harris urged Americans to stand together and prepare for the challenges ahead, emphasizing that the country belongs to the people, not whoever is in the White House.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Ukraine have finalized a deal allowing the United States to share in future revenues from Ukraine's mineral reserves, establishing a joint investment fund between the two countries. This New York Times article details that the agreement comes after months of fraught negotiations, aiming to give President Trump a personal stake in Ukraine's fate and address concerns about providing Kyiv with a blank check. While the agreement does not include explicit guarantees of future U.S. security assistance, it is intended to signal to Russia the Trump administration's commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine. The deal had been delayed after a contentious meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky in February, with Trump initially demanding repayment for past U.S. aid.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement to share profits and royalties from the sale of Ukrainian minerals, creating a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund. The deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to invest in Ukraine's defense and reconstruction, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stating it signals a commitment to a free and sovereign Ukraine. Ukrainian officials emphasized that the agreement is equitable, maintaining Ukraine's control over its natural resources and ensuring no debt obligations. Critics had previously accused the White House of seeking to exploit Ukraine's reliance on aid, but the final terms are less onerous than initially proposed, with the US presence intended to deter bad actors.</p>

          <p>Eleven students accused of participating in a hazing incident targeting younger members of the Westhill High School lacrosse team turned themselves in after facing potential kidnapping charges. According to the district attorney, the older players allegedly lured the younger members into an isolated area, where accomplices emerged masked and staged an abduction. One younger player was reportedly tied up, had a pillowcase placed over his head, and was thrown into the trunk of a car. While no injuries were reported, the district attorney described the incident as "hazing on steroids" and said it could have resulted in tragedy, adding that he had seen the videotape of what happened to the young man and that it is not a rite of passage and it is not a trivial matter.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of trade policies on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. This New York Times article details that the central bank now expects Japan's economy to grow by 0.5 percent, a sharp decrease from the 1.1 percent previously predicted in January. President Trump's tariff threats are weighing heavily on economic prospects, exacerbating pressures on an already fragile economy where consumers are reluctant to spend due to rising inflation. The tariff disruption is also complicating the Bank of Japan's efforts to revert to more conventional monetary policies, as the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady.</p>

          <p>In the trial of Erin Patterson, accused of serving a poisonous mushroom lunch to her family, her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, testified that it was unusual for her to host social gatherings. He had been invited to the lunch but declined to attend the day before. The prosecution alleges that Ms. Patterson invited the group to lunch under the pretense that she had been diagnosed with cancer. Mr. Patterson recounted instances of separation during their marriage, including one where she left him and their baby son during a road trip. He described her as intelligent and witty, noting her good relationship with his parents, who were among those who died after the meal. The main issue in the case is whether Ms. Patterson intended to kill or cause very serious injury.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the shifting dynamics in Asia, noting the decline of American influence and the rise of China as a dominant power. The article reflects on the historical context of American involvement in Vietnam, contrasting it with the current landscape where China's economic and political presence is increasingly felt. While some express concerns about China's intentions and actions, others acknowledge the diminishing role of the United States in providing aid and support.

          <p>A California Assembly committee revised a controversial bill aimed at ending solar credits for owners of rooftop solar systems, narrowing its scope to apply only to those who sell their homes. The original bill, AB 942, sought to limit the program's benefits to 10 years, but the committee removed this provision following opposition from rooftop solar owners, schools, and environmental groups. Opponents argued that the bill would reduce home values and undermine investments in green energy. The bill's author, Lisa Calderon, argued that the credits given to rooftop solar owners are raising electric bills for those without panels.</p>

          <p>Japan's central bank decided to hold its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs weigh on the outlook for the country's economy. The move aligns with economists' expectations and occurs amid global trade tensions and pressure from the U.S. for countries to sign business deals. While Japan's inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target, Trump tariffs have complicated plans to raise rates. The central bank indicated it will continue to raise its policy rate if economic and price forecasts are realized, while also acknowledging that Japan's growth is likely to moderate.</p>

          <p>Meta's finance chief Susan Li announced that Chinese online retailers have decreased their advertising spending on Facebook and Instagram due to President Donald Trump's tough trade policy. The reduction in spending is likely in response to the de minimis trade loophole ending, which benefited online retailers like Temu and Shein. While a portion of the spending has been redirected to other markets, overall spend for these advertisers is below previous levels. Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region reached $8.22 billion for the first quarter, falling short of Wall Street projections.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to change vaccine testing protocols, requiring all new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials before licensure. According to the Washington Post, this represents a significant departure from past practices. The HHS spokesperson confirmed the policy change but did not clarify the implementation details or which vaccines it would apply to. This decision has sparked debate within the scientific community, given Kennedy's past skepticism regarding vaccine safety.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average price of resale homes across 100 Chinese cities fell by 0.7% month-on-month in April, according to a report by a Chinese real estate research institute. The decline is attributed to an increase in residential properties on the market, intensifying competition for buyers. The report noted that price cuts to drive sales remain the market norm, with a relatively high number of listings in core cities following the lifting of resale restrictions in some areas. Signs of stabilization or a mild rebound in the property market could help cushion China's economy from the impact of a renewed trade war with the United States.</p>
