          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will halt all new federal research grants to Harvard University, citing the university's alleged failure to combat antisemitism and discrimination, as well as its abandonment of academic rigor and viewpoint diversity. Education Secretary Linda McMahon is expected to formally notify Harvard of the decision, which also includes medical research funding. Harvard is currently under investigation by multiple federal agencies for accusations ranging from failure to disclose foreign gifts to discrimination within the Harvard Law Review. The university maintains that there is no legal basis to rescind its tax-exempt status, arguing it would impair its ability to carry out its mission.</p>

          <p>Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is facing scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to seemingly coordinate with a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. The practice, known as 'red-boxing,' involves posting strategic information publicly for outside groups to act upon, circumventing campaign finance limits. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned against this practice, and a formal investigation has been requested by one of Cuomo's opponents. Cuomo's lawyer denies any wrongdoing, stating that the super PAC has not acted on the information provided.</p>

          <p>President Trump's call to impose steep tariffs on movies produced outside the U.S. has caused confusion in Hollywood, with industry members expressing concerns about the potential harm such tariffs could inflict. The proposal followed a meeting with actor Jon Voight, who presented plans to increase domestic film production through tax incentives and other measures. While some appreciate Trump's attention to the issue, many are advocating for federal tax credits instead of tariffs. The industry has seen a decline in local film and television production due to incentives offered by other states and countries.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has claimed responsibility for a strike on a drone command unit in Russia's Kursk region, amidst reports of renewed attempts to cross into Russian territory. Russian officials reported damage to an electrical substation in Rylsk, injuring two teenagers. Military bloggers have indicated that Ukrainian forces attempted to cross into the village of Tyotkino, using special vehicles to breach minefields. Ukraine asserted that its forces maintain a military presence in the Kursk region, nine months after launching a surprise incursion.

          <p>Travelers are expressing heightened anxiety regarding detentions at U.S. airports, with some taking precautions such as leaving their phones at home and using burner devices. Immigration lawyers report increased panic among their clients, including green-card holders and even U.S. citizens, due to concerns about interactions with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers. This fear stems from the Trump administration's intensified screening of foreigners and immigrants, as well as promises of a large deportation program. CBP officials maintain that searches of electronic devices have not significantly increased and that detentions are based on derogatory information.</p>

Early studies, often unpublished, linked these chemicals to various health problems, including cancer and developmental issues, but industry lobbying and lax regulations have allowed their continued use.
