          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest 2025 is being held in Basel, Switzerland, featuring artists from 26 countries. Sweden's comedy trio KAJ is favored to win with their song about saunas, but the event is also marked by political tensions, particularly surrounding Israel's participation due to the ongoing war in Gaza, sparking both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests. Organizers expect over 500,000 people to gather in Basel for Eurovision week, with around 36,000 watching the final show at the stadium. There are also rumors of a possible appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest in 1988 representing Switzerland.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are increasingly challenging the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. This article highlights several cases where courts have insisted that immigrants be given the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly when the administration claims novel powers to remove them. Legal scholars have praised the courts for upholding basic constitutional principles, while also expressing concern that such intervention was necessary in the first place.</p>

          <p>Romania's presidential election between hard-right George Simion and pro-EU Nicusor Dan is causing tension within the European Union. Simion's victory could lead to political chaos similar to the U.S. under Trump, potentially altering Romania's role as a reliable EU and NATO partner. While the Romanian president has limited executive powers, they still exert influence over domestic and foreign policy. Recent polls show Simion ahead, but election forecasts in Romania are unreliable. Simion has a history of anti-Ukrainian agitation and pro-Russian views, raising concerns about Romania's future direction.</p>

Despite opposition from hard-liners within the Republican Party, Trump is pushing forward with negotiations, led by Steve Witkoff, to find a creative solution. The potential deal could involve a long-term freeze on Iranian enrichment under enhanced inspections and a phased removal of sanctions, but faces challenges in securing lasting guarantees.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took U.S. sanctions officials by surprise, creating confusion within the Treasury Department. The announcement, made during a visit to Saudi Arabia, lacked specifics, leaving officials uncertain about which measures would be rolled back and at what pace. While the decision was welcomed by Syria's transitional government, it has raised questions about the implications for regional stability and the enforcement of existing sanctions related to terrorism and human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>Democrats in Arizona are facing significant challenges as they prepare for the 2026 elections, particularly the re-election bid of Governor Katie Hobbs. The state party is grappling with internal divisions, and Hobbs is considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic governors. The Republican primary is shaping up to be a competitive battle, with potential candidates including hard-right populist Andy Biggs and businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robson. Despite these challenges, Hobbs's supporters argue that her focus on pragmatic governance and her ability to block Republican legislation will resonate with voters.</p>
