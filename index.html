          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a plasma drive technology that significantly boosts the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones. Wind tunnel tests revealed that plasma generated by high-voltage currents could increase an aircraft wing's lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88 percent. This advancement could extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance drones, enabling them to fly for extended periods. The research team, led by Zhang Xin from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre, published their findings in the Chinese Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.</p>

The deals also break with Biden's policies restricting tech sales to these nations due to their ties with China. Elon Musk's presence highlighted his continued influence, securing a Starlink agreement for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia, and demonstrating Tesla's Optimus robots.</p>

The recordings capture Biden struggling to recall dates, including the year of his son Beau's death and Trump's first election, with staff members correcting him.

The tapes reveal Biden's confusion and memory lapses during the interview, contradicting claims from allies and aides about his mental sharpness.

          <p>Maureen Dowd reflects on the downfall of Joe Biden, attributing it to hubris and a chip on his shoulder. Biden's loss of mental acuity, exacerbated by personal tragedies and the Hunter Biden situation, led to a damaging inability to see his own limitations. Aides and family perpetuated a "selective truth," shielding him from reality and enabling his re-election bid despite his obvious decline. The disastrous debate performance confirmed his steep mental decline, revealing a cover-up that ultimately harmed both Biden and the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>With the Trump administration ramping up collection efforts, student loan borrowers are advised to understand the difference between delinquency and default. Delinquency begins after missing a payment, while default occurs after 270 days of non-payment, leading to garnishments. Borrowers should contact their loan servicer to request forbearance and enroll in affordable repayment plans. Options for those in default include contacting the Default Resolution Group and pursuing income-driven repayment or loan rehabilitation. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump's proposal for tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. has sparked debate about the industry's decline. Many states and countries offer financial incentives to attract productions, leading to "runaway production." California needs to update its tax credit program to remain competitive. Grassroots groups and studio executives agree that California needs a comeback to preserve its legacy as the entertainment capital of the world.</p>
