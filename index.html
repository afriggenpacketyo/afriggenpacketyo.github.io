          <p>Following a historic election loss for the Liberal-National coalition in Australia, Sussan Ley has been elected as the first female leader of the Liberal Party. Ley, a seasoned politician who has held the seat of Farrer since 2001 and served in various senior ministerial roles, aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, especially women and young people who felt neglected. She plans to review all party policies, including those related to nuclear energy and net-zero emissions, emphasizing a fresh approach and collaborative decision-making. The appointment comes as Anthony Albanese was sworn in as Prime Minister after his Labor Party's landslide victory.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to lift an injunction that temporarily blocked the deportation of nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas. The administration argues that these migrants, alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, pose a significant danger and have threatened violence and hostage-taking within detention facilities. Solicitor General D. John Sauer stated that the migrants have received adequate notice and opportunity to pursue habeas petitions, emphasizing the need for their removal due to the risks they present while detained. The administration also indicated it would pursue deportation under other legal authorities if the AEA is blocked.</p>

          <p>The defense in the Karen Read trial is floating a theory that a "jealous" Brian Higgins may have fought with John O'Keefe before his death, suggesting a violent love triangle involving an ATF agent and the defendant. The defense presented text messages between Read and Higgins in the weeks before O'Keefe's death, highlighting flirtatious exchanges and heavy drinking. The defense questioned the detective about whether he explored the possibility of Higgins being jealous of O'Keefe, which the detective denied. The defense also highlighted text messages from a state trooper, who has since been fired over his off-duty behavior, that called Read names and discussed searching her phone for nude selfies.</p>

          <p>A China-led international research team has analyzed seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, revealing a zone in Mars' crust that suggests the presence of liquid water locked in rock just a few kilometers beneath the surface. This discovery, if confirmed, could indicate a significant amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. The findings offer new insights into Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet, using data collected by the InSight lander's seismometer between 2018 and 2022.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how German companies, significant investors in the United States, are rethinking their investment strategies due to trade tensions and tariffs. While German firms have long had a strong presence in the U.S., recent surveys indicate a pullback in investment and a more pessimistic outlook. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry noted a decline in sentiment among German companies with U.S. factories since tariffs were introduced. Simultaneously, there's increased interest in investing within Germany, spurred by a new government focused on reducing bureaucracy and investing in infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The article explores the two contrasting narratives of China's economy: one of a technological superpower and the other of an economy facing significant challenges. While companies like DeepSeek, BYD, and Huawei showcase China's innovation and leadership in areas like AI and electric vehicles, the country also grapples with sluggish consumer spending, rising unemployment, a housing crisis, and the impact of trade wars. Experts suggest that China's technological advances may not be enough to overcome its structural economic imbalances, highlighting the need to address issues like unemployment, weak consumption, and reliance on exports.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's offer to mediate between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir dispute has placed India in a difficult situation, given its long-standing opposition to third-party mediation. The offer followed a period of heightened tensions and cross-border clashes, with Trump announcing a ceasefire brokered by the U.S. While Pakistan welcomed the offer, India, which considers Kashmir an integral part of its territory, has historically insisted on bilateral negotiations. The situation is further complicated by India's recent actions in Kashmir and its refusal to engage in discussions with Pakistan due to accusations of cross-border terrorism.</p>

The decision follows a challenge by Kalyn Free, who alleged that the DNC improperly combined two questions and tallied votes together, disadvantaging female candidates. The controversy comes as Hogg faces separate intraparty criticism over his plans to primary some Democratic politicians. Hogg argued that the vote was influenced by his efforts to reform the party, while DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed disappointment over the procedural error.</p>

The resolution will now be presented to the entire DNC.
