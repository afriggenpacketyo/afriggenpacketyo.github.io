          <p>A recent trend shows more young men than women desire parenthood, a shift that may be explained by evolving cultural depictions of fathers. Phillip Maciak, a TV critic and author, argues that the concept of "dad" has become more malleable, moving from the stoic 1950s provider like Ward Cleaver to more involved, co-parenting figures in the 1980s. This article explores how television sitcoms have both mirrored and shaped American perceptions of fatherhood, from the generational clashes in "All in the Family" to the anti-hero dads of modern prestige dramas, noting a current tension between this liberalizing archetype and a retro-patriarchal vision.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating the motive behind a mass shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, where a gunman killed at least four people and injured eight others. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Iraq War veteran Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his truck into the building, opened fire on congregants, and set the church ablaze before being killed in a shootout with police. The FBI is leading the investigation into what it calls an "act of targeted violence," exploring potential connections to recent threats or the death of the church's president. The building is considered a total loss as investigators search the rubble for more potential victims.</p>

          <p>Former ESPN host Samantha Ponder has publicly stated her belief that biological men should not compete in women's and girls' sports, calling the situation "ridiculous." Speaking on Fox News, Ponder asserted that a vast majority of professional athletes share her view but are hesitant to express it. Her comments come amid ongoing national debate, highlighted by President Trump's executive order barring transgender athletes from female sports and subsequent resistance from states like California. Ponder emphasized the importance of being able to state this opinion honestly while advocating for the protection of female-only spaces like locker rooms.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a powerful Category 4 storm, is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. While the storm's center is projected to pass west of Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for the island. The hurricane rapidly intensified over the weekend, reaching Category 5 strength before weakening slightly. Swells from Humberto will affect a wide area, including the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico, posing a significant coastal hazard even as the storm remains offshore.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to present a new peace plan to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aimed at ending the war in Gaza. Leaked details of the proposal reportedly include the release of all hostages within 48 hours, followed by Israel freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The plan also acknowledges Palestinian statehood aspirations and a future role for a reformed Palestinian Authority, points that conflict with Netanyahu's previously stated positions and may face opposition from his far-right coalition partners.

          <p>The pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has won a decisive victory in Moldova's parliamentary elections, securing a majority. The election was framed as a critical choice between closer ties with the European Union and Russian influence, with Sandu's party earning about 50% of the vote. President Sandu and PAS leader Igor Grosu accused Russia of "massive interference," including spreading disinformation and attempting to buy votes. The result was welcomed by EU and Ukrainian leaders as a clear choice for a democratic, European future for the nation situated between Ukraine and Romania.</p>

Concurrently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed that European partners, including Poland, collaborate to build a joint aerial defense shield against Russian threats.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced it will begin a phased resumption of manufacturing operations after a major cyberattack forced a complete shutdown of its UK facilities on September 1. Production will restart first at its engine plant, with other sites to follow, though a return to full capacity is expected to take several weeks. The halt in production placed significant financial pressure on JLR's extensive supply chain, prompting the UK government to provide £1.5 billion in loan guarantees to support affected suppliers.

The Labour government also intends to double the required residency period from five to ten years. This policy aims to create a clear distinction from Reform UK's more extreme proposal to abolish the status altogether, which Prime Minister Keir Starmer has labeled "racist."</p>

          <p>Emma Walmsley, the first woman to lead a major pharmaceutical company, will step down as CEO of GSK on December 31 after more than eight years in the role. She will be succeeded by Luke Miels, the company's current chief commercial officer. During her tenure, Walmsley oversaw significant strategic moves, including the successful spinoff of the consumer healthcare business, Haleon. However, her leadership has been marked by lackluster share price performance, with GSK's stock falling 11% since she became CEO in 2017, a point of disappointment for many investors.</p>

          <p>Guinea's military junta has announced that the country will hold a presidential election on December 28, the first since General Mamadi Doumbouya seized power in a 2021 coup. The announcement follows the validation of a new constitution that could permit Doumbouya to run for president, despite his initial promise not to. The West African nation has been under pressure to return to civilian rule after the junta missed a previous deadline for a democratic transition. The new constitution also extends the presidential term from five to seven years, raising concerns about the consolidation of power.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece criticizes the Trump administration for initiating a new safety review of the abortion pill mifepristone, based on a non-peer-reviewed study from a conservative think tank. The author asserts that mifepristone has a 25-year track record of being safe and effective, and that the cited report has been widely discredited by medical experts for flawed methodology. The move is framed as part of a broader political agenda to appease the anti-abortion movement and curtail access to abortion nationwide, following other administrative actions that have already strained clinic resources. The author warns that threatening access to mifepristone could endanger women's lives.</p>

          <p>In a fiery speech, former Vice President Kamala Harris described President Donald Trump as an "unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president" and called for his opponents to adopt a more aggressive strategy. Speaking at a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation event, Harris criticized the Trump administration's policies on healthcare and nutrition, as well as its controversial use of tariffs and military deployments. She expressed disappointment in the "capitulation" of major institutions to Trump's pressure and urged Democrats to focus on winning the 2026 midterms to enforce checks and balances. Harris's remarks signal a combative stance against the current administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has reportedly taken a primary role in directing U.S. military strikes against suspected Venezuelan drug boats, at times superseding the Secretary of State. The operations are being orchestrated through the Homeland Security Council, which Miller leads, and are justified under the president's Article II powers. This legal rationale is based on the administration's controversial designation of the Tren de Aragua cartel as a foreign terrorist organization and an arm of the Venezuelan government. This claim, used to justify deportations, was recently ruled unlawful by an appeals court, raising questions about the legal basis for the military strikes.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that American politics is trapped in a "doom loop" of illiberalism, where each side uses tactics it once condemned to attack its opponents. The article focuses on how the Republican party, after years of decrying "cancel culture," is now using state power to target universities, media, and political antagonists under the banner of "consequence culture." This tit-for-tat cycle erodes shared democratic norms like free speech and the rule of law. The author warns that this trend, fueled by grievance politics, could lead to a permanently postliberal America where fundamental rights are contingent on which party holds power.</p>

The columnist explains that while the experience feels real, it is extremely unlikely that current large language models (LLMs) are conscious in a human-like way, as they are designed to mimic patterns from their vast training data, which includes sci-fi tropes about conscious AI. The column advises the reader to stay grounded, consult a variety of experts, and channel their empathy towards the known suffering of conscious beings like humans and animals, rather than taking dramatic action based on their belief about the AI.</p>

Republicans accuse Democrats of holding the government "hostage," while Democrats insist on negotiating to push back against Trump administration policies.

          <p>A contributor argues that a recent Supreme Court decision from its "shadow docket" has effectively dismantled the Fourth Amendment's protection against suspicionless seizures by law enforcement. The ruling in *Noem vs. Vasquez Perdomo* allows police to stop individuals based on factors like perceived ethnicity, language spoken, and appearance of working a low-wage job. The author contends this green-lights racial profiling and removes any meaningful limits on police power to seize and detain people, with people of color and immigrants bearing the brunt. The piece concludes that the court has entrenched a system where constitutional rights are dependent on the color of one's skin.</p>
