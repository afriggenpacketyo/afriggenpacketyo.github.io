          <h2>China Enacts New Law to Protect Private Sector from Unfair Enforcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 04:00:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a new private sector law aimed at curbing “profit-driven” enforcement actions that disproportionately target non-state-owned businesses. This legislation seeks to address long-standing grievances regarding cross-regional enforcement and enhance accountability for officials. The law is designed to reassure private entrepreneurs amid growing economic pressures both domestically and internationally. Analysts believe the law's focus on regulating administrative actions and establishing clear accountability mechanisms will empower businesses to defend their interests, potentially through legal action against local governments. The Ministry of Justice hailed the law as historically significant, especially given increasing external challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has held its policy rate steady at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, influenced by concerns over potential tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which could impact Japan's economic outlook. Despite inflation remaining above the BOJ's 2% target for 36 months, giving the central bank flexibility to raise rates, trade tensions have complicated normalization plans. The BOJ indicated it would continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are met, while also acknowledging a likely moderation in Japan's growth due to global economic slowdown and declining domestic corporate profits. Governor Kazo Ueda cautioned that drastic tariff policy changes would affect the central bank's monetary policy outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Worldcoin, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has officially launched its global identity verification system in the U.S., using iris scans to combat fraud and bots. The system involves scanning a person's face and iris with a biometric device called an Orb, creating a unique “IrisCode” that verifies their humanity and uniqueness, in exchange for some of the project's cryptocurrency. Worldcoin is opening six retail locations in the U.S. for sign-ups and has announced partnerships with Visa for a "World Visa card" and Match Group to pilot age verification on Tinder in Japan. Concerns have been raised about data storage, but the company claims data is decentralized and impossible to reverse-engineer.</p>

          <p>Seven months after Hurricane Helene devastated towns in western North Carolina, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is still leading cleanup efforts, particularly in Lake Lure. The hurricane caused record rainfall and historic flooding, leaving up to ten feet of debris under silt and sand in some areas. The USACE has removed over 5 million cubic yards of debris, including storm-damaged trees and fragments from waterways, and is also clearing roadways and private properties. The town's mayor, Carol Pritchett, expressed gratitude for the USACE's assistance, noting that the hurricane's power was beyond what their emergency plan anticipated.</p>

Tesla chair Robyn Denholm stated the report was “absolutely false,” and Musk himself criticized the Wall Street Journal's reporting. Musk previously stated he would allocate more time to Tesla and reduce his government role. The Wall Street Journal claimed Musk was told by the board that he needed to spend more time on Tesla and to publicly state so.</p>

The fires have injured several people and prompted the deployment of troops and resources to help control the blazes. Police closed the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and evacuated residents, while international assistance, including firefighting aircraft from several countries, was being mobilized. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir suggested arson could be a cause and police arrested a resident for allegedly attempting to set fire to a field.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the UK's attempts to appease Donald Trump in hopes of securing favorable trade deals, arguing that these efforts have been largely unsuccessful. The piece suggests that despite the UK's efforts to align with Trump's requirements, it is likely to receive less favorable treatment compared to other countries. It draws parallels to Columbia University's experience, where concessions to Trump did not guarantee the restoration of federal funding. The article concludes that belligerence may be more effective in dealing with Trump than appeasement, as demonstrated by tech companies and business leaders.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk argue that the U.S. military lacks the personnel and materiel needed to fight a major war. They contend that while the U.S. possesses advanced military equipment, it has traded a larger, more durable force for one that is high-tech but brittle. The authors highlight that modern wars require both advanced systems and a sheer volume of munitions, citing Ukraine's high usage of artillery shells as an example. They recommend increasing investment in active service members, ammunition, new ships, and new aircraft to address these shortcomings.</p>
