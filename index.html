          <h2>UK Economy Stalls in July Amidst Budget Pressures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy recorded zero growth in July, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics, following a 0.4% expansion in June. This stagnation, while part of a 0.2% growth over three months, significantly increases pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to deliver economic growth ahead of the November budget. A strong performance in the service sector, driven by health and computer programming, was counteracted by a weak manufacturing output. Economists anticipate a broader economic slowdown in the latter half of 2025, with the government facing mounting challenges to its fiscal rules and a need to reverse years of underinvestment.

          <p>Russia and Belarus have commenced joint military exercises, named Zapad, scheduled from September 12-16, amidst heightened tensions with NATO countries following a recent drone incident in Polish airspace. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met with his Polish counterpart, Radosław Sikorski, in Kyiv to discuss shared security, Ukraine's EU and NATO accession, and strategies to pressure Russia. These large-scale maneuvers involve tens of thousands of soldiers and are set to include training with Russia's new Oreshnik missiles, which are reportedly capable of carrying nuclear warheads. The Kremlin states the drills are not aimed at any other country.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, detained in a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, have returned to their home country, triggering significant diplomatic and economic concerns. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Hyundai's chief executive warned that the raid could deter foreign investment and delay the factory's opening by months. Seoul is actively negotiating with Washington for new visa options for Korean firms, while media in South Korea express "shock" and urge cooperation to mend alliance strains. The White House, however, defended the operation and dismissed concerns about deterring investment.</p>

          <h2>UK Economic Growth Flatlines in July, Signaling H2 2025 Slowdown</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy recorded zero growth in July, consistent with economist expectations, signaling an anticipated slowdown in the latter half of 2025 following a stronger second quarter. This stagnation creates further challenges for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the Autumn Budget and complicates the Bank of England's balancing act between fiscal uncertainty and sticky inflation. Production output contracted significantly, though services and construction saw marginal increases. Experts predict a course correction in trade and public spending will contribute to slower GDP growth, with a November rate cut still expected despite the Bank's recent hawkish stance.

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper has secured its first in-flight Wi-Fi contract with JetBlue, marking a significant step in its race against SpaceX's dominant Starlink satellite internet service. Despite this win, Kuiper's current constellation of 102 satellites lags far behind Starlink's 8,393, with Amazon facing a mandate to deploy thousands more by 2029 to meet FCC requirements. The burgeoning satellite internet market, driven by projections for future 6G communications, is attracting massive investment, aiming to connect billions globally who currently lack internet access.

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis delves into the principle of proportionality concerning Israel's military operation in Gaza, which has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and widespread destruction since October 2023. While Israel asserts its right to self-defense and adherence to international law, a vast majority of international law experts consulted by the BBC conclude that Israel's actions, particularly its overall conduct and impact on civilians and infrastructure, have been disproportionate. The article explores two aspects of proportionality—overall response and individual military actions—and discusses the contested application of self-defense given Gaza's occupied status.

          <p>The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, proposing to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, is set for a two-day debate in the House of Lords. Supporters urge peers to respect the Commons' decision to back the bill, while opponents highlight "massive problems" and call for more scrutiny, citing concerns from a Lords committee about the bill's underdeveloped nature and sweeping, unspecified powers. The legislation would allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, requiring approval from two doctors and a panel of professionals.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that US attempts to reindustrialize and contain China are fundamentally undermined by its anti-immigrant policies, citing the recent raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia as a stark illustration. The raid, which resulted in the detention of hundreds of South Korean technicians, exposed the inherent contradiction between President Trump's "Make America Great Again" base and the actual labor needs for advanced manufacturing. The article argues that such actions, initiated by both the Trump and Biden administrations, disrupt globalization and world trade, ultimately hurting the US and its allies more than they benefit.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning to Mexico, urging it to "think twice" before implementing plans to hike tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%, and threatening "necessary measures" in retaliation. Mexico's proposed tariffs, part of a broader federal budget, aim to protect its domestic auto industry amidst ongoing trade tensions, particularly with the US. China criticized the move as sacrificing third-party interests due to US pressure and highlighted its own dominance in critical mineral supply chains.

          <p>California's Assembly has passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and expand high-density housing near public transit hubs. The legislation, championed by Senator Scott Wiener, would permit buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops, impacting single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile. While supporters argue drastic measures are needed for the state's affordability crisis, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, condemn it as a "one-size-fits-all mandate" that strips local authorities of control and could alter communities. Support surged after amendments added union hiring provisions.</p>
