          <h2>Central Banks Navigate Currency Devaluation Amidst Fluctuating Dollar</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is presenting a complex scenario for central banks worldwide, offering both relief and challenges. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens for emerging markets and lower inflation through cheaper imports, it also complicates export competitiveness, especially with renewed U.S. tariffs. Currency devaluation, though tempting for some, carries risks such as stoking inflation and attracting retaliation from the U.S. administration. Central banks are currently prioritizing stability and avoiding currency wars that could further destabilize the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on sourcing products from China and selling to the U.S., are facing significant pressure due to increased tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The cumulative tariff on Chinese goods is impacting profit margins, forcing businesses to raise prices and shift focus to European markets. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, further exacerbates the challenges. Dropshippers are now contending with higher costs, border inspections, and customer refund requests, leading to a pessimistic outlook within the industry.</p>

          <p>Police arrested Jeffrey Zizz in connection with the death of Marcia Norman, an 82-year-old woman whose remains were found buried beneath a shed he built.

Investigators discovered Norman's body buried and partially encased in concrete after Zizz fled the state.

          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration after rejecting demands from the White House and having $2.2 billion of government funding frozen. The university is accused of ideological bias and allowing antisemitism during campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza. The Trump administration demanded the university screen international students and end diversity programs. Harvard's president has rejected those reforms, and Mr. Trump has questioned whether the university should lose its tax-exempt status.</p>
