          <p>Severe weather, including tornadoes, swept across North Dakota, resulting in at least three deaths in rural Enderlin. The Cass County Sheriff's Office and other first responders are continuing search and rescue operations while assessing extensive damage to the area. Governor Kelly Armstrong declared a statewide disaster and activated the State Emergency Operations Plan in response to the widespread destruction. The storm, characterized as a "derecho," brought wind gusts up to 106 mph, multiple tornadoes, and large hail, also causing flash flooding and prompting water rescues in Fargo. Optimism surrounding the recovery efforts and community resilience is tempered by the initial tragedy.</p>

          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war has commenced with further strikes on an Iranian nuclear research facility near Isfahan, with Israel targeting centrifuge production sites. Iran's foreign minister warned against U.S. military intervention, as President Trump considers potential U.S. involvement. The conflict, which began on June 13, has resulted in numerous casualties on both sides, with Israel continuing its military operations to eliminate Iran's nuclear program. B-2 stealth bombers are being moved to Guam, potentially signaling a show of force or preparation for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, Israel continues to combat Hamas in Gaza, reflecting a multi-front war situation.</p>

Williams highlighted the intensity of the fan interaction at Lambeau Field, describing it as more aggressive than expected. Despite the Bears' struggles last season, Williams' performance has inspired hope among fans for a franchise quarterback. Williams completed 62.5% of his passes for 3,541 yards with 20 touchdowns and six interceptions during his first season, after being selected first overall in the 2024 NFL Draft out of USC. The first game between the Bears and the Packers next season will be held at Lambeau Field on December 7.</p>

However, some passengers were unable to jump before the balloon ascended again and ultimately crashed. Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, and Sobrevoar has suspended all operations indefinitely.</p>

Khalil, who was arrested on March 8 and held for over three months, vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants. He accused the White House of attempting to dehumanize those who disagree with the administration's policies. Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Khalil, stating that his release indicates the Trump administration is losing its legal battle to deport migrants who support Palestinians.

Protesters in London waved Palestinian flags and carried signs advocating for an end to arms shipments to Israel and opposing war with Iran. The protests, ongoing monthly since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, reflect growing concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the potential for escalation in the Middle East. The overall death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached at least 55,637 people, according to the Hamas-led Health Ministry.</p>

The ruling prevents a policy change that would have stripped universities of millions of dollars in research funding.

The Trump administration had sought to cap indirect expenses for NSF grants to universities at 15% of direct research costs.

Reed suggested that Trump's stance is politically motivated, particularly as he contemplates potential military action against Iran. He argued that Trump needs to believe Iran possesses the capability and intent to develop a nuclear weapon to justify an attack. Reed also noted that if the National Intelligence Director made a false statement, it should have been corrected immediately, rather than after Israeli activity. Reed characterized Trump's behavior as "shocking" and indicative of disavowing the intelligence community for political gain.</p>

          <p>The city of Pasadena has canceled swimming lessons and recreation programs at three parks due to concerns about potential immigration enforcement by federal agents. The decision was made after social media posts showed apparent federal enforcement activity near Villa Parke. Officials cited the need to avoid potential conflict caused by unannounced federal enforcement activities. The announcement follows recent detentions by federal agents at a bus stop near Villa Parke, which drew criticism from local politicians. The cancellations reflect growing concerns about the impact of immigration enforcement on community activities and public safety.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the Minnesota shootings that killed a lawmaker and her husband was a doomsday "prepper," according to the FBI. Vance Boelter's wife told investigators the family was among a small group of Americans who "prepare for major or catastrophic incidents". Boelter has been charged with killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. The FBI agent Terry Getsch wrote in an affidavit that Boelter's wife told the authorities her husband had warned her in a message that she should flee, because they should prepare for war. Governor Tim Walz has called the shootings an "act of targeted political violence".</p>

The B-2 bombers can carry the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, capable of destroying deeply buried targets. It remains unclear whether the deployment is directly linked to the Middle East tensions. Experts are monitoring whether the bombers will proceed to the U.S.-British military base on Diego Garcia, which is strategically positioned for operations in the Middle East. The move comes amidst ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, with Israel alleging Iran's proximity to developing nuclear weapons.</p>
