          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, questioning his intelligence for the role after the agency signaled it would accept proposals from SpaceX's rivals for future moon landers. NASA's move is aimed at accelerating the timeline for returning astronauts to the moon and fostering competition to ensure success in what it terms the "second space race" against China. Musk defended SpaceX's progress, asserting its Starship rocket will ultimately complete the entire mission, while Duffy welcomed the competition as a benefit for America.</p>

          <p>Construction has commenced on a new, privately funded ballroom at the White House, involving the demolition of a portion of the East Wing. President Trump confirmed the project, which is estimated to cost $250 million and is funded by private donations, stating it will significantly enhance the White House's event hosting capabilities. The project has drawn criticism from historic preservation groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, who are concerned the large annex will overwhelm the original structure's classical design.</p>

This transfer brings the total number of deceased hostages returned by Hamas to 15 out of 28 under the first phase of the U.S.-brokered deal, which also involved the release of Palestinian prisoners.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has reported that North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles from an area south of its capital, Pyongyang. The missiles traveled approximately 350 kilometers in a northeasterly direction toward the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan. The launch, which comes ahead of a planned visit to South Korea by U.S. President Donald Trump for an APEC summit, has prompted a national security council meeting in Seoul. This marks the first such weapons test since South Korean President Lee Jae-myung took office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has criticized Democrats for the current budget impasse, labeling a potential government shutdown a "'Seinfeld' shutdown... about nothing." He argued that Republicans are offering a clean continuing resolution to fund the government at existing levels, while Democrats are insisting on adding provisions related to health insurance subsidies and Medicaid. McCarthy contrasted the situation with the 2013 shutdown, where he claimed the parties' roles were reversed, with Republicans then seeking to attach policy changes to a funding bill.</p>

          <p>During a lunch with Senate Republicans, President Donald Trump recounted being told he was rated the "third best president" in U.S. history, behind only George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Trump stated that he became "extremely angry" at this assessment, adding that while it would be "very tough to beat" them, he was going to try to do so. The comments were made on the same day he received the Architect of Peace Award from the Richard Nixon Foundation, during which he also repeated a debunked claim of having ended eight wars.</p>

          <p>While visiting Israel, U.S. Vice President JD Vance commented that the first week of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza is "going frankly better than I expected," despite recent flare-ups of violence. Vance acknowledged the challenges, including difficulties in recovering all hostage remains, but urged patience and expressed optimism that the agreement will hold. He reiterated that the plan does not involve deploying American troops to Gaza but will rely on U.S. coordination to help both sides transition to a "peacetime posture."</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced proposals to make it quicker and easier to fine English water companies for illegal raw sewage discharges. The new system would include automatic financial penalties of up to £20,000 for minor offenses and simplify the process for penalizing more serious breaches by lowering the burden of proof required by the Environment Agency. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds stated the goal is to give the regulator "the teeth it needs" to ensure swift consequences for companies that break environmental rules.</p>

          <p>A White House official has stated there are "no plans in the immediate future" for a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This follows the president's earlier announcement that he would meet with Putin in Budapest to discuss the war in Ukraine. Trump later clarified that he did not want to "have a wasted meeting," suggesting progress is needed before any summit takes place. The announcement came after a call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart, which the Kremlin indicated showed serious preparation was still required.</p>

          <p>The price of gold suffered its most significant single-day drop in 12 years on Tuesday, falling as much as 6.3% and leading some analysts to speculate that its recent record-setting rally may be over. Billionaire investor Bill Gross commented that gold's recent price action has been exhibiting characteristics more akin to volatile "meme and momentum stocks" than a traditional safe-haven asset. The surge in gold's value this year has been attributed to large-scale purchases by central banks amid global policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian military has announced it conducted a "successful hit" on a chemical plant in Bryansk, Russia, using UK-provided Storm Shadow long-range missiles. According to Ukraine's general staff, the facility is a key part of Russia's military-industrial complex, producing gunpowder, explosives, and rocket fuel for Moscow's war effort. The strike represents a significant use of Western-supplied weaponry to target strategic assets inside Russian territory, a move the Kremlin has repeatedly warned against. The outcome of the strike is still being assessed.</p>
