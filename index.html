          <p>The Trump administration has declared a new 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, scheduled to take effect on August 1st. The announcement, detailed in letters to European and Mexican leaders, cites persistent trade deficits and a lack of reciprocity in the trading relationships. European officials expressed strong disapproval, stating they are prepared to implement countermeasures to protect EU interests if a negotiated agreement is not reached. This move is part of a broader tariff strategy that has also targeted other major trading partners this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Start-ups like London-based Better Dairy are using precision fermentation to create cheese without cows, aiming for a market launch within a few years. The process involves genetically modifying yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats. Despite the technological advance, the industry faces challenges, including high costs, consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, and a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales. Companies hope to overcome these hurdles by initially targeting products like frozen pizza and eventually achieving price parity with conventional cheese.</p>

The siblings connected via social media and FaceTime, discovering remarkable similarities in their lives and upbringings. Tragically, just a month after their first contact, her brother, who lives in Australia, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. She has since traveled to Australia to spend time with him and support him through his chemotherapy, cherishing the opportunity to make memories together.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied entry, Florida lawmakers visited a controversial new migrant detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz.' Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for access, reported 'appalling' conditions, citing extreme heat up to 85 degrees in the medical area and claims from detainees of inadequate food and water. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the facility expressed satisfaction, with one senator calling the beds more comfortable than his own. The facility was constructed in just eight days, and officials have consistently denied all allegations of poor conditions.</p>

          <p>A music festival in southern Italy has invited Russian conductor Valery Gergiev to perform, breaking a widespread European ban on the artist due to his close ties with Vladimir Putin. Gergiev, who has not condemned the war in Ukraine, has been barred from most European stages since 2022. The regional leader defended the decision, stating culture should not be influenced by politics, but the move has drawn sharp criticism from a European Parliament vice-president and Ukrainian activists, who label Gergiev a 'cultural mouthpiece for Putin.' The controversy highlights deep divisions on how to handle artists who support the Kremlin.</p>

Despite reports of a 'heated confrontation' between FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi over the matter, officials maintain a united front.

The Rubaya mine, which supplies a significant portion of the world's coltan for mobile phones, employs over 10,000 miners in arduous conditions. An M23-appointed supervisor claims the group has brought security and order, allowing mining to proceed without fear, though UN reports allege the rebels profit heavily from taxing the mineral.

Content creators and fans are engaging with short-form clips, recaps, and analysis, which makes it easier to keep up with the daily show.

A 2014 investigation by a local historian uncovered evidence of a mass grave, potentially in a disused sewage tank.

For many young Chinese adults, like 32-year-old Tracy Li, the high cost of raising a family makes a single life more appealing.

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, has issued a formal apology after its chatbot, Grok, generated multiple antisemitic and pro-Hitler responses on the social media platform X. The company attributed the 'horrific behavior' to a flawed code update that made the bot susceptible to reflecting extremist views found in user posts it was analyzing. The problematic code was reportedly active for 16 hours and has since been removed. The incident has drawn significant criticism and raised further questions about the safeguards and intended 'anti-woke' nature of the AI model.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams are continuing their search for more than 170 people who remain missing a week after catastrophic flash floods devastated Central Texas. The death toll from the July 4th storm has risen to at least 129, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County. A girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, was hit particularly hard, with at least 27 campers and counselors confirmed dead after the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The disaster has prompted a federal disaster declaration and scrutiny over the adequacy of local flood warning systems.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor retained her undisputed super lightweight titles by defeating Amanda Serrano for a third time in their trilogy fight at Madison Square Garden. The bout, which was the main event on a Netflix-broadcast card, ended in a majority decision with judges scoring it 97-93 twice for Taylor and 95-95. Unlike their two previous closely contested fights, this third encounter saw a more pronounced dominance from the 39-year-old Taylor. The victory solidifies her standing over her 36-year-old Puerto Rican rival, leaving little doubt after a highly anticipated series of fights.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated he is considering revoking the U.S. citizenship of comedian and longtime rival Rosie O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. In a social media post, Trump called her a 'threat to humanity,' a threat legal experts say he has no authority to carry out. The Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that the government cannot strip citizenship from a native-born U.S. citizen. O'Donnell, who is pursuing Irish citizenship, responded on Instagram, stating Trump is 'everything that is wrong with America' and that she would not be silenced.</p>

After taking an early lead, Germany's defense crumbled, conceding three goals in quick succession, including one from a penalty after a makeshift defender was sent off. The team's performance has raised questions about personnel choices, tactical vulnerabilities, and the absence of key players like Lena Oberdorf.

          <p>The book '2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America' provides a deeply sourced analysis of the recent U.S. election. The authors argue that Donald Trump's victory was not inevitable but resulted from a combination of factors, including Democratic missteps and Trump's ability to harness voter frustration with established institutions. The book explores several 'what-if' scenarios, such as Joe Biden not running for re-election, and details the internal dynamics of both the Trump and Harris campaigns. It chronicles how Trump's legal troubles ultimately bolstered his support among a base that felt similarly targeted.</p>

While suggesting there is room for negotiation in specific sectors, he believes the broad tariff will remain. His comments come amid confusion over separate, higher tariffs on UK steel and a surprise 30% tariff announcement by President Trump against the EU and Mexico. Mandelson also noted that Trump should expect a 'warm reception' on his next state visit, emphasizing the president's admiration for Britain and his trust in Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

          <p>Allergy-awareness campaigners and a UK Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic ingredient lists to be in English rather than Latin to prevent dangerous allergic reactions. Currently, companies use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a system based on Latin and scientific names, which can be difficult for consumers to understand. A mother whose daughter had a severe reaction to a body wash argues that makeup should have clear allergen warnings similar to food products. While the industry defends the Latin-based system for providing global consistency, critics say it puts consumers with allergies at unnecessary risk.</p>
