          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries publicly challenged Republican Speaker Mike Johnson to a primetime debate regarding the ongoing government shutdown, aiming to bring transparency to the American people. Johnson dismissed the challenge as political theatrics, asserting that the House GOP has already passed its funding measure and that negotiations are unnecessary. This standoff highlights the deep partisan divide prolonging the shutdown, which is estimated to cost the U.S. economy $15 billion per week, with no clear resolution in sight as both sides remain entrenched in their positions.</p>

          <p>A new report from Adobe Analytics forecasts that U.S. online holiday spending will increase by 5.3% to $253.4 billion, a slower growth rate compared to the previous year's 8.7% rise. This deceleration reflects broader economic concerns and a consumer base that is increasingly focused on finding discounts. Despite the slowdown, spending is expected to remain robust as shoppers are determined to celebrate the season, with mobile devices anticipated to drive over half of all online sales for the first time.

          <p>France's political crisis has intensified with the resignation of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu after only 26 days in office, marking the nation's fifth prime minister in under two years. His departure followed harsh criticism of his newly formed cabinet and the inability to build a stable coalition in a deeply fractured parliament. President Emmanuel Macron now faces limited options to break the political impasse, with growing calls for another round of legislative elections that could potentially favor the far-right.</p>

          <p>Tensions between the federal government and the state of Illinois have escalated, with the White House publicly insulting Governor JB Pritzker after he rejected President Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to address crime. Pritzker condemned the move as an "un-American" overreach, prompting the Trump administration to authorize Texas National Guard members to be sent instead.

          <p>Despite receiving $45 billion to expand detention capacity, ICE's enforcement actions have reportedly stalled over the summer, with arrest numbers declining since a peak in June. Current and former DHS officials suggest internal administrative hurdles, including new contracting rules, have slowed the process of adding new detention beds, limiting the agency's ability to escalate its operations. This has led to worsening overcrowding in short-term holding facilities and frustration among administration supporters who expected a more rapid acceleration of deportations.</p>

          <p>Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi have been awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine for their foundational discoveries related to peripheral immune tolerance. Their collective work identified regulatory T cells (T-regs) and the controlling gene Foxp3, which are crucial for preventing the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. This research has opened up a new field of immunology and is now pivotal for developing treatments for autoimmune diseases and certain types of cancer.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers can find high interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs), often surpassing the rate of inflation. An unusual market condition known as an inverted yield curve has resulted in short-term CDs, such as those with 6-month or 1-year terms, offering higher annual percentage yields than longer-term CDs. Financial experts suggest that online banks typically provide the most competitive rates, and savers can use a laddering strategy to take advantage of high short-term yields while planning for long-term goals.

          <p>While TSA officers and air traffic controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay during a government shutdown, a prolonged impasse could lead to significant travel disruptions. Staffing shortages may arise if unpaid workers call in sick, leading to longer security lines and potential flight delays, as seen in previous shutdowns. Additionally, the shutdown halts the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, worsening an existing shortage and creating further delays even after government funding is eventually restored.</p>

          <p>Social Security and SSI recipients will continue to receive their monthly payments on schedule during the government shutdown, as the program's funding is mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation battles.

Furthermore, the shutdown could delay the release of key inflation data, potentially postponing the announcement of the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).</p>

          <p>India is significantly investing in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology to modernize its military, recently opening its first drone warfare school and launching its largest-ever drone war games, codenamed "Cold Start." This strategic shift is driven by lessons from recent border clashes with Pakistan and the demonstrated effectiveness of drones in global conflicts like the war in Ukraine. The initiative is part of a broader plan to create a multi-layered, indigenous air defense system to protect the nation's borders and vital installations.</p>

The attacks reportedly hit one of Russia's primary explosives factories, located in the Dzerzhinsk region, and an oil terminal in occupied Feodosia, Crimea, which is used to fuel Moscow's war efforts. These operations are part of Ukraine's escalating campaign to degrade Russia's logistical and production capabilities deep behind the front lines, disrupting its ability to sustain its military aggression.</p>

          <p>A recent poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov indicates that talk show host Jimmy Kimmel holds a higher net favorability rating than President Donald Trump. The survey was conducted after a controversy in which Kimmel's show was temporarily suspended by ABC following pressure from the Trump administration, only to be reinstated after public outcry. The poll found Kimmel with a +3 net favorability, while Trump registered a -13, suggesting the public dispute may have bolstered the comedian's standing relative to the president.</p>
