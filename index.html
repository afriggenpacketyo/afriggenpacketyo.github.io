          <p>The U.S. Senate engaged in a prolonged "vote-a-rama," debating numerous amendments to a major legislative package supported by President Trump. The process saw partisan clashes, with Democrats forcing votes on controversial topics like Medicaid cuts, while some Republicans crossed party lines on specific issues. Despite White House pressure for a swift passage, Republican leadership faced challenges in securing enough votes from their narrow majority, with several key senators remaining uncommitted. The bill's fate remains uncertain as it must also pass the House after the Senate's final vote.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials. The center, located at a remote airport, is designed to house, process, and deport up to 5,000 unauthorized immigrants. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis highlighted the site's isolation and surrounding dangerous wildlife as a deterrent against escape, stating it is an "effective way" to increase deportations. The facility's opening has drawn protests and is part of the administration's broader efforts on immigration enforcement.</p>

The threat came after Musk renewed his strong criticism of the president's major legislative spending bill, calling it "debt slavery" and an "utterly insane" package. Trump retorted on social media that Musk's businesses rely heavily on these subsidies and that the country could save a "fortune" by cutting them.

The challenge, brought by Republican campaign committees, argues that these long-standing restrictions violate First Amendment free speech rights. Democratic officials have vowed to "fight tooth and nail" to preserve the limits, warning that their removal would upend the campaign finance system and return it to a "pre-Watergate era."

The article suggests his success demonstrates that a platform of "practical socialism," including proposals like a rent freeze and a higher minimum wage, can resonate with voters. It also highlights how Mamdani's unwavering moral stance on complex issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, despite attacks, proved to be a political asset rather than a liability. His campaign's ability to mobilize volunteers and overcome massive spending from opponents suggests people-powered movements can still triumph.</p>

The policy allows foreign companies to receive a tax deduction equivalent to 10 percent of any profits they reinvest into their operations within China. This measure, which can be applied retroactively to the start of 2025, is part of a broader government strategy to signal openness and encourage capital to remain in the country.

The city of Leavenworth has sued CoreCivic, arguing the company needs a new permit to operate, leading to a legal battle.

However, the proposal faces criticism over the significant cost, estimated at over $288 million, and potential disruption to students and faculty.

          <h2>RAND Study Shows Mixed Results in Los Angeles Homelessness Efforts</h2>

          <p>A new study by the RAND Corporation found that while the number of unsheltered homeless people decreased significantly in Hollywood and Venice in 2024, the population grew in Skid Row. Overall, the report documented a 15% reduction across the three areas, but noted a concerning trend: the proportion of people "sleeping rough" without any form of shelter held steady. This suggests that while programs like Mayor Karen Bass's Inside Safe may be helping some, the most vulnerable individuals remain on the street. The study indicates that future progress will be more challenging and require new strategies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo is in a precarious situation as its 60-year partnership with its primary fundraising nonprofit, the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association (GLAZA), dissolves into a lawsuit. The dispute centers on control of a nearly $50-million endowment, which the city claims ownership of, while GLAZA asserts it is an independent charity. This "messy divorce" comes as the zoo struggles with dilapidated exhibits, declining attendance, and warnings from regulators about its facilities. The conflict leaves the zoo's future funding for major projects and renovations uncertain as it seeks new partners to handle its operations.</p>

          <p>A group of pediatricians has authored an opinion piece expressing alarm over current U.S. immigration policies, which they label "family separation 2.0." They argue that indiscriminate arrests and the expansion of family detention centers are causing significant trauma and health risks for children. The authors cite evidence that any amount of time in detention is harmful, leading to severe anxiety, depression, and developmental regression in children. They call on the government to end these practices in favor of community-based alternatives and to stop policies that create punitive barriers for sponsors of unaccompanied minors.</p>

This designation not only benefits astronomical research at the McDonald Observatory but also supports the local tourism economy and protects nocturnal wildlife.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health policy experts are raising concerns about proposed changes to Medicaid within the Republican legislative package, which could reduce federal spending by $1 trillion over a decade. A key provision would impose new work requirements on many recipients, which an analysis from UC Berkeley suggests could disproportionately harm older adults aged 50-64 who face health issues and age discrimination in the job market. Healthcare advocates also warn that the significant funding cuts risk forcing the closure of rural hospitals and community health centers that rely heavily on Medicaid revenue, potentially devastating access to care in those areas.</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have detained 157 people in the coastal city of Izmir, including members of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and the city's former mayor. The detentions are reportedly part of a corruption and fraud investigation, but the opposition claims it is a politically motivated crackdown. A CHP official described the "dawn arrests" as a "clear political choice" rather than a legal necessity, linking it to a similar operation in Istanbul that saw the arrest of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.

          <p>Inflation in the euro zone rose slightly to 2.0% in June, precisely meeting the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in an extended period.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile items, remained steady at 2.3%, while the closely watched services inflation ticked up to 3.3%. Following the data, the ECB's chief economist stated that the bank's recent cycle of interventions is likely "done," reinforcing expectations that interest rates will remain stable in the short term.

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices recorded their most significant monthly decline since February 2023, falling by 0.8% in June. This drop may reflect a weakening of demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax thresholds, which made property purchases more expensive for many. Despite the monthly fall, the annual growth rate remained positive at 2.1%, though this was the slowest pace in nearly a year. Economists suggest the market is in a temporary "soft patch" and expect activity to recover, supported by low unemployment and earnings growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has modified its controversial welfare reform bill after facing a potential rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. The changes offer greater protection for existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and the health-related element of Universal Credit, who will now be shielded from stricter eligibility criteria and have their benefits rise with inflation. However, the bill will still significantly cut payments for new claimants, creating what critics call a "two-tier" system. The government's own analysis shows the revised bill will still push an estimated 150,000 people into poverty.</p>
