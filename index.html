        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's delay in implementing tariffs on the European Union until July 9th, analysts are advising investors to brace themselves for ongoing market volatility, because the potential for trade war escalation remains. The delay provides a brief respite for trade negotiations, but significant uncertainty persists regarding the ultimate outcome. Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding suggests the delay may be insufficient to resolve all detailed questions, while Guntram Wolff from Bruegel notes the ambiguity surrounding Trump's specific demands from Europe. Naeem Aslam from Zaye Capital Markets cautions that sectors like tech and industrials should be prepared for potential disruptions to supply chains and inflationary pressures (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's office has downplayed an incident where his wife, Brigitte Macron, appeared to push his face away upon their arrival in Hanoi, Vietnam. Video footage showed Brigitte placing her hands on Emmanuel's face and pushing it, causing a startled reaction from the president. Macron's office initially denied the authenticity of the video before confirming it as genuine and a close associate described the incident as a harmless "squabble." Another member of Macron's entourage suggested it was a moment of levity before the start of a week-long Southeast Asian tour, where Macron aims to position France as an alternative to the United States and China.</p>

          <p>The article argues that while the U.S. has Memorial Day to honor fallen soldiers, there is a need for a day to remember the far greater number of civilians killed in war. The author highlights that in modern conflicts, civilians often bear the brunt of war, citing examples from World War I and II to more recent conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. The author suggests that honoring civilian deaths would acknowledge the true cost of war and promote peace. The article calls for a shift in perspective, urging recognition of war's devastating impact on non-combatants.</p>

          <p>Five years after anti-police protests swept the United States, initiatives aimed at improving the mental health of law enforcement officers are gaining traction. The killing of George Floyd in 2020 served as a catalyst, bringing the issue of officer wellness to the forefront. Departments are creating dedicated wellness units, and states are mandating and funding wellness programs for first responders. Research indicates that police officers face significantly higher rates of depression, burnout, PTSD, and substance abuse compared to the general public, with the average officer experiencing 188 traumatic events during their career.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukrainian cities, launching massive aerial bombardments as the United States appears to be stepping back from diplomatic efforts and military assistance. President Trump has criticized President Putin's actions but has not approved new military aid packages for Ukraine. Analysts suggest Russia sees an opening due to the reduced U.S. involvement, leading to increased attacks and a dire warning from a former top commander about Ukraine's future. The Kremlin has expressed gratitude to Trump for pressing negotiations, while Ukraine faces shortages of interceptor missiles and struggles to counter Russia's upgraded arsenal.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the potential for overdiagnosis in modern medicine, where advanced technologies and an eagerness to diagnose can lead to unnecessary medical labels. Dr. Suzanne O’Sullivan, author of "The Age of Diagnosis," argues that this obsession with diagnosis can create new fears and constraints for patients. She advocates for "slow medicine," where doctors and patients develop relationships, monitor symptoms, and carefully consider a diagnosis before assigning a label. The article explores the tension between utilizing new technologies and maintaining a measured approach to clinical practice.</p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is facing criticism for accepting contributions from the oil industry in his 2026 gubernatorial campaign, a departure from his previous environmentalist stance. Villaraigosa defends his position by warning of rising gas prices and advocating for an "all-of-the-above" energy approach, including oil and gas. This shift has upset some environmental groups, who accuse him of violating a pledge not to accept fossil fuel money. He argues that the economy has changed, and working-class Americans are being negatively impacted by the rising cost of living.</p>
