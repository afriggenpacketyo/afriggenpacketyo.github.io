          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck southeastern Afghanistan, injuring at least 15 people. The event occurred late Sunday near the Pakistan border and was followed by a 4.5 magnitude aftershock. This region is prone to seismic activity due to its location near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The quake brings to mind the devastating magnitude 6.3 earthquake in October 2023, which resulted in thousands of fatalities, highlighting the area's vulnerability to natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev has spoken out against a $3,000 fine he received for using profane language during his second-round match at the U.S. Open. Rublev argued that players should not be penalized for words spoken to themselves in the heat of competition, distinguishing it from directing foul language at an official or another person. He asserted that such expressions are a normal part of high-stakes sports and do not warrant financial penalties when they are self-directed.</p>

          <p>Protests in Epping, Essex, concerning the housing of asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel resulted in three arrests. Clashes occurred between demonstrators and police, who had a dispersal order in place to manage the march. The arrests were for inciting racial hatred and breaching protest orders, with police clarifying one arrest was not for flying a Union flag but for being in a restricted area. The demonstrations follow charges of sexual assault against an asylum seeker housed at the hotel, a case currently in the courts.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has announced that Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, was killed in an aerial attack on Gaza City. Israel's Defence Minister praised the operation, while Hamas has not yet confirmed the death. The strike, which local journalists report also caused civilian casualties, targeted a residential building in the al-Rimal neighborhood. Obeida was a highly visible figure in Hamas's propaganda efforts, and his death represents a significant development in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has been given a five-place grid penalty for the upcoming Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The penalty was issued because he failed to slow down sufficiently under double yellow flags before the start of the Dutch Grand Prix. This setback adds to a challenging weekend for Ferrari, where both Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc crashed out of the race in separate incidents. The penalty means Hamilton will start no higher than sixth in his first race at Monza as a Ferrari driver.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen revealed that Europe is developing "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. In an interview with the Financial Times, she stated that President Trump has reassured European leaders of an American presence as part of the support structure. The plan reportedly involves tens of thousands of European-led troops, with U.S. assistance in areas like intelligence and command systems, with further high-level discussions planned in Paris.</p>

          <p>Bishop Montgomery High School in Torrance has fired its football coach, Ed Hodgkiss, amid a growing sports scandal involving ineligible transfer students. The school was forced to forfeit a major game after five transfer players were ruled ineligible by the athletic governing body and other players were suspended. Critics suggest the Archdiocese of Los Angeles should have recognized the warning signs, drawing parallels to a similar scandal at St. Bernard High School in 2020. The situation points to a failure to learn from past incidents of schools attempting to rapidly build programs through questionable means.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The deal is expected to support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership will create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, significantly strengthening NATO's northern flank. The agreement is seen as a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the death of a baby from whooping cough, noting the infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy. This is the first fatal case in the UK this year and comes amid warnings about declining vaccine uptake for childhood diseases. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for providing passive immunity to newborns in their first weeks of life before they can receive their own jabs. The case serves as a tragic reminder of the disease's severity in very young infants.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing.

This is the 40th consecutive drawing without a jackpot winner, with the last major prize being won on May 31. The current jackpot is the largest since a $1.326 billion prize was won in Oregon in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels have stormed the offices of the UN's World Food Programme and UNICEF in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, detaining multiple employees.

The UN has condemned the detentions and the forced entry into its premises, stating its immediate priority is the safety of its staff.

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore has pushed back against President Donald Trump's recent criticisms of Baltimore, stating he is interested in "fighting for my communities," not feuding with the president. The exchange escalated after Trump called the city a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore described as "performative." While acknowledging the city's challenges with crime, Moore highlighted recent progress and called for constructive federal support rather than what he termed "arrogant criticism and cynicism" from the White House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over 13 years, a team led by The Bay Foundation has cleared over 80 acres of "urchin barrens" by smashing nearly 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins. This allowed the giant Pacific kelp, which had declined by 80%, to regrow rapidly. The restored "forgotten forest" now provides critical habitat for hundreds of species and serves as a model for marine conservation efforts globally.</p>
