          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second night of serious disorder with fireworks, bottles, and petrol bombs thrown at police. The unrest, described as racially motivated, follows a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Police responded with baton rounds and a water cannon, restoring order around 01:00 Wednesday. A 29-year-old man has been charged in connection with Monday's violence, and politicians have condemned the unrest, with some citing tensions related to migrant integration in the area.</p>

          <p>President Trump is criticized for his behavior at Fort Bragg, which is seen as undermining military traditions. He mocked political rivals and encouraged soldiers to jeer at the press and elected officials. This is seen as a violation of regulations and a departure from the values of the U.S. Army. The article questions the silence of senior military officers and calls for them to defend the integrity of the troops and uphold American traditions.</p>

          <h2>Legal Aspects of Trump's Use of the National Guard on US Soil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 20:05:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's administration has deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against deportation operations. This has raised questions about the legal basis for such deployments without the governor's consent. The Insurrection Act and Title 10 authority are examined as potential justifications, along with the limitations on the military's role in civilian law enforcement. The situation raises concerns about the use of military force on US soil and the potential for escalation.</p>
