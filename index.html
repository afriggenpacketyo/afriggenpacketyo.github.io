        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs was convicted on two counts of transporting individuals for prostitution but was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. While this outcome is a partial victory for his defense, he still faces a potential prison sentence of up to 20 years, with a hearing scheduled for October 3rd. Following the verdict, a judge denied his request for bail, ensuring he remains in custody. Beyond the criminal case, Combs confronts numerous civil lawsuits and an uncertain future for his career and business empire, as his brand may struggle with partnerships and some assets could face forfeiture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Prime Minister has announced a major 10-year plan to reform England's NHS by shifting many services out of hospitals and into local communities. The strategy involves creating approximately 200 new neighborhood health centers staffed by a mix of GPs, nurses, pharmacists, and mental health specialists, intended to be open 12 hours a day, six days a week. This move aims to make care more convenient, reduce hospital waiting lists, and better suit patient needs, with the goal of moving the majority of outpatient care to these hubs by 2035. However, nursing and medical unions have raised significant concerns about the plan's feasibility without a concrete strategy for funding and staffing the new services.</p>

          <p>House Republican leadership is struggling to secure enough votes to pass President Trump's signature domestic policy bill due to significant opposition from within their own party. Both moderate Republicans and conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus have expressed dissatisfaction with changes made to the bill by the Senate. These changes include steeper Medicaid cuts and alterations to green energy policies. With a razor-thin majority, leaders can only afford a few defections, and the White House is actively engaging with holdouts in an effort to push the legislation across the finish line before a self-imposed July 4th deadline.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Apple in China," has sparked a debate among analysts regarding the tech giant's extensive operational reliance on China. The book argues that Apple made a significant error by consolidating its production and supply chain so heavily within a single, authoritarian state. However, some experts, like Harvard Business School professor Meg Rithmire, contend that Apple likely had no better alternative. They suggest that tapping into China's immense wave of innovation and production was essential for Apple to become the global powerhouse it is today, and avoiding it would have meant missing out on a critical phase of industrial development.</p>

          <p>The punk band Bob Vylan has been dropped from music festivals in Manchester and France after their lead singer initiated chants of "death, death to the IDF" during their set at Glastonbury. The performance drew widespread condemnation, including from the UK Prime Minister, and prompted a criminal investigation by police. In response to the backlash and cancellations, the band stated they were being targeted for speaking out and clarified their stance was against a "violent military machine," not any specific race or group of people. The BBC, which broadcast the set, has expressed regret for not cutting the live stream and is facing scrutiny from the broadcast regulator Ofcom.</p>

          <p>The historic Griffith Park Pool, a Los Angeles landmark built in 1927, will not reopen after being closed since 2020 due to a severely cracked foundation that was deemed irreparable. The city has announced a $28-million plan to demolish the old structure and replace it with two new, smaller pools and a splash pad, along with a renovated pool house. The project, which is fully funded, aims to provide a modern, year-round aquatic facility for local communities that have long relied on the public pool for summer recreation. Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin in the summer of 2026, with completion expected by early 2028.</p>

          <p>The mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs's federal trial, where he was acquitted of the most serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges, is prompting analysis of its cultural implications. The trial resurfaced complex questions about consent and credibility, with the defense strategy focusing heavily on undermining the prosecution's witnesses, echoing rape myths that the Me Too movement sought to dismantle. The outcome is seen by some as a reflection of a broader societal backlash against Me Too, where the concept of a "perfect victim" persists. While the movement enabled the case to proceed, the verdict suggests its cultural and legal lessons on coercive control and victim behavior are eroding.</p>

The impact is felt more quickly on private-label goods and footwear, which rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing. The situation is further complicated by a new trade deal with Vietnam, which imposes a 20% tariff and could significantly affect companies that use Vietnam as a manufacturing hub.

This rate is lower than the 46% levy that was set to take effect next week. The deal also includes a steeper 40% tariff on products that are made in other countries, like China, and then routed through Vietnam in a process known as trans-shipping. According to the President, Vietnam has agreed to grant the U.S. full access to its markets with zero tariffs on American products. Vietnam has become a critical manufacturing center for many major international brands, particularly those that have moved operations out of China.</p>

In his post, he stated that all people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The mural, located on Lankershim Blvd., features HernÃ¡ndez's image alongside the words "Born X Raised" and "Los Angeles," paying homage to his stance on what the artist calls "standing up for what is right."</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Los Angeles must adopt a more serious and technologically advanced strategy to combat the pervasive issue of illegal fireworks. Despite being banned, their widespread use causes fires, injuries, toxic air pollution, and distress to residents, veterans, and pets. The author suggests following the example of Riverside, which uses surveillance drones to capture violations in real-time and mail citations with fines starting at $1,500. The article calls for L.A. to implement a similar system with even higher fines to create a more effective deterrent, especially with the upcoming World Cup and Olympics increasing fire risk.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between the Republican's massive tax and spending bill and Jeff Bezos's recent extravagant wedding in Venice, framing both as symbols of a new Gilded Age. The author argues the legislation represents a massive upward transfer of wealth, making permanent tax cuts that primarily benefit the rich while cutting over a trillion dollars from healthcare programs like Medicaid. This policy, the article contends, exacerbates record income inequality and could lead to thousands of preventable deaths by causing millions to lose health coverage. The piece concludes that these actions demonstrate a disregard for the needy in favor of the ultra-wealthy.</p>

          <p>India's new cricket captain, Shubman Gill, delivered a remarkably composed performance, scoring an unbeaten 114 against England in the second Test at Edgbaston. His innings was statistically the most controlled Test century recorded in England since data collection began in 2006, with a false shot percentage of just 3.5%. This level of precision surpasses that of modern greats like Joe Root, Steve Smith, and Rahul Dravid during their centuries in England. Gill's secure batting anchored his team, helping India reach a respectable score of 310-5 on the first day and defying England's early advantage after they won the toss.</p>

The proposed legislation includes $1 trillion in cuts to the healthcare program, which could cause millions to lose coverage and harm rural hospitals. One representative, Derrick Van Orden, publicly pushed back against the White House's directive, highlighting the internal party friction over the controversial bill.</p>

The electric vehicle maker is facing significant headwinds, including intensifying competition from Chinese automakers and a political backlash against CEO Elon Musk that has impacted the brand's reputation. The company's first-quarter deliveries had also seen a 13% drop compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

The motion was initiated by a right-wing Romanian MEP, Gheorghe Piperea, who cited a lack of transparency regarding text messages exchanged with Pfizer's CEO during COVID-19 vaccine negotiations. While the vote is largely symbolic and expected to fail, it highlights growing frustration within Brussels over a series of controversial decisions. For the motion to pass and force the entire Commission to resign, it would need an absolute majority of at least 361 votes in the 720-seat parliament.</p>

Judge Randolph Moss stated that declaring an "invasion" to unilaterally ban asylum is not permitted under the Constitution or existing immigration law. The ruling came in a class-action lawsuit filed by asylum seekers and immigrant rights groups. The judge has stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration to appeal, but if it holds, it would require officials to resume processing asylum claims for migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
