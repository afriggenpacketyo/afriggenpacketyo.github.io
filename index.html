          <p>Following an attack on a woman in Crown Heights by pro-Israel demonstrators, a group of pro-Palestinian protesters rallied to condemn the assault and other alleged incidents. The protesters marched towards the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters, the site of the initial confrontation, while being monitored by a heavy police presence. The police ensured the protest remained peaceful, preventing the group from reaching their destination and arresting one individual for drifting into the street. The New York Times article also notes Mayor Adams acknowledged a second woman was harassed and injured during the initial protests, further fueling the demonstrators' outrage.</p>

          <p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, reported first-quarter results that exceeded expectations, driven by robust performance in its wealth business and corporate and institutional banking segment. The bank announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion, planned for completion before the announcement of its 2025 interim results. While profit before tax declined 25% year-on-year, it soared nearly 317% from the previous quarter, with CEO Georges Elhedery citing momentum in earnings and confidence in achieving targets amidst economic uncertainty. The bank's restructuring plan, initiated last October, aims to yield $300 million in cost reductions this year.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a surprising victory in the Canadian federal election, reversing earlier projections that favored the Conservative Party. The Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader. Donald Trump's constant criticism of Canada and suggestions of annexation played a significant role in the election's outcome, allowing the Liberals to campaign against what they framed as a threat to Canadian sovereignty. Carney plans to negotiate a new economic and security relationship with the U.S. following the election.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured an unexpected victory in Canada's federal election, largely fueled by a backlash against U.S. President Trump's policies and rhetoric. Carney successfully framed the election as a fight for Canada's economic survival and sovereignty against Trump's threats of tariffs and annexation. While the Conservatives made significant gains, their focus on domestic issues was overshadowed by concerns over the U.S. relationship, leading to a Liberal win and Carney's ascension to Prime Minister. The left-wing New Democrats experienced a collapse in support, further consolidating the progressive vote around the Liberals.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a prior "withholding of removal" order protecting him from deportation due to gang persecution. Homan argued that the circumstances surrounding the withholding order had changed, claiming Abrego Garcia is now a terrorist, and the gang he feared no longer exists. This claim stems from the administration's decision to designate certain gangs, including MS-13, as terrorist organizations. The deportation has sparked controversy, with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele refusing to send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, providing automakers with more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, they will be modified to avoid "stacking" with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some tariff costs on imported components.

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox following the emergence of a video showing a band member appearing to advocate violence against Tory MPs. The group rejected any intention to incite violence and expressed regret for causing hurt to the Amess and Cox families. The Metropolitan Police are also investigating another video where a band member allegedly shouted support for Hamas and Hezbollah, organizations banned in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the comments as unacceptable and announced a halt to further government funding for Kneecap.</p>

          <p>A vigil held in Santa Ana, California, to honor cats allegedly killed by a suspected serial cat killer turned violent when attendees mistakenly targeted the wrong house. The mob, believing the house belonged to the suspect's brother, demanded that he come out, broke windows, and pepper-sprayed a resident who is related to the suspect's brother-in-law. Police arrived after more than an hour, declaring the assembly unlawful. The Santa Ana Police Department condemned the violence, stating that any damage to life or property would have consequences.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed the TAKE IT DOWN Act, a bill supported by Melania Trump that aims to implement strict penalties for those who publish and promote revenge porn. The act subjects offenders to potential prison time, fines, or both for publishing intimate visual depictions without consent or with harmful intent. Public forums will be required to incorporate a process for subjects of revenge porn to request content removal, with a 48-hour window for compliance. Melania Trump emphasized that the bipartisan passage of the act demonstrates a united front in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of children.</p>

          <p>Approximately 55,000 Los Angeles County workers initiated a two-day strike, leading to disruptions in various public services, including healthcare, social work, libraries, and parks. SEIU Local 721, the union representing the workers, cited unfair contract negotiations and alleged labor law violations as the reasons for the strike. Libraries and some healthcare clinics are closed, while hospitals remain open, and the strike is expected to affect nearly all county departments. The union is protesting what they consider an insultingly low pay offer, while county officials express concerns about the financial implications of the union's demands.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is now targeting unaccompanied minors for deportation as part of its broader immigration crackdown, conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the U.S. alone. These moves have sparked concerns about a crackdown and potential "backdoor family separation." The president has also signed executive orders targeting "sanctuary cities" that obstruct federal immigration laws. This shift marks an escalation in the administration's immigration policies, raising questions about the treatment of vulnerable children and the enforcement of immigration laws.</p>

          <p>A research team predicts that without significant efforts to combat global warming, students in Japan may be unable to participate in extracurricular outdoor sports during the summer months from the 2060s onward. Projections indicate that in the most pessimistic scenario, outdoor sporting activities would need to be avoided between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. in July and August in most areas, excluding Hokkaido. The study highlights the potential impact of climate change on daily life, necessitating a reevaluation of how future club activities are organized.</p>

Jamiel, a non-citizen, registered as a member of the Conservative Party and cast a ballot in South Glens Falls, New York. Court filings suggest that Jamiel is a Trump supporter who had previously expressed anti-immigration views in a lawsuit.

This action comes amid ongoing tensions between the administration and Harvard over diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, as well as concerns about antisemitism on campus. The Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services will examine Harvard's relationship with the Law Review, including financial ties and selection policies, to determine if they violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is revamping its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) office, renaming it the Office of Community and Campus Life, in what appears to be a response to pressure from the Trump administration.

The Trump administration also opened an investigation into the Harvard Law Review for alleged racial discrimination. Harvard's actions suggest a shift in response to the administration's scrutiny of DEI initiatives and its broader challenge to university autonomy.</p>
