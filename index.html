          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, is returning to the United States to face criminal charges. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for allegedly participating in a conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants within the U.S. The indictment alleges a decade-long scheme involving thousands of non-citizens, including some children and MS-13 members. Despite a prior court order shielding him from deportation to El Salvador, the Trump administration initially deported him, claiming he was an MS-13 member, a claim his family denies. He is now returning following diplomatic discussions, with the Justice Department pursuing the charges after a 2022 traffic stop raised suspicions. </p>

          <p>Despite their recent falling out, Donald Trump and Elon Musk remain intertwined due to their reliance on each other in several key areas, including political funding, government contracts, and personal relationships. Musk's substantial donations to Trump and other Republicans could be missed as Republicans try to maintain their congressional advantage. Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have significant government contracts, giving Trump leverage. Canceling these contracts would be a complex legal process, and the US government is likely to continue doing business with Musk's companies. </p>

          <p>The Scottish National Party (SNP) is vowing to learn lessons after Labour's victory in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election. Labour's Davy Russell won with 8,559 votes, a majority of 602 over the SNP. The vote followed the death of SNP MSP Christina McKelvie. Scottish Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson said the SNP would need to look closely at the result and learn lessons for the Holyrood elections. Reform UK finished third, knocking the Conservatives into fourth place. </p>

          <p>An escaped zebra named Ed has been spotted in Tennessee nearly a week after escaping its owners. Rutherford County sheriff's deputies are tracking the animal with a drone near Christiana. The zebra was originally brought to the property of Taylor and Laura Ford, who initially named it Zeke but later changed it to Ed due to public interest. Animal advocacy groups have criticized the situation, stating that zebras are wild animals and do not belong in backyards. </p>

          <p>Steve Bannon has called for the Trump administration to investigate Elon Musk following their public feud. Bannon wants the White House to probe alleged drug use by Musk, as well as his immigration status and involvement with China. He questioned whether Musk's path to citizenship was handled properly. Bannon has criticized Musk for years, claiming he is "owned by the Chinese Communist Party." The comments came after Musk criticized Republicans' tax and budget bill, leading to a public exchange of insults with Trump. </p>
