          <p>A skydiving plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring all 15 people on board. Officials noted that despite some severe injuries and the aircraft being covered in jet fuel, it was remarkable there were no fatalities. The pilot had reported engine trouble before attempting to return to the airport, and an investigation is underway. The same aircraft was involved in a previous landing incident in 2023.</p>

          <p>A major legislative proposal backed by President Trump, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is facing hurdles in the House. The bill aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent and add new ones, totaling $4.5 trillion, while also increasing defense and border security funding. These changes would be offset by $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO estimates could cause 12 million people to lose health insurance and would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt.

          <p>A federal jury in New York acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transporting individuals across state lines for prostitution, which falls under the Mann Act. The verdict concluded a high-profile trial that featured graphic testimony from former girlfriends about a culture of abuse and coercion. Combs, who had been detained since his arrest, now faces a maximum sentence of 10 years for each conviction, with sentencing scheduled for October.</p>

          <p>With razor-thin margins in the U.S. House of Representatives, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become more prominent. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed. This was illustrated in a 2024 vote on impeaching a cabinet secretary, where a procedural move was used to allow the bill to be reconsidered later rather than letting it fail on a tie.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic resurgence, with fundraising volumes reaching their highest first-half level since 2021. The boom is driven by a wave of mainland Chinese companies seeking to list in the city, spurred by supportive policies from Beijing and a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges. New listing volumes jumped to $14 billion in the first half of the year, a massive increase from the same period in 2024. This trend is positioning Hong Kong to potentially become the world's top IPO destination this year. (not investment advice)</p>

While Combs was convicted on two lesser charges, his acquittal on racketeering and sexual trafficking has raised concerns that it will deter future prosecutions of powerful individuals. The reaction places the verdict in the context of the MeToo movement and the recent comebacks of other artists accused of abuse.

Political experts suggest the trend is driven by economic populism, with working-class Latino voters feeling failed by both parties and prioritizing economic concerns over cultural issues.
