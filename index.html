          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his place among the sport's legends. Despite having the overall victory virtually guaranteed, Pogačar characteristically launched an attack on the final stage in Paris, even amid treacherous rainy conditions. Although he didn't win the stage itself, his aggressive style was a hallmark of his dominant performance throughout the three-week race. Pogačar finished more than four minutes ahead of his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard, capping a season where he also became the first rider since 1998 to win both the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France.

          <p>Japanese baseball icon Ichiro Suzuki, alongside dominant pitcher CC Sabathia and closer Billy Wagner, were officially inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Suzuki, the first Japanese player to be enshrined, fell just one vote short of a unanimous selection, a fact he humorously referenced in his speech. The ceremony celebrated the careers of these influential players, with Sabathia reflecting on his journey to becoming a New York Yankee and Wagner expressing gratitude for his election on his final ballot. The induction coincided with a new Hall of Fame exhibit celebrating the deep connection between Japanese and American baseball.</p>

          <h2>Caribbean Nations See Surge in Demand for Citizenship-by-Investment Programs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several Eastern Caribbean island nations are experiencing a significant increase in applications for their citizenship-by-investment programs, largely driven by wealthy Americans seeking a "plan B" amid domestic political and social volatility. Countries like Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Dominica offer a passport, and the associated visa-free travel, in exchange for real estate purchases or donations starting around $200,000. While these programs are a crucial source of revenue for the small island economies, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over concerns about security and financial crime, prompting the nations to bolster their oversight and due diligence processes.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade deal, averting a potential trade war. The agreement establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the US, a rate higher than pre-Trump levels but lower than the threatened 30%. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars in US energy products and investing heavily in the American economy. While European leaders expressed relief at the newfound stability, some details, particularly concerning pharmaceuticals and steel tariffs, remained points of discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for stricter regulation of dog rescue organizations amid growing concerns over pets being imported into the UK with serious health and behavioral issues. The charity warns that a "Deliveroo for dogs" model, often operating through social media, is placing animals from countries like Romania and Ukraine in homes without proper assessment. This has led to an increase in diseases not commonly found in the UK, such as Brucella canis, and has left some new owners struggling with aggressive or traumatized animals. Experts are urging for a licensing system for all rescues to ensure public safety and the welfare of the dogs.</p>

The system significantly underestimated the quake's magnitude, sending out a low-level "Be Aware" notification to most users instead of the life-saving, high-level "Take Action" alarm that could have provided up to 35 seconds of warning. According to a new report, only 469 of the most critical alerts were sent when 10 million should have been issued.

ICE has lodged a detainer against Martinez-Avila, who had a prior drunk driving conviction.

The suspect allegedly used a folding knife to randomly attack 11 people, including shoppers and an employee, before being confronted by armed citizens in the parking lot and arrested by police. All victims, ranging in age from 21 to 84, are expected to survive their injuries. Authorities stated that while a motive is still under investigation, the terrorism charge is appropriate because the mass, random nature of the attack was intended to instill fear in the community.</p>

          <p>Sarina Wiegman's leadership is being credited as the central force behind England's back-to-back European championships, a run that has seen her reach five consecutive major tournament finals. Known for her calm demeanor, tactical acumen, and ability to foster a resilient team culture, Wiegman has transformed the Lionesses into serial winners. Her methods include direct but fair communication, a deep understanding of player psychology, and a ruthless desire to win, often relying on key substitutes she calls 'finishers' to change games. This latest triumph solidifies her status as one of the most successful and influential managers in the history of international football.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Johns Hopkins University professor Yuen Yuen Ang discusses China's current economic and political challenges, which she terms a "polycrisis." However, she also suggests that this complex set of problems could be transformed into a "polytunity" if handled correctly. Ang, an influential scholar on China, reflects on the history of US-China relations, noting the deep investment past American leaders made in understanding China. She contrasts that with the current decline in expertise, which she sees as a significant issue. Her work explores how China can adapt and navigate its trajectory in an increasingly fragmented and unpredictable global landscape.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" has launched with a strong opening weekend, earning an estimated $118 million at the North American box office. This debut marks the fourth-largest opening of the year and represents a significant success for Marvel Studios, which has been seeking to reinvigorate its superhero lineup. The film, which also grossed $100 million internationally for a global total of $218 million, appears to have successfully rebooted the franchise after previous versions underperformed. The strong performance suggests that audience appetite for well-made superhero films remains high, pushing back against notions of "superhero fatigue."</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area has a prime opportunity to become a global model for low-carbon, sustainable tourism. Policymakers are already implementing smart infrastructure and climate innovations, creating a foundation for a green travel corridor connecting its cities. The piece points to Hong Kong's new electric ferries and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transit system as key first steps. To fully realize this vision, the author contends that the region must move beyond just hardware, developing integrated systems, partnerships, and travel experiences that cater to the growing demand for environmentally conscious tourism.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with US President Donald Trump in Scotland, with discussions expected to focus on transatlantic trade and the ongoing crisis in Gaza. Starmer is likely to press for further reductions in US tariffs on UK goods, building on a recent trade agreement. On the topic of Gaza, the Prime Minister will navigate a delicate diplomatic position, balancing the UK's alignment with European allies, who are increasingly critical of Israel, and the staunchly pro-Israel stance of the US administration. The meeting underscores the complex foreign policy challenges facing the UK in managing its key alliances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new trade agreement between the US and the European Union can be framed as a victory for both parties, though the specifics reveal a complex picture. For the EU, the 15% tariff is a better outcome than the threatened 30%, while the US secures significant investment commitments and tariff revenue. The deal, brokered personally by the leaders, highlights President Trump's strategy of renegotiating global trade relationships. However, questions remain about the long-term benefits for the EU and the precise implementation of the massive investment figures promised by the bloc. (not investment advice)</p>
