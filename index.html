          <p>David Richardson, acting director of FEMA, reportedly joked during an all-hands meeting that he was unaware hurricane season had begun, which runs from June 1 to November 30. A DHS spokesperson stated that Richardson was joking and that FEMA is focused on disaster response and protecting Americans. Sources indicate that Richardson is sticking with the existing plan and not interfering with the FEMA advisory council, established by President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. This incident raises questions about the agency's leadership's preparedness, even if it was intended as a joke, during a critical time of year. </p>

However, Laos still faces challenges with inflation and public debt, with nearly 17% of families living in poverty as of 2023.

          <p>President Trump's Justice Department is reviewing pardons granted by former President Biden, citing concerns over Biden's mental state and use of an AutoPen to sign documents. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin is examining Biden-era pardons, including preemptive pardons for Hunter Biden and sentence commutations for over 35 death row inmates. Critics had previously questioned Biden's clemency decisions, noting that some pardoned individuals were convicted of defrauding taxpayers.

          <p>The OECD forecasts that President Trump's tariffs will negatively impact global economic growth, reducing it to 2.9% from a previous forecast of 3.1%. The report cites a significant rise in trade barriers and warns that weakened economic prospects will be felt worldwide. The OECD also slashed the outlook for the US economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and predicted growth would slow again in 2026. The group trimmed its expectations for UK growth as well, attributing it to heightened trade tensions and elevated uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's largest and most active volcano, is a stratovolcano located on the island of Sicily, Italy, rising 3,357 meters above Catania. It has been continuously erupting for over 500,000 years, with frequent Strombolian activity and both terminal and lateral eruptions. While posing a threat to nearby populations through debris, dust, and lava flows, Etna's volcanic soil also supports agriculture and diverse ecosystems. Research indicates that the eastern flank of Mount Etna is slowly sliding towards the Ionian Sea, potentially triggering landslides and tsunamis.</p>

Critics argue that the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) is using outdated data to justify the hunt and falsely claiming it is necessary for conservation.

          <p>Male beauty standards are shifting towards hypermasculinity, influenced by manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces, with trends like eyelash-shaving and tongue exercises. This evolution emphasizes being masculine for its own sake rather than attracting women, often accompanied by misogynistic undertones. The pursuit of these standards can lead to body dysmorphia, with some men prioritizing muscle-building to impress other men. The shift mirrors the feminist movement's efforts to help women create relationships with their bodies independent of male approval.</p>

          <p>A United Nations aid convoy en route to North Darfur was attacked in el-Koma, resulting in multiple casualties and hindering the delivery of essential supplies. The Sudanese government blamed the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for the assault, while the RSF accused the army. El-Fasher, the last major location in North Darfur under army control, has been under attack by the RSF for over a year, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The ongoing conflict has displaced over four million people, creating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge has been classified as an England and Wales project, sparking anger in Wales as no tracks will be laid in Wales. Critics argue this classification denies Wales extra cash under the Barnett Formula, which would have been the case if it was classified as an England-only project. The UK government maintains that its rail network enhancements pipeline funds projects in Wales, but Welsh officials are calling for a fix to the funding system to ensure fair allocation.</p>

          <p>The challenge of feeding a growing population while minimizing agriculture's environmental impact requires innovative solutions. Achieving climate goals necessitates addressing the "land problem" by increasing food production on less land. This involves adopting new crops, foods, policies, and behaviors, as well as embracing technological advancements in agriculture. While the fossil-fuel problem is now mostly political, the eating-the-Earth problem is still analytical, requiring further research and development to find sustainable solutions.</p>

          <p>Millennials are entering their 40s facing a redefined midlife crisis, characterized by a progress report rather than the traditional trope of abandoning family for a sports car. Unlike previous generations, millennials often lack the stability to throw away, and instead seek opportunities for personal growth and reinvention. Factors such as economic instability and societal pressures contribute to this unique experience, as millennials grapple with career reevaluations and evolving personal identities.

          <p>Germany's Constitutional Court rejected a challenge to the results of February's parliamentary elections brought by the populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW). The BSW narrowly missed the 5% threshold required for representation in the Bundestag, arguing that its placement on election ballots and the failure to carry out a recount violated its right to equal opportunity. The court rejected the arguments, stating that the applicant had not sufficiently substantiated the possibility of a violation of its right to equal opportunities.
