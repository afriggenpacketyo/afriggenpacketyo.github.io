            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart that killed 23 people, is expected to accept a plea deal in state court to avoid the death penalty. Crusius has admitted to targeting Hispanics in the attack, which is one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. Under the proposed deal, Crusius would plead guilty to capital murder and receive life in prison without parole. Texas prosecutors declined to pursue the death penalty at the request of a majority of the victims' families. Optimism score: 10</p>

            <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to exchange Venezuelan deportees from the U.S. for "political prisoners" held by the Maduro government. Bukele directed his proposal to President Nicolás Maduro, listing family members of opposition figures, journalists, and activists detained in Venezuela. He offered to repatriate 252 Venezuelans in exchange for the release of an equal number of political prisoners. Venezuela's prosecutor's office responded critically, calling Bukele's statements "cynical" and demanding information on the detained Venezuelans. Optimism score: 30</p>

The Emergency Housing Vouchers program, launched in 2021, is expected to run out of funds by the end of next year due to rising rent costs. This could result in a large-scale loss of rental assistance, leading to evictions and a return to homelessness or abusive situations for many. Congress could decide to add more money to the program, but the prospect is uncertain amid Republican efforts to cut federal spending. Optimism score: 20</p>

            <p>Rookie Ingrid Lindblad won the LPGA's JM Eagle LA Championship at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana, securing her first LPGA victory in her third career tour start. Lindblad converted six birdies and weathered the field, but Akie Iwai missed a 13-foot putt on the 18th hole that would have forced a playoff. Lindblad outpaced attempts to cut into her lead from top-ranked women's golfers. With the Chevron Championship coming next week, Lindblad said it may be time to reassess her rookie-season goals. Optimism score: 80</p>
            <p>80/100</p>
