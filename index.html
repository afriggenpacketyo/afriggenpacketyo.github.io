          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate has concluded with an agreement that solidifies his son Lachlan's control over Fox Corp and News Corp. The deal resolves all litigation among the Murdoch siblings by establishing a new trust controlled by Lachlan, while his more politically moderate siblings will sell their holdings. This arrangement ensures the continuation of a conservative editorial direction for outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal after the 94-year-old patriarch's eventual passing, ending a real-life saga that mirrored the drama of a television series.</p>

          <p>For the first time, England's National Health Service has published performance rankings for its hospital trusts, with specialized institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The new system evaluates trusts on seven key metrics, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial management, sorting them into four performance categories. While the Health Secretary stated the tables will help identify where support is needed, some trusts have raised concerns about the fairness of the metrics used and the potential for unintended consequences on patient care and confidence.</p>

          <p>According to HSBC's co-CEO, multinational companies are increasingly directing their investments in China toward high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and other innovative sectors. This strategic shift indicates that global firms view China not just as a manufacturing base but as a crucial market for driving global innovation and consumption. A recent HSBC survey further revealed that China remains the top target for companies seeking to expand their global trade capabilities, drawn by its large market size, comprehensive industrial infrastructure, and dynamic ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has introduced new uncertainty into the already tense relationship between Tokyo and Beijing. While China's foreign ministry has refrained from commenting on what it considers an internal Japanese affair, analysts widely expect that Japan's next leader will maintain a hardline stance. The consensus is that Tokyo will continue to perceive Beijing as a primary strategic competitor, suggesting that diplomatic pressures are likely to persist regardless of who takes office.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that populist right-wing movements in both the United States and the United Kingdom are actively trying to reshape historical narratives to justify their political goals. It cites the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" museum exhibits and Reform UK's call for a more "patriotic" curriculum as examples of attempts to erase histories of racial injustice and imperialism. The author argues that this revisionism is a deliberate strategy to dismantle democratic protections and erode rights for vulnerable communities by creating a narrowed, nationalistic version of the past.</p>

          <p>A former head of security at WhatsApp has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against parent company Meta, alleging that the messaging service has "systemic cybersecurity failures" that could compromise user privacy. The suit claims that thousands of engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data without adequate monitoring and that the company retaliated against the employee for raising these concerns internally and to regulators. Meta has disputed the allegations, stating the former employee was dismissed for poor performance and that his claims are distorted.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has begun the process of electing a new deputy leader following the resignation of Angela Rayner, a contest that is being closely watched as an indicator of the party's ideological direction. With nominations now open, the election is expected to reveal the balance of power between the party's moderate and left-wing factions under Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. The outcome will shape Labour's internal dynamics and signal which wing of the party holds greater influence as the new government establishes its agenda.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has expressed serious concern that the country might be forced to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, similar to the 1976 sterling crisis. She argued that without a credible plan for economic growth, the UK risks entering a "doom loop" of rising taxes and unstable public finances. Badenoch offered to work with the Labour government on cutting welfare spending to avert such a crisis, an offer a Labour source dismissed as astonishing given the Conservatives' own economic record.

          <p>Americans are beginning to see the direct impact of the Trump administration's tariffs after an executive order ended the "de minimis" rule, which had exempted shipments under $800 from import taxes. Consumers are now facing surprise bills for tariffs and processing fees on small online orders from international retailers, sometimes adding over 50% to the original cost. The new expenses are also severely impacting small businesses, both in the U.S. and abroad, who are seeing sales plummet as a result of the added costs.</p>

This pattern is seen as a high-profile, symbolic gesture that allows nations to demonstrate a commitment to reducing their trade surpluses with the United States. While these deals provide a visible win for an iconic American company, they are also pragmatic for many nations, as a growing global tourism industry means the passenger aircraft are genuinely needed by international airlines.</p>
