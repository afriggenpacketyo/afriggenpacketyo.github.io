        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations is set to reimpose economic and military sanctions on Iran, a decade after they were lifted following a landmark nuclear deal. This action comes after the UK, France, and Germany accused Iran of failing to meet its commitments, triggering a 30-day diplomatic window that has now closed. Iran's President Pezeshkian condemned the sanctions as "unfair, unjust, and illegal," insisting his country would not build a nuclear bomb but demanding assurances against Israeli attacks on its facilities. The move follows Iran's increased nuclear activity after the US withdrew from the deal in 2016 and subsequent bombings of Iranian sites.</p>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between top-ranked England and second-ranked Canada transcends a mere contest for silverware, symbolizing a clash between vastly different funding models. England, with 32 fully professional players and substantial investment, represents the pinnacle of professional women's rugby. In stark contrast, Canada's team relies on a fraction of England's budget, supplementing their limited national funding with crowdfunding efforts. Despite this financial disparity, Canada has achieved remarkable on-field success, prompting questions about the optimal path for developing women's Test rugby globally and the true measure of investment return.</p>

Hooker Amy Cokayne, an RAF police officer, and veteran Marlie Packer, a former plumber, exemplify the dedication required before full-time contracts were introduced. Packer, who took unpaid leave for the 2014 World Cup, now enjoys a fully professional career, a testament to the sport's growth. Other players like Lark Atkin-Davies (teacher) and Hannah Botterman (painter/decorator) also illustrate the significant shift in support for women's rugby, enabling them to pursue their athletic dreams full-time.</p>

          <p>President Trump is accelerating his promised retribution against political opponents and critics, significantly expanding presidential authority. This includes encouraging his attorney general to prosecute specific adversaries, targeting media licenses, and investigating wealthy individuals funding "agitators." The recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, following Trump's public demands, illustrates this trend. Critics warn of a shift towards authoritarianism, while Trump and his supporters argue these actions are necessary to counter a "deep state" and alleged bias, citing prior actions against him as justification.</p>

          <p>A new peace movement is gaining momentum in Germany, with thousands protesting in Berlin against the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. Led by politician Sahra Wagenknecht, the diverse group calls for active support for peace negotiations and an end to arms deliveries, condemning Hamas's actions but arguing against the indiscriminate bombing of Gaza. While critics question Wagenknecht's stance, the movement seeks a unified message. The debate over compulsory military service is also mobilizing young people, with an online petition reflecting a potential shift in Germany's traditionally pacifist stance, yet facing internal fragmentation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to continue freezing over $4 billion in foreign aid, despite Congressional approval. The conservative-majority court deemed that potential harm to Trump's foreign affairs conduct outweighed risks to aid recipients, clarifying this is not a final ruling. Liberal Justices dissented, with Kagan arguing the decision undermines Congress's constitutional "power of the purse" and the separation of powers. This article highlights a significant policy victory for the Trump administration's efforts to downsize foreign aid, drawing warnings from humanitarian groups about severe global impacts.
