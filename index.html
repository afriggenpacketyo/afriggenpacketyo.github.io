          <p>The Trump administration is currently withholding $715 million in federal grant funds designated for adult education programs across the United States. This decision has thrown programs that serve over a million students annually into a state of uncertainty. Program administrators and students are now scrambling for information and solutions as they face a significant funding crisis. The lack of funds jeopardizes essential services for adult learners nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits, but instead introduces a new temporary deduction. This deduction, which applies to all income for seniors over 65 below certain income thresholds, will lower their overall tax burden. However, policy experts note this is not a full repeal of the tax on benefits and primarily benefits higher-income seniors, while potentially adding to Social Security's financial strain. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first-ever EU-Moldova summit was held in Chisinau, with European Union leaders reaffirming their commitment to Moldova's integration into the bloc. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised Moldova's progress and pledged to protect it from Russian "hybrid attacks" and disinformation. Moldovan President Maia Sandu hailed the summit as a clear message that her country's accession is underway and no longer a distant dream. The talks also focused on providing financial support and bolstering Moldova's resilience as it navigates its path toward EU membership.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows reports and opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned the project would harm the many seabird species that nest on the atoll. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in approximately 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the military logistics program.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly threatened to impose new 17% tariffs on food and farm exports from the European Union. The warning was delivered to the EU's trade commissioner during recent talks in Washington and would impact a wide range of popular products like chocolate, butter, and olive oil. This move is part of an aggressive negotiating stance as the administration pushes for new trade deals with numerous countries under a self-imposed deadline. The EU has stated it prefers a negotiated solution but is prepared to issue retaliatory tariffs if a trade war ensues. (not investment advice)</p>

Activists report that hostile rhetoric from government officials, who describe the community as a threat to family values, has intensified.

President Bukele responded on social media with photos and videos, claiming Abrego Garcia appeared well and was not tortured.

However, Corbyn's own statement suggested that while discussions are ongoing, the "democratic foundations" of a new party are still being formed. The potential new party aims to capture a space to the left of Keir Starmer's Labour, and polling suggests it could attract up to 10% of the vote, primarily from young voters and the Green Party.
