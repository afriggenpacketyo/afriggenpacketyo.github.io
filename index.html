            <p>Canada's four major federal party leaders engaged in their second and final debate, addressing key issues such as the ongoing trade war with the US, affordability, crime, and the environment. Liberal leader Mark Carney, facing scrutiny as the new prime minister, defended his policies against attacks from Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who criticized the "lost Liberal decade." The leaders debated strategies for negotiating with US President Donald Trump regarding tariffs, with Carney advocating for targeted tariffs to minimize harm to Canada. Smaller parties, including the New Democrats and Bloc Québécois, fought for air time amidst polls suggesting a Conservative-Liberal dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing a new rule to reclassify some career civil servants as "at-will" employees, making it easier to fire them for poor performance or subversion of presidential directives. This rule, formerly known as "Schedule F," empowers federal agencies to swiftly remove employees in policy-influencing roles without lengthy procedural hurdles. The Office of Personnel Management estimates that around 50,000 positions will be changed to the new status, granting the administration greater control over the federal workforce.</p>
