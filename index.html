          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale was forced to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers, Florida, after a passenger's portable battery pack caught fire mid-flight. The cabin crew successfully extinguished the flames, but the plane was diverted due to residual smoke as a precautionary measure. All 185 passengers and six crew members landed safely without injury. The incident is now under investigation by the FAA, which notes a significant increase in lithium battery-related events on flights in recent years.</p>

          <p>Roman Starovoy, Russia's former Minister of Transport, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound just hours after being fired by President Vladimir Putin. The dismissal followed significant air traffic disruptions in Russia caused by Ukrainian drone attacks. Shortly after Starovoy's death, another senior transport ministry official, Andrei Korneichuk, also died suddenly from a reported cardiac arrest during a meeting. These incidents add to a series of sudden deaths among high-profile Russian officials and business leaders.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic turn of events at Wimbledon, Grigor Dimitrov was forced to retire from his fourth-round match against world number one Jannik Sinner due to a sudden injury. The Bulgarian player was leading the match by two sets when he collapsed after serving an ace, clutching his right pectoral muscle in apparent pain. After receiving medical attention, a visibly emotional Dimitrov was unable to continue and conceded the match. He received a standing ovation from the Centre Court crowd as he left in tears.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value fell by nearly 7%, erasing over $68 billion in market capitalization, after CEO Elon Musk announced his intention to form a new political party called the "America Party." The move has reportedly made investors nervous, as they prefer Musk to focus on the company's operations rather than engaging in political activities. This renewed political involvement follows a previous stint working with the Trump administration, which was also seen as a potential risk to the Tesla brand by some market analysts.

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant downturn after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on seven countries and indicated more could follow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 422 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also saw notable declines, interrupting a recent market rally. The new 25% tariffs on South Korea and Japan, effective August 1, were followed by announcements of additional levies on five other nations. Trump also threatened a 10% tariff on countries aligning with the BRICS economic bloc, signaling a continued reliance on trade levies as a policy instrument. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tax experts are clarifying that President Trump's recently passed tax and spending package does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security for most beneficiaries, contrary to some descriptions. The legislation introduces a new $6,000 deduction for seniors, which reduces taxable income but does not directly remove the tax on benefits for the majority. While this change will lower the tax liability for many middle-income seniors, it will not affect those with incomes too low to be taxed or too high to qualify for the deduction. Critics also note the changes may accelerate the Social Security trust fund's insolvency date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in central Texas, which have killed at least 90 people, resulted from a convergence of severe weather and regional vulnerabilities. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry combined with another moisture band, dumping several months' worth of rain in just a few hours over an area known as "flash flood alley." While forecast models anticipated major rainfall, gaps in the local warning systems and communication challenges, particularly overnight, may have contributed to the high death toll.

          <p>Advocates are expressing concern that the Trump administration's planned overhaul of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program could be used as a tool for political retribution. A draft proposal from the Education Department would strip eligibility from organizations involved in vaguely defined "illegal activities," including those providing services to immigrants or transgender youth. Critics fear this could give the education secretary subjective power to disqualify entire hospital systems, city governments, or universities from the program, potentially blocking huge numbers of public service workers from receiving promised loan cancellation.</p>

          <p>A new round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza, has ended without any conclusive progress. The talks, mediated by Qatar and Egypt in Doha, reportedly stalled as the Israeli delegation was not seen as having sufficient authority to finalize an agreement. Meanwhile, the BRICS group of nations expressed grave concern over the conflict and called for an immediate ceasefire. U.S. President Trump is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the proposed deal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge sharply criticized the Department of Justice for its changing positions regarding the deportation of Kilmar Abrego, a case that has reached the Supreme Court. The judge expressed "real concerns" after DOJ attorneys provided conflicting timelines about when their investigation into Abrego began, which is central to his illegal deportation to El Salvador. The court is considering whether to order the administration to return Abrego to Maryland, his home before he was deported in violation of a 2019 court order protecting him from persecution.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of pterosaur, a flying reptile from the age of dinosaurs, based on a 209-million-year-old jawbone found in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park. The creature, named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, is now believed to be the earliest pterosaur ever discovered in North America. Advanced scanning of the fossil revealed unique details, and analysis of its teeth suggests the seagull-sized reptile fed on hard-shelled prey like primitive, armored fish. The discovery provides a valuable snapshot of the ecosystem during the late Triassic period.</p>

          <p>California has made significant progress toward its "30x30" goal of conserving 30% of its land and coastal waters by 2030, now standing at 26.1% and 21.9% respectively. Recent gains were largely driven by the federal designation of two new national monuments and the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. However, state officials express concern that progress could be reversed by the Trump administration, which has signaled it may rescind the new monument designations and has terminated the national version of the 30x30 initiative, highlighting a growing conflict over land use policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has again delayed a broad implementation of tariff hikes but simultaneously announced new, steep levies on goods from at least seven countries, including Japan, South Korea, and South Africa, effective August 1. The president extended a 90-day pause on his "reciprocal tariffs" but sent letters to world leaders detailing new rates of up to 40%. The move creates further uncertainty for global trade and prompted a downturn on Wall Street. Trump also threatened an additional 10% tariff on countries aligning with the BRICS nations, which recently criticized his unilateral trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 76,000 immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, effective in early September. This move will revoke the work permits and deportation protections for individuals who have lived in the U.S. for decades, many since Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America in 1999. The Department of Homeland Security argued that conditions in both countries have improved enough to no longer warrant the protection. This action is part of a broader effort to curtail humanitarian immigration programs ahead of a planned mass deportation campaign.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly flash floods in Texas, this article provides historical context by examining some of the worst flooding events in U.S. history. The deadliest was the 1889 Johnstown Flood in Pennsylvania, caused by a dam failure that killed over 2,200 people. Other catastrophic events include Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which claimed 1,833 lives after New Orleans' levee system failed, and the Great Flood of 1913 in the Midwest. These historical disasters highlight the immense destructive power of floods, whether caused by hurricanes, dam failures, or extreme rainfall.</p>

Health officials report that 92% of cases were among individuals who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.

The strikes were part of a broader operation against Houthi targets in response to repeated missile attacks on Israel and shipping in the Red Sea.

          <p>In the aftermath of the Texas floods that killed at least 95 people, questions are being raised about the adequacy of emergency warnings and the potential impact of federal staffing cuts. While local officials claimed the rainfall exceeded forecasts, meteorologists have defended the National Weather Service's performance, noting that warnings escalated as the situation intensified. The debate has also highlighted concerns about staffing levels at local NWS offices and the suspension of some federal programs designed to coordinate between meteorologists and local emergency managers, which critics argue could have improved the response.</p>
