          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, aligning with economists' expectations and down from a recent high. This marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, driven in part by previously soaring rice prices that are now beginning to ease. Despite the cooling, concerns persist over economic growth due to potential U.S. tariffs, which will likely influence the central bank's future decisions on interest rates.

          <p>Regulators in the United Kingdom are set to introduce new rules requiring stricter affordability checks for shoppers using buy now, pay later (BNPL) services, effective next July. This move aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt, as the currently unregulated sector has seen rapid growth, particularly among younger adults. While the new measures will likely prevent some shoppers from accessing this form of credit, they will also provide greater consumer protections, including clearer terms and access to the Financial Ombudsman. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:10:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has announced a new directive to end what it calls "regulatory favoritism" for wind and solar energy projects on public lands. The policy will add layers of senior-level oversight for renewable project approvals, aiming to level the playing field for traditional energy sources like coal and natural gas. This action aligns with a recent executive order to halt subsidies for what the administration terms unreliable, foreign-dependent energy, shifting focus toward achieving energy dominance through domestic fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>The House is moving forward with a vote on a legislative package requested by President Trump to rescind approximately $9 billion in government funding. The bill, which faces a critical deadline, targets about $8 billion in foreign assistance programs and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The process has been complicated by political maneuvering, but Republican leaders are pushing to pass the cuts before the funds must be spent as originally appropriated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block the termination of a key FEMA disaster preparedness program. The suit alleges that the administration acted illegally by unilaterally shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which provides federal funds for projects to mitigate the impact of natural disasters. The states argue that this decision violates the separation of powers and jeopardizes critical, long-planned infrastructure projects across the country.</p>

          <p>The Florida Supreme Court has upheld a controversial congressional map that was challenged for diminishing the influence of Black voters. The map, pushed by Governor Ron DeSantis, dismantled a North Florida district where Black voters had consistently elected their candidate of choice.

          <p>This article analyzes the U.S. Supreme Court's increased reliance on its emergency "shadow docket," a mechanism for issuing rulings without full hearings or detailed explanations. This trend has been particularly prominent in cases involving the Trump administration, allowing major policies on issues like immigration and federal agency powers to proceed while legal challenges are still pending. Legal experts express growing concern that this lack of transparency is damaging the court's legitimacy and public trust in the judicial process.</p>
