        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece in The Guardian argues that the marketing industry's embrace of 'woke' ideologies has inadvertently contributed to the rise of the far right. By commodifying progressive values and presenting them as tools for selling products, brands have trivialized activism and created a backlash. The author suggests that consumers have grown cynical of corporations that promote social justice while simultaneously contributing to economic inequality. The piece calls on marketers to recognize their role in this phenomenon and to prioritize authentic acts of resistance over superficial marketing campaigns. Optimism score is 40 because it is critical of current trends and highlights potential negative consequences.</p>

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio is defending the US response to the Myanmar earthquake, dismissing accusations that cuts to USAID hindered rescue efforts. Rubio stated that the US has to balance global humanitarian work with its own national interests and that other wealthy countries should also contribute. He blamed the military regime in Myanmar for limited access, despite the state department's claim of a formal request for assistance. Rubio also criticized NGOs that receive US taxpayer money.
