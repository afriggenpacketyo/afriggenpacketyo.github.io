          <p>A shooting at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulted in one person injured and the death of the alleged gunman. Police Chief Ryan Strong reported that the suspect, a 31-year-old man, arrived at the church and began firing at the building with a long gun and handgun. A parishioner struck the suspect with a vehicle, and two staff members shot at him, killing him; one staff member, a security guard, was shot in the leg but is expected to recover. The FBI is assisting with the investigation to determine the motive behind the shooting, and Pastor Bobby Kelly Jr. noted the parishioners were grateful the situation wasn't worse. </p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan faces its first period without giant pandas in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. relations strained, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize ties with Tokyo, as these animals have historically symbolized friendship and brought economic benefits to Japan. However, some experts doubt the diplomatic weight of this gesture, especially considering ongoing tensions over historical and territorial issues. China has long used pandas as a tool of diplomatic outreach, signaling goodwill to various nations, but it remains uncertain whether this will significantly impact Japanese diplomatic posture or public opinion.</p>

The U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and Special Envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, condemned the act, and the attack comes amid heightened political unrest in the Middle East.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda suggests parents avoid phrases that trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, such as "Because I said so" or "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]." Instead, she recommends using language that respects a child's autonomy and promotes cooperation, such as explaining reasons for decisions or framing requests as choices. By fostering emotional safety and involvement, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children. The key is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural, shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership.</p>

          <h2>Strait of Hormuz Vulnerable to Iran Retaliation</h2>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. This strait is a vital oil trade route, connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. In 2024, over a quarter of global maritime oil trade flowed through the Strait of Hormuz, and any disruption could upset international energy markets. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that blocking the strait would be a "suicidal move" for Iran, potentially drawing backlash from powerful countries.</p>

          <p>Following America's attacks on Iran, the British government is making it known that while it was informed in advance, it did not participate and was not asked to. The UK has repeatedly pressed for "de-escalation," and questions have been raised within the government about the legality of getting involved. Washington's decision to act alone meant that Prime Minister Starmer did not need to make a difficult decision on whether to authorize US warplanes to use the UK military base on Diego Garcia. Depending on Iran's retaliation, these trade-offs could soon return.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. China is Iran's most important oil customer and maintains friendly relations with the Islamic Republic, and Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the Strait for its oil imports. Iran's foreign minister warned of defending its sovereignty after U.S. strikes, and Iranian state media reported parliamentary support for closing the Strait. Such a move could have significant consequences for the global economy, given the large volume of oil that passes through the waterway daily.</p>

This follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire offering ketamine-assisted therapy, which combines ketamine infusions with psychotherapy. While ketamine is unlicensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors, and it's been used recreationally for its effects. The Royal College of Psychiatrists urges caution but will publish updated information on psychedelics, and it is hoped that ketamine treatment will become more widely available.</p>
