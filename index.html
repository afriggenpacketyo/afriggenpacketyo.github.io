          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 01:41:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's recent dip in form, marked by three consecutive losses, is significantly impacted by the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid, despite extensive new signings. The article highlights that beyond his goal and assist contributions, the team profoundly misses his unique on-ball quality, crucial weak-foot passing, and ability to break down high defensive presses. His absence has notably hindered effective short build-up play and the execution of long, crossfield passes, forcing tactical compromises like playing Florian Wirtz deeper. These less obvious elements of his game are proving critical for Liverpool's overall strategy and recent performance challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major companies, from tech to airlines, are citing AI as the reason for recent job cuts, leading to employee anxiety. However, critics, including experts from the Oxford Internet Institute, argue that AI is being used as a convenient scapegoat for layoffs stemming from pandemic overhiring and broader economic slowdowns. Research from Yale and the New York Fed indicates minimal disruption to the U.S. labor market from AI automation thus far, with many firms using AI for retraining or hiring, not mass layoffs. This article suggests companies may be leveraging AI's innovative image to conceal other business challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated the U.S. will repatriate two survivors, from Ecuador and Colombia, after a U.S. strike on what he called a "drug-carrying submarine" loaded with fentanyl. Two others were killed in the incident, which Colombian President Gustavo Petro condemned as "murder" and a violation of sovereignty, denying drug ties. This is at least the sixth U.S. strike in the Caribbean recently, raising international concerns about extrajudicial executions. The article highlights the escalating tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela over drug trafficking claims, with Trump defending the operations as vital for national security.</p>

          <p>Royal biographer Andrew Lownie claims Buckingham Palace's decision to have Prince Andrew relinquish his titles is mere "window dressing," failing to address the true gravity of his associations with Jeffrey Epstein. Lownie argues that the King should have acted more decisively, removing all titles, forcing his departure from Royal Lodge, and ensuring full cooperation with authorities. The article suggests the move was pressured by the government for public relations, not a genuine resolution. This perspective highlights ongoing dissatisfaction with the royal family's handling of the Duke of York's controversies.</p>
