          <p>CVS Health announced it will significantly boost access to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy for patients covered by its Caremark pharmacy benefit manager starting July 1, making it the preferred GLP-1 drug for obesity. This move is part of a new partnership between Caremark and Wegovy's manufacturer, Novo Nordisk. Consequently, Caremark will drop Eli Lilly's Zepbound from its standard formularies. The company has negotiated a more affordable price for Wegovy, and CVS plans to combine the drug with lifestyle support as part of its Weight Management program, also partnering with Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare.

          <p>McDonald's reported mixed quarterly results, with U.S. same-store sales declining for the second consecutive quarter, marking the largest domestic drop since the pandemic's onset, shrinking 3.6% due to bad weather and cautious consumer spending. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted a decrease in quick-service restaurant traffic from low- and middle-income consumers. Despite these challenges, McDonald's plans to focus on value meals and popular menu items, including the return of snack wraps, and will keep its $5 meal deal for the rest of 2025.
