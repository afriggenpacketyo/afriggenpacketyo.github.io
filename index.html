          <h2>Opinions on Trump Divided Among Neighbors of His Scottish Golf Course</h2>

          <p>Ahead of a presidential visit to Scotland, residents living near the Trump International Golf Links express sharply divided opinions about their famous neighbor. Some locals, like David Milne, whose property is surrounded by the course, resent the development for altering the natural landscape and criticize the president's treatment of property owners who refused to sell. Conversely, the resort employs over 80 people, and some community members praise its positive economic impact and world-class facilities. The article highlights that while protests are planned, reflecting broad disapproval of the president's politics, others separate the man from the golf course, appreciating the business it brings to the Aberdeenshire coast.</p>

          <h2>NTSB Report Concludes Overloading with Moose Meat Caused Fatal 2023 Alaska Plane Crash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 08:47:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board report has concluded that a 2023 plane crash in Alaska, which resulted in the death of the pilot, was caused by overloading the aircraft. The pilot, Eugene “Buzzy” Peltola Jr., husband of U.S. Representative Mary Peltola, had loaded the plane with nearly 120 pounds of moose meat beyond its certified weight limit. Additionally, unapproved moose antlers were strapped to a wing strut, which further degraded the plane's takeoff performance and flight characteristics. The report details how these factors led to a loss of control shortly after becoming airborne, resulting in the fatal wreck.</p>

          <h2>Aid Workers and Doctors Report Worsening Hunger and Despair in Gaza</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 08:41:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doctors and humanitarian aid workers on the ground in Gaza are providing harrowing accounts of a deepening hunger crisis, with widespread malnutrition devastating the civilian population, particularly children. Organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières and Mercy Corps report that cases of severe acute malnutrition have surged, and some children are now dying from starvation. The testimony highlights an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, as many families go days without food and even aid workers struggle to feed themselves. While Israel denies limiting aid and blames Hamas for shortages, aid groups warn that the situation is becoming a catastrophic, man-made famine that is increasingly difficult to reverse.</p>

          <p>Talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages have reached an impasse, leading the United States and Israel to withdraw their negotiating teams from Doha, Qatar. A U.S. envoy stated that the latest response from Hamas demonstrated a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire," prompting a consideration of alternative options. In response, Hamas expressed surprise at the negative characterization of its position, affirming its commitment to reaching a permanent ceasefire agreement. The breakdown in talks prolongs the uncertainty for the remaining hostages and deepens the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where aid agencies warn of mass starvation.</p>

It lists national averages for 15-year and 30-year loans, which are currently hovering in the 6% to 7% range. The report suggests that while the high-rate environment presents challenges for homebuyers and those looking to refinance, there is potential for stabilization if the Federal Reserve halts further rate increases. It also offers guidance for borrowers, emphasizing the importance of a strong credit score and comparing offers from multiple lenders to secure the best possible terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold, a key safe-haven asset for investors, is subject to constant fluctuation driven by a variety of global factors. As of July 24, 2025, the price stood at $3,367.65 per ounce, but this figure is influenced by ongoing economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical turmoil. The article explains that demand for gold typically rises during periods of instability, as investors seek to hedge against the eroding value of fiat currencies. Other significant factors impacting its price include supply and demand dynamics, central bank policies, interest rates, and the strength of the U.S. dollar, making it a complex but historically resilient investment commodity.

While emphasizing an open-minded approach based on scientific evidence, he clarified that no immediate changes are planned but did not rule out future action if new data indicates a safety concern. This position comes after Republican senators, such as Josh Hawley, have urged the FDA to restore certain safeguards on the medication, citing safety issues.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its financial outlook for the year after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, falling to 3.83 billion euros. The company attributed the decline to significant financial pressures, including a 1.3 billion euro impact from U.S. import tariffs in the first half of the year and 700 million euros in restructuring provisions. Consequently, Volkswagen has lowered its expected operating return on sales for 2025. The results underscore the challenges facing European carmakers, who are grappling with robust competition and the disruptive effects of ongoing trade disputes, particularly President Trump's 25% import tariffs.

By pulling the official nomination, the administration sidesteps a federal law that would have prevented her from serving as an acting officer while under Senate consideration.

Meanwhile, some Chinese scholars argue that these new Arctic shipping routes present a strategic opportunity for Beijing to counter U.S. geopolitical containment by offering more cost-effective and efficient trade pathways.

          <p>A recent summit between EU leaders and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing concluded with little progress on major disputes, exposing deepening rifts between the two powers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the EU-China trade imbalance as having reached an "inflection point," demanding solutions for China's export surplus flooding European markets. In contrast, President Xi urged the EU to keep its markets open and asserted that no fundamental conflicts of interest exist. While a minor agreement was reached on climate change cooperation, the summit failed to bridge significant gaps on geopolitical issues, including China's alleged support for Russia's war economy.</p>

          <p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated into serious military clashes along their shared border, involving airstrikes and artillery fire. Thailand's military reported carrying out airstrikes after accusing Cambodian forces of shelling its territory, with the violence centered near the contested Ta Moan Thom Temple. Thailand's acting Prime Minister reported over 20 deaths, believed to be mostly Thai civilians, marking the worst violence between the neighboring countries since 2011. The conflict stems from long-standing territorial disputes and has been exacerbated by recent nationalist sentiments and internal Thai political dynamics, prompting calls from international bodies like ASEAN for an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, over an article detailing a sexually suggestive birthday card he allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. This legal action is the latest in a series of efforts by the president to use the courts to challenge media outlets, having previously sued companies like CBS and ABC, which chose to settle. The lawsuit comes as Trump faces pressure from his own base to release files related to Epstein. This move expands the president's declared war on the press to include a formerly allied media titan, signaling a warning to other news organizations.</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that the death of 19-year-old Jay Slater in Tenerife was accidental, concluding that he died instantly from skull fractures and brain trauma after falling down a remote ravine. Slater, from Lancashire, went missing in June after telling friends he was lost in the mountains while attempting a long walk back to his apartment. The inquest heard that he had consumed drugs and alcohol the night before and was not equipped for the mountainous terrain. The coroner stated there was no third-party involvement and that the fall, estimated to be up to 25 meters, caused non-survivable injuries, offering some consolation that he would not have suffered.</p>

          <p>Manchester City is set to re-sign goalkeeper James Trafford in a £27 million deal, just two years after selling the academy graduate to Burnley. The 22-year-old impressed during Burnley's promotion-winning season and attracted a bid from Newcastle, which City opted to match using a buy-back and matching rights clause in his original transfer. Trafford is expected to sign a five-year contract and will join a goalkeeping roster that includes Ederson and Stefan Ortega, creating significant competition for the number one spot. The move highlights Manchester City's strategy of inserting buy-back clauses on promising young players, allowing them to bring back talent that has developed elsewhere.</p>

Berlin emphasized that its immediate priorities are securing a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and drastically improving the humanitarian situation.

Under the agreement, 92% of U.K. goods exported to India will see reduced or eliminated tariffs, while 99% of Indian goods shipped to Britain will become tariff-exempt.

This new system, launching later this year, offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining specific food items on prescription from a pharmacy. The goal, according to the Welsh Health Minister, is to "de-medicalise" the process and provide patients with more choice and dignity. While advocacy group Coeliac UK praised the move, some participants from a pilot scheme noted that the monthly allowance only "scratches the surface" of the significantly higher cost of a gluten-free diet, which can be 35% more expensive.</p>

However, the transition presents challenges, including potential supply shortages of natural pigments and the risk of consumer rejection, as Americans are accustomed to the vibrant hues of artificial dyes.

          <p>PayZen, a company using artificial intelligence to purchase medical debt from hospitals, claims its long-term, interest-free payment plans are a solution to healthcare affordability, but consumer advocates raise concerns about transparency. The company's business model involves buying patient debt from cash-strapped hospitals at a discount and then collecting the full amount from patients over time. Critics question whether patients are aware that the hospital has already accepted a reduced payment and whether vulnerable, low-income patients are being funneled into these plans instead of being screened for charity care. The debate intensifies as hospitals face revenue pressures from government cuts, potentially leading to more aggressive collection tactics.</p>

This approach, funded by federal grants from the American Rescue Plan Act, has paid for job training, mental health services, and infrastructure improvements in high-crime areas.
