            <p>The People's Bank of China has decided to keep its loan prime rates unchanged, with the one-year LPR at 3.1% and the five-year LPR at 3.6%, prioritizing yuan stabilization amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. This decision comes after China reported better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% year-on-year GDP growth in the first quarter. Retail sales and industrial output numbers for March also exceeded economists' expectations, indicating a resilient economy despite external pressures. The steady LPRs, which influence corporate and household loans, reflect China's cautious approach to monetary policy during uncertain times. (not investment advice)</p>

Paredes claims he and others were forced to sign a paper stating they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which he denies. The White House maintains its actions are lawful and necessary to remove dangerous illegal aliens, while Paredes' mother asserts his innocence and fears for his safety if deported to El Salvador, a country he has never known.

            <p>A Texas man, Sarmad Ghaled Dafar, has been sentenced for trafficking vulnerable Mexican baby spider monkeys into San Diego and selling them on Facebook. The monkeys, who were illegally separated from their mothers, were intercepted by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents. Dafar was sentenced to four months in custody and 180 days of home confinement, and ordered to pay restitution for the monkeys' quarantine at the San Diego Zoo. The crime highlights the risks to both wildlife and public safety, as the illegal trade disrupts ecosystems and poses the risk of spreading diseases from primates to humans.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's tariffs may inadvertently make China stronger by forcing it to address its economic weaknesses, particularly the fragmentation of its domestic market. The author suggests that instead of relying on brute strength, China could use fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact of tariffs in the short term. However, the real key is for it to resolve its own economic weaknesses. The U.S. has moved in the opposite direction – imposing increasingly strict export controls , particularly on advanced technology, thereby hindering trade opportunities that could have eased tensions.</p>

            <p>Despite government efforts to provide 'free hours' of childcare in England, parents are still facing significant challenges in finding nursery places, particularly in deprived areas. While the government estimates that an additional 70,000 places and 35,000 staff will be needed by September, reports indicate that demand is increasing while access to childcare is declining. The situation is further complicated by rising operating costs for private nurseries and debates over charging for extras like meals and nappies. This leaves many families, especially those not eligible for the funded hours, struggling to afford childcare, raising concerns about equal opportunities for disadvantaged children.</p>

Factors include societal pressures to 'tough it out,' fear of appearing weak, and appointment systems that don't accommodate working patterns. Experts suggest that men often delay seeking help until symptoms interfere with daily function, and that services should be redesigned to better meet their needs. Personal stories highlight the importance of overcoming embarrassment and seeking timely medical attention.</p>

Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine personally, likely due to diplomatic considerations as Japan seeks to improve ties with China and South Korea. The Yasukuni Shrine honors Japan's wartime leaders, who were convicted as war criminals by a post-World War II international tribunal, along with millions of war dead.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have traded accusations of violating a 30-hour 'Easter truce' announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russian troops had violated the ceasefire nearly 3,000 times, while Russia's defense ministry claimed it had repelled assaults by Ukraine. The United States President Donald Trump has expressed hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine this week. The BBC has not independently verified claims by the warring sides.</p>
