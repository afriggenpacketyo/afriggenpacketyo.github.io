          <h2>Transgender Former Judge to Challenge Supreme Court's Gender Ruling in European Court</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 04:35:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Victoria McCloud, the UK's only openly transgender former judge, plans to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex at the European Court of Human Rights. McCloud argues that the ruling, which defines a woman by biological sex under equalities law, violates her human rights and excludes trans people from legal consideration. The Supreme Court's ruling has led to interim guidance stating that trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities in certain contexts. McCloud argues that the court failed to consider the impact on trans people and has left her in a legal paradox of being "two sexes at once."</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars announced a cost-cutting plan of $1.87 billion and withdrew its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026 after reporting a sharp decline in first-quarter operating profit. The company cited tariff pressure and increased competition in the electric vehicle market as reasons for the revised outlook. The cost-cutting measures will include reductions in investments and potential redundancies across its global operations. Volvo Cars CEO Håkan Samuelsson noted the challenges posed by volume drops, price competition, and tariff uncertainties, emphasizing the company's focus on controlling costs.</p>

          <p>Young Australian voters, feeling forgotten by major parties, are poised to express their climate concerns at the ballot box in the upcoming election. Gen Z and Millennials, now outnumbering baby boomers, are demanding stronger climate action and a transition to renewable energy. Many young people believe current and former governments have not done enough to address the climate crisis, leading them to consider voting for minor parties or independent candidates. While the incumbent government promotes clean energy, it has faced criticism for approving new fossil fuel projects, highlighting the conflict between climate goals and the influence of the fossil fuel sector.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a fourth term in Canada's federal election, a turnaround attributed to President Trump's territorial threats and tariffs. Carney emphasized the need for Canadian unity and self-determination, declaring the old relationship with the U.S. over and vowing to protect Canada's sovereignty. Voters expressed concerns about Trump's influence on Canada's economy and sovereignty, with many supporting the Liberal Party's stance against American interference. Trump's remarks about annexing Canada appeared to galvanize support for the Liberals, who campaigned on a platform of defending Canada's independence and interests. (not investment advice)</p>

Counter-terrorism police are assessing the footage, and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for prosecution.

          <p>The Society of Radiographers is advocating for a change in policy to allow male health workers to perform mammograms to address critical staff shortages. Currently, mammograms are exclusively performed by female staff, leading to a vacancy rate of 17.5% among mammographers. While some women express concerns about having a male radiographer for such an intimate screening, others emphasize that the focus should be on saving lives regardless of the gender of the provider. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch believes most women would prefer female radiographers, suggesting the focus should be on recruiting more women rather than compromising patient privacy.</p>

          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax, formally known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, including non-dairy substitutes. The Treasury is consulting on proposals to end the exemption for milk-based drinks, citing concerns about excess sugar consumption and its impact on children's health. The government also proposes reducing the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml. The original exemption was included due to concerns about calcium consumption, but the Treasury argues that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar.</p>
