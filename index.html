        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a faster increase in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth, even amidst ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, cumulative profits at major industrial firms rose by 3% compared to the previous year, an acceleration from March's 2.6% growth, and high-tech manufacturing saw particular gains. Despite U.S. tariffs, Chinese exports have managed to find alternative markets, and a recent trade truce has led to a reduction in levies between the two nations. However, some sectors, like automobiles and apparel, continue to face challenges due to price competition and demand shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has approved the allocation of 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses during the summer months, aiming to mitigate the impact of inflation. This measure is part of a broader relief package designed to counter the economic fallout from U.S. tariffs, including levies on the automotive industry. The subsidies are projected to reduce household energy bills significantly during the peak summer months, and the government has earmarked funds for electricity, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas. Some critics view the subsidies as an attempt to bolster support for the government ahead of upcoming elections. (not investment advice)</p>

Judge Brian E. Murphy ordered the Trump administration to provide the deportees with a "reasonable fear interview," but the government's failure to do so prompted further criticism. The judge noted the logistical challenges of conducting immigration proceedings on another continent and suggested returning the men to the United States if remote proceedings proved too difficult. The case is part of a larger class-action lawsuit examining the due process rights of migrants facing deportation to third countries.</p>

          <p>Recent studies have revealed that some beers brewed in the United States contain elevated levels of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," exceeding the EPA's allowed limits. Researchers from the ACS' Environmental Science & Technology found a strong correlation between PFAS concentrations in municipal drinking water and the levels in locally brewed beer. Beers brewed in North Carolina, California, and Michigan were found to have the highest levels of PFAS, while international beers from Holland and Mexico were less likely to have detectable PFAS. The study suggests that drinking water is a primary source of PFAS contamination in beer.</p>

Volvo Cars CEO Håkan Samuelsson cited the "challenging period" faced by the industry as the reason for the layoffs, and this announcement follows a previous action plan to shake up the business.

          <p>A manhunt is underway in northern Arkansas for Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault, after he escaped from a high-security prison. Hardin, 56, slipped out of the Calico Rock North Central Unit dressed in a makeshift law enforcement uniform, and authorities consider him extremely dangerous. He was serving a decades-long sentence for shooting James Appleton and was later linked to a cold case sexual assault from 1997. Law enforcement officials are urging residents not to approach him if sighted.</p>

          <p>A report by the Lowy Institute warns that the world's poorest nations are facing a "tidal wave of debt" as repayments to China reach record highs in 2025. China's Belt and Road Initiative has led to extensive lending for infrastructure projects, but new lending is now drying up, and developing countries are struggling to repay their debts. The poorest 75 countries are set to make record-high debt repayments of $22 billion to China in 2025, potentially jeopardizing spending on essential services like healthcare and education. The report also raises concerns about China potentially using these debts for geopolitical leverage.</p>

          <p>A House bill proposes to cut in half a tax break for sports team owners, potentially impacting the trend of wealthy individuals buying professional sports teams. The legislation would limit the tax write-off for intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, to half their value over 15 years, only affecting future owners. While team owners claim the congressional estimate of increased revenue is far too low, the White House stated that the tax measure aims to eliminate an advantage for owners at a time when ticket prices are rising. The prospect of these tax changes could spur sellers or buyers to act quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Bill Saporito criticizes President Trump for demanding that retailers like Walmart absorb the costs of tariffs on goods from China, rather than raising prices for consumers. Saporito argues that Trump's demand contradicts basic business principles, as retailers cannot sustain operations if costs exceed revenues, and Kelly Loeffler, head of the Small Business Administration, is quoted downplaying the concern for tariffs. Small and medium-sized businesses are making it clear by adding surcharges to goods and services and informing their customers of the source, and the essay concludes by saying that companies that deny the realities of the tariffs are engaging in self-satire.</p>
