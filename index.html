          <p>Peter Coker Jr., involved in the $100 million New Jersey deli fraud case, was attacked by fellow inmates in a Thai prison while awaiting extradition. His lawyer cited these inhumane conditions and Coker Jr.'s severe liver cirrhosis as reasons for a lenient sentence. Coker Jr. expressed deep regret for his actions and the impact on his parents, while his father, Peter Coker Sr., received a six-month jail sentence followed by home confinement. The Cokers, along with James Patten, admitted to fraudulently inflating the share price of two companies, including Hometown International, which owned a small, money-losing deli.

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be around 2.4%, which would be the lowest annual increase in five years, according to estimates from policy analysts and senior citizen groups. This potential decrease is based on current inflation data, although the final COLA will depend on inflation rates in the coming months. The annual adjustment is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year, using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W has increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months.</p>

This decision comes nearly a decade after the city's jails fell under federal oversight following a class-action lawsuit focused on curbing violence towards detainees and correction officers.

Hogg claims the vote is linked to his dispute with the party over his support for primary challengers, while Kenyatta expressed frustration at the focus on Hogg, emphasizing his own work as vice chair.

          <p>The Qatari royal family has proposed gifting President Donald Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and violations of the emoluments clause. While presidents often exchange gifts with foreign governments, the scale of this giftâ€”estimated at $400 millionâ€”is unprecedented. Critics argue that accepting such a gift could create an expectation of quid pro quo and influence Trump's decision-making, especially given the Trump Organization's recent deal to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar. Legal experts suggest that accepting the plane could lead to legal challenges, particularly if Trump transfers it to his presidential library.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's imposition of large tariffs on goods from various countries, inflation slowed down in April, defying expectations. This unexpected outcome is attributed to companies stocking up on foreign goods earlier in the year in anticipation of the tariffs. While some companies, like Mattel and Procter & Gamble, have announced plans to raise prices to offset tariff costs, the overall impact on inflation remains uncertain. Economists are debating whether the tariffs will lead to a one-time price surge or trigger a broader inflationary cycle, considering factors like supply chain disruptions and potential government spending increases.</p>

          <p>Three key House committees are debating a major budget package addressing President Trump's defense, energy, and tax priorities. The committees will vote on proposals including changes to Medicaid and food stamps to fund tax cuts. Divisions among Republicans persist, particularly on overhauling Medicaid and a tax deduction expiring in December. Democrats are challenging the proposals, with Republicans aiming to have the bill on the floor by next week. Trump is pressuring Republicans to unify behind the "big, beautiful bill."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria marks a significant shift in Middle East policy. The move comes as a political risk, given that Syrian leader Ahmad al Sharaa was previously wanted by the United States. Despite the change, U.S. officials remain concerned about the new government's ability to keep the Islamic State at bay and protect minorities. The planned meeting between Trump and Sharaa signals a major change, being the first leader meeting since 2000.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez returned to court for a resentencing hearing to determine if they will have a chance at freedom after serving nearly three decades for the murder of their parents in 1989. The hearing will center on whether the brothers have been rehabilitated in prison and deserve a lesser sentence, making them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. Prosecutors are opposed to resentencing, arguing the brothers have not taken complete responsibility. The judge could decide on the resentencing during the hearing or issue a written ruling later.</p>
