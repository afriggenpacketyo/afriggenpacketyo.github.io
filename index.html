Over the past 10 years, the bank has financed over $60 billion in infrastructure projects, including healthcare support during the COVID-19 pandemic.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States conducted military strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, utilizing B-2 bombers and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Following the strikes, Trump addressed the nation, asserting it as a "spectacular military success." A U.S. official confirmed that Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs were deployed during the mission. Trump urged Iran to pursue a diplomatic resolution rather than retaliation, emphasizing the potential for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The strikes represent a significant escalation in the tensions between the U.S. and Iran.</p>

          <p>General Dan Caine of the Joint Chiefs of Staff outlined the US mission to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, involving decoy flights, multiple mid-air refuelings, and seven B-2 stealth bombers. The operation, dubbed 'Operation Midnight Hammer,' targeted Iran's most secure nuclear sites, including the Fordo facility. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stated the bombers went "in and out and back without the world knowing at all." The US employed deception tactics, including decoy bombers heading towards Guam to divert attention. While the Trump administration declared the operation a total victory, Iran has minimized the extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>The United States has crossed a significant threshold by directly striking Iranian nuclear sites, a move that has sparked alarm globally and set the stage for potentially momentous decisions by Iran. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei faces immense pressure to respond in a way that protects the Islamic Republic without triggering further escalation. Iran's options are limited, as direct attacks on US bases or disrupting oil traffic could backfire. President Trump, now seemingly aligned with Israel, urges Iran to "come to peace," while Iran views US diplomacy as a deceptive tactic.</p>

General Caine indicated that all three sites sustained severe damage, though a full damage assessment is pending. Satellite images show craters and ash across the area, with tunnel entrances appearing blocked. The IAEA reported no increase in off-site radiation levels, but stressed the need for dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. This request comes after Iran warned it reserves all options to defend its sovereignty following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. Rubio emphasized that closing the strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it relies on the waterway for oil exports to China. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is stationed in Bahrain to protect maritime trade in the Persian Gulf, but analysts warn of potential disruptions to shipping.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, with the Pentagon assessing "extremely severe damage." The operation involved 125 US military aircraft, including B-2 stealth bombers, and targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Gen Caine detailed the mission, including decoy flights and the use of GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators. Iranian officials confirmed the strikes but denied major damage. Within hours, Iran launched missiles hitting parts of Tel Aviv and Haifa. The US now awaits Iran's next move, with options ranging from diplomacy to retaliation.</p>

          <p>A woman installed a fence on her property to prevent her neighbor's children from disturbing her, but the neighbors are now complaining that they can't fit two cars in their driveway. The woman is wondering if she is being unreasonable for declining their request to move the fence. Mumsnet users overwhelmingly supported her decision, stating that her neighbors' parking issues are not her problem. Commenters noted that the neighbors were previously using her driveway for access and that managing their children's behavior would have prevented the need for the fence.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz, located between Oman and Iran, is a crucial global trade route facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil daily. Secretary of State Rubio warned that closing the strait would be a "suicidal move" for Iran, likely drawing backlash from powerful countries dependent on the route. The U.S. has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.</p>

The attack was carried out without prior Congressional approval or notification to top Democratic lawmakers.

However, some lawmakers question the legality of the strikes, arguing that Trump acted without proper authorization from Congress.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military executed a complex operation, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, to bombard Iranian nuclear sites, employing deception tactics and stealth bombers to achieve surprise. B-2 bombers delivered 420,000 pounds of explosives to key underground uranium enrichment plants. The mission involved a series of deceptive tactics and decoys to maintain secrecy, including a decoy plan where some B-2 bombers traveled west while others headed east. The U.S. officials said Iran neither detected the inbound fusillade, nor mustered a shot at the stealthy American jets.</p>

          <p>Following US strikes on its nuclear sites, Iran is reportedly considering blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a key waterway connecting the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) describes it as the "world's most important oil transit chokepoint." Large volumes of crude extracted by OPEC countries and consumed globally flow through the strait. Experts, however, say Iran is unlikely to move ahead with closing it, and exporters have other options to fall back on if it does.</p>
