        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area Friday night, causing near-zero visibility and prompting ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. The fast-moving wall of dust, driven by wind gusts reaching over 70 mph, blanketed the city and suburbs in a thick haze, leading to hazardous driving conditions on major interstates. Some areas experienced "mud rain" as showers and storms coincided with the dust storm. Several schools closed due to power outages resulting from severe weather events, and temperatures are expected to cool down over the weekend before a rainy pattern returns next week. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1,' citing concerns over the increasing government debt and interest payment ratios. The downgrade reflects the failure of successive administrations to reverse ballooning deficits, leading to higher borrowing costs for the country. While Moody's acknowledges the US's exceptional credit strengths, such as its economic size and the dollar's role as the global reserve currency, the firm expects federal debt to significantly increase relative to GDP by 2035. The White House criticized Moody's, while the downgrade coincided with a setback for Trump's spending bill in Congress.</p>

          <p>An internal review reveals that FEMA is "not ready" for the upcoming hurricane season due to staff cuts, contract changes, and a perceived lack of understanding regarding the agency's role. The review cites culture issues, staffing shortages, and coordination challenges with other federal agencies. The report also references President Trump's plan to shift more emergency response duties to the states, leading to concerns about states "passing the buck" to FEMA. FEMA's acting leader, David Richardson, has expressed support for shrinking FEMA and increasing cost-sharing with the states, raising concerns among agency staff.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill encountered a significant obstacle as conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee, citing insufficient federal spending cuts. Disagreements persist among Republicans regarding Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to bringing the legislation, which includes tax cuts and increased spending on military and border security, to a floor vote before Memorial Day, despite the divisions within his party. Trump has urged Republicans to unite behind the bill, but negotiations continue to resolve the remaining differences.</p>

While AI will play a significant role, experienced forecasters will still oversee the process and issue final weather reports and disaster alerts.

          <p>Tesla has changed its corporate bylaws, limiting shareholders' ability to sue the company for breach of fiduciary duties. The new bylaw requires a shareholder or group to hold at least 3% of Tesla's outstanding shares to initiate a derivative proceeding, a threshold valued at over $30 billion. The company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders. This move follows Tesla's relocation of its incorporation site to Texas after a court decision rescinded CEO Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package.</p>
