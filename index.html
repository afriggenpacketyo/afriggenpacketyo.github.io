          <p>White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, suggesting the president seeks a successor who will lower interest rates more promptly. Vought defended the administration's review and delay of congressionally approved funds for education and health, citing a need to eliminate wasteful spending on "left wing organizations" and controversial research. He also addressed the potential for a government shutdown, asserting the administration wants to avoid one but is committed to overhauling a "broken" bipartisan appropriations process to achieve spending reductions. The discussion highlighted significant tensions between the executive and legislative branches over the power of the purse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is urging the Trump administration to immediately stop funding the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and restore support for UN aid mechanisms. They express grave concerns over the GHF's operations, which have been linked to hundreds of Palestinian deaths as people attempt to access food in designated military zones. The letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio highlights the dire humanitarian situation, with the UN warning of mass starvation and reporting over 1,000 deaths near aid sites since May. The senators are also demanding transparency regarding the $30 million in US funding for GHF.</p>

          <p>A joint investigation highlights the devastating consequences of false positive drug tests on pregnant patients, which can be as high as 50%. The report details cases where new mothers faced child welfare investigations after consuming common items like poppy seeds, which can trigger a positive result for opiates. In at least 27 states, hospitals are required to report positive tests to authorities before a more accurate confirmatory test is completed, leading to traumatic family separations. Medical experts and advocates argue that these initial screenings are unreliable and that hospitals should use verbal questionnaires, as recommended by major medical groups.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has implemented a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza, including Gaza City, to allow for the secure delivery of humanitarian aid. This move comes amid mounting international pressure and severe warnings of famine, with images of malnourished children drawing global criticism. The UN welcomed the step but reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to address the crisis effectively, as aid trucks from Egypt and Jordan began moving toward the region. Despite the pause in designated areas, Israel's offensive against Hamas continues elsewhere, and Palestinian health officials reported new fatalities in recent strikes.</p>

The UK government has described the situation as "utterly horrifying" and has been working with Jordan on aid airdrops, while emphasizing that unhindered truck access is the only sustainable solution.</p>

          <p>A new "Trump IRA" proposal, part of a recent bill, aims to encourage savings for children under 18 by allowing parents and employers to contribute up to $5,000 annually. The accounts would grow tax-free, and funds could be withdrawn penalty-free at age 18, with the government adding a $1,000 starter for children born between 2025 and 2028. However, this article suggests that while the free $1,000 is worth taking, other savings vehicles like 529 education accounts and custodial Roth IRAs offer more significant long-term benefits. These alternatives provide more robust options for funding education or retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek have shown significant improvements in employee well-being, but the reason extends beyond just having more free time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a major factor in increased happiness is that employees feel more effective and productive at work. Faced with less time, teams are forced to eliminate busywork and streamline processes, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and control over their professional lives. This boost in work quality and efficiency has a profound positive impact on overall well-being, fostering better team spirit and motivation.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, has met twice with the deputy US attorney general, sparking speculation about what she might reveal regarding Jeffrey Epstein's network. The meetings come as the Trump administration faces pressure over its handling of Epstein-related files and a congressional committee seeks Maxwell's testimony. However, legal experts question what new information she could provide and whether it would be credible, given her previous perjury charges and her decision not to cooperate before her trial. Any potential deal for a reduced sentence would likely require her to provide substantial, verifiable assistance to prosecutors.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that Donald Trump's worldview is defined by avarice and a relentless focus on "dealmaking," which he uses to subvert markets and bolster his personal brand and wealth. Unlike traditional entrepreneurs, Trump's deals are adversarial and personal, allowing him to claim victory regardless of the outcome while avoiding the measurable consequences of market forces. This "egonomics" connects his narcissistic urges directly to accumulating money, with policies like tariffs serving as tools to dominate the global prestige economy and create further opportunities for personal enrichment. The article suggests his core motivation is not power or glory, but an insatiable desire for money itself.</p>

          <p>A travel writer with experience in 70 countries outlines seven phrases that American tourists often use abroad that can come across as rude, ignorant, or entitled. These include asking for prices in dollars, commenting on how "cheap" things are, and asking locals "What state are you from?" The advice emphasizes the importance of cultural awareness and respect, suggesting travelers research local currency and customs before their trip. Other tips include avoiding corporate chains in favor of local businesses and refraining from comparing local practices to how things are done "back home."</p>

This campaign aims to highlight the impact of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid. Rural hospitals, which are heavily reliant on Medicaid, have been under financial strain for years, and analyses predict hundreds more could close due to these cuts. While Republicans included a $50 billion "rural health transformation fund," Democrats argue it's an insufficient "slush fund" that won't offset the long-term damage to healthcare access.</p>

While modern socialists lack a coherent plan for wealth creation, their ideas gain traction as a response to the perceived corruption and inequality under Trump.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping in the United States is rooted in the post-Civil War era, where it emerged as a way for employers to avoid paying wages to formerly enslaved Black workers. This system was later codified by the powerful National Restaurant Association lobby, resulting in the "tipped minimum wage." Under federal law, this wage is just $2.13 an hour, with the expectation that customer tips will make up the difference to the regular minimum wage of $7.25. This legacy system, which is difficult to enforce and leads to wage theft, places the burden of paying an employee's wages directly on the consumer.</p>
