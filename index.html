          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 05:34:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry and the use of foreign productions for "messaging and propaganda." This proposal has raised significant concerns within the film industry, with unions warning of a potential "knock-out blow" to the sector, especially in countries like the UK and Canada that have attracted productions with lower costs and skilled crews. The details of the tariff, including its application to American production companies filming abroad and streaming services, remain unclear, prompting debate about the definition of a "US film."</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza, including capturing and holding territory, a move that has drawn criticism from the UN and aid agencies. The plan also involves a phased expansion of ground operations, including seizing additional areas and expanding the buffer zone along the borders. While the cabinet approved the "possibility" of humanitarian aid distribution, the UN has expressed concerns that the proposed system would contravene humanitarian principles and further endanger civilians. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum criticized the plan, saying it prioritizes territory over the release of hostages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Collection activity on federal student loans has restarted for over 5 million borrowers in default after a five-year pause, causing concerns about economic instability for working families. Many borrowers who had signed up for the Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan now face switching to different plans with potentially higher monthly bills due to legal challenges. Borrowers are reporting long wait times to receive assistance, and the restart of collections could significantly lower credit scores, impacting their ability to secure loans and credit cards. The Federal Reserve predicts that some people with a delinquency could see their scores fall by as much as 171 points.</p>

          <p>Jury selection has begun in New York City for the trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who faces criminal charges including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.

The trial is expected to include testimony from alleged victims and debate over a hotel surveillance video of Combs assaulting singer Cassie Ventura, his ex-partner, which prosecutors view as evidence of his violent nature.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how learning new languages physically changes the brain and improves cognitive skills. Neuroscientists have found that learning a new language is like exercising the brain, strengthening neural pathways and improving information processing. Studies show that multilingualism enhances connectivity between brain regions, leading to more efficient communication and improved memory. While it's unclear if polyglots are inherently smarter, learning new languages expands verbal repertoire and offers new cultural experiences, but there is no conclusive evidence to determine whether the increased verbal repertoire is due to a bigger cognitive reserve.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Jack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general, argues that Donald Trump's expansion of presidential powers builds on excesses of recent presidencies, creating a dangerous trend.

Goldsmith calls for substantial limitations on the presidency, including potential constitutional amendments, to restore congressional primacy and prevent further escalation of power grabs.</p>

          <h2>NIH Cuts 'Safe to Sleep' Team, Raising Concerns for Infant Safety</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has shut down the office responsible for leading the Safe to Sleep campaign, a public awareness initiative credited with significantly reducing sleep-related infant deaths. This decision has raised concerns among pediatricians and organizations like First Candle, as sleep-related infant deaths have been increasing in recent years. The Safe to Sleep campaign provided crucial information and resources to parents, including safe sleep recommendations, but now that these are defunct, state agencies and hospitals may lack the necessary resources to continue these efforts.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, Kosmos 482, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere this coming weekend after orbiting the planet for decades. The probe, intended to reach Venus, was stranded in low Earth orbit due to an engine malfunction. While some parts of the spacecraft likely landed in New Zealand shortly after launch, the lander probe has survived in orbit and is expected to reenter essentially undamaged. There is a small chance it could damage property or hurt someone upon impact.</p>

Ms. Sheinbaum confirmed that Mr. Trump made the suggestion, and that she rejected it, emphasizing that Mexico and the United States can “collaborate,” but “with you in your territory and us in ours.”</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house America's "most ruthless and violent Offenders." The former prison, located on an island off San Francisco, has been closed for over 60 years due to high operating costs and crumbling infrastructure. Trump's directive to rebuild and reopen the penitentiary is part of his effort to overhaul federal prison systems, but the plan faces significant logistical and financial challenges, as the island is now a major tourist site operated by the National Park Service.</p>

The tariffs could impact foreign productions, potentially making it less attractive for productions aimed at the massive US market, and could also affect the export of Australian content to the US.</p>
