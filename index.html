          <p>Shane Daley, a New York man, faces federal cyberstalking charges for allegedly harassing a family member of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Prosecutors contend that Daley left disturbing voicemails expressing satisfaction over Thompson's recent killing and wishing similar harm upon his relatives, intensifying the family's pain. The alleged calls began just hours after Thompson was fatally shot in Manhattan on December 4, 2024, by Luigi Mangione, who was reportedly angered by corporate greed. This incident underscores the severe emotional distress that can be inflicted through digital harassment in the wake of a tragedy, with Daley facing potential imprisonment and a substantial fine if convicted.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a US man who faked his death and fled to Scotland to evade sexual assault charges, has been found guilty of one such charge in a Utah court. The 38-year-old was accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2008, with prosecutors trying the cases separately. His victim testified he held her down and forced himself upon her, identifying him despite his changed appearance and use of multiple aliases. Rossi's defense attempted to argue the accusation stemmed from resentment over their relationship. He was ultimately apprehended in Glasgow while hospitalized for COVID-19, recognized by his distinctive tattoos, ending his years-long attempt to avoid justice.</p>

          <p>The parents of Jayda Floyd, a 22-year-old probation officer, have filed a lawsuit against the owners and general manager of HTR TX Hill Country Resort, alleging negligence after their daughter died in the deadly Kerr County floods. The suit claims the campground was aware of its 'history of dangerous flooding' but failed to warn guests or establish proper evacuation procedures. Floyd reportedly saved her fiancé's teenage step-siblings by helping them to the RV roof before she perished in the July 4 deluge that claimed 135 lives. This legal action, seeking over $1 million, underscores broader criticisms of the official response to the catastrophic Texas floods.</p>

          <h2>Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low Alcohol Consumption Among Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of Americans now consume alcohol, marking a record low since 1958. This significant decline is primarily driven by increasing public awareness of alcohol's health risks, even in moderation, a shift from previous understandings. Younger demographics, aged 18-34, are particularly responsive to this evolving scientific consensus, with a majority believing moderate drinking is harmful. Societal factors like the growing acceptance of sobriety, the popularity of 'Dry January,' and the rise of mocktails also contribute to this trend, which experts anticipate will continue.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This transaction represents the second-largest sale price for a US sports franchise, following the Los Angeles Lakers' $10 billion valuation. Chisholm's group is set to acquire at least 51% ownership, with plans to buy out remaining minority shareholders by 2028 at an increased valuation of $7.3 billion. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and managing partner of STG Partners, will become the Celtics' governor, signaling a new era for the team. The sale is expected to finalize shortly.</p>

          <p>A Virginia Tech study has demonstrated that trained pet dogs can effectively detect the elusive egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly, offering a promising new defense against this destructive pest. These insects, native to Asia, have rapidly spread to 19 US states, causing significant damage to various plants and promoting mold growth. Human efforts to locate their camouflaged egg masses are often inefficient, but dogs' superior sense of smell proved highly effective, achieving over 80% accuracy indoors and 60% in real-world outdoor tests. This innovative research highlights the significant potential for K9 teams to aid in early detection and control efforts, preventing further ecological and agricultural harm.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a public warning against mousse-form sunscreen products, including those from popular brands like Supergoop!, raising concerns about their efficacy in protecting against harmful UV rays. The agency dispatched warning letters to five companies, asserting that these products are classified as drugs and are being sold without the necessary FDA approval. A critical safety concern highlighted is their packaging, which often mimics whipped cream containers, posing a risk of accidental ingestion, particularly for children. Companies have 15 days to rectify these violations, with some already initiating product removal or labeling adjustments.</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu hydropower station, the world's fourth-largest dam, has announced it will no longer use Western industrial chips in its control systems, citing national security concerns. This significant decision reflects growing global anxieties over vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, particularly in industrial control systems, as highlighted by past cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus. The Stuxnet virus famously exploited Siemens PLCs to disrupt Iran's nuclear program over a decade ago. The Xiluodu Dam, with its massive 13.86 gigawatt capacity, underscores the strategic importance of China's move to enhance the security and autonomy of its crucial energy infrastructure.</p>

His trial, which has drawn significant international attention and calls for his release from figures like UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, was recently postponed due to a typhoon.

Biden had claimed in a recent interview that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, attributing this assertion to author Michael Wolff. This legal threat aligns with President Trump's history of aggressively pursuing litigation against critics, though public figures typically face a high legal bar in defamation cases.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has delivered a victory to President Trump's administration, ruling that it can continue to freeze or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid previously earmarked by Congress. In a 2-to-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit determined that the international aid groups challenging the freeze lacked the necessary legal standing to bring the lawsuit. The disputed funds encompass nearly $4 billion for global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS initiatives. This ruling overturns a lower court's preliminary injunction, aligning with Trump's past criticisms of foreign aid as 'wasteful' and his administration's efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Big Bear Lake, California, have arrested Christopher Tindall for allegedly operating an illegal psychedelic mushroom business from the Jah Healing Cannabis Church. Responding to citizen complaints, deputies executed a search warrant and discovered approximately three ounces of psilocybin mushrooms on Tindall, identified as the owner of the 'mushroom sales shop.' Tindall was booked on felony charges related to illegal mushroom sales and subsequently released on bond. This incident adds to the church's legal woes, as it was previously ordered to permanently shut down in 2022 for allegedly functioning as an illegal cannabis dispensary, a ruling the church continues to fight in court.</p>

          <p>Viral photos of rabbits in Colorado exhibiting twisting black, horn-like growths have sparked widespread online curiosity, but Colorado Parks and Wildlife has clarified that the animals are afflicted with the relatively harmless Shope Papilloma Virus. This disease, prevalent in the American Midwest, causes these distinctive growths, which are generally benign unless they obstruct the rabbits' ability to eat or see. The virus primarily spreads through fleas, ticks, or direct rabbit-to-rabbit contact, posing no threat to humans or other animal species. Once the affected rabbits' immune systems successfully combat the virus, the growths naturally recede, a phenomenon believed to have inspired the centuries-old myth of the 'jackalope.'</p>

          <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has declared a state of emergency for Española and its surrounding areas, citing a 'significant surge' in violent crime and drug trafficking. This declaration allocates $750,000 in emergency funding to the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to provide crucial resources. The governor highlighted that police calls in the region have more than doubled in two years, with business dispatches quadrupling. Rio Arriba County, encompassing Española, struggles with the state's highest overdose death rate, with fentanyl being a major contributor. This is the second such emergency declaration by the governor this year, underscoring the severity of the crisis.</p>

          <p>Rising energy costs are posing an escalating challenge for low-income Americans, making essential cooling increasingly unaffordable, as illustrated by individuals like Angela Harmon in Dallas. Research by Professor Andrew Dessler indicates that climate change is directly contributing to increased wholesale electricity costs, with substantial price surges observed across various US regions. Compounding this, President Trump's proposed 2026 budget aims to eliminate the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which currently assists over six million Americans. The administration justifies this by citing fraud concerns and advocating for state-level responsibility, but critics warn it will exacerbate financial hardship for vulnerable populations as temperatures and energy demands continue to climb.</p>

          <p>David Ellison, leading Skydance Media, has unveiled ambitious plans to revitalize Paramount following his $8-billion takeover, aiming to re-establish it as a top destination for filmmakers. His strategy involves significantly increasing content production, targeting 15-20 annual film releases, and leveraging popular franchises like 'Top Gun,' 'Star Trek,' and 'Yellowstone.' Ellison also articulated a desire to move the company away from political divisions, seeking to appeal to a wider audience. The new ownership structure, with Ellison's family holding 50%, signals a long-term build-out strategy, prioritizing growth and creative output over short-term earnings, despite anticipated cost savings and layoffs.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Imperial College London are warning that UK cities, including London and Edinburgh, face an emerging 'firewave' risk due to rising temperatures and prolonged dry spells exacerbated by climate change. A 'firewave' describes the phenomenon of multiple urban wildfires igniting simultaneously, which can overwhelm emergency services and threaten homes. Recent heath and gorse fires underscore this increasing vulnerability. Researchers have found that after ten consecutive days of very dry weather, urban vegetation becomes highly flammable, susceptible to even small sparks. The study proposes the Met Office adopt the 'firewave' term to signal extreme fire danger, aiming to enhance public safety strategies and climate resilience planning.</p>

City officials expressed significant relief that temporary 'Hesco' barriers largely prevented catastrophic damage, sparing hundreds of homes from being inundated for a second consecutive year. This annual flooding originates from Suicide Basin, which fills with meltwater and forces its way under the glacier's ice dam. While the immediate threat has passed and evacuated areas reopened, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has initiated a multi-year study to develop more permanent solutions, as these outburst floods are projected to continue for decades.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revoked a 2021 executive order by Joe Biden aimed at promoting competition in the US economy, marking a significant policy reversal. The Justice Department supported this move, advocating for an 'America first antitrust' approach that prioritizes free markets over what it described as Biden's 'overly prescriptive and burdensome' methods. Biden's original order sought to combat corporate concentration and abuses of market power across various sectors, an initiative that had garnered popularity among Americans. Critics contend that Trump's actions, including proposed cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have already resulted in billions of dollars in higher fees and lost compensation for consumers.</p>

Lula sharply criticized Trump's justification for the tariffs, linking them to allegations against former President Jair Bolsonaro and dismissing US claims of human rights abuses in Brazil.

          <p>Coffee and specialty tea prices in the US are experiencing significant increases, largely attributed to tariffs, which is causing considerable concern for small businesses and consumers. Coffee prices alone surged 14.5% year-over-year in July, with a pound of ground coffee averaging $8.41. Retailers, such as Bethany's Coffee Shop, report price hikes of 18-25% since January, compelling them to raise consumer prices despite already slim margins. Industry experts highlight that importers of natural resources like coffee and tea have limited options to circumvent these tariffs. This situation poses a severe threat to small, authentic brands and could ultimately lead to reduced product diversity and higher costs for American consumers.</p>
