            <p>Reports indicate that a hospital in Gaza City, Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, was struck by an Israeli air strike, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The strike reportedly caused significant damage, particularly to the intensive care and surgery departments, leading to the displacement of patients and staff. Hamas has condemned the incident as a "horrific crime," while Israel has stated that it is investigating the reports. This event follows a similar incident in October 2023, where an attack on the same hospital resulted in numerous casualties, raising concerns about the protection of medical facilities during conflict. Relevant context is the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has resulted in numerous casualties and heightened tensions in the region.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is backing a recall campaign to remove opposition lawmakers, seeking to regain control of the legislature. This effort is driven by the DPP's dissatisfaction with the current legislative balance, where the opposition holds a majority. The campaign has sparked concern about deepening political divisions and instability, especially amid pressure from Beijing and economic uncertainties. The DPP needs to unseat at least six district-based KMT legislators to reclaim a working majority, making the recall campaign a critical political maneuver in Taiwan.</p>

            <p>An Alabama woman, Towana Looney, had a pig kidney removed after living with it for a record 130 days due to her body starting to reject the organ. Although the transplant was ultimately unsuccessful, it provided valuable data for doctors researching xenotransplantation. Looney, who had been on dialysis since 2016, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to the research. Doctors decided that removing the kidney was less risky than trying to save it, and Looney is now back on dialysis but grateful for the break it gave her.</p>

Indonesia's policy of strategic autonomy, balancing US security partnerships with Chinese investment and trade, is becoming increasingly difficult amid US-China decoupling.

            <p>Luxury malls in Beijing and Shanghai are reducing rents and diversifying their tenant mix to attract middle-class shoppers due to a decline in consumer spending on luxury goods. Malls like Parkview Green and K11 are easing tenant criteria and courting mid-market retailers to fill vacancies. The shift reflects the challenges facing high-end consumption in China and the need for malls to adapt to changing market conditions. Parkview Green, known for its art collection, was even put up for sale due to financial struggles.</p>

            <p>Smartphones and computers have been exempted from tariffs imposed on China and other countries, providing a major boost for the tech industry. This move alleviates concerns about rising consumer prices and benefits tech companies with manufacturing operations in Southeast Asia. The decision aligns with the Trump administration's push to encourage companies to onshore manufacturing to the United States. However, these goods are still subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl.</p>
