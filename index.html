        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced it would begin revoking visas for some Chinese international students, particularly those in critical fields or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the government would also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. criticized the decision as politically motivated and discriminatory, warning it would undermine the rights of Chinese students and damage the U.S.'s reputation. This policy change adds to the increasing scrutiny international students face from the Trump administration. Optimism is tempered by the potential disruption to international academic exchanges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's order that found many of President Trump's global tariffs to be illegal, allowing the import taxes to continue for the time being. The initial ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade was criticized by Trump officials as judicial overreach, while small businesses and states had challenged the tariffs. The Trump administration argued that the trade court had improperly second-guessed the president's authority and threatened trade negotiations. The next hearing is scheduled for June 5, and the matter is widely expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court, raising questions about the long-term impact on businesses and international trade.

          <p>Families of girl athletes in California are expressing dissatisfaction with the California Interscholastic Federation's (CIF) recent rule changes addressing transgender athletes. The CIF announced it would expand the championship competition pool and recognize female athletes on the medal podium if they are displaced by a trans athlete. Reese Hogan, who finished second to a trans athlete, stated the changes fall short of ensuring fair competition for all girls. The family of Olivia Viola, another athlete, argues that the changes do not fix the underlying issue of biological males competing against females, thus violating Title IX civil rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona, ordering a new trial. The decision came after a judge stepped down due to criticism surrounding her participation in a documentary series about the case. The prosecutor argued that the judge had violated judicial ethics by allowing a camera crew to film her overseeing closed-door hearings. The new trial will effectively restart the proceedings, casting doubt on the timeline, and a higher court will select three new judges by lottery. This turn of events adds another layer of complexity to the already high-profile and closely watched case.</p>

          <p>A senior UN official has stated that there is little hope for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to halt the ongoing conflict. UN Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo highlighted the recent wave of attacks, including the largest drone attack on Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, as a stark warning of potential escalation. While acknowledging that the possibility of negotiations remains, DiCarlo emphasized that it is "just barely" alive.

          <p>Global investment advisory Cambridge Associates suggests that global investors are reevaluating their portfolios and considering undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China. This shift is seen as a way to "provide defense" amid geopolitical tensions, particularly with the U.S. The firm notes that despite Trump's tariffs, Asian equities, particularly Chinese and Hong Kong stocks, have outperformed. Valuations in these markets are attractive compared to U.S. stocks, making a case for diversifying away from U.S. equities even stronger, as institutional portfolios are starting to tilt away from US markets.

Instead, Musk's team faced criticism for unlawfully accessing sensitive data and firing federal employees, ultimately failing to deliver on its ambitious goals. The department's creation was seen by some as a joke, given its reference to an internet meme and cryptocurrency.</p>
