          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve his one-year prison sentence in jail, deeming his previous transfer to a hospital unlawful. The decision relates to a commuted sentence for corruption convictions from his time in office. Thaksin, an influential figure whose family has long dominated Thai politics, had spent only hours in a cell before being moved to a hospital for six months, a move that drew public criticism over perceived special treatment for the powerful.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within Rupert Murdoch's media empire has concluded with an agreement that ensures his son, Lachlan, will control the trust for News Corp and Fox Corp. The deal will see siblings James, Elisabeth, and Prudence sell their holdings, preventing them from influencing the conservative editorial direction of outlets like Fox News. This resolution ends years of family tension and litigation, which famously inspired the television series "Succession." The agreement finalizes Lachlan's leadership role following Rupert Murdoch's step back in 2023.</p>

In Indonesia, markets reacted negatively to the unexpected dismissal of the finance minister, causing the rupiah to weaken. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reached a multi-year high, reflecting broader regional trends as investors tracked gains in US tech stocks.</p>

          <p>New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts in England have been published for the first time, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital ranking highest. The system scores trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, A&E performance, and financial management, sorting them into four categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables will help identify where support is needed, but some trusts have questioned the metrics used. The rankings aim to increase transparency and drive improvements, with top performers gaining more autonomy.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, analysts anticipate that Tokyo will maintain its stance of viewing Beijing as a strategic competitor. Ishiba's departure comes after securing a trade deal with the United States that reduces tariffs on Japanese car imports. While China's foreign ministry described the resignation as an internal affair, the leadership change in Japan introduces a new dynamic to the already complex relationship between the two Asian powers. The next Japanese leader will face the challenge of navigating these rocky diplomatic and strategic ties.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an enhanced immigration enforcement action in Chicago, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz," targeting individuals it describes as "criminal illegal aliens." Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson stated the city received no prior notice and opposes the operation, citing concerns about potential human rights violations and ICE's track record. The operation follows social media posts from President Trump threatening a crackdown in the city. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accused the administration of focusing on "scaring Illinoisians" rather than coordinating on public safety.</p>

          <p>A US congressional committee has released several documents from the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including his will, address book, and a "birthday book" from 2003. The book contains messages from various high-profile individuals, including an alleged note from Donald Trump and another from UK ambassador Peter Mandelson, who called Epstein his "best pal." The release has renewed focus on the extensive network of powerful figures associated with Epstein. While many names are included, the individuals are not accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein's crimes.</p>

          <p>A former head of security at WhatsApp, Attaullah Baig, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against parent company Meta, alleging "systemic cybersecurity failures" at the messaging service. The suit claims that hundreds of WhatsApp engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data without adequate monitoring, potentially violating a 2020 FTC privacy settlement. Baig alleges that he was fired in retaliation after raising these concerns to senior leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg. A Meta spokesperson disputed the claims, stating Baig was dismissed for poor performance and his allegations are distorted.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, the Labour Party is holding a contest to elect a new deputy leader, a process that is seen as an indicator of the party's internal political dynamics. The tight timetable for nominations has drawn criticism from the party's left wing, which fears being excluded from the ballot. The vacancy comes after a government reshuffle perceived by some as a rightward shift by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The outcome of the election will be closely watched to see who emerges and how they will be integrated into the government.</p>

The response aligns with the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" message on crime, framing the local tragedy as a national test case for accountability and public safety policy.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece examines President Trump's "Chipocalypse Now" social media post, which threatened an enforcement surge in Chicago and was criticized as a threat of war against an American city. The author argues the meme-like, seemingly joking nature of the post is a deliberate form of "memetic warfare" used by the MAGA movement to downplay authoritarian rhetoric. The article contends that this tactic allows the administration to propose aggressive actions while dismissing criticism as humorless. It frames the subsequent "Operation Midway Blitz" as the serious follow-through on these thinly veiled threats.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why large orders for Boeing aircraft have become a recurring feature in trade deals struck by the Trump administration. Countries striking deals with the U.S., including South Korea, Japan, and the UK, have often announced multi-billion dollar purchases of Boeing jets. Experts suggest these high-profile, high-value orders serve as a visible way for nations to show they are addressing trade surpluses with the U.S. Additionally, aircraft are a less politically sensitive import than agricultural or industrial goods, and the long delivery timelines ease immediate financial strain on the purchasing airlines.</p>
