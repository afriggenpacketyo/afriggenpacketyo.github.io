          <p>Actor Danny Dyer revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016, during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Dyer, who struggled with fame and addiction, said he was ready to leave the facility in South Africa but the letter made him reflect on the pain he'd caused his family. He committed to treatment, which he credits with helping him turn his life around and realize the toxic nature of fame. Dyer played Mick Carter in BBC soap EastEnders from 2013 to 2022.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being released from federal custody following a judge's order. Ozturk, whose visa was canceled amid the Trump administration's crackdown on international students, expressed joy and gratitude while maintaining faith in American democracy. Her supporters believe she was detained in retaliation for her criticism of the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands, while the government accused her of supporting Hamas. Despite the ordeal, Ozturk thanked her supporters and voiced concern for other immigrants still in detention, with Representative Ayanna Pressley vowing to continue fighting for her exoneration and visa restoration.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump declared a "total reset" in US-China trade relations following the first day of talks in Geneva between top officials aimed at de-escalating trade war tensions. The US president praised the "very good" discussions and stated that "GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!" in opening up China to American business. The negotiations, led by Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, occurred amid escalating tariffs that have disrupted supply chains and unsettled financial markets. Despite Trump's optimistic claims, economic analysts remain skeptical of a significant breakthrough, with the US maintaining its stance on tariffs until China makes concessions.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has revealed that a new oral medication, zongertinib, demonstrates promise as a safe and effective therapy for HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The medication outperformed the standard treatment option in treating HER2-mutated NSCLC, working by targeting the HER2 protein and blocking the activity of the protein’s tyrosine kinase. The study, conducted across 82 sites globally, suggests that zongertinib could become a new benchmark for targeted therapy in this difficult-to-treat type of lung cancer.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Ozturk, who was detained for six weeks, spoke at a press conference alongside Sen. Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, expressing gratitude for the support she received. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated, and the judge found no evidence for her detainment besides an op-ed she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper.</p>

          <p>Despite Japan's gradual shift towards a cashless society, app-based digital salary payments have struggled to gain traction two years after their introduction. While over 100 companies offer PayPay as a salary payment option, only a small percentage of workers use it. Experts suggest that highlighting the benefits of app-based payments and expanding availability to part-time workers could increase adoption, but many companies cite a lack of demand and increased administrative work as reasons for not introducing the option.</p>
