          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the Zelle payment network, which is co-owned by several major U.S. banks. The suit alleges that EWS failed to implement adequate security measures, allowing scammers to steal over $1 billion from consumers between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit claims that design flaws, such as a quick registration process and lack of verification, made the platform highly susceptible to fraud. Zelle has dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt."</p>

The team led 2-0 until the final minutes, with both goals coming from set-pieces, a hallmark of Frank's tactical approach. While the inability to secure the win highlights areas for improvement, the performance demonstrated a new, more pragmatic and organized style compared to the previous era. The focus on efficiency and defensive structure suggests a clear strategic shift for the club.</p>

          <p>A Washington, D.C. man has been federally charged with assaulting an officer after allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions over the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the city, following President Trump's declaration of a public safety emergency. The accused reportedly shouted profanities at the agent before throwing the sandwich and was later apprehended after attempting to flee. The confrontation highlights local concerns over federal intervention, which the president justifies by citing crime rates.</p>

The company increased its marketing budget from $32 million to $137 million, utilizing social media influencers and standardizing value meals to drive growth. This strategy helped the chain achieve a 23.7% increase in same-store sales, allowing the company to combat inflationary pressures and improve profit margins. The company subsequently raised its full-year forecast, leading to a modest pop in its stock price.</p>

          <p>Perplexity AI has made a public bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, intensifying the drama as Google awaits a judicial decision on antitrust remedies. Following a ruling that Google holds a monopoly in search, the Department of Justice has suggested a potential breakup, including the divestiture of Chrome. This situation has prompted analysts to re-evaluate the worth of Alphabet's various components, such as YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo, in the event of a forced separation. Analyst valuations for Chrome are around $50 billion, significantly higher than Perplexity's offer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comedian and host Marc Maron, who is ending his influential podcast "WTF" this fall, has sharply criticized the current state of podcasting, labeling it as mediocre and oversaturated. In a recent interview, he lamented that the proliferation of podcasts has lowered the bar, comparing much of the content to "mediocre afternoon drive-time radio." Maron, a pioneer in the format since 2009, expressed his distaste for what he sees as unoriginal content, particularly from hosts he feels are pandering to certain political audiences, a theme also present in his latest comedy special.</p>

          <p>The recent deployment of federal agents in Washington D.C. by President Trump is rooted in the city's unique constitutional status. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress exclusive legislative power over the federal district, a decision influenced by the 1783 Pennsylvania Mutiny, which made the Founders wary of relying on local authorities for protection. While the 1973 Home Rule Act granted D.C. a local government, Congress retains ultimate authority. This historical precedent allows the president to assert federal control, a power that has been periodically exercised, especially concerning local laws and public safety.</p>

          <p>Two suspects who led police on a dramatic, multi-vehicle car chase across Los Angeles remain at large after apparently escaping with the help of accomplices. The pursuit began with a carjacking in Lancaster and involved the suspects stealing two more vehicles, including a semi-truck, before they were last seen in a Chevrolet Silverado. They managed to disappear under a freeway overpass in Boyle Heights, a tactic that shielded them from news helicopters and gave them time to be picked up. Authorities are now processing forensic evidence from the abandoned vehicles in an effort to identify and locate the individuals.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will begin cancelling flights on Thursday to prepare for a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could begin as early as Saturday. The airline stated the move is to ensure an orderly shutdown of operations if a deal is not reached with the union. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract talks reached an impasse, citing low wages and unpaid labor as key sticking points. Air Canada has issued a lockout notice in response and says affected customers will be notified and eligible for full refunds.</p>

          <p>A new study predicts that global reindeer populations could decline substantially by the end of the century due to climate change, with North American caribou facing the highest risk of an 80% reduction. Researchers from the University of Adelaide and the University of Copenhagen used ancient DNA and computer models to reconstruct population changes over 21,000 years. They found that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change is likely to cause more severe losses than ever before. This decline could also have cascading ecological effects, including reduced carbon storage in Arctic soils.</p>

These potential signings would significantly add to Liverpool's summer spending, which has already been substantial as they aim to build a competitive squad under manager Arne Slot.</p>

Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year and the company raised its full-year revenue guidance, citing strong demand that continues to outweigh supply.

While no one is forecasting runaway inflation, the gradual price increases are expected to push the Federal Reserve's preferred core inflation measure higher, though this is not anticipated to prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates.
