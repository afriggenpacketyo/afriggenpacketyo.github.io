          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 09:18:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A South Korean court has ordered the Japanese government to pay compensation to the son of a former "comfort woman," marking the third such ruling in favor of victims of wartime sexual enslavement. Japan, however, has strongly protested the ruling, asserting that it contradicts international law and a 1965 bilateral agreement. The Japanese government maintains that all claims related to its colonial rule were settled under the 1965 pact, while some victims continue to seek an official apology and direct compensation, despite previous attempts to resolve the issue through financial aid. The ruling has the potential to further strain relations between South Korea and Japan, as the issue of 'comfort women' has historically been a contentious point between the two nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amherst College, known for its diversity, is facing an identity crisis as Black enrollment plummeted to 3% in the freshman class of 2025. This decline is a stark contrast to the 11% Black enrollment in 2023, raising concerns within the community. The drop has led to decreased engagement among Black students and fewer attendees at Black student gatherings. This shift prompts questions about the college's commitment to diversity and inclusion following changes in affirmative action policies, impacting the overall campus climate and sense of belonging for Black students.

The decision to halt online orders reflects the severity of the cyberattack and the company's efforts to fully restore its systems and ensure customer data security.</p>

          <p>Israel's military employed artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the Gaza war to locate and assassinate a top Hamas commander, Ibrahim Biari. The AI audio tool helped pinpoint Biari's location, leading to airstrikes on October 31, 2023, which killed Biari but also resulted in the deaths of over 125 civilians. This use of AI in warfare raises ethical concerns about the potential for increased civilian casualties and the lack of human oversight in targeting decisions. The incident highlights the growing role of AI in military operations and the need for international regulations to govern its use.</p>

          <p>This article explores the trend of people not dancing in nightclubs, with DJs and club-goers noting an increase in people standing around, talking, and using their phones instead. The author suggests that this shift could be attributed to social media, the concertification of DJ sets, or gatekeeping of good parties. The article also discusses potential solutions, such as creating intentional club spaces with separate lounges and stricter door policies, but concludes that complaining about people clubbing "wrong" is a long-standing tradition.</p>

          <h2>Energy Price Cap Predicted to Fall in July</h2>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in England, Wales and Scotland are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in the energy price cap. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by £166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%. This would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to £1,683, the lowest level since last September.</p>
