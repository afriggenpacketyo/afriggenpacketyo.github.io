          <p>Elon Musk has accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT in its App Store, thereby hindering his xAI's Grok chatbot. In a social media post, Musk claimed this behavior constitutes an "unequivocal antitrust violation" and announced that his company, xAI, will pursue immediate legal action against the tech giant. This threat comes as Apple moves forward with plans to integrate ChatGPT technology directly into its core products, including the iPhone and Mac operating systems, intensifying the rivalry in the artificial intelligence space.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The appointment follows the controversial firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed slowing hiring. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS, having previously questioned its methodology and data accuracy. The move is seen by some as an effort to install a loyalist to ensure economic data aligns with the administration's narrative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has urged the government to adopt a balanced approach toward the country's booming "quick commerce" industry. Rather than stifling the fierce competition among e-commerce platforms, he recommends guiding the sector's development with targeted policies. The goal is to move beyond a zero-sum, cash-burning model toward higher-level competition focused on innovation and quality. This strategy aims to harness the rapid delivery sector as a vital new driver for long-term consumption and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

She sustained injuries to her arm, leg, and back but is expected to recover. The girl's mother and sibling rushed out upon hearing screams, which scared the animal away. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located and euthanized a mountain lion found hiding on the property and are conducting DNA tests to confirm it was the one responsible for the rare attack.</p>

The chase began with a carjacking of a pickup truck, during which the suspects fired shots at the victim. They later abandoned it to steal a big-rig, which they drove the wrong way on the 10 Freeway, before carjacking a third truck and ultimately fleeing on foot.

          <p>According to newly released FBI documents, a Democratic whistleblower who worked on the House Intelligence Committee has alleged that Senator Adam Schiff approved the leaking of classified information to discredit then-President Donald Trump. The staffer, who reported the conduct in 2017, claimed Schiff stated in a meeting that the group would leak derogatory information to be used to indict Trump. The whistleblower reportedly described these actions to the FBI as both "illegal" and "treasonous," adding a contentious layer to the history of political investigations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Energy has canceled a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express, a major transmission line project. The line was designed to carry wind and solar energy from western Kansas across Missouri and into Illinois and Indiana. This decision, which followed a direct appeal from Senator Josh Hawley to President Trump, puts the decade-in-the-making project in jeopardy.

This extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving disputes over trade imbalances, market access, and national security issues.

The agreement allows the companies to resume certain chip sales to China in exchange for giving 15% of that revenue to the U.S. Treasury. Cramer argues that since the companies are not complaining and the arrangement benefits U.S. taxpayers, it is a relatively benign and pragmatic policy move amid ongoing trade tensions with China.

          <p>More than a thousand firefighters are currently battling two massive wildfires in Colorado under challenging conditions of gusty winds and extreme drought. The Lee fire has grown to become the fifth-largest single fire in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment. These blazes have forced evacuations in multiple counties and led to poor air quality across the region. The article notes that this is part of a severe wildfire season across North America, which experts link to the intensifying effects of climate change.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Trump's Claims of Rampant D.C. Crime Contradict Recent Data Trends</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's justification for the federal takeover of D.C. police reveals his claims are based on outdated and misleading crime statistics. The article points out that Trump cites 2023 figures, a year that saw a spike in homicides, while ignoring current data showing a dramatic drop in violent crime in 2024 and 2025, reaching a 30-year low. This rhetoric, which portrays D.C. as lawless, mirrors his past characterizations of other Democratic-led cities and appears disconnected from the factual, on-the-ground reality.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have filed a whistleblowing complaint warning that the organization is at risk of collapse. The complaint alleges a "toxic internal culture," misuse of public funds, and a crisis in governance. This internal turmoil coincides with external pressure from the UK's Technology Secretary, who has threatened to withdraw the institute's £100m grant unless it pivots its research focus toward defense and national security, a move that would fundamentally alter its original mission.</p>

          <p>England footballer Jess Carter has spoken out about the intense fear of racist abuse faced by Black players. She described feeling a "horrible" sense of relief when white teammates also missed penalties in a crucial shootout, because she feared her Black teammate, Lauren James, would have been subjected to "astronomical" racist attacks if she had been the only one to miss. Carter also shared the personal toll of the abuse she received during the tournament, stating it made her feel small, scared, and not confident on the pitch.</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of a missing cyclist, Tony Parsons, was solved thanks to the quick thinking of his killer's girlfriend. After Alexander McKellar confessed to his new partner, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had killed Parsons in a hit-and-run, he showed her the remote shallow grave. Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can at the site as a marker and later contacted the police. This crucial clue led investigators to recover Parsons' body and secure justice for his family, who expressed immense gratitude for her bravery.</p>

          <p>This political analysis argues that President Trump's recent actions are part of a coordinated narrative to project strength ahead of a summit with Vladimir Putin. The article suggests that the federal takeover of D.C. police is timed to create an image of a decisive law-and-order leader. It also highlights that the planned summit will exclude Ukraine's president, framing it as a direct power play between two leaders. A verbal gaffe in which Trump confused his destination as Russia is cited as evidence of how central Putin is to his current focus.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's federalization of the D.C. police force is a direct result of the city's vulnerable political status. The author contends that because D.C. is not a state and lacks voting representation in Congress, it is an easy and convenient target for an executive seeking to demonstrate power or distract from other issues. The article criticizes Democrats for failing to secure statehood when they had the chance, leaving the district exposed to such federal overreach and unable to mount a legal challenge like a state could.</p>

          <p>In a sharp reversal, President Trump met with and praised Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling his rise an "amazing story" just days after demanding his immediate resignation. The initial demand was prompted by concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton about the CEO's alleged ties to China. Following a meeting with Tan and cabinet members, Trump announced they would bring him suggestions, marking a significant change in tone and highlighting the administration's volatile but hands-on approach to the U.S. semiconductor industry.
