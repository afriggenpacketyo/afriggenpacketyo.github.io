          <p>President Trump's visit to the U.K. includes royal ceremonies and business meetings. He will meet with King Charles and Prime Minister Starmer to discuss foreign policy, complicated by the recent firing of the U.K.'s U.S. ambassador, Peter Mandelson, due to connections with Jeffrey Epstein. Nvidia and OpenAI are expected to announce major U.K. investment commitments to support data center development. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will also attend, following trade talks with China where the future of TikTok will be addressed. The week is packed with potential for unexpected events, making it a critical period for U.S.-U.K. relations.</p>

          <p>American Airlines and Delta Air Lines removed employees from duty after they made celebratory or mocking remarks online about the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy called the behavior disgusting and urged permanent removal. American Airlines condemned violence and hate-related behavior, initiating action to address it. Delta suspended multiple employees, reminding staff that their conduct should reflect Delta’s values. A GoFundMe page for a Phoenix Suns reporter fired for "refusing to mourn" Kirk has raised nearly $15,000, while another GiveSendGo page to support Kirk's family has raised nearly $1 million.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that cannabis use, particularly THC, can negatively impact female fertility by disrupting egg cell development and stability. Researchers examined THC's effects on isolated human eggs and IVF outcomes, finding that THC-positive patients had lower rates of euploid embryos, reducing the chances of successful pregnancy. In the lab, THC led to chromosome distribution errors and defective egg cell structures. While German experts acknowledge the findings, they call for further research on cannabis consumption habits and age groups.</p>

It is currently unknown why China has issued four travel advisories in five months, and the impact that it will have on China's economic links to Philippines is yet to be determined.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the Nazi regime, the concept of equality for all Germans is being questioned, with some politicians echoing Nazi-era ideologies. The AfD's program is seen as a continuation of Nazi ideology, similar to the Nuremberg Laws that distinguished between "Reich citizens" and "state citizens." Racial discrimination based on ancestry persists, with some feeling that equality applies more to those with "German blood." Overcoming these prejudices requires recognizing the positive aspects of migration and individual responsibility.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk has led to a crackdown on critical commentary, with numerous individuals losing their jobs. Those affected include teachers, firefighters, journalists, politicians, and military personnel. The defense secretary has ordered the identification of military members who mocked Kirk's murder. This contrasts with past instances where some of these same figures mocked victims of political violence.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages accuse Prime Minister Netanyahu of being the "one obstacle" to their return and a peace deal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum claims Netanyahu sabotages ceasefire efforts. These comments follow Israel's strike on Qatar, which targeted Hamas leaders. The group argues Netanyahu's stalling has cost lives and threatens those still held captive. A Qatari security official died as a result of the strike.</p>

          <p>Jakob Ingebrigtsen described his performance as "terrible" after a shock exit in the 1500m heats at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. He attributed the loss to an injury-disrupted season and lack of preparation. The two-time Olympic and world champion will not have the chance to win the world outdoor title. Britons Kerr, Wightman and Neil Gourley progressed - and saw their medal hopes boosted further.</p>
